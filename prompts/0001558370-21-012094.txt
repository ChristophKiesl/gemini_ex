ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Business Overview
Lannett Company, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company,” “Lannett,” “we,” or “us”) was incorporated in 1942 under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and reincorporated in 1991 as a Delaware corporation. We primarily develop, manufacture, market and distribute generic versions of brand pharmaceutical products. Generics represent the vast majority of U.S. prescriptions today, accounting for approximately 90% of prescriptions in the 12-month period ending June 30, 2021. We report financial information on a quarterly and fiscal year basis with the most recent being the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. All references herein to a “fiscal year” or “Fiscal” refer to the applicable fiscal year ended June 30.
Over the past 18 years, the Company has grown total net sales from $12.1 million in fiscal year 2001 to $478.8 million in fiscal year 2021. The Company generates revenue through filing and receiving approvals for abbreviated new drug applications (“ANDAs”), strategic partnerships and launches of additional manufactured drugs, as well as from products acquired from Silarx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Silarx”) and Kremers Urban Pharmaceuticals Inc. (“KUPI”) in 2015. More recently, the Company’s revenues have grown through a renewed emphasis on new product launches, strategic portfolio management and business development. We have launched 55 products since January 2018, anchored by 24 new partner agreements, covering 33 new product launches, and complemented by 22 acquired or internally developed products. Over the last three years, new product launches have generated more than $485 million of revenues.
Today, we market more than 100 products, mainly tablet, capsule or liquid oral generic medications. Examples of marketed products include generics such as Posaconazole, Fluphenazine, Levothyroxine and Sumatriptan and our NDA-based product Numbrino. Our portfolio includes medications across multiple and diverse groups of therapeutic categories. The 55 products we launched have grown our revenue base, diversified our portfolio and reduced product concentration. For the fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019, the Company’s top two products contributed, on average, approximately 40% of revenues. By comparison, our top two products accounted for approximately 28% and 19% of revenues for fiscal years 2020 and 2021, respectively.
The Company’s pipeline includes 12 ANDAs currently pending at the FDA and more than 20 additional product candidates in various stages of development. More recent additions to our pipeline include high value, large market opportunity products that are often partnered. These higher value products generally have more technical, manufacturing, regulatory and operational complexity and require significant capital investment for specialized and dedicated manufacturing facilities and equipment, making them more durable product opportunities with fewer expected competitors. Four of the product candidates, generic Advair Diskus and generic Flovent Diskus, combination drug/devices for the treatment of asthma, and biosimilar Insulin Glargine and biosimilar Insulin Aspart for the treatment of diabetes both delivered in a device, are widely used medications that we believe represent a combined U.S. addressable market opportunity of over $13 billion in 2021, which includes the entire Insulin Glargine market. The ANDA for the generic Advair Diskus product was submitted to the FDA on April 1, 2021, and the generic Flovent Diskus product along with the Insulin Glargine and Insulin Aspart biosimilar products are all in relatively advanced stages of development. We have identified and are negotiating with current and potential partners for additional complex, large and durable market opportunity products, including other biosimilars and inhalation drug/device products.

Over the past three years, we have made cost and operational discipline, along with reducing our debt, key priorities. Since the beginning of calendar year 2018, we lowered our gross debt level by more than $320 million, which included paying off our Term A Loan in November 2020 and Term Loan B in April 2021. We have streamlined our operations by restructuring and generally exiting the pain management Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (“APIs”) business. We consolidated plants and facilities, and substantially increased production and output at our remaining manufacturing sites in Seymour, Indiana and Carmel, New York. In addition, we have reduced costs companywide; these efforts included substantial workforce reductions, a $66 million cost savings plan implemented in 2018 (approximately half of which we re-invested into the business) and another $15 million cost reduction plan implemented in July 2020. The July 2020 cost reduction plan included consolidating our Research and Development (“R&D”) function into one location, as well as other cost savings measures focused on our manufacturing base.
Competitive Strengths
Diversified product portfolio. We currently market over 100 products across multiple therapeutic categories. For the fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019, the Company’s top two products contributed, on average, approximately 40% of revenues. By comparison, our top two products accounted for approximately 28% and 19% of revenues for fiscal years 2020 and 2021, respectively.
Attractive mid to longer term pipeline. We believe we have an attractive pipeline of large product opportunities that will enable us to grow revenue and profitability. For example, we filed the ANDA for generic Advair on April 1, 2021, and are on track to launch in calendar year 2022, if approved. The other dry powder inhaler we have in partnership with Respirent, generic Flovent Diskus, is currently in clinical development. Additionally, we are focused on advancing our biosimilar Insulin Glargine and biosimilar Insulin Aspart pipeline products to potentially launch in calendar years 2023 and 2024, respectively. We believe leveraging our existing relationships to collaborate on opportunities across dry powder inhalation, metered dose inhalation, and other biosimilar products will enable us to further strengthen our pipeline.
Extensive experience with productive partnerships. We continue to grow, diversify and strengthen our business by entering into partnerships to distribute both externally developed products and authorized generic equivalents of brand products. We are focused on the U.S. generics market, but our partnership opportunities are global, as demonstrated by our partnerships with HEC, Respirent, Rivopharm, IBSA, Cediprof/Neolpharma and Sinotherapeutics, due to our experience, expertise and reliability in commercialization in the U.S. market. In fiscal year 2021, we successfully launched around a dozen new products, several of which are sourced from external parties, including Levothyroxine tablets and Levothyroxine capsules (Tirosint®). We believe that our success with these products, along with existing alliances, has established us as a strong development and marketing partner creating the foundation for continued productive partnership alliances in the future.
Strong internal product development capabilities. We believe that our U.S.-based manufacturing expertise, low overhead expenses and skilled product development capabilities will contribute to being competitive in the generic pharmaceutical market. We intend to dedicate significant resources toward developing new products because we believe our success is linked to our ability to continually introduce new generic products into the marketplace.
Strong track record of obtaining regulatory approvals for new products. During the past three fiscal years, we have received one NDA approval and 12 ANDA approvals from the FDA. Although the timing of ANDA approvals by the FDA is uncertain, we currently expect to continue to receive more during Fiscal 2022. These regulatory approvals will enable us to manufacture and supply a broader portfolio of generic pharmaceutical products.
Market orientation. We believe that our success depends on our ability to properly assess the competitive market for new products, including customer interest, the number of competitors, market share opportunity and the generic unit price erosion. We look to reduce our exposure to competitive influences that may negatively affect our sales and profits, including the potential saturation of the market for certain products, by continuing to emphasize a strong product selection process with an orientation in internal development to areas where we have technological and manufacturing expertise and use external development partnerships to access other technologies and associated manufacturing capacity as well as risk sharing.

Leverage our flexibility and speed. We believe flexibility and speed in decision-making are critical success factors in the generic industry. Our mid-sized scale and relatively less complex organizational structure as a U.S. based organization results in a nimbler response to securing market opportunities. For example, Fluphenazine, a product that contributed approximately $96 million of net revenue in fiscal year 2020, was the result of the Company capitalizing on changing market opportunity and achieving significant market share and profitability for about a decade before other new manufacturers entered the market in early fiscal year 2021.
Dependable U.S.-based supplier to our customers. We believe we are viewed by our customers as a strong, dependable supplier due in part to our agile and reliable operations network, as well as having a less complex manufacturing/supply chain based mostly within the U.S. We have cultivated productive customer relationships by focusing on what is important to them and their patients, along with maintaining adequate inventory levels, employing a responsive order filling system and prioritizing timely fulfillment of those orders. Unless a later delivery date is specified, a majority of our orders are filled and shipped on or the day after we receive the order.
Reputation for regulatory compliance. We have a strong track record of regulatory compliance. We believe that we have effective regulatory compliance capabilities and practices due to: (1) the hiring of qualified individuals, (2) the implementation of comprehensive Standard Operating Procedures (“SOP”), (3) adherence to current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) and (4) operating an owned manufacturing network less complex than larger firms. Our agility in responding quickly to market events and a reputation for regulatory compliance positions us to avail ourselves of market opportunities as they materialize.
We continue to pursue “Quality by Design” for improving and maintaining product quality in our pharmaceutical development and manufacturing facilities, which is outlined in the Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) report entitled, “Pharmaceutical Quality for the 21st Century: A Risk-Based Approach.” The FDA periodically inspects our operations to determine our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. During an inspection, the FDA may issue an inspection report, entitled a “Form 483,” containing potentially objectionable observations arising from an inspection. Additionally, at the close of each inspection, FDA will issue an Establishment Inspection Report (“EIR”) that details the final classification for each site, either No Action Indicated (“NAI”), Voluntary Action Indicated (“VAI”), or Official Action Indicated (“OAI”). The FDA’s observations may be minor or severe in nature and the degree of severity is generally determined by potential consequences to the consumer. By strictly complying with cGMPs and the various FDA guidelines as well as adherence to our Standard Operating Procedures, we have never received a cGMP Warning Letter in more than 70 years of business.
Experienced management team. We have been focused on maintaining and augmenting the quality of our management team in anticipation of continuing growth. Our team is distinctive with regard to their generic industry tenure and extensive U.S. focus. We have hired experienced personnel from large, established, pharmaceutical companies as well as competing generic companies to complement the skills and knowledge of the existing management team. As we continue to grow, additional personnel may need to be added to our management team and we intend to hire the best people available to expand the knowledge base and expertise within our team.
Business Strategies
Focus on the large U.S. generic market and larger U.S. brand market opportunities
We believe generics are the foundation of efficient pharmaceutical care and are estimated to be approximately 90% of all U.S. pharmaceutical prescription volume with an IQVIA value of approximately $56 billion for the 12-month period ending June 30, 2021. While that estimate likely well exceeds actual market size, Lannett’s opportunity is significant relative to Lannett’s size. Meanwhile, the brand market subject to eventual genericization exceeds $450 billion, according to IQVIA. As new branded products become off patent and existing generic product opportunities become available, we will seek to generate new business through both internal development and partnerships.

We are focused on increasing our market share in the U.S. generic pharmaceutical industry while directing additional resources on the development of new products. We look to grow revenue and profitability by expanding our line of generic products, increasing unit sales to current customers, creating manufacturing efficiencies and managing our overhead and administrative costs.
Emphasis on in-line execution
We have a broad portfolio of existing generics and we continually look to optimize the share and value of our existing portfolio. We look to capitalize on competitor supply disruptions, which occur frequently in the industry of both a shorter and longer duration. We seek to reduce the cost of our products through various life cycle management approaches including increasing the efficiency of our plant, and our product manufacturing yields, and lowering incipient and API costs from third-party suppliers.
Strategic expansion of our product offering
We have three primary strategies for expanding our product offerings: (1) entering into product development partnerships or strategic alliances with third-party product developers and formulators; (2) deploying our experienced R&D staff to develop products in-house; and (3) purchasing ANDAs or New Drug Applications (“NDA”) from other manufacturers. We expect that each strategy will facilitate our identification, selection and development of additional pharmaceutical products that we may sell to our existing network of customers. 
We are focused on the U.S. market, but our business development efforts are global. Our relationships with global partners and our track record of delivering regulatory and commercialization expertise to global biopharmaceutical companies is a competitive advantage and offers significant opportunities for future growth. Between January 2018 and June 2021, the number of alliances that our business development efforts have secured increased significantly and we have acquired or in-licensed over 75 ANDA products as a result of these efforts.
One of our major strategic partnerships was struck in October 2019 when the Company announced it had entered into an exclusive U.S. distribution agreement for the therapeutically equivalent generic of ADVAIR DISKUS® (Fluticasone Propionate – Salmeterol Xinafoate Powder Inhaler) of Respirent Pharmaceuticals Co. Ltd. ADVAIR DISKUS had U.S. sales of $3.6 billion for the 12 months ending July 2019, according to IQVIA, although the accessible generic market is expected to be lower. We currently estimate the generic accessible market to be approximately $1 billion, annually. The Company submitted to the FDA an ANDA for the product on April 1, 2021. Under the agreement, the Company will commence U.S. distribution of the product after FDA approval. The Company will make an upfront payment, as well as future milestone payments, and receive a portion of the net profits once it commences distribution of the product. The term of the agreement is 12 years, which begins upon commencement of distribution.
As an expansion in our partnership with Respirent, in August 2020, the Company announced it had entered into an exclusive U.S. distribution agreement for a second product, the therapeutically equivalent generic of Flovent® Diskus® (Fluticasone Propionate Powder Inhaler). U.S. sales of Flovent Diskus were $96 million for the 12 months ending June 2021 according to IQVIA, although actual accessible generic market values are expected to be lower. Early development of the product is underway. Subsequently, the Company announced further expansion of the relationship to target the therapeutically equivalent generic to SPIRIVA® handihaler®. U.S. sales of SPIRIVA handihaler were approximately $1.5 billion for the 12 months ending June 2021 according to IQVIA.

In 2016, the Company announced a strategic partnership with YiChang HEC ChangJiang Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd, an HEC Group company, to co-develop a biosimilar insulin glargine pharmaceutical product for the U.S. market. The product is currently in development, and a healthy human Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic modeling (“PK/PD”) clinical trial was conducted in South Africa. The study met all of its primary endpoints. Subsequently, Lannett held a Biosimilar Biological Product Development Type II meeting with the FDA. The feedback was consistent with our expectation. The Company plans to manage the clinical and regulatory steps for FDA approval and will have the exclusive U.S. marketing rights to the product. Drug substance and drug product have been produced at a newly commissioned facility and we are targeting completing an Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) towards the end of calendar year 2021. We currently expect to file the product in early calendar year 2023 and, if approved, launch the product in the first half of calendar year 2024. In February 2021, the Company expanded its strategic relationship with HEC and added a new co-development agreement for biosimilar Insulin Aspart. In addition, we will market other generic products developed by HEC with several launches expected over the next few years.
In August 2020, the Company announced it had commenced distributing Cediprof, Inc’s (“Cediprof”) Levothyroxine product under an interim exclusive supply and distribution agreement. The interim supply agreement covers the period from July 2020 through the start of the previously executed 10-year exclusive supply and distribution agreement with Cediprof to distribute Levothyroxine Sodium Tablets USP, which was entered into in July 2019 and becomes effective August 2022. The Company also entered into an exclusive U.S. distribution agreement with IBSA Institut Biochemique SA and commenced the launch of the authorized generic of Tirosint® (Levothryoxine Sodium Capsules USP) in November 2020. Levothyroxine is one of the largest volume generics sold in the United States. 
We have several other existing supply and development agreements with both international and domestic companies; in addition, we are currently in negotiations on similar agreements with other companies through which we can market and distribute future products. We intend to continue to capitalize on our strong customer relationships to build our market share for such products.
Internal research and development is also an important prong of our growth strategy. Examples of internally developed products include Chlorpromazine and butalbital, acetaminophen and caffeine (“BAC”), and co-development projects such as Sumatriptan Nasal Spray. Opportunistically, we may increase our focus on specialty markets within the pharmaceutical industry. For example, in Fiscal 2018, the Company filed its first NDA for Numbrino (cocaine hydrochloride solution), which was approved by the FDA in January 2020.
Key Products
Key products were selected based on current and future sales and profitability. In aggregate, the 11 products noted below accounts for approximately 47% of Lannett sales in Fiscal 2021. While these products are our top selling products, margins may vary well above or below average margins based on changing competitive circumstances as well as product partnership royalties, where applicable.

Amphetamine IR Tablets
Amphetamine IR Tablets are used to treat ADHD and narcolepsy. It is the generic version of Adderall. 
Cocaine Hydrochloride Solution
In December 2017, a competitor received approval from the FDA to market and sell a Cocaine Hydrochloride topical product. This approval affects the Company’s right to market and sell its unapproved cocaine hydrochloride solution product. In March 2018, in accordance with its guidance, the FDA requested the Company to cease manufacturing and distributing its unapproved cocaine hydrochloride solution product as a result of an approved product on the market. The Company committed to not manufacture or distribute cocaine hydrochloride 10% solution, which has not been sold during Fiscal 2019, as of April 15, 2019 and agreed to cease manufacturing its unapproved cocaine hydrochloride 4% solution on June 15, 2019 and cease distributing the product on August 15, 2019. 
We filed a NDA for Numbrino® Nasal Solution in Fiscal 2018. We received approval in January 2020 and launched the product in March 2020. 
The competitor filed a series of Citizen Petitions and lawsuits beginning in 2019, first attempting to block the FDA from approving our NDA for cocaine hydrochloride solution and, following the FDA’s approval, seeking a court order requiring FDA to withdraw approval of the NDA. To date, the competitor has been unsuccessful, although litigation has not yet been concluded. Refer to Note 10 “Legal, Regulatory Matters and Contingencies” for further information regarding the pending litigation.

Levothyroxine Tablets
Levothyroxine tablets is a thyroid hormone medication that is used to treat underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) and other conditions. It is deemed bioequivalent to Levoxyl®, Synthroid®, Unithroid® and Euthyrox®. 
Levothyroxine Capsules
Levothyroxine capsules are soft gel capsules used to treat patients with hypothyroidism and other conditions. It is the generic version of the branded drug Tirosint®. 
Sales & Marketing and Customers
We enter into contracts with Group Purchasing Organizations (“GPOs”) to sell our products to their members who are our direct and indirect customers. The largest GPOs are ClarusOne, Red Oak Sourcing and Walgreens Boots Alliance Development. Net sales to these GPOs accounted for 73% of total net sales in fiscal year 2021 and 74% in fiscal year 2020. 
We sell our pharmaceutical products to generic pharmaceutical distributors, drug wholesalers, chain drug retailers, private label distributors, mail-order pharmacies, other pharmaceutical companies, managed care organizations, hospital buying groups, governmental entities and health maintenance organizations. The pharmaceutical industry’s largest wholesale distributors, Amerisource Bergen, McKesson and Cardinal Health, each associated with one of the GPOs mentioned above, accounted for 27%, 21% and 12%, respectively, of our total net sales in fiscal year 2021, 25%, 23% and 11%, respectively, of our total net sales in fiscal year 2020 and 21%, 18% and 10%, respectively, of our total net sales in fiscal year 2019.
Sales to wholesale customers include “indirect sales,” which represent sales to third-party entities, such as independent pharmacies, managed care organizations, hospitals, nursing homes and group purchasing organizations, collectively referred to as “indirect customers.”
We enter into definitive agreements with our indirect customers to establish pricing for certain covered products. Under such agreements, the indirect customers independently select a wholesaler from which to purchase the products at these agreed-upon prices. We will provide credit to the wholesaler for the difference between the agreed-upon price with the indirect customer and the wholesaler’s invoice price. This credit is called a “chargeback.” For more information on chargebacks, see the section entitled “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Form 10-K. These indirect sale transactions are recorded on our books as sales to wholesale customers.
We promote our products through direct sales, trade shows and group purchasing organizations’ bidding processes. We also have a limited number of products that are marketed as part of our customers’ “private label” programs. Private label products are manufactured by Lannett but distributed to the customer with a label typically containing the name and logo of the customer. Private label allows us to leverage our internal sales efforts by using the sales and marketing efforts of those customers.
Strong and dependable customer relationships have created a positive platform for us to increase our sales volumes. Historically and in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, our advertising expenses have been modest. When our sales representatives make contact with a customer, we will generally offer to supply the customer our products at fixed prices. If accepted, the customer’s purchasing department will coordinate the purchase, receipt and distribution of the products throughout its distribution centers and retail outlets. Once a customer accepts our supply of a product, the customer typically expects a high standard of service, including timely receipt of products ordered, availability of convenient, user-friendly and effective customer service functions and maintaining open lines of communication.

We believe that retail-level consumer demand dictates the total volume of sales for most of our various products. In the event that wholesale and retail customers adjust their purchasing volumes, we believe that consumer demand will be fulfilled by other wholesale or retail sources of supply. As a result, we attempt to develop and maintain strong relationships with most of the major retail chains, wholesale distributors and mail-order pharmacies in order to facilitate the supply of our products through whatever channel the consumer prefers. Although we have agreements with customers governing the transaction terms of our sales, generally there are no minimum purchase quantities applicable to these agreements. Our practice of maintaining adequate inventory levels, employing a responsive order filling system and prioritizing timely fulfillment of those orders have contributed to a strong reputation among our customers as a dependable supplier of high-quality generic pharmaceuticals.
Competition
The manufacturing and distribution of generic pharmaceutical products is a highly competitive industry. Competition is based primarily on a reliable supply and price. In addition to competitive pricing, our competitive advantages are our ability to provide strong and dependable customer service by maintaining adequate inventory levels, employing a responsive order filling system and prioritizing timely fulfillment of orders. We look to ensure that our products are available from national wholesale, chain drug and mail-order suppliers as well as our own warehouse. The modernization of our facilities, hiring of experienced staff and implementation of inventory and quality control programs have improved our competitive cost position. Our primary competitors across our product portfolio are Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., Mylan N.V., and Amneal Pharmaceuticals Inc.
Validated Pharmaceutical Capabilities
The Company’s 432,000 square foot Seymour, Indiana facility contains approximately 107,000 square feet of manufacturing space as well as a leased 116,000 square foot temperature/humidity-controlled storage warehouse. The Seymour facility has had satisfactory inspections conducted by the FDA and EMA and similar regulatory authorities of Japan, Taiwan, Brazil, China, Korea and Turkey. As of June 30, 2021, the facility has a production capacity of approximately 4.0 billion doses based on our current product mix and plant configuration.
The Company has an 110,000 square foot manufacturing facility located in Carmel, New York, which sits on 25.8 acres of land. The facility specializes in liquid products and currently houses manufacturing, packaging, quality and research and development and has capacity for additional manufacturing space, if needed.
Lannett owns two facilities in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The research and development facilities are located in a 31,000 square foot facility at 9000 State Road and a second, 63,000 square foot facility that is located within one mile of the State Road facility at 9001 Torresdale Avenue, Philadelphia, PA. The latter facility contains our analytical research and development and quality control laboratories. We have adopted many systems and processes to ensure adherence to FDA requirements and we believe we are operating our facilities in substantial compliance with the FDA’s cGMP regulations.
Raw Materials and Finished Goods Suppliers
Our use of raw materials in the production process consists of pharmaceutical chemicals in various forms that are often available from several sources. In addition to the raw materials we purchase for the production process, we purchase certain finished dosage inventories. We sell these finished dosage form products directly to our customers along with the finished dosage form products manufactured in-house. We generally take precautionary measures to avoid a disruption in raw materials and finished goods, such as finding secondary suppliers for certain raw materials or finished goods when available and maintaining adequate inventory levels.

11



Over time, we have entered into supply and development agreements with Summit Bioscience LLC, Respirent Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., HEC Pharm Group, Dexcel Pharma, Elite Pharmaceuticals, RivoPharm and various other international and domestic companies. The Company is currently in negotiations on similar agreements with other companies and is actively seeking additional strategic partnerships, through which it will market and distribute products manufactured in-house or by third parties. The Company also continues to assess product acquisitions that are a strategic fit and accretive to the business.
Research and Development Process
Over the past several years, we have invested in R&D projects. The costs of these R&D efforts are expensed during the periods incurred. We believe that such costs may be recovered in future years when we receive approval from the FDA to manufacture and distribute such products. We have embarked on a plan to grow in future years, which includes organic growth to be achieved through our R&D efforts. We expect that our list of generic products under development will help drive future growth. The following steps outline the numerous stages in the generic drug development process:

1.) | Formulation and analytical method development. After a drug candidate is selected for future sale, product development scientists perform various experiments to incorporate excipients with the APIs to produce a robust, stable and bioequivalent dosage form that will be therapeutically equivalent to the brand name drug and meet all FDA requirements for approval. These experiments will result in the creation of a number of product formulations to determine which formula will be most suitable for our subsequent development process. Various formulations are tested in the laboratory to measure results against the innovator brand drug. During this time, we may use reverse engineering methods on samples of the innovator drug to determine the type and quantity of inactive ingredients. During the formulation phase, our R&D chemists begin to develop an analytical, laboratory testing method. The successful development of this test method will allow us to test developmental and commercial batches of the product in the future. All of the information used in the final formulation, including the analytical test methods adopted for the generic drug candidate, will be included as part of the Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (“CMC”) section of the ANDA submitted to the FDA.

2.) | Scale-up and tech transfer. After product development, our R&D formulators and our R&D chemists agree on a final formulation for use in moving the drug candidate forward in the developmental process, we then attempt to increase the batch size of the product. The batch size represents the standard magnitude to be used in manufacturing a batch of the product. The determination of batch size affects the amount of raw material that is used in the manufacturing process and the number of expected dosages to be created during the production cycle. We attempt to determine batch size based on the amount of active ingredient in each dosage, the available production equipment and unit sales projections. The scaled-up batch is then generally produced in our commercial manufacturing facilities. During this manufacturing process, we document the equipment used, the amount of time in each major processing step and any other steps needed to consistently produce a batch of that product.

3.) | Bio equivalency and clinical testing. After a successful scale-up of the generic drug batch, we schedule and perform generally required bio equivalency testing on the product and in some cases, clinical testing, if required by the FDA. These procedures, which are generally outsourced to third parties, include testing the absorption rate and extent of the generic product in the human bloodstream compared to the absorption of the innovator drug. The results of this testing are then documented and reported to us to determine the “success” of the generic drug product. Success, in this context, means that we are able to demonstrate that our product is comparable to the innovator product in dosage form, strength, route of administration, quality, performance characteristics and intended use.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bioequivalence (meaning that the product has the same blood levels and dosage form as the innovator drug) and a stable formula are the primary requirements for a generic drug approval (assuming the manufacturing plant is in compliance with the FDA’s cGMP regulations). Lengthy and costly clinical trials proving safety and efficacy, which are required by the FDA for NDAs (and may include 505(b)(2)NDAs), are typically unnecessary for generic companies. If the results are successful, we will continue the collection of information and documentation for assembly of the drug application.

4.) | Submission of the ANDA for FDA review and approval. An ANDA is a comprehensive submission that contains, among other things, data and information pertaining to the proposed labeling, active pharmaceutical ingredient, excipients, container/closure, drug product formulation, drug product testing specification, methodology and results. Bioequivalence study reports are also included in the ANDA submission.

​
We have additional products of various dosage forms currently under development. Our developmental drug products are intended to treat a diverse range of indications. The products under development are at various stages in the development cycle—formulation, scale-up, clinical testing and/or FDA review.
The cost associated with each product that we are currently developing is dependent on numerous factors, including but not limited to, the complexity of the active ingredient’s chemical characteristics, the price of the raw materials and the FDA-mandated requirement of bioequivalence studies (depending on the FDA’s Product Specific Guidance). With the introduction of GDUFA and additional guidance issued by the FDA, the cost to develop a new generic product varies but can total several million dollars.
In addition, we currently own several ANDAs for products that are not currently marketed and noted as Discontinued in FDA’s Orange Book. Occasionally, we review such discontinued products to determine if the market potential for any of these products has recently changed to make it attractive for us to reconsider manufacturing and selling. If we decide to commercially market one of these products, we evaluate the requirements necessary for commercial launch, including a filing strategy to properly report the relaunch to the FDA so that the product is moved to the Active section of the Orange Book.
In addition to the efforts of our internal product development group, we have contracted with numerous outside firms for the formulation and development of several new generic drug products. These outsourced R&D products are at various stages in the development cycle—formulation, analytical method development and testing and manufacturing scale-up. These products include orally administered solid dosage products, injectables and nasal delivery products that are intended to treat a diverse range of medical indications.
We intend to ultimately transfer the formulation technology and manufacturing process for some of these R&D products to our own commercial manufacturing sites. We initiated these outsourced R&D efforts to complement the progress of our own internal R&D efforts.

13



We recorded R&D expenses of $24.2 million in fiscal year 2021, $30.0 million in fiscal year 2020 and $38.3 million in fiscal year 2019. These amounts included expenses associated with bioequivalence studies, internal development resources as well as outsourced development. While we manage all R&D from our principal executive office in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, we have also been taking steps to capitalize on favorable development costs in other countries. We have strategic relationships with various companies that either act as contract research organizations or API suppliers as well as dosage form manufacturers. In addition, U.S.-based research organizations have been engaged for product development to enhance our internal development. Fixed payment arrangements are established between Lannett and these research organizations and in some cases include a royalty provision. Development payments are normally scheduled in advance, based on attaining development milestones.
Human Capital Management 
We provide affordable medicines to improve the quality of life of our patients. It is our mission and the foundation of our Lannett Cares culture. Our mission guides the way we work and we strive to put people and patients at the forefront of what we do. We are thus committed to providing a positive, inclusive and team-oriented workplace. We encourage and promote open communication with our teams, aspire to strong social connections, and provide learning and growth opportunities to our employees. We want our people, our business and our corporate responsibility to reflect the core values of Lannett. 
Lannett helps bring together employees with a wide variety of backgrounds, skills and cultures. Combining such a wealth of talent and resources creates the diverse and dynamic teams that consistently drive our success. As of June 30, 2021, we have more than 810 full-time employees. Employees identifying as female represent approximately 44% of our employee population and approximately 41% of employees at the leadership level (employees at manager and above) at June 30, 2021. These ratios are consistent with approximately 45% and approximately 39% respectively as of June 30, 2020. Approximately 40% of the employees holding positions at the Vice President level and above identify as female. 
Employee rewards, growth and development 
We strive to ensure that our employees are provided equal opportunity and equal treatment. With a focus on all our employees, we offer a variety of resources and rewards to support their health and well-being and career aspirations. Lannett is committed to attracting and retaining the best talent by providing competitive benefits, supporting continued learning for employees, and encouraging employees to gain exposure across many aspects of our business. 
Lannett recognizes the importance, contributions and performance of its employees in pursuing, achieving and supporting the company’s business objectives. Therefore, Lannett is committed to designing and maintaining compensation policies and programs that ensure equitable job and position evaluation, and competitive and performance-based pay. We have an annual short-term incentive program for eligible employees to be rewarded, in part, based on their individual goal performance, rather than being based solely on the Company’s financial performance. Under this program, an employee’s potential bonus is a blend of corporate goals and individual goals. We are committed to remaining transparent on payout opportunities and, as part of the quarterly earnings release process, Lannett communicates progress toward our corporate goals. In addition to the annual short-term incentive opportunity, we are committed to rewarding employees for exceptional performance during the year including (1) celebrating length of service milestones, (2) granting recognition awards and (3) for eligible employees, an annual discretionary long-term incentive award. During 2020, we also awarded bonuses to certain essential employees who consistently came to work at our plants during the COVID-19 pandemic to produce the affordable medicines we make for patients. 

14



In addition to bonus opportunities, we offer a competitive benefits package, including medical, dental, and vision care. We offer a variety of wellness programs including a personal health survey and individual health coaching, fitness challenges and incentives for incremental HSA contributions, on-site health screenings, and wellness webinars. We are also focused on supporting our employees in reaching their personal financial goals. We have a 401k defined contribution plan (the “Plan”) available for substantially all employees, which includes a matching contribution during each Plan year. Further, we offer an Employee Stock Purchase Program (“ESPP”), which allows eligible employees to purchase shares of the Company’s stock at a discount to nurture an ownership mentality in everyone who works at the Company. Additionally, in 2021, we provided access to financial wellness webinars with Morgan Stanley, which included a variety of topics including college planning, budgeting, investing and retirement. 
Moreover, Lannett is committed to supporting our employees in their continued learning and career development. We offer employees training for their current positions and opportunities to access learning platforms. We also provide tuition reimbursement to eligible employees for all or a portion of the costs incurred by the employee to attend educational courses related to the successful performance of their duties. Employees are encouraged to seek advancement opportunities and obtain promotions, transfers and career guidance from all levels of management within Lannett and Human Resources. 
Across all other aforementioned matters, we understand the importance of employee satisfaction and aim to improve the employee experience. We regularly conduct and share engagement surveys with employees to obtain feedback on various matters, including executive leadership effectiveness, communication, total rewards, and development and recognition. Various actions taken by management have been a direct result of suggestions provided as part of these surveys and follow-up focus groups. During the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, we spent time to gauge the pulse of our employees and their needs, including childcare needs, using surveys and Q&A sessions. 
The Company’s total employee turnover rate for fiscal year 2021, which the Company defines as the ratio of the number of separated employees during the year to the average active employees during fiscal year 2021, was approximately 37%, up from approximately 17% in fiscal year 2020. The turnover rate at our Philadelphia, PA locations was approximately 17%, up from approximately 8% in fiscal year 2020 and our Carmel, NY facility turnover rate was approximately 11%, down from approximately 18% in fiscal year 2020. Competing demands for manufacturing skills, some pandemic burnout and more job opportunities resulted in approximately 47% turnover in our Seymour, IN manufacturing site, up from 20% in fiscal year 2020. The turnover rate in Seymour, IN was much higher than our historical average. While a portion of this increase is related to the 2020 Restructuring Plan, implemented in July 2020, the Company continues to focus on employee retention by establishing a purpose-driven and inclusive culture, investing in our employees, and providing transparency and opportunities for feedback to management. 
Employee safety 
A safe, healthy and secure work environment is our top priority for all employees, contractors and visitors. Our goal is to conduct business with minimal injuries and incidents and maintain compliance with applicable rules and codes. Management, as well as the Board of Directors, regularly review and monitor metrics on our safety performance. We also use these metrics to identify hazards for correction before an incident or injury occurs. If employees have concerns regarding safety, they are expected to report the concerns to their manager, to a member of the executive team, or by contacting the Company’s anonymous whistleblower hotline. 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have continued to prioritize safety and follow local, state, federal and CDC mandates. When possible, employees have been directed to work from home throughout the duration of the pandemic. Across our work sites, we implemented enhanced cleaning and sanitizing procedures and provided additional personal hygiene supplies and personal protective equipment such as rubber gloves, N95 respirators and powered air-purifying respirator that are in line with Centers for Disease Control and Preventions (“CDC”) recommendations. We have also implemented thermal screening for employees and visitors entering our facilities. Employees are required to adhere to the CDC guidelines, social distancing and any employee experiencing any symptoms of COVID-19 is required to stay home and seek medical attention. We will continue to monitor COVID-19 protocols and the safety of our employees, contractors, and visitors as CDC recommendations evolve and restrictions are lifted or raised in our various states of operations. 

15



Corporate social responsibility 
Lannett believes that it is important to invest in the communities where we live, work and operate. Every year, Lannett and its employees give time and money to registered charities, schools, service clubs and community organizations. Our Charitable Contributions Policy focuses on employee involvement and is structured to provide (1) direct cash donations, (2) monetary matching for cash or goods donated by employees, and (3) monetary matching for time volunteered by employees. Lannett and our employees have participated in various charitable events throughout fiscal year 2021, including virtual charity walks, clothing and food drives, and blood drives. In addition, we have partnered with various charitable organizations to donate excess and short-dated product that would otherwise be unused. In the last two years, Lannett and its employees have raised or donated over $0.6 million of pharmaceutical products, valued at wholesale acquisition cost, to a variety of worthy organizations, with our most recent emphasis on assisting local communities impacted by COVID-19. We believe in giving back to the people, causes and organizations that make a difference in the lives of others and that inspire our employees.
Environmental Matters 
Lannett is committed to a more sustainable future with a reduced environmental footprint, effective use of natural resources and a multi-pronged approach to managing carbon intensity that strengthens our quality-oriented focus of providing affordable medicines to patients who depend on them. As the manufacturer of high-quality generic medicines, we are focused on developing, manufacturing and distributing safe and cost-effective medicines in the United States. Because we operate primarily in the U.S., our supply chain is more compact and resilient than many of our competitors and has a smaller corresponding carbon footprint. As a U.S.-based, publicly traded company, we are also subject to various strict U.S. compliance requirements. We follow regulations issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), and various state environmental agencies in the U.S. We have consistently had a good record of compliance with these agencies. The majority of our large competitors that manufacture and are headquartered abroad are not always subject to the same set of requirements.
Our product portfolio has been migrating to lower relative volume products that, as a result of their market and production requirement, have a smaller environmental impact than higher relative volume products. We still strive to reduce the amount of natural resources consumed and minimize the amount of facility and pharmaceutical-related waste generated and disposed of in our communities. Measures include implementing projects that reduce the total amount of energy & natural resources utilized and improving manufacturing operations to improve production output per unit of resources used.
In addition, we participate in a drug takeback program, which provides channels for consumers to return unused prescriptions in an effort to divert waste from landfills and water supply. The Company is currently developing our plan to address climate change and intends to issue a report during fiscal year 2022 to address our goals and metrics for the future. We expect to monitor and revise these goals and metrics as the climate change landscape evolves over time. We also intend to communicate our performance against these metrics and to be transparent with our progress in improving our environmental impact. 
Government Regulation
Pharmaceutical manufacturers are subject to extensive regulation by the federal government, including the FDA and, in cases of controlled substance products the DEA as well as other federal regulatory bodies and state governments. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”), the Controlled Substance Act (the “CSA”) and other federal statutes and regulations govern or influence the testing, manufacture, safety, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of our generic drug products. Non-compliance with applicable regulations can result in fines, product recalls and seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, personal and/or corporate prosecution and debarment and refusal of the government to approve applications. The FDA also has the authority to revoke previously approved drug applications.

16



Generally, FDA approval is required before a drug can be marketed. A new drug is one not generally recognized by qualified experts as safe and effective for its intended use and is submitted to the FDA as a NDA. The FDA review process for new drugs is very extensive and requires a substantial investment to research and test the drug candidate. A less burdensome approval pathway, the ANDA, is used for generic drug products. Typically, the investment required to develop a generic drug is less costly than the new drug. Some drug products may be submitted as a 505(b)(2) NDA, allowing some of the required research and testing to be waived by relying on FDA’s previous findings of safety and efficacy and literature. For additional information on the FDA approval pathways, refer to section 505(b)(1) and 505(b)(2) of the FD&C Act for NDAs, section 505(j) for ANDAs and resources available on the FDA website, www.fda.gov.
Manufacturing cGMP requirements
Among the requirements for a new drug approval, facilities identified in each application that perform operations related to the drug product, including drug substance manufacturers and outside contract facilities, must conform to FDA cGMP regulations. The FDA may perform general GMP and/or pre-approval inspections to assess a company’s compliance with cGMP regulations. These inspections include reviews of procedures, operations, and data used to support the application and ongoing drug product manufacturing and testing. FDA’s cGMP regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance systems as well as the corresponding records and documentation. In complying with the evolving standards set forth in the cGMP regulations, we must continue to expend time, money and effort in many areas to ensure compliance.
Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including but not limited to, warning letters, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations, injunctions, the seizure of non-complying drug products and/or civil and criminal penalties.
Adverse experiences with the product and certain non-compliance events may need to be reported to the FDA and could result in regulatory actions such as labeling changes or FDA request for application withdrawal or product removal.
Other regulatory requirements
With respect to post-market product advertising and promotion, the FDA imposes a number of regulations on entities that advertise and promote pharmaceuticals, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. The FDA has very broad enforcement authority under the FDCA and failure to abide by these regulations can result in penalties, including the issuance of a warning letter directing entities to correct deviations from FDA standards, a requirement that future advertising and promotional materials be pre-cleared by the FDA and state and/or federal civil and criminal investigations and prosecutions. Some of our products require participation in Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (“REMS”) programs. A shared system REMS encompasses multiple prescription drug products and is developed and implemented jointly by two or more companies marketing the same products. These programs can add significant costs for the Company, depending on market share and complexity of the program.
Any one or a combination of FDA regulatory or enforcement actions against the Company could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.

17



DEA regulation
We maintain registrations and quota (limitations on purchases of controlled substances) with the DEA that enable us to receive, manufacture, store, develop, test and distribute controlled substances in connection with our operations. Controlled substances are those drugs that appear on one of five schedules promulgated and administered by the DEA under the CSA. The CSA governs, among other things, the distribution, recordkeeping, quota, handling, security and disposal of controlled substances. We are subject to periodic and ongoing inspections by the DEA and similar state drug enforcement authorities to assess our ongoing compliance with the DEA’s regulations. Any failure to comply with these regulations could lead to a variety of sanctions, including the revocation or a denial of renewal of our DEA registration or quota, injunctions, or civil or criminal penalties. We are subject to an allocation of national (aggregate) quota for several products in our portfolio. Our quota requests require DEA approval in full for us to meet our forecasted customer demands. The DEA may or may not approve our quota requests in full based on factors that we do not control.
Fraud and abuse laws
Because of the significant federal and state funding involved in the provision of health care services, including Medicare and Medicaid funding, Congress and state legislatures have enacted, and federal and state prosecutors actively enforce, a number of laws whose purpose is to eliminate fraud, abuse, and corruption in the health care industry. Our business is subject to compliance with these laws, including both federal and state level anti-kickback laws and statutes aimed at eliminating false or fraudulent claims for payment. In addition, we are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), which prohibits offering, promising, authorizing, or making payments to any foreign government official to obtain or retain business. Because health care systems in many countries are run and funded at least in part by the government, the FCPA applies to interactions with most healthcare professionals and procurement representatives in many countries. Other countries have enacted similar anti-bribery laws. 
Anti-kickback statutes 
One of the primary federal laws aimed at curbing fraud and abuse in the federal health care programs is the Anti-Kickback Statute (“AKS”), which prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal health care program such as Medicare, Medicaid or TRICARE. The definition of “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, and can take many forms besides cash or compensation, including for example gifts and entertainment, certain discounts, the furnishing of free supplies, equipment or services, credit arrangements, rebates, and waivers of payments, including copayments. For example, under the AKS, a pharmaceutical company is prohibited from offering, directly or indirectly, any remuneration to induce Medicare patients to purchase the company’s drugs or to induce physicians to prescribe the company’s drugs. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal health care covered business, the statute has been violated, regardless of the existence of other legitimate purposes for the remuneration. In addition, the AKS may not even require proof of a kickback recipient’s motivation for accepting an illegal payment, so long as he or she accepts the kickback knowingly and willfully. Penalties for AKS violations include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment, and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal health care programs. In addition, claims for services or goods resulting from kickback arrangements are “false claims” within the meaning of the federal False Claims Act, discussed in more detail below.

18



The AKS is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the health care industry. Recognizing that the AKS is broad and may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements, Congress incorporated several statutory exceptions into the AKS’s framework, which protect certain types of business arrangements. Congress also authorized the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“OIG”) to issue a series of “regulatory safe harbors.” The "safe harbor" regulations describe various payment and business practices that, although they potentially implicate the AKS, are not treated as offenses under the statute. Both the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors set forth requirements that, if met, assure health care providers and other parties to the arrangement that they will not be prosecuted under the AKS. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy each applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities such as OIG.
Many states have adopted laws similar to the AKS. Some of these state prohibitions apply to referrals of patients for health care items or services reimbursed by any source, including commercial payers and private pay patients. 
The federal government is aggressive and particularly active in pursuing suspected violations of the AKS against companies and certain sales, marketing, and executive personnel, for allegedly offering unlawful inducements to potential or existing customers in an attempt to procure their business (i.e. to promote drug sales). Additionally, a number of courts have ruled that a transaction that violates the AKS is unenforceable as against public policy.
In addition to applying federal and state anti-kickback statutes in enforcement actions involving the marketing of healthcare services and products, the federal government and various states also have enacted laws specifically regulating the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical companies. These laws and regulations may limit financial interactions between manufacturers and health care providers, require disclosure to the federal or state government and the public of such interactions (e.g. federal and state “Sunshine” laws), or require the adoption of compliance standards or programs. Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation and, given the lack of clarity, our activities could be subject to the penalties under the pertinent laws and regulations.
False claims act statutes 
The federal False Claims Act (“FCA”) imposes liability on any person or entity who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal health care program. The Qui Tam provisions of the FCA allow private individuals with evidence of fraud to file suits on behalf of the federal government and to share in any monetary recovery. In recent years, the number of suits brought against health care providers by private individuals has increased dramatically, and in Fiscal 2020, the federal government recovered more than $1.8 billion in judgements and settlements related to FCA violations in the health care industry. In addition to the FCA, various states have enacted false claims laws analogous to the FCA, which similarly enable private individuals to bring claims on behalf of a state or local government that has been defrauded. Because the Medicaid program is jointly funded by the federal government and the states, for example, qui tam plaintiffs frequently pursue both federal and state law claims.

19



When an entity is determined to have violated the FCA, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties in excess of $23,000 per claim, as adjusted annually. Liability arises, primarily, when an entity knowingly submits or causes another to submit a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the federal government. The definition of a “false” claim is broad: In addition to actual or objective falsity, a claim may be considered “false” for purposes of liability under the FCA based on an express or implied certification that the person or company who submitted the claim is in compliance with all applicable statutes, regulations, or government contract provisions. For example, the federal government has used the FCA to assert liability on the basis of inadequate care, kickbacks, and other improper referrals; improper use of Medicare numbers by the provider of services; as well as allegations regarding misrepresentations with respect to the services rendered. In addition, the federal government has prosecuted companies under the FCA in connection with off-label promotion of products (because government health programs ordinarily do not cover “off-label” uses of medications). Our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesale or estimated retail prices of our products, the reporting of discount and rebate information and other information affecting federal, state, and third-party reimbursement of our products, and the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. We are unable to predict whether we will be subject to actions under the FCA or a similar state law, or the impact of such actions. However, the costs of defending such claims, as well as any sanctions imposed, could significantly affect our financial performance.
Foreign corrupt practices act
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, (the “FCPA”) and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit certain persons and entities, and their intermediaries, from making payments to foreign government officials to obtain or retain business. In recent years, for example, pharmaceutical, medical device, and other health care companies have resolved FCPA allegations of bribing government procurement officials to win tenders and/or bribing public health care providers to prescribe products. If we are found to be liable for FCPA or other violations, we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, including contract cancellations or debarment, and loss of our reputation, any of which could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition, and operations.
HIPAA and other fraud and privacy regulations
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) created two new federal crimes: health care fraud and false statements relating to health care matters. The HIPAA health care fraud statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private payment programs. HIPAA’s extensive privacy and security regulations impose significant regulatory requirements on covered entities to acquire and implement information systems and to adopt business procedures and security measures designed to protect the privacy and security of patients’ protected health information. These particular HIPAA requirements have had a significant financial impact on many sectors of the health care industry because they impose extensive new requirements and restrictions on the use and disclosure of identifiable patient information, and the financial consequences of a data breach or unauthorized disclosure of patients’ protected health information, including data breaches caused by malicious third parties and inadvertent disclosures, can result in substantial civil fines, penalties and lawsuits, negative publicity, and costly remediation efforts imposed by the Office for Civil Rights of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The HIPAA false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items, or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment and/or exclusion from government-sponsored programs.
Pricing
In the United States, our sales are dependent upon the availability of coverage and reimbursement for our products from third-party payors, including federal and state programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and private organizations such as commercial health insurance and managed care companies. Such third-party payors challenge the price of medical products and services and continue to institute cost containment measures to control or significantly influence the purchase of medical products and services.

20



Over the past several years, the rising costs of providing health care services has triggered legislation to make certain changes to the way in which pharmaceuticals are covered and reimbursed, particularly by government programs. For instance, federal legislation and regulations have created a voluntary prescription drug benefit, Medicare Part D, which revised the formula used to reimburse health care providers and physicians under Medicare Part B and imposed significant revisions to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. These changes have resulted in and may continue to result in, coverage and reimbursement restrictions and increased rebate obligations by manufacturers.
In addition, there continues to be legislative and regulatory proposals at the federal and state levels directed at containing or lowering the cost of health care. Examples of how limits on drug coverage and reimbursement in the United States may cause reduced payments for drugs in the future include:

● | changing Medicare reimbursement methodologies;
--+-----------------------------------------------


● | revising drug rebate calculations under the Medicaid program;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


● | reforming drug importation laws;
--+---------------------------------


● | fluctuating decisions on which drugs to include in formularies; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | requiring pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative drug therapies.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Also, over the last few years, several states have passed legislation or have proposed legislation that have imposed price reporting requirements for both generic and brand pharmaceutical products and that include price transparency, price increase notification and supplement rebate requirements.
We cannot predict the likelihood or pace of such additional changes or whether there will be significant legislative or regulatory reform impacting our products, nor can we predict with precision what effect such governmental measures would have if they were ultimately enacted into law. However, in general, we believe that legislative and regulatory reform activity likely will continue.
Current or future federal or state laws and regulations may influence the prices of drugs and, therefore, could adversely affect the prices that we receive for our products. Programs in existence in certain states seek to set prices of all drugs sold within those states through the regulation and administration of the sale of prescription drugs. Expansion of these programs, in particular, state Medicaid programs, or changes required in the way in which Medicaid rebates are calculated under such programs, could adversely affect the price we receive for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, generic pharmaceutical drug prices have been the focus of increased scrutiny by certain states’ attorneys general, the U.S. Department of Justice and Congress. Decreases in health care reimbursements or prices of our prescription drugs could limit our ability to sell our products or could decrease our revenues, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
The Company believes that under the current regulatory environment, the generic pharmaceutical industry as a whole will be the target of increased governmental scrutiny, especially with respect to state and federal anti-trust and price-fixing claims.
See Note 10 “Legal, Regulatory Matters and Contingencies” for a description of current state and federal anti-trust and price-fixing claims.

Other applicable laws
We are also subject to federal, state and local laws of general applicability, including laws regulating working conditions and the storage, transportation, or discharge of items that may be considered hazardous substances, hazardous waste, or environmental contaminants. We monitor our compliance with laws and we believe we are in substantial compliance with all regulatory bodies.
As a publicly-traded company, we are also subject to significant regulations and laws, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Since its enactment, we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program based on what we believe are the current best practices and we continue to update the program in response to newly implemented or changing regulatory requirements.
Employees
As of June 30, 2021, we had 812 full-time employees.
