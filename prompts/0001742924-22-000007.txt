ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Livent Corporation was formed and incorporated by FMC Corporation as FMC Lithium USA Holding Corp. in the State of Delaware on February 27, 2018, and was subsequently renamed Livent Corporation ("Livent"). Prior to this time, our business was operated through various subsidiaries of FMC and their predecessors. Pursuant to a 2018 restructuring, FMC transferred substantially all of the assets and liabilities of its lithium business to us in exchange for all of our common stock. We conducted our initial public offering of common stock in October 2018, and FMC completed the spin-off distribution of all remaining shares of our common stock that FMC owned in March 2019. We have been operating as an independent company since that time. Livent's principal executive offices are located at 1818 Market Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 19103.

General    
We are a pure-play, fully integrated lithium company, with a long, proven history of producing performance lithium compounds. Our primary products, namely battery-grade lithium hydroxide, lithium carbonate, butyllithium and high purity lithium metal are critical inputs used in various performance applications. Our strategy is to focus on supplying high performance lithium compounds to the fast-growing electric vehicles ("EV") and broader battery markets, while continuing to maintain our position as a leading global producer of butyllithium and high purity lithium metal. With extensive global capabilities, nearly 80 years of continuous production experience, applications and technical expertise, long standing customer relationships and a favorable sustainability profile, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the accelerating trends of vehicle electrification and renewable energy adoption.
We produce lithium compounds for use in applications that have specific and constantly changing performance requirements, including battery-grade lithium hydroxide for use in high performance lithium-ion batteries. We believe the demand for our compounds will continue to grow as the electrification of transportation accelerates, and as the use of high nickel content cathode materials increases in the next generation of battery technology products. We also supply butyllithium, which is used in the production of polymers and pharmaceutical products, as well as a range of specialty lithium compounds including high purity lithium metal, which is used in non-rechargeable batteries and in the production of lightweight materials for aerospace 

applications. It is in these applications that we have established a differentiated position in the market through our ability to consistently produce and deliver performance lithium compounds.
Livent Strategy
We believe that growth in EV sales will drive significant growth in demand for performance lithium compounds. We believe that we are well positioned to benefit from this trend thanks to our leading position, long-standing customer relationships and favorable sustainability profile. We view sustainability as central to our mission and a key consideration in all of our investment and operational decisions.
To fully capitalize on our growth opportunities, our strategy will involve investing in our assets, our technology capabilities and our people to ensure we can continue to meet our customers’ growing demands as well as our broader commitments to other key stakeholders, including investors, employees, regulators and our local communities.
Expand our Production Capacities
We are well advanced on a 5,000 metric ton lithium hydroxide addition in Bessemer City, North Carolina, and a 20,000 metric ton expansion of lithium carbonate in Argentina. The new hydroxide unit is expected to come online by the fourth quarter of 2022, and the additional carbonate capacity is expected to come online in two equal phases by the first quarter of 2023 and year-end 2023, respectively.
In the first quarter of 2022, we began engineering work on a second expansion to add an additional 20,000 metric tons of carbonate capacity in Argentina by the end of 2025. Upon completion, we would have total carbonate capacity in Argentina of roughly 60,000 metric tons.
Longer-term, we plan to expand our hydroxide capacity in multiple geographies in order to meet growing customer demand globally. We will also continue to evaluate our butyllithium capacity regionally and add capacity as demand continues to increase. For high purity lithium metal, we are evaluating expansion opportunities, including expansion of lithium chloride as a feedstock, to align with the potential increase in demand for lithium metal as customers develop next generation battery technologies. This includes opportunities for our proprietary LIOVIXTM lithium metal product.
Diversify our Sources of Supply
We continue to pursue additional sources of lithium products, which may include further expansion in Argentina, increasing our ownership stake in the Nemaska Lithium Inc. development project and assets, acquisition and development of new resources, entering into long-term supply agreements with other producers or some combination thereof. We will continually assess new resources that offer the potential to provide alternative sources of lithium products and will look to invest in developing such resources where it makes sense to do so.
Expand our Applications and Process Technology Capabilities
Our market position today depends on our ability to consistently provide our customers with the products they need, in a sustainable and responsible manner. To maintain this position, we are continuously investing to improve our application, process and extraction technologies, on both existing and new potential resources, and to reduce our environmental footprint. As we work with our customers to understand their evolving lithium needs, we will focus on expanding our extraction and processing capabilities and our ability to adapt the properties of our products, whether chemical or physical, to meet those needs. This may require us to invest in and potentially acquire new capabilities, hire people or acquire new technical resources.
Develop Next Generation Lithium Compounds
We believe that the evolution of battery technologies will lead to the adoption of lithium-based applications in the anode and electrolyte within the battery. This evolution will require new forms of lithium to be produced, such as new lithium metal powders or printable lithium products. We will continue to invest in our research and development efforts to help us create new products, such as LIOVIXTM, and we will also invest with and partner with our customers to further their own research and development efforts.
Invest in Our People
Our business requires that we hire, retain and engage research scientists, engineers and a technical sales force. We will continue to invest in our people through training and developing our employees to retain talent. We will look to cultivate an inclusive and positive work environment that (i) creates and supports diversity; (ii) prioritizes equal opportunity and fairness in the company’s management systems and practices; and (iii) fosters a sense of belonging for employees with diverse perspectives, backgrounds and expertise.
Focus on Sustainability
We believe lithium will continue to play an important role in enabling a cleaner, healthier and more sustainable world, including the transition to a lower carbon future and the fight against climate change. Likewise, we believe that meeting the growing demand for lithium compounds must be balanced with considerations for responsible production across the spectrum of Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) issues and concerns. Our core values reflect this commitment to sustainability. We believe that operating in a safe, ethical, socially conscious and sustainable manner is important for our business. 
As such, we intend to continue to integrate ESG and sustainability considerations into our business, operations and investment decisions. In addition, we are determined to help set the standard in the lithium industry for sustainability, performance, transparency and independent validation. We believe that our ESG and sustainability efforts will continue to help us differentiate ourselves from competitors and help us develop and strengthen relationships with customers and other key stakeholders.
We encourage you to review our 2020 Sustainability Report and website (located at www.livent.com/sustainability) for more detailed information regarding our ESG programs and initiatives as well as our 2030 and 2040 sustainability goals. Nothing on our website, including our Sustainability Report or sections thereof, shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K.
Financial Information About Our Business
We operate as one reportable segment based on the commonalities among our products and services, the types of customers we serve and the manner in which we review and evaluate operating performance. As we earn a substantial amount of our revenues through the sale of lithium products, we have concluded that we have one operating segment for reporting purposes.
Business Overview
As a result of our focus on supplying performance lithium compounds for use in the rapidly growing EV and broader energy storage battery markets, we expect our revenue generated from lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate, energy storage and our Asia operations to increase. We intend to maintain our leadership positions in other high performance markets such as non-rechargeable batteries, greases, pharmaceuticals and polymers.
We believe that we have earned a reputation as a leading supplier in the markets we serve, based on the performance of our products in our customers’ production processes and our ability to provide application know-how and technical support. In the EV market, we are one of a small number of lithium suppliers whose battery-grade lithium hydroxide has been qualified by global customers for use in their cathode material production that is ultimately used in numerous global EV programs at scale. Throughout our history, as end market application technologies have evolved, we have worked closely with our customers to understand their changing performance requirements and have developed products to address their needs.
As a vertically integrated lithium producer, we benefit from operating one of the lowest cost lithium mineral deposits in the world that also has a favorable, industry leading sustainability footprint. We have been extracting lithium brine at our operations at the Salar del Hombre Muerto in Argentina for more than 25 years, and have been producing various lithium compounds for approximately 80 years. Our operational history provides us with a deep understanding of the process of extracting lithium compounds from brine safely and sustainably. We have developed proprietary process knowledge that enables us to produce high quality, low impurity lithium carbonate and lithium chloride, and helps us to produce industry leading quality downstream products. We source the majority of our base lithium compounds for use in the production of performance lithium compounds from these low cost operations in Argentina. Our operations in Argentina are expandable, giving us the ability to increase our lithium carbonate and lithium chloride production to meet increasing demand. We also have the operational flexibility to procure lithium carbonate from third party suppliers as needed. This allows us to manage our production requirements and produce more end-products for customers than we would have the ability to do with lithium carbonate derived solely from our internal sources of supply.
We are one of a few lithium compound producers with global manufacturing capabilities. We use the majority of the lithium carbonate we produce in the production of battery-grade lithium hydroxide in the U.S. and China. We use lithium chloride to produce lithium metal, a key feedstock in the production of butyllithium products in the U.S., the United Kingdom, China and India, as well as in the production of high purity lithium metal in the U.S. We have significant know-how and experience in the lithium hydroxide, butyllithium and high purity lithium metal production processes and product applications, which we believe provide us with a competitive advantage in these markets.

Products and Markets    
Our performance lithium compounds are frequently produced to meet specific customer application and performance requirements. We have developed our capabilities in producing performance lithium compounds through decades of interaction with our customers, and our products are key inputs into their production processes. Our customer relationships provide us with first-hand insight into our customers’ production objectives and future needs in terms of product volume, mix and specifications, which we in turn use to further develop our products. 
Other specialties include lithium phosphate, pharmaceutical-grade lithium carbonate, high purity lithium chloride and specialty organics. In addition to performance lithium compounds, we also produce lithium carbonate and lithium chloride, both of which we largely consume as feedstock in the process of producing our performance lithium compounds.
Competition and Industry Overview
We sell our performance lithium compounds worldwide. Most markets for lithium compounds are global, with significant growth occurring in Asia, eventually expected to follow in Europe, and then the U.S. This is being driven primarily by the development and manufacturing of lithium-ion batteries. The market for lithium compounds faces barriers to entry, including access to an adequate and stable supply of lithium feedstock, the need to produce sufficient quality and quantity, technical expertise and development lead time. According to Wood Mackenzie 2021 estimates, we are one of the five largest producers of lithium compounds, including SQM, Albemarle, Tianqi Lithium and Ganfeng Lithium, which accounted for just over 50% of the global refined lithium production as measured by lithium carbonate equivalent ("LCE"). We expect capacity to be added by new and existing producers over time. We believe our lithium brines in Salar del Hombre Muerto, Argentina, which have a favorable sustainability profile and are considered by the industry to be one of the lowest-cost sources of lithium, provide us with a distinct competitive advantage against current and future entrants. Additionally, as the EV supply chain gradually 

regionalizes to Europe and North America, our lithium resource in Argentina and battery-grade lithium hydroxide capacity in the U.S. positions us well for partnering with leading automakers for their regional electrification roadmaps.
We compete by providing advanced technology, high product quality, reliability, quality customer and technical service, and by operating in a cost-efficient manner and prioritizing safety and sustainability. We also enjoy competitive advantages from our vertically integrated manufacturing approach, low production costs and history of efficient capital deployment. We believe that we are a leading provider of battery-grade lithium hydroxide in EV battery applications and in performance grease applications. We currently have lithium hydroxide capacity in the U.S. and China. We are also the only fully integrated producer of high purity lithium metal in the Western Hemisphere. We believe that we are one of only two global suppliers of butyllithium and, according to Wood Mackenzie, we are one of the two largest producers of downstream lithium chemicals outside of China. Our primary competitors for performance lithium compounds are Albemarle Corporation and Ganfeng Lithium. 
Growth
According to BloombergNEF's June 2021 Long-Term Electric Vehicle Outlook, under the Economic Transition Scenario ("ETS"), EV (battery electric and plug-in hybrid electric passenger vehicles) sales are expected to be approximately 32 million units in 2030, rising to approximately 66 million units in 2040, representing a penetration rate of 34% and 68%, respectively, of all passenger vehicles sold. According to EV Volumes’ August 2021 report on global plug-in (battery electric and plug-in hybrid electric) passenger cars and light commercial vehicles forecast, sales are expected to be approximately 37 million units in 2030, rising to approximately 65 million units in 2035, representing a penetration rate of 37% and 61%, respectively, of all passenger cars and light commercial vehicles sold. Both BloombergNEF, and EV Volumes expect battery electric vehicles to comprise a clear majority of the EV sales mix.
The strong EV demand growth in 2021 was in large part driven by national and regional governments' announced incentives, subsidies and more stringent fuel economy/carbon dioxide emissions regulations to stimulate the automotive industry’s recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact and support electrification efforts. Throughout 2021, numerous automakers announced large investments towards drivetrain electrification and laid out roadmaps for launching a growing number of competitive models across various segments. As countries around the world gradually phase out subsidies for consumers, in order to comply with the fuel economy regulations, automakers will require an increasing share of EVs in their product sales mix. 
In 2022 and beyond, fuel economy/carbon dioxide emissions regulations for commercial vehicles coupled with environmental commitments of an increasing number of corporations are likely to propel electric commercial vehicle sales. According to BloombergNEF's June 2021 Long-Term Electric Vehicle Outlook, under the ETS, electric commercial vehicles (battery electric, plug-in hybrid electric, and range extender electric light-, medium-, heavy-duty commercial vehicles) sales are expected to increase from approximately 0.5 million units in 2022 to approximately 6 million units in 2030, and to approximately 15 million units in 2040. By 2040, according to BloombergNEF, electric commercial vehicles will have 52% share of all commercial vehicles sold.
Besides electrification of transportation, electricity generation continued its decarbonization trend with solar and wind installations crossing new milestones; many of these installations are coupled with lithium-ion battery-based energy storage systems. According to BloombergNEF’s November 2021 Long-Term Energy Storage Outlook, lithium-ion technology will be dominant in stationary storage applications through 2030.
In line with varying consumer preferences across regions, automakers are launching an increasing number of EVs across segments and for shorter-ranges and longer-ranges. Automakers have been introducing longer-range, bigger size, premium-performance-luxury EV models using higher energy density batteries and are increasingly doing so by using high (>60%) nickel content cathode materials. Continued strong demand for high nickel content cathode materials for automotive applications will require battery-grade lithium hydroxide in the production of cathode materials. Additionally, since late 2020, automakers have been increasing adoption of lithium iron phosphate cathode material initially for the China passenger vehicles market and subsequently for markets outside China. Lithium iron phosphate is also a more suitable cathode material in stationary storage applications and other forms of electric transportation. Lithium iron phosphate is predominantly synthesized using lithium carbonate, and thereby carbonate demand has been witnessing strong growth.
As an existing, proven global producer of battery-grade lithium hydroxide, and lithium carbonate, we are well positioned to benefit from this expected increase in lithium demand from EV growth. As one of the pioneers in the lithium industry, we have relationships throughout the lithium-ion battery value chain. Across the battery value chain, product performance requirements have continued to evolve since the first lithium-ion batteries and cathode materials were introduced in the early 1990s. We have developed our application and materials knowledge by working with our customers over time to produce performance lithium compounds which meet evolving customer needs.

Our growth efforts focus on developing environmentally compatible and sustainable lithium products. We are committed to providing unique, differentiated products to our customers by acquiring and further developing technologies as well as investing in innovation to extend product life cycles.

Raw Materials
Lithium    
Our primary raw material is lithium, and we obtain the substantial majority of our lithium from our operations in Argentina. We extract lithium from naturally occurring lithium-rich brines located in the Andes Mountains of Argentina, which are believed to be one of the world’s most significant and lowest cost sources of lithium, through a proprietary selective adsorption and solar evaporation process. We process the brine into lithium carbonate at our co-located manufacturing facility in Fénix, Argentina and into lithium chloride at our nearby manufacturing facility in Güemes, Argentina. In 2018 and 2019 we expanded capacity of lithium carbonate at these facilities through debottlenecking projects.
For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, our Argentine operations extracted and processed approximately 16 kMT, 16 kMT and 17 kMT of lithium carbonate, respectively, and approximately 4 kMT, 5 kMT and 4 kMT of lithium chloride, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, lithium brine production from both lithium carbonate and lithium chloride, on a lithium carbonate equivalent ("LCE") basis, was approximately 18.5 kMT, 19.5 kMT and 20 kMT, respectively.
We have also historically purchased a portion of our lithium carbonate raw materials from other suppliers as needed.
Salar del Hombre Muerto    
We conduct our Argentine operations through Minera del Altiplano SA ("MdA"), our local operating subsidiary. We extract lithium from naturally occurring lithium-rich brines in Salar del Hombre Muerto, an area covering approximately 600 square kilometers in a region of the Andes Mountains of northwest Argentina known as the “lithium triangle.” This area of the Central Andes is within an arid plateau with numerous volcanic peaks and salt flats known as “salars” and is the principal lithium-bearing region of South America.
Salar del Hombre Muerto consists of evaporite deposits formed within an isolated basin depression. Fault-bounded bedrock hills occur within and along the margins of the salar basin, subdividing the Salar del Hombre Muerto into two separate sub-basins (eastern and western), each with different evaporite sediment compositions. The eastern sub-basin is dominated by 

borate evaporites, whereas the western sub-basin is relatively free of clastic sediment (such as sand, silts and clays) and is dominated by halite (sodium chloride) evaporite deposits.
We performed initial geological investigations of the Salar del Hombre Muerto in the early 1990s, prior to development of our lithium production facilities. We commenced commercial extraction operations in Salar del Hombre Muerto in 1998. Lithium extract is processed into lithium carbonate at our co-located manufacturing facility in Fénix, Argentina and into lithium chloride at our nearby manufacturing facility in Güemes, Argentina. These facilities were opened in conjunction with the commencement of our extraction operations and are in good working condition. MdA owns these facilities. We use natural gas and diesel to generate electricity, which is the principal source of power at our facilities. From time to time, we experience interruptions in the supply of electricity, but we do not believe these interruptions materially impact our operations.
Brine containing approximately 600 parts per million ("ppm") lithium is pumped from saltwater aquifers using extraction wells. The brine is then diverted to an evaporation pond system. We have also developed a proprietary lithium concentration and purification process for brine operations that significantly reduces the time from pumping brine from the Salar to processing it into lithium carbonate or lithium chloride. This reduction in processing time compares favorably to a conventional solar evaporation process, while effectively removing impurities, providing increased process control and improving lithium yields. During evaporation, other minerals, such as sodium, potassium and magnesium, which are typically contained in brine, are concentrated and removed through processing. The resulting lithium chloride brine from the terminal pond of the system is then routed to our processing plants.
We access our extraction sites and nearby manufacturing facilities by local roadway, which is a suitable transportation alternative. We transport the brine extract from our Fénix facility by truck to our Güemes facility for processing. We then transport the processed lithium carbonate and lithium chloride by truck to ports in Argentina and Chile, where it is shipped by vessel to our manufacturing facilities and customers.
Mineral concession rights
MdA holds title to mineral concession rights for its extraction activities in Salar del Hombre Muerto. These mineral concession rights cover an area of approximately 327 square kilometers and are granted to MdA pursuant to the Argentine Mining Code. See subsection “Argentine Law and Regulation” to this Item 1 for more information. Pursuant to the Argentine Mining Code, MdA’s mineral concession rights are valid until the deposit is depleted of all minerals. The concession rights may be rescinded if we fail to pay fees or do not actively extract minerals for a period lasting more than four years.
In 1991, MdA entered into an ongoing agreement, for so long a time as our mineral concession is valid, with the Argentine federal government and the Catamarca province in connection with the development of the Salar del Hombre Muerto exploration site. Following legislative and constitutional reforms in 1993 and 1994, the Argentine federal government assigned all of its rights and obligations under the agreement to the Catamarca province. The agreement governs limited matters relating to our production activities and grants to the Catamarca province an immaterial minority ownership stake in MdA, which enables the province to receive certain dividends and to appoint two of MdA’s ten-member Board of Directors and one of MdA’s three-member audit committee. The term of the agreement expires when MdA ceases to extract and produce lithium compounds from Salar del Hombre Muerto.
MdA is required to pay the Catamarca province an immaterial semi-annual “canon” fee pursuant to the Argentine Mining Code and royalties equal to 3% of the pithead value of the minerals extracted by MdA pursuant to the Argentine Mining Investment Law and Catamarca provincial law. Separately, under an amendment to its long-term agreement with Catamarca entered into on January 25, 2018, MdA agreed to pay the Catamarca province a monthly royalty payment and to make Corporate Social Responsibility ("CSR") expenditures. The royalty amount is equal to 2% of sales of products in a given month measured at the higher of MdA’s average invoice price or an average international price for similar products, net of tax. MdA is permitted to net the royalty payment paid to the Catamarca province against the royalties to be paid under the Mining Investment Law. Total payments to the Catamarca province, including the "canon" fee and royalties, water trust payments (as described below in the "Water" subsection to this Item 1) and CSR expenditures were approximately $5.5 million, $5.9 million and $7.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.
A portion of the territory governed by our concession rights is subject to a longstanding border dispute between Catamarca and the adjacent Salta province. The border dispute has not impacted our operations for the over twenty years we have been operating in Argentina and we do not expect that it will impact our operations going forward. We estimate the total area in dispute represents approximately 7.6% of our concession (approximately 25 square kilometers). We do not view this as material, especially considering that the area in question is largely at the fringe of the salar, where the deposits are not as thick and the grade of lithium concentration is much lower.
Salta province claims that it is entitled to royalties from us for the minerals extracted within the small portion of our concession that falls within the disputed territory, although under Argentine law we cannot be charged duplicate royalties for the same minerals (the "Salta Royalty Claim"). In addition, the Salta province has granted and may grant mineral concessions in the 

disputed territory to other parties, although to date Catamarca authorities have not permitted any others to extract lithium from within the boundaries of our concession. 
In December 2019, the provinces of Catamarca and Salta entered into an agreement to create an interprovincial commission to: evaluate projects and programs for mining activity in the area subject to the border dispute; prepare a technical report to set the border between both provinces; and submit a bill to the Argentine Congress on the matter.
We previously engaged in judicial proceedings in Argentina with the Salta province to resolve the Salta Royalty Claim. The outcome of these proceedings was not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In January 2021, MdA and the State Prosecutor of Salta entered into an agreement to suspend the judicial proceedings and for discussions with the competent authorities of the Salta province to evaluate and resolve the Salta Royalty Claim. The agreement may be terminated by either party upon sixty days prior notice. The discussions are ongoing.
Water 
Our Argentine operations require fresh water. We have water rights for the supply of fresh water from the Trapiche aquifer, from which water is pumped through a battery of wells to our facilities. We and the Catamarca province regularly monitor the water and salinity levels of the aquifer.
We only had to temporarily suspend water extraction once, in January 2015, due to a dispute with the Catamarca province, and our access to our water source was quickly restored. We also regularly evaluate supplemental supplies of fresh water. The grant of water concessions and other water rights is subject to local governmental approvals, the timing and availability of which are uncertain and may be subject to delay or denial.
In October 2015, MdA entered into a water trust agreement with the Catamarca province that was amended in 2018. Under the amended trust agreement, MdA is obligated to pay into the trust an amount equal to 1.2% of its annual sales (calculated using the methodology used to determine the monthly royalty payments described above in the "Mineral Concession Rights" subsection to this Item 1), in lieu of any water use fees. These payments are fully reflected in our financial statements.
Energy 
Our Argentine operations rely on a steady source of energy. In 2015, we completed construction of a 135 kilometer natural gas pipeline from Pocitos, within the Salta province, to our Fénix facilities at Salar del Hombre Muerto, which eliminated our reliance on natural gas shipments by truck. This pipeline is governed by various agreements between MdA and Recursos Energeticos y Mineros Salta, S.A., or REMSA, a local natural gas sub-distributor, including a subdistribution agreement providing for contracted capacity through 2027. We are in discussions to increase our contracted capacity in advance of our needs for all phases of our expansion plans and may need to invest in additional infrastructure to support this expansion. REMSA or Gasnor S.A., another local natural gas distributor that operates in the northeast of Argentina, have no obligation to provide us the additional capacity on a timely basis or at all. If we cannot obtain such additional capacity, we would need to secure alternative arrangements to meet the increased energy needs of the planned expansion and such alternative arrangements may be less cost effective.
MdA also has a natural gas supply contract with Enel Trading Argentina S.R.L. and Gasmarket S.A. providing for the supply of natural gas for our Fénix manufacturing facility. This supply agreement expires in May 2022 and is typically renewed on an annual basis. We also have a purchase agreement with YPF SA for the supply of diesel fuel and gasoline to our Fénix and Güemes manufacturing facilities. This purchase agreement expires on February 28, 2022.
Other raw materials
We purchase raw materials and chemical intermediates for use in our production processes, including materials for use in our production of the proprietary adsorbent used to selectively extract lithium from our brine in Argentina, soda ash, or sodium carbonate, for use in our production of lithium carbonate, and lithium metal for our production of butyllithium. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, costs of major raw materials represented 14%, 13% and 11% of our total revenues, respectively. Major raw materials include soda ash, solvents, butyl chloride, hydrochloric acid, quicklime, metal and caustic soda. We generally satisfy our requirements through spot purchases and medium- or long-term contractual relationships. In general, where we have limited sources of raw materials, we have developed contingency plans to minimize the effect of any interruption or reduction in supply, such as sourcing from other suppliers or maintaining safety stocks. Supply chain constraints arising due to the COVID-19 pandemic continue to remain a challenge in all countries where we operate. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - COVID-19 Impacts."
Temporary shortages of raw materials may occasionally occur and cause temporary price increases. For example, we have had past regional interruptions in raw material supply, notably in China. In recent years, these shortages have not resulted in any material unavailability of raw materials. However, the continuing availability and price of raw materials are affected by many factors, including domestic and world market and political conditions, as well as the direct or indirect effect of governmental regulations. During periods of high demand, our raw materials are subject to significant price fluctuations, and such fluctuations may have an adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, there could be inflationary pressure on costs of the raw 

materials and/or services that could impact our results of operations. The impact of any future raw material shortages on our business as a whole or in specific geographic regions, including China, or in specific business lines cannot be accurately predicted. In line with recent market developments, we have seen price increases in butyllithium raw materials, especially solvents, butyl chloride and lithium metal. We have also seen significant price increases for certain of our raw materials as a result of recent global inflationary pressures. 
Seasonality
Our operations in Argentina are seasonally impacted by weather, including varying evaporation rates and amounts of rainfall during different seasons, which can be heavy at times. These changes impact the concentration in large evaporation ponds and can have an impact on the downstream processes to produce lithium carbonate and lithium chloride. Heavy rainfall can damage pond liners, lead to loss of product, and make the ponds generally difficult to maintain. Our operations team continuously measures pond concentrations and models how they will change based on operating decisions. Our processes use proprietary and traditional technologies to minimize the variation of concentrations at the inlet to our plants. There was an abnormally large rain event in both the first quarter of 2019 and during the last quarter of 2021. These resulted in reductions in lithium carbonate production of approximately 1,000 MT in 2019, and approximately 500 MT in 2021.
Argentine Law and Regulation
We are subject to various regulatory requirements in Argentina under the Argentine Mining Code, the Argentine Mining Investment Law and certain federal and provincial regulations, including with respect to environmental compliance. In addition, the relationship between us, MdA and the Catamarca provincial government is regulated through a contractual framework.
The Argentine Mining Code, which sets forth the rights and obligations of both mining companies and their workers, is the principal regulatory framework under which we conduct our operations in Argentina. The Argentine Mining Code provides for the terms under which the provinces regulate and administer the granting of mining rights to third parties.
The Argentine Mining Code establishes two basic means of granting title to mining property: the exploration permit and the mining concession, both of which convey valid mining title in Argentina.
Exploration permits grant their holders the right to freely explore for minerals within the boundaries of the territory covered by that permit as well as to request the mining concession for any discoveries within the covered territory.
Once a mining concession is granted, the recipient owns all in-place mineral deposits within the boundaries of the territory covered by the concession. Mining concessions are freely tradable by the title holder and can be sold, leased or otherwise transferred to third parties. Two requirements must be met to keep a mining concession in good standing: (i) the concession holder must make regular payments of a semi-annual fee known as a canon; and (ii) the concession holder must file and perform an initial five-year expenditure plan. In addition, prior to commencing mining activities, the concession holder must submit environmental impact studies, which must be renewed at least every two years, for approval by the relevant environmental authorities.
In addition to the Argentine Mining Code, we are also subject to the Argentine Mining Investment Law. The Argentine Mining Investment Law offers specific financial incentives to mining investors, including a 30-year term fiscal stability of national, provincial and municipal tax rates; a deduction from income tax for prospecting, exploration and feasibility study expenditures; a refund of Value Added Tax fiscal credits resulting from exploration works; accelerated depreciation of fixed assets; and a 3% cap on royalties payable out of production to the province where the deposit is located. Our 30-year term fiscal stability certificate expires in 2026.
Our fiscal stability rights under the Argentine Mining Investment Law have been challenged by the imposition of certain export taxes on our lithium chloride and carbonate exports that did not exist at the time we obtained our 30-year term fiscal stability certificate. For instance, in 2018, the Federal Government imposed another export duty on lithium carbonate and chloride through Decree No. 793/2018, which was in effect until December 31, 2020. Furthermore, in December 2019, after the change of Presidential administration, the Argentine Congress passed Law No. 27,541 creating a new legal framework for export duties and establishing a new rate for mining and hydrocarbon exports not to exceed 8% on the taxable amounts or the FOB value. In December 2020, the Executive Power issued Decree No. 1060/2020 establishing a new export duty applicable to all kinds of goods effective from January 1, 2021. In the case of lithium chloride and lithium carbonate, the applicable tax rate amounts to 4.5% and no cap has been set.
Under our 30-year term fiscal stability certificate, we are entitled to reimbursement or set-off (against other federal taxes) of any amount paid in excess of the total federal taxable burden applicable to us under such certificate. Although we are litigating to exercise our fiscal stability rights and are requesting an administrative reimbursement with respect to the imposition of certain of such export taxes, there can be no assurance that we will seek, or be able to obtain, reimbursement or set-off.
Environmental Laws and Regulations
We are subject to and incur capital and operating costs to comply with, numerous foreign, U.S. federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing employee health and safety, the composition of our products, the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the usage and availability of water, the cleanup of contaminated properties and the reclamation of our mines, brine extraction operations and certain other assets at the end of their useful life.
Our business and our customers are subject to significant requirements under the European Community Regulation for the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”). REACH imposes obligations on European Union manufacturers and importers of chemicals and other products into the European Union to compile and file comprehensive reports, including testing data, on each chemical substance, and perform chemical safety assessments. Currently, certain lithium products are undergoing a risk assessment review under REACH, which may eventually result in restrictions in the handling or use of lithium carbonate and other lithium products that we produce, which may increase our production costs. In addition, REACH regulations impose significant additional responsibilities and costs on chemical producers, importers, downstream users of chemical substances and preparations, and the entire supply chain. South Korea has a similar Act on the Registration and Evaluation of Chemicals which is known as “K-REACH.” Both REACH and K-REACH may lead to increases in the costs of raw materials we purchase and the products we sell in the European Union and South Korea, respectively. Increases in the costs of our products could result in a decrease in their overall demand. In addition, customers may seek products that are not regulated by REACH and/or K-REACH, which could also result in a decrease in the demand of certain products subject to the respective regulations. We continually monitor these laws and the regulations being adopted under them to determine our responsibilities.
In June 2016, modifications to the Toxic Substances Control Act in the U.S. were signed into law, requiring chemicals to be assessed against a risk-based safety standard and for the elimination of unreasonable risks identified during risk evaluation. Other initiatives in Asia and potentially in other regions will require toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals, including chemicals used or produced by us. These assessments may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals involved and additional requirements being placed on the production, handling, labeling or use of the subject chemicals. Such concerns and additional requirements could also increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products, which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products.
Liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances and wastes, as well as personal injury, property damages or natural resource damages arising from the release of, or exposure to, such hazardous substances and wastes, may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault, and may also be imposed jointly and severally. Such liabilities may be imposed on entities that formerly owned or operated the property affected by the hazardous substances and wastes, entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances and wastes at the affected property, and entities that currently own or operate such property. Our Bessemer City, North Carolina facility is currently undergoing monitoring and remediation of contamination pursuant to a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Part B corrective action permit. In addition, we currently have, and may in the future incur, liability as a potentially responsible party with respect to third party locations under CERCLA or state and foreign equivalents, including potential joint and several liabilities requiring us to pay in excess of our pro rata share of remediation costs.
We use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations and may become subject to claims and substantial liability for personal injury, property damage, wrongful death, loss of production, pollution and other environmental damages relating to the release of such substances into the environment. In addition, some of our current properties are, or have been, used for industrial purposes, which could contain currently unknown contamination that could expose us to governmental requirements or claims relating to environmental remediation, personal injury and/or property damage. Depending on the frequency and severity of such incidents, it is possible that the Company’s revenues, operating costs, insurability and relationships with customers, employees and regulators could be impaired.
We record accruals for environmental matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. It is possible that new information or future developments could require us to reassess our potential exposure related to environmental matters. We may incur significant costs and liabilities in order to comply with existing environmental laws and regulations. It is also possible that other developments, such as increasingly strict environmental laws, regulations and orders of regulatory agencies, as well as claims for damages to property and the environment or injuries to employees and other persons resulting from our current or past operations, could result in substantial costs and liabilities in the future.
A discussion of environmental related factors and related reserves can be found in Note 9 “Environmental Obligations” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.
Human Capital Management
Human Capital Management ("HCM") General Statement
We continue to build on our heritage as a global leader in the lithium industry. We are investing in the health, well-being, professional and personal development of our employees and are always striving to gain a deeper understanding of the needs of our business, customers, and employees. 
In 2021, we experienced a 15% global headcount increase over the previous year. This increase was driven by several factors, including: (i) our ongoing expansion efforts in Argentina and the U.S.; (ii) increasing the depth of our quality program in Asia through key hires; and (iii) expanding our global engineering talent pool. This increase is also, in part, reflective of hiring that was delayed in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This hiring increase is a reminder of the level of growth and demand our employees will be tasked to support over the next several years. Our focus on the needs of “people” was heightened in 2021 as we worked to provide for the health and safety of our manufacturing workforce who remained onsite. Simultaneously, we sought to balance our return-to-work goals for our non-manufacturing employees while maintaining the flexibility needed by many in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. 
Our Executive Leadership Team ("ELT") and Board of Directors ("Board") have challenged our teams to advance their focus on (i) identifying and developing high-potential talent to advance our business, (ii) global talent retention efforts, (iii) increasing our hiring of diverse talent and females where they are underrepresented and are the most qualified candidates, and (iv) creating an even more inclusive workplace. We are working to meet these challenges while maintaining our commitment to our customers, our employees and the communities in which we operate to be led by our core values:
•Safety First. We put safety at the forefront of everything we do. Simply put: the safety of everyone is everyone's responsibility.
•Be Responsible. We act ethically and honestly and advance responsible and sustainable practices in all aspects of our business.
•Constantly Innovate. We move the world forward and strive to constantly innovate through agile thinking, our industry-leading material science expertise and an intimate understanding of our core element: lithium.
•Celebrate Differences. We celebrate our differences in perspective, background and expertise, empowering our employees to be authentic and transparent. By encouraging employees to bring their own selves to work, we make Livent more dynamic.
•Thrive with Customers. Customers are at the heart of everything we do. By listening to and learning from them, we work together to build better lithium technologies.
Board of Directors’ Oversight of the HCM Process
The Compensation and Organization Committee (the “Compensation Committee”) of our Board of Directors assists the Board in its oversight of the development, implementation and effectiveness of our policies and strategies relating to our human capital management function, including, but not limited to, those policies and strategies regarding corporate culture, talent acquisition and retention, pay equity, career development and employment practices.
The Sustainability Committee of our Board of Directors assists the Board in its oversight of our Corporate Social Responsibility programs, including those relating to community, health and safety, human rights, responsible supply chain, and Diversity, Equity & Inclusion ("DE&I").
In 2021, we engaged the Board and these committees in our HCM process by providing them with updates on relevant HCM topics. This approach has proven to be an effective method of providing continued visibility and transparency, which, in turn, allows our Board to make informed decisions impacting compensation, succession planning, and DE&I priorities. 
Employee Safety, Health & Well-being 
Safety remains a core value of our business and drives our focus in everything we do. Our weekly publication of a “safety, quality and reliability” message continues to remind employees to prioritize safe behaviors in their personal and professional lives. Globally, we reported only one recordable injury in 2021. 
As we continued to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic, we consulted with managers and other senior leaders to identify what meaningful steps could be taken to both assess and contribute to our employees’ health, safety and well-being. Based on feedback, we developed a mental health awareness campaign. In May 2021, we launched a three-month campaign to bring awareness of mental health issues. Throughout this campaign, we published Wellness Wednesday messages focusing on mental health topics relevant to our employees and their families. We also held a global town hall with a panel of mental health professionals from the regions in which we operate. Each regional team also held a local event to address mental health topics 

that were more specific to their communities. We continue to offer access to mental health resources globally to every employee through an employee assistance program. 
As in 2020, it was important to maintain safely functioning plant operations as the COVID-19 pandemic continued in 2021. Accordingly, we considered the needs of all employees globally and provided support for them and their families that was appropriate for their circumstances. For most of 2021, non-manufacturing employees in many of our global locations continued to work remotely as we considered how to transition everyone safely back into the office. 
Prospective employees have, likewise, challenged us to consider remote working opportunities to protect and support our employees during the COVID-19 pandemic. As we grow the company and increase hiring, we will create opportunities for our people to come together through more regular in-person meetings and social interactions so that we maintain our culture and values while fostering innovation, collaboration, continuous learning, and customer focus. In late 2021, we announced Livent’s official transition to a hybrid workplace for non-manufacturing employees in the U.S. Non-manufacturing employees and their managers will discuss a schedule of in-office and remote work (while maintaining needed flexibility to keep everyone safe and to meet business needs). We expect that transition to begin in early 2022 as we continue monitoring the virus’ impact on our respective communities. 
While we have not implemented a vaccine requirement for existing employees, in the U.S. we do require employees whose role requires international travel to be fully vaccinated. We also require that all new U.S. employees be fully vaccinated within 30 days following their start date. We believe such measures will support our efforts to keep our U.S. plant operating safely and allow us to successfully transition U.S. non-manufacturing employees back to their physical offices in Pennsylvania and North Carolina on a hybrid basis. While there have been no government-imposed vaccine mandates at our non-U.S. locations, efforts are taken to understand the vaccination status of all existing and prospective employees and encourage vaccinations subject to legally recognized exemptions. Most of our global employees are vaccinated. 
Workforce Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (“DE&I”) 
We continue to operate in the U.S., Asia, Europe, and Argentina. As of December 31, 2021, we had a combined workforce of approximately 1,109 full-time, part-time, temporary, and contract employees. Argentina represents our only location with a unionized workforce, with approximately 188 of our 376 employees being union members. The following represents our employee breakdowns by region: North America (35%); Latin America (38%); Europe (7%); and Asia (19%). Our global gender makeup is approximately 70% male, 20% female, and 10% unspecified. Approximately 25% of our employees support our Commercial, Research and Development and Corporate functions, while 75% support our global manufacturing. The gender composition of our senior leadership team was 34% female and 66% male, and our Board composition was 22% female and 78% male. 
Currently, racial diversity metrics are only tracked in the U.S. The following table contains aggregate information, as of December 31, 2021, regarding certain self-identified diversity characteristics of our U.S. employees: 

US Diversity
 | Asian | Black/African American | Hispanic | Two or More Races | White | Unspecified
2021 | 6% | 20% | 3% | <1% | 66% | 5% 

The leadership team members have annual goals focused on our ESG priorities, including DE&I, and those priorities are cascaded to their teams as part of our organizational commitment to building a workforce that is diverse and inclusive. We worked over the course of 2021 to continue to develop and refine our internal talent development practices and external recruitment processes, with a focus on equity and improving the racial and gender profile of our candidates across our regions. In 2021, we continued to monitor our progress in increasing representation among these groups through quarterly reviews of our DE&I talent acquisition metrics. These metrics provide visibility into the diversity of our global candidate pools, for internal and external hires, and offer insights into those roles requiring an adjustment of our recruitment strategy to attract underrepresented talent. Through these insights in 2021, we were able to target our recruiting efforts to specific industry and professional organizations dedicated to the advancement of racially diverse candidates and women. We also tasked our external recruiting partners to support our DE&I efforts by presenting us with diverse candidate slates in each of their engagements. Additionally, we worked closely with hiring managers and others involved in local hiring processes to keep the diversity of their candidate pools and interview selection teams top of mind whenever they initiated a hiring process. 
In 2021, we had a significant increase in headcount as a result of the continuation of our capital expansion projects, which had been suspended in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of our plant expansion in Bessemer City, North Carolina, we filled 17 positions in Operations and Maintenance. Of those hired, 94% were men, 6% were women, and 65% were White and 

35% were Black/African American. Going forward, we will use insights from our 2021 global employee survey to take actions to further improve the diversity of our workforce and overall work experience at Livent.
One of the 2021 priorities of our DE&I Committee was to encourage conversations among our employees that would increase cultural awareness and reinforce a spirit of inclusivity. In partnership with our three Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”), the Black Employee Network, Global Women’s Network and Lift Up, we delivered a full year of engaging communications and events, both global and local, across a variety of relevant DE&I topics. 

ERG | Year Formed | Mission | 2021 Highlights 
Black Employee Network | 2020 | To provide a safe space for the Black community and work to ensure Livent is inclusive at all professional levels. | •Joint monthly meetings with Black Employee Network members and allies focused on addressing and raising awareness around relevant topics impacting our work and local communities.
Lift Up | 2021 | To support employees' shared professional development interests. | •Impactful Communications Workshop•Fireside chats exploring the career paths of Livent’s leaders•Leading Diverse Teams Master Class 
Global Women’s Network | 2021 | To support Livent as an inclusive place to work for women. | •Fireside chat exploring topics relevant to women in the workplace (North America)•‘Listen to Understand’ (U.K./Argentina)•Virtual lunches (Asia Pacific) 

We will continue working with our ERGs to review and support their initiatives while also extending the global reach of our programming. 
In Argentina, we piloted a DE&I training for our employees aimed at (i) providing a space for reflection, discussion and training for DE&I-related topics; (ii) identifying unconscious biases and stereotypes impacting our behaviors and decisions; (iii) influencing managers to remain committed to and involved with DE&I issues; and (iv) creating a space to promote the development of inclusive leadership. We plan to use this training as a model for similar training at our other global locations in 2022 and beyond. 
Our DE&I Committee regularly seeks the input of external experts to ensure that we are remaining current in our efforts to challenge and evolve our DE&I strategy. Continuous learning is also encouraged for our members as well as our ERGs and credits are available for those involved to pursue DE&I-focused trainings to benefit their own growth and development as well as impact the organization’s DE&I culture. 
Talent Recruitment, Retention and Development
Over the next decade, the lithium industry is expected to experience increasing demand for product. In response, over the coming years we expect to increase our manufacturing capacity and expand the size of our workforce to ensure that we are identifying, retaining and developing the talent needed to remain competitive. In 2021, we filled 185 jobs across all functions with approximately 60% of such roles representing manufacturing operations (61% were external hires while 39% were filled internally). Our 2021 voluntary turnover rate was 10.2% which represents a decrease of 2.3% from the prior year. 
In 2021, we faced significant competition for talent as candidates requested higher compensation packages, PTO allotments and flexible/remote work arrangements. This highlighted for us the importance of identifying the right talent for our needs, retaining our existing talent to preserve historical knowledge and offering career growth and development opportunities. In 2021, we partnered with engineering, technical, legal and veterans’ organizations to specifically target certain talent pools for a variety of roles. Several of these organizations helped us to get more visibility for our roles among more diverse talent pools. 
In 2021, driven primarily by our expansion efforts, we expanded our succession planning strategy to include top manufacturing jobs. We recognize that continuous learning and development ("L&D") opportunities will be critical to successfully executing our succession plan. For 2022, our global leaders will continue to execute our L&D strategy and support the succession planning review process that we facilitate with our Board annually, the primary goals of which remain to: (i) identify emerging talent and (ii) prioritize the training and development resources needed to support them. 
We continue to foster the development of current and future employees through our development of and participation in an engineering development program for manufacturing and non-plant career opportunities; a university-sponsored employer co-op program; and “emerging talent”-level apprenticeships to increase employability of local and Indigenous resident populations where we operate. In 2021, we hired 34 temporary and full-time employees across all three programs, of which 24% were female and 74% were male. 
Advancing Positive Workplace Culture, Employee Engagement & Recognition 
Maintaining an engaged and invested workforce remains a critical priority at Livent. In a follow-up to the COVID-19-related and employee engagement surveys we conducted in 2020 (all of which were developed and administered internally), in 2021 we hired a third-party consulting firm to launch a broader global employee engagement survey to measure employee sentiment around and satisfaction with working at Livent. Of the 828 eligible employees invited to take the survey, we achieved a 64% participation rate, of whom the majority reported high favorability ratings in the areas of Teamwork, Work Environment, Beliefs and Attitudes and Empowerment. From a DE&I perspective, we also sought feedback on how we can further promote a diverse and inclusive culture and environment. We will use the insights gained from the survey to create global and local action plans for improvement. This is part of our commitment to creating a positive work experience for our employees around the world and to continuously improve in all aspects of our operations. 
In our 2020 employee engagement survey, our employees shared that they wanted us to focus more on recognizing their achievements. Accordingly, in 2021, we reviewed our Go the Extra Mile ("GEM") award program to determine how we could improve recognizing and rewarding excellence shown by employees who reflect our core values. We launched a new employee recognition portal for the GEM program, the Employee Service Award program as well as other employee recognition tools. Through the portal, managers and colleagues can celebrate everyday wins and successes as well as key milestone anniversaries. 
Compensation & Benefits 
We recognize the importance of maintaining competitive compensation and benefits programs to be able to attract and retain the talent needed to meet the demands of our evolving business and industry as well as meet the needs of all our employees. In 2021, we updated our global compensation system so that salary levels are reflective of position responsibilities, better aligned with external market data and capable of attracting and retaining strong talent. This was a significant accomplishment that enables us to administer global compensation decisions more effectively while providing the flexibility necessary to fit varying levels of skills and qualifications as compared against similarly situated companies of our size and industry. The updated compensation structure remains comprised of base salaries, short and long-term incentive structures (based on job level), and individual and business performance-based incentives. We also provide a variety of relocation incentives which, in turn, allows us to attract talent from other markets which, from a DE&I perspective, allows us to reach a more diverse talent pool. 
We have made no major changes to our benefits programs (which vary by country/region and employment classification). Our benefits include tax-deferred savings programs; medical, prescription drug, vision and dental insurance; health savings and flexible spending accounts; life and accident insurance; short and long-term disability insurance; an employee assistance program; paid time off; family leave; and wellness incentives and challenges. We continue to monitor costs year-over-year and make every effort to negotiate benefits packages that are affordable to all eligible employees. Despite a slight increase in some benefit plans due to increased COVID-19 health care costs, we were able to offer reduced costs to our U.S. based employees based on vaccination status. 
Across all our regional locations, we continued to promote a variety of health and wellness programs aimed at heightening awareness around mental health, COVID-19 prevention and maintaining healthy, active lifestyles for our employees and their families. 
Supply Chain Human Capital Management Safeguards 
We are committed to the objective of ensuring there is no modern slavery in our supply chains or in our business. Through our Supplier Code of Conduct and other internal policies, and our supply chain initiatives and processes, we are committed to sourcing components and materials from companies that share our values regarding respect for human rights, integrity and environmental responsibility. We will continue to act ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships to implement and enforce effective systems and controls to prevent modern slavery in our supply chains.
