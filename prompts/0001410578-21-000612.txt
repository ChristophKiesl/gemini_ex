On June 30, 2021, the Company provided notice to all holders of the Company’s 6.0% Convertible Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A (“Series A Preferred Stock”) that, subject to applicable law and in accordance with the Company’s certificate of incorporation, the Company intended to redeem all 206 shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, at a price equal to $25,000 per preferred share plus all accrued and unpaid dividends whether or not declared up to and excluding the Redemption Date of September 1, 2021 (the “Redemption Price”). 
A portion of the 206 outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock were converted into common stock of the Company (“Common Stock”) at the election of each shareholder. The conversion formula for each share of the Series A Preferred Stock was $25,000 plus all accrued but unpaid dividends up to, but excluding, September 1, 2021 divided by the Conversion Price of $1.50. Cash was issued in lieu of fractional shares at a rate of $1.50 multiplied by the fractional share rounded to the nearest cent. 
On October 6, 2021, the Company’s transfer agent completed the redemption, which resulted in the issuance of 2,626,492 new shares of the Company’s common stock, the issuance of 317,500 common shares that were included in Series A Preferred Stock units, and cash redemption payments of $1.3 million. The Company’s total outstanding common shares after redemption was 16,247,898 as of October 6, 2021.

COVID-19 Response
In March 2020, the World Health Organization recognized the novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, as a pandemic. This coronavirus and related variants have significantly impacted both the world and U.S. economies. In response the governments of many cities, counties, states, and other geographic regions have taken preventative or protective actions. In the geographic regions in which the Company operates, state ordered business closures and masking policies have been lifted during 2021; however, some businesses may implement their own policies related to masks and vaccination. While a federal vaccine mandate enforceable by OSHA has been suspended pending developments in litigation, certain customers, or potential customers, may require all construction employees working on a project to be vaccinated. 
Some of the procedures that the Company has implemented to help protect employees from COVID-19 and variant exposure are guidelines for social distancing, office sanitation, hand washing, mask wearing, limited office admittance, and immediate symptom reporting. The Company has provided personal protective equipment and hand-sanitizers to employees, made arrangements for administrative personnel to work from home, and provided access to vaccines to employees. The Company works closely with our customers to limit exposure risk and cooperate with symptom reporting and contact tracing. Construction employees are required to meet all procedures established by our customers in addition to the Company’s own procedures. The Company also followed the paid sick and expanded family and medical leave guidelines set forth in the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which expired on December 31, 2020.
As of September 30, 2021, the Company has not had significant issues with COVID-19 exposure among its employees and most of the Company’s existing customers had resumed projects that were affected by the March 2020 shutdowns. As a result, the Company has increased its employment level of construction personnel as compared to March 31, 2020. Given the uncertainty regarding the spread of this coronavirus and variants, the related financial impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial position, and liquidity or capital resources cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.
Seasonality: Fluctuation of Results
Our revenues and results of operations can and usually are subject to seasonal variations. These variations are the result of weather, customer spending patterns, bidding seasons and holidays. The first quarter of the calendar year is typically the slowest in terms of revenues because inclement weather conditions causes delays in production and customers usually do not plan large projects during that time. While usually better than the first quarter, the second calendar year quarter often has some inclement weather which can cause delays in production, reducing the revenues the Company receives and/or increasing the production costs. The third and fourth calendar year quarters usually are less impacted by weather and usually have the largest number of projects underway. Many projects are completed in the fourth calendar year quarter and revenues are often impacted by customers seeking to either spend their capital budget for the year or scale back projects due to capital budget overruns.
In addition to the fluctuations discussed above, the pipeline industry can be highly cyclical, reflecting variances in capital expenditures in proportion to energy price fluctuations. As a result, our volume of business may be adversely affected by where our customers are in the cycle and thereby their financial condition as to their capital needs and access to capital to finance those needs.
Accordingly, our operating results in any quarter or year may not be indicative of the results that can be expected for any other quarter or any other year. You should read “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Understanding Gross Margins” below for discussions of trends and challenges that may affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Financing Arrangements
On December 16, 2014, the Company’s Nitro subsidiary entered into a 20-year $1.2 million loan agreement with First Bank of Charleston, Inc. (West Virginia) to purchase the office building and property it had previously been leasing for $6,300 monthly. The interest rate on this loan agreement is 4.82% with monthly payments of $7,800.

Paycheck Protection Program Loans
Due to the economic uncertainties created by COVID-19 and limited operating funds available, the Company applied for loans under the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”). On April 15, 2020, Energy Services of America Corporation and subsidiaries C.J. Hughes Construction Company, Contractors Rental Corporation and Nitro Construction Services, Inc. entered into separate PPP notes effective April 7, 2020, with United Bank, Inc. as the lender (“Lender”) in an aggregate principal amount of $13,139,100 pursuant to the PPP (collectively, the “PPP Loan”). In a special meeting held on April 27, 2020, the Board of Directors of the Company unanimously voted to return $3.3 million of the PPP Loan funds after discussing the financing needs of the Company and subsidiaries. That left the Company and subsidiaries with $9.8 million in PPP Loans to fund operations.
The Small Business Administration (“SBA”) has announced, in consultation with the Department of the Treasury, that it will review all loans in excess of $2 million, following the lender’s submission of the borrower’s loan forgiveness application. The SBA will be reviewing a borrower’s required certification that current economic uncertainty at the time of the loan made the PPP loan request necessary to support the ongoing operations of the applicant. Borrowers must make this certification in good faith, taking into account their current business activity and their ability to access other sources of liquidity sufficient to support their ongoing operations in a manner that is not significantly detrimental to the business. The SBA has noted it is unlikely that a public company with substantial market value and access to capital markets will be able to make the required certification in good faith, and such a company should be prepared to demonstrate to the SBA, upon request, the basis for its certification.
During fiscal year 2021, the Company received notice that the SBA had granted forgiveness of the $9.8 million of PPP borrowings and the SBA repaid the lending institution in full. The forgiveness was recorded as “other non-operating income” for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021.
Borrowers must retain PPP documentation for at least 6 years after the date the loan is forgiven or paid in full, and the SBA and SBA Inspector General must be granted these files upon request. The SBA could still revisit its forgiveness decision and determine that the Company does not qualify in whole or in part for loan forgiveness and demand repayment of the loans. In addition, it is unknown what type of penalties could be assessed against the Company if the SBA disagrees with the Company’s certification. Any penalties in addition to the potential repayment of the PPP Loan could negatively impact the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations and prospects.
Backlog/New Business
The Company’s backlog represents contracts for services that have been entered into, but which have not yet been completed. At September 30, 2021, Energy Services had a backlog of $72.2 million of work to be completed on existing contracts. At September 30, 2020, the Company had a backlog of $63.8 million. Due to the timing of Energy Services’ construction contracts and the long-term nature of some of our projects, portions of our backlog work may not be completed in the current fiscal year. Most of the Company’s projects can be completed in a short period of time, typically two to five months. Larger projects usually take seven to eighteen months to be completed. As a rule, work starts shortly after the signing of the contract. 
Types of Contracts
Energy Services’ contracts are usually awarded on a competitive and negotiated basis. While some contracts may be lump sum or time and material projects, most of the work is bid based upon unit prices for various portions of the work with a total agreed-upon price based on estimated units. The actual revenues produced from the project will be dependent upon how accurate the customer estimates are as to the units of the various items.
Raw Materials and Suppliers
The principal raw materials that the Company and its subsidiaries use are metal plate, structural steel, pipe, wire, fittings, and selected engineering equipment such as pumps, valves and compressors. For the most part, the largest portion of these materials are supplied by the customer. Purchases made by the Company are predominately those of a consumable nature, such as small tools, welding rod and environmental supplies. The COVID-19 pandemic has not had a significant impact on the Company’s ability to obtain materials and consumables for projects awarded. We anticipate being able to obtain materials for current work, as well as any raw materials not supplied by our customers, for the foreseeable future. However, the inability of our customers to obtain raw materials may delay projects 

7



from being bid, awarded, started, or completed. Although not a significant impact, the Company has experienced minor delays resulting from the availability of construction equipment and vehicles. 
Industry Factors
Energy Services’ revenues, cash flows and earnings are substantially dependent upon, and affected by, the level of natural gas exploration development activity and the levels of work on existing pipelines as well as the level of demand for our electrical and mechanical services. Such activity and the resulting level of demand for pipeline construction and related services and electrical and mechanical services are directly influenced by many factors over which the Company has no control. Such factors include the market prices of natural gas and electricity, market expectations about future prices, the volatility of such prices, the cost of producing and delivering natural gas and electricity, government regulations and trade restrictions, local and international political and economic conditions, the development of alternate energy sources, changes in the tax code that affect the energy industry, and the long-term effects of worldwide energy conservation measures. Energy Services cannot predict the future level of demand for its construction services, future conditions in the pipeline or electrical construction industry or future pipeline and electrical construction rates.
Competition
The pipeline, electrical, and mechanical construction industries are highly competitive and characterized by high capital and maintenance costs. Contracts are usually awarded through a competitive bid process. The Company believes that operators consider factors such as quality of service, type and location of equipment, or the ability to provide ancillary services. However, price and the ability to complete the project in a timely manner are the primary factors in determining which contractor is awarded a job. There are many regional and national competitors that offer services similar to Energy Services. Certain of the Company’s competitors have greater financial and human resources than Energy Services, which may enable them to compete more efficiently because of price and technology. The Company’s largest competitors are Otis Eastern, Miller Pipeline, Brown Electric, Summit Electric and Apex Pipeline. 
Operating Hazards and Insurance
Energy Services’ operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the pipeline, electrical, and mechanical construction businesses, including, for example, operating equipment in mountainous terrain, people working in deep trenches, people working near large construction equipment, and people working near manufacturing equipment and power sources. These hazards could cause personal injury or death, serious damage to or destruction of property and equipment, and substantial damage to the environment, including damage to producing formations and surrounding areas. Energy Services seeks protection against certain of these risks through insurance, including property casualty insurance on its equipment, commercial general liability and commercial contract indemnity, commercial umbrella and workers’ compensation insurance.
The Company’s insurance coverage for property damage to its equipment is based on estimates of the cost of comparable used equipment to replace the insured property. There is a deductible per occurrence on equipment of $2,500 and $500 for damage to miscellaneous tools. The Company also maintains third party liability insurance, pollution and professional liability insurance, and a commercial umbrella policy. Energy Services believes that it is adequately insured for public liability and property damage to others with respect to its operations. However, such insurance may not be enough to protect Energy Services against liability for all consequences related to its operations.
Government Regulation and Environmental Matters
General. Energy Services’ operations are affected from time to time in varying degrees by political developments and federal, state and local laws and regulations. In particular, natural gas production, operations and the profitability of the gas industry are or have been affected by price controls, taxes and other laws relating to the natural gas industry, by changes in such laws and by changes in administrative regulations. Although significant capital expenditures may be required to comply with such laws and regulations, to date, such compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on the earnings or competitive position of Energy Services. In addition, Energy Services’ operations are vulnerable to risks arising from the numerous laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Energy Services may also be affected by regulations designed to provide benefits to companies engaged in the production of alternative sources of energy, such as solar, wind, and related industries.
Environmental Regulation. Energy Services’ activities are subject to existing federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental quality, pollution control and the preservation of natural resources. Such laws and regulations concern, among 

8



other things, the containment, disposal and recycling of waste materials, and reporting of the storage, use or release of certain chemicals or hazardous substances. Numerous federal and state environmental laws regulate drilling activities and impose liability for discharges of waste or spills, including those in coastal areas. The Company has conducted pipeline construction in or near ecologically sensitive areas, such as wetlands and coastal environments, which are subject to additional regulatory requirements. State and federal legislation also provide special protections to animal and marine life that could be affected by the Company’s activities. In general, under various applicable environmental programs, the Company may potentially be subject to regulatory enforcement action in the form of injunctions, cease and desist orders and administrative, civil and criminal penalties for violations of environmental laws. Energy Services may also be subject to liability for natural resource damages and other civil claims arising out of a pollution event. The Company would be responsible for any pollution event that was determined to be caused by its actions. It has insurance that it believes is adequate to cover any such occurrences.
Environmental regulations that affect Energy Services’ customers also have an indirect impact on Energy Services. Increasingly stringent environmental regulation of the natural gas industry has led to higher drilling costs and a more difficult and lengthier well permitting process.
The primary environmental statutory and regulatory programs that affect Energy Services’ operations include the following: Department of Transportation regulations, regulations set forth by agencies such as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and various environmental agencies including the Environmental Protection Agency, and state and local government agencies.
Health and Safety Matters. Energy Services’ facilities and operations are also governed by various other laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, relating to worker health and workplace safety. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has issued the Hazard Communication Standard. This standard applies to all private-sector employers, including the natural gas exploration and producing industry. The Hazard Communication Standard requires that employers assess their chemical hazards, obtain and maintain certain written descriptions of these hazards, develop a hazard communication program and train employees to work safely with the chemicals on site. Failure to comply with the requirements of the standard may result in administrative, civil and criminal penalties. Energy Services believes that appropriate precautions are taken to protect employees and others from harmful exposure to materials handled and managed at its facilities and that it operates in substantial compliance with all Occupational Safety and Health Act regulations. It is not anticipated that Energy Services will be required to make material expenditures by reason of such health and safety laws and regulations.
Please see “COVID-19 Response” above to see the steps the Company has taken to ensure the health and safety of its workforce as it relates to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Research and Development/Intellectual Property
Energy Services has not made any material expenditure for research and development. Energy Services does not own any patents, trademarks or licenses.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
Energy Services of America believes the Company’s greatest asset is its employees. The Company’s emphasis on the health and safety of its employees is an important factor in maintaining its experienced workforce and attracting new talent. As of September 30, 2021, the Company had 703 employees including 274 full-time non-union employees.
The Company’s non-union construction, management, and administrative employees are all eligible to participate in the Company paid health, vision, dental, life, prescription, and long-term disability insurance plans. The Company also provides employee paid supplemental life and accident insurance plans. To encourage employees to keep up with routine medical care and participate in its wellness program, the Company funds a Health Reimbursement Account for participating employees. To help employees cover medical expenses pre-tax, the Company offers employees a Flexible Spending Account. The Company also offers employees a 401(k)-retirement plan with a Company match.
The Company’s union construction workers are represented by various collective bargaining units that provide health and welfare and retirement plans to their members. The Company’s top priority is the safety of our construction employees. The Company’s experienced safety department ensures that employees have the Company and customer required safety training before starting a project. 

9



Daily and weekly safety meetings at project sites help employees remain aware of potential hazards. Periodic internal and third-party safety audits are performed to help ensure that the Company’s and customer’s safety procedures are followed.
Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company had customers that delayed or cancelled projects due to the uncertainty in the economy and health concerns. During this time, the Company attempted to keep as many of its employees working as possible by moving crews to different projects or shifting work responsibilities. The Company also worked closely to accommodate employees’ request to use the Families First Coronavirus Relief Act and the Family Medical Leave Act.
