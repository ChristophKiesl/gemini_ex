General
The Children's Place, Inc. is the largest pure-play children's specialty apparel retailer in North America. We sell apparel, accessories, footwear, and other items for children. We design, contract to manufacture, sell at retail and wholesale, and license to sell trend right, high quality merchandise at value prices, the substantial majority of which is under the proprietary “The Children's Place”, "Place", and "Baby Place" brand names. Our stores offer a friendly and convenient shopping environment. The Children's Place has differentiated departments and serves the wardrobe needs of girls and boys (sizes 4-16), toddler girls and boys (sizes 12 mos.-5T) and baby (sizes 0-18 mos.). Stores are visually merchandised by size segment. Our merchandise 
3

is also available online at www.childrensplace.com. Our customers are able to shop online and receive the same merchandise available in our physical stores, in addition to merchandise which is exclusive to our e-commerce site.
The Children's Place was founded in 1969. The Company became publicly traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market in 1997. As of January 28, 2017, we operated 1,039 stores throughout North America as well as our online store. During Fiscal 2016, we opened four stores and closed 34 stores. During Fiscal 2015, we opened four stores and closed 32 stores. Also, in Fiscal 2016, we continued to expand into international markets through territorial agreements with franchisees, and, in our wholesale business, we continued to add accounts and expand categories and distribution to our customers.
 Jane Elfers, our President and Chief Executive Officer, established four key strategic initiatives that are delivering sales and margin:

1. | Superior Product - Product will always be our number one priority. We continue to significantly differentiate and upgrade the look of our merchandise. We strive to ensure that we have the right product, in the right channels of distribution, at the right time. In addition to apparel, we offer a full line of accessories and footwear so busy moms can quickly and easily put together head-to-toe outfits. Our design, merchandising, sourcing, and planning teams have made great progress moving our product forward while at the same time balancing fashion and fashion basics with more frequent, wear-now deliveries. 


2. | Business Transformation through Technology - Our business transformation through technology initiative has two key components: inventory management and digital transformation. With respect to inventory management, the insights from the implementation of our assortment planning, allocation, replenishment, order planning, and forecasting tools are delivering significant gross margin and inventory productivity benefits.

Mobile is the cornerstone of our digital strategy and when designing and developing our digital experience, our starting point is to optimize the mobile experience. Our digital transformation is comprised of three key initiatives: omni-channel initiatives; architectural upgrades; and customer segmentation efforts. During Fiscal 2016, we piloted our first omni-channel initiative, reserve on line, pick up in store ("ROPIS"), and re-launched our loyalty program in conjunction with our new private label credit card program. Our loyalty members and private label credit card holders represent our most loyal customer segment, exhibiting a great visit frequency and average spend.

3. | Growth through Alternate Channels of Distribution - We have established new channels of distribution, including international and wholesale distribution. We continued our international expansion program during Fiscal 2016 with our franchise partners adding 48 additional international points of distribution (stores, shop in shops, e-commerce site) bringing our total count to 150 points of distribution operating in 17 countries. We also launched our brand on the Tmall e-commerce platform in the China market. In our wholesale business, we launched our replenishment program with Amazon and expanded categories of merchandise available for distribution to our customers. 


4. | Fleet Optimization - We constantly evaluate our store fleet as part of our fleet optimization initiative. To improve store productivity we plan to close approximately 300 stores through fiscal 2020, which includes 34 stores closed during Fiscal 2016, 32 stores closed during Fiscal 2015, 35 stores closed in Fiscal 2014 and 41 stores closed during fiscal 2013. 

Overlaying these four strategic initiatives is talent. Talent ultimately defines our success, and over the past several years we have built a best-in-class management team. This talented team is a significant competitive advantage for our Company.
Underlying these growth initiatives is a commitment to operational excellence. The Company’s commitment to operational excellence includes disciplined expense management, improving store operations, and combined with our finance, compliance, legal and human resources areas, forms the strong base necessary to support our long-term growth initiatives.
Segment Reporting
In accordance with FASB ASC 280--Segment Reporting, we report segment data based on geography: The Children’s Place U.S. and The Children’s Place International.  Each segment includes an e-commerce business located at www.childrensplace.com.  Included in The Children’s Place U.S. segment are our U.S. and Puerto Rico based stores and revenue from our U.S. based wholesale business. Included in The Children's Place International segment are our Canadian based stores, revenue from the Company's Canada wholesale business, as well as revenue from international franchisees. We measure our segment profitability based on operating income, defined as income before interest and taxes.  Net sales and direct costs are recorded by each segment.  Certain inventory procurement functions such as production and design as well as corporate overhead, including executive management, finance, real estate, human resources, legal, and information technology services are managed by The Children’s Place U.S. segment.  Expenses related to these functions, including depreciation and amortization, are allocated to The Children’s Place International segment based primarily on net sales.  The assets related to 
4

these functions are not allocated.  We periodically review these allocations and adjust them based upon changes in business circumstances.  Net sales to external customers are derived from merchandise sales and we have no major customers that account for more than 10% of our net sales. The following tables show by segment our net sales and operating income for the past three fiscal years, and total assets as of January 28, 2017 and January 30, 2016:

Key Capabilities
Our objective is to deliver high quality, value priced, trend right assortments for children. Our assortment offers one stop shopping across apparel, footwear, accessories, and other items for children. Our strategies to achieve this objective are as follows:
Merchandising Strategy
Our merchandising strategy is to offer a compelling and coordinated assortment of apparel, footwear, accessories, and other items for children that encourage our customer to purchase head to toe outfitting for their children. We build our deliveries by season and flow new product to our stores monthly. 
5

High Quality and Value Pricing
We believe that offering high quality, trend right, age appropriate merchandise under “The Children's Place” and "Place" brand names at value prices is our competitive advantage. We design and merchandise our branded apparel, footwear, and accessories to offer a compelling value to our customers.
Brand Image
We focus on strengthening our brand image and customer loyalty for “The Children's Place” by:

• | Consistently offering high quality and age appropriate products and trend right fashion at value prices in a friendly and convenient shopping environment;


• | Providing coordinated outfits and accessories for our customers' lifestyle needs;


• | Creating strong merchandising and visual presentations to create a compelling in-store experience;


• | Emphasizing our great value and fashion in marketing visuals to convey a consistent brand message;


• | Leveraging our customer database to frequently communicate with our customers and tailor promotions to maximize customer satisfaction;


• | Using our MyPLACE Loyalty Rewards Program and private label credit card to drive customer engagement; and


• | Providing exclusive assortments in our e-commerce business to further expand the breadth of our offerings and brand recognition.

Low-Cost Global Sourcing
We design, source and contract to manufacture the substantial majority of The Children's Place branded products. We believe that this is essential to assuring the consistency and quality of our merchandise, as well as our ability to deliver value to our customers. We have strong relationships with our most important vendors. Through these relationships and our extensive knowledge of low cost sourcing on a global scale, we are able to offer our customers high-quality products at value prices. We maintain a network of sourcing offices globally in order to manage our vendors efficiently and respond to changing business needs effectively. Our sourcing offices in Hong Kong, Shanghai, India, Bangladesh, and Vietnam, and contract associates in greater Africa, Cambodia, Indonesia and other countries in which we source products, give us access to a wide range of vendors and allow us to work to maintain and/or reduce our current merchandise costs by capitalizing on new sourcing opportunities while maintaining our product quality.
Merchandising Process
The strong collaboration between our experienced cross functional teams in design, merchandising, sourcing and planning have enabled us to build our brand. 
Design
The design team gathers information from trends, color services, research and trade shows. 
Merchandising
Each quarter we develop seasonal merchandising strategies. 
Planning and Allocation
The planning and allocation organization works collaboratively with the merchandising, finance, and global sourcing teams to develop seasonal sales and margin plans to support our financial objectives and merchandising strategies. Further, this team plans the flow of inventory to ensure that we are adequately supporting floor sets and key promotional periods. Special attention is paid to our store types, as they differ in capacity and layout. 
Production, Quality Assurance and Social Compliance
During Fiscal 2016, we engaged over 100 independent vendors located primarily in greater Asia. We continue to pursue global sourcing opportunities to support our inventory needs and to seek to control merchandise costs. 
We contract for the manufacture of the substantial majority of the products we sell. We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. Increases in manufacturing costs negatively impact our business, and we seek to manage the risks of operational difficulties posed by contract manufacturers, including the availability of adequate manufacturing capacity, errors in complying with our product specifications, insufficient quality control processes, failures to meet production deadlines, worker and environmental safety concerns, and political and social instability in certain regions.
During Fiscal 2016, we purchased approximately 98% of our total merchandise directly without the aid of third party commissioned buying agents. We source from a well-diversified sourcing base including approximately 21% of our total goods 
6

from China, approximately 20% from Bangladesh, approximately 15% from Indonesia and approximately 11% from Vietnam. No other country accounted for 10% or more of our production. 
In addition to our quality assurance procedures, we administer a responsible sourcing program that seeks to protect our company and enhance our brand by continually providing guidance in-line with industry standards to our global vendors in their efforts to provide safe and otherwise appropriate working conditions for their employees. These efforts are part of an ongoing process to encourage the continued improvement by our vendors of factory working conditions, and ultimately, the lives of their employees who make our product. This is achieved through encouraging our vendors to comply with local legal regulations, as well as industry standards, and socially responsible business practices. The components of our program are as follows:

• | Vendor Code of Conduct - By formally acknowledging and agreeing to our code of conduct, our vendors affirm their commitment to integrate compliance with local law and industry standards into their manufacturing and sourcing practices. Topics covered by these standards include child labor, involuntary or forced labor, slavery and human trafficking, coercion or harassment, discrimination, health and safety, compensation, working hours, freedom of association, environment, unauthorized subcontracting, security practices, and undue influence of independent auditors.


• | Ongoing Auditing Program - We administer a factory auditing program staffed by our internal sourcing team and/or professional third party auditors, who visit factory locations at least once a year on average to provide insight into general factory working conditions and other production characteristics in all factories that manufacture The Children's Place products. With this information, we can understand factories’ challenges, help the factories identify non-compliance with industry standards, and offer guidance on corrective action plans for the factories to achieve better compliance. All factories that are approved for The Children’s Place production must undergo a social compliance audit prior to any orders being placed and at least once annually thereafter. 


• | Corrective Action Plans - Following each social audit, a corrective action plan outlines any areas of non-compliance identified through the factory audit. Each factory is expected to develop a remediation plan and remediation timeline for any non-compliance found. Through follow-up social audits, we assess a factory’s progress in achieving its remediation plan. It is our preference to work with factories to remediate and achieve compliance rather than terminate our relationship; however, where there is serious non-compliance of critical standards, repeated non-compliance, or failure of the factories to invest in continued improvement, we reserve the right to terminate our relationship. 


• | Vendor Factory Engagement - Our responsible sourcing team provides guidance and training to vendors and factories in order to help vendors and factories improve compliance with industry standards. Our goal is to serve as a resource for vendors and factories as they develop and strengthen their capabilities to better manage the working conditions of their employees.


• | Worker Education and Community Investment - In some cases, we will provide support to factories that wish to implement worker training and community investment initiatives. We have encouraged factories to invest in health and nutrition education for their workers, which we have financially supported in factories in Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, and Vietnam.

Additionally, under our responsible sourcing program we monitor changes in local laws and other conditions (e.g., worker safety, workers' right of association, and political and social instability) in the countries from which we source in order to identify and assess potential risks to our sourcing capabilities.
Company Stores
The following section highlights various store information for The Children's Place operated stores as of January 28, 2017.
Existing Stores
As of January 28, 2017, we operated a total of 1,039 The Children's Place stores in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico, most of which are clustered in and around major metropolitan areas and our stores at www.childrensplace.com. In addition, our six international partners operated 150 international points of distribution in 17 countries. We operate 644 stores located in malls, 219 in strip centers, 135 in outlet centers, and 41 in street locations. The following table sets forth the number of stores in the U.S., Puerto Rico and Canada as of the current and prior fiscal year end:
7


 | Number of Stores
Location | January 28, 2017 | January 30, 2016
United States | 899 | | 926
Canada | 129 | 132 
Puerto Rico | 11 | 11 
Total Stores | 1,039 | 1,069 

Store Concepts 
At The Children's Place, our store concepts consist of multiple formats ranging in size from 4,100 to 7,100 square feet, which have evolved over time in response to market trends. We try to create an open and brightly lit environment for customers.  Our stores typically feature white fixtures to ensure the product is the focal point, using color to brand and create shop identifiers, and are strategically placed within each market.
Fleet Optimization
As part of our store fleet optimization initiative, we plan to close approximately 300 stores through fiscal 2020, which includes the 34 stores we closed during Fiscal 2016, the 32 stores we closed during Fiscal 2015, the 35 stores we closed in Fiscal 2014 and the 41 stores we closed during fiscal 2013. Over the past four fiscal years, we have reduced our total store square footage from 5.2 million to 4.9 million. These closures are resulting in improved profitability and operating margin accretion due to sales transfer, low cost of exit, and the elimination of the underperforming locations. In those markets where we have closed stores, we are seeing the neighboring stores along with the e-commerce business become more productive from both a Comparable Retail Sales and profitability perspective. These results further our commitment to executing this optimization program while dramatically slowing down new store openings.
We continuously review the performance of our store fleet. We base our decisions to open, close or remodel stores on a variety of factors, including lease terms, landlord negotiations, market dynamics, and projected financial performance. When assessing whether to close a store, we also consider remaining lease life and current financial performance.
Internet Sales (“e-commerce”)
Our U.S. and International segments each include an e-commerce business located at www.childrensplace.com and digital growth remains one of our top strategic priorities. We are committed to delivering a best in class, end-to-end user experience including product assortment and website design operations, fulfillment, and customer service. We are further committed to delivering these experiences to our customers when, where and how they are looking to access the brand, accounting for cross-channel behavior, growth of mobile devices, and the growing interest in our brand from international consumers. As such, we will continue to make required investments in back-end infrastructure, as well as front-end technology to deliver on this commitment. We believe that the critical investments made in areas such as e-commerce infrastructure and mobile optimization as well as additional front-end website features have improved our customers' experience.
International Franchises and Wholesale
We continued our international expansion program with our franchise partners adding 48 additional international points of distribution (stores, shop in shops, e-commerce site) during Fiscal 2016 bringing our total count to 150 points of distribution operating in 17 countries. We also launched our brand on the Tmall e-commerce platform in the China market. We generate revenues from our franchisees from the sale of products and sales royalties. In our wholesale business, in Fiscal 2016 we launched our replenishment program with Amazon to complement our fashion wholesale business with Amazon and expanded categories of merchandise available for distribution to our wholesale customers. 
Store Operations
The Children's Place U.S. store operations are organized by geographical region. We employ two U.S. Zone Vice Presidents and one Canadian Vice President who oversee our operations of both Place and Outlet stores and to whom regional directors report. A regional director oversees a number of district managers resident within each region. Our stores are staffed by store managers and sales associates, with additional part-time associates hired to support seasonal needs. Our store managers spend a high percentage of their time on the store's selling floor providing direction, motivation, and development to store personnel. To maximize selling productivity, our teams emphasize greeting, replenishment, presentation standards, procedures, and controls. In order to motivate our store management, we offer a monthly incentive compensation plan that awards bonuses for achieving certain financial goals.

Seasonality
Our business is subject to seasonal influences, with heavier concentrations of sales during the back-to-school and holiday seasons. Our first fiscal quarter results are dependent upon sales during the period leading up to the Easter holiday, third fiscal quarter results are dependent upon back-to-school sales, and our fourth fiscal quarter results are dependent upon sales during the holiday season. The business is also subject to seasonal shifts due to unseasonable weather conditions. The following table shows the quarterly distribution, as a percentage of the full year, of net sales and operating income (loss):

 | First Quarter | | Second Quarter | | Third Quarter | Fourth Quarter
Quarterly net sales as a percentage of full year | | | | | | 
Fiscal 2016 | 23.5 | % | | 20.8 | % | 26.5 | % | 29.2 | %
Fiscal 2015 | 23.5 | % | | 21.2 | % | 26.4 | % | 28.9 | %
Quarterly operating income (loss) as a percentage of full year | | | | | | 
Fiscal 2016 | 26.9 | % | | (2.0 | )% | 42.1 | % | 33.0 | %
Fiscal 2015 | 25.8 | % | | (22.3 | )% | 64.0 | % | 32.6 | %

For more information regarding the seasonality of our business, refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Quarterly Results and Seasonality. 
Marketing
The Children's Place is a well-recognized brand, with a trend right offering and a compelling value proposition. Our direct marketing program utilizes both on and off-line channels.
During the third quarter of Fiscal 2016, we re-launched our customer loyalty program in conjunction with our new private label credit card program. At the end of Fiscal 2016, our MyPLACE Rewards loyalty program had approximately 8.0 million members who accounted for approximately 74% of sales. Our private label credit card is issued to our customers for use exclusively at The Children's Place stores and online at www.childrensplace.com, and credit is extended to such customers through a third-party financial institution on a non-recourse basis to us. Approximately 12% of our net sales during Fiscal 2016 were transacted using our private label credit card. We promote affinity and loyalty through our marketing programs by utilizing specialized incentive programs. 
Distribution
In the United States, we own and operate a 700,000 square foot distribution center in Alabama, which supports both U.S. retail store operations and U.S. e-commerce operations. In Canada, we operate a 95,000 square foot distribution center in Ontario for our Canadian retail store operations. We also use a third-party provider to support our Canadian e-commerce operations. On occasion, we may utilize additional facilities to support seasonal warehousing needs. We also use a third-party provider of warehousing and logistics services in Malaysia to support our international franchise business.
Competition
The children's apparel, footwear, and accessories retail markets are highly competitive. Our primary competitors are specialty stores and mass merchandisers, including Target Corporation and GapKids, babyGap and Old Navy (each of which is a division of The Gap, Inc.), The Gymboree Corporation, Justice (a division of The Ascena Retail Group, Inc.), Carter's, Inc., J.C. Penney Company, Inc., Kohl's Corporation and other department stores, as well as other discount stores such as Walmart Stores, Inc. We also compete with regional retail chains, catalog companies and Internet retailers. One or more of our competitors are present in substantially all of the areas in which we have stores.
Trademarks and Service Marks
“The Children's Place,” “Place,” and “Baby Place", and certain other marks have been registered as trademarks and/or service marks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in Canada and other foreign countries. The registration of the trademarks and the service marks may be renewed to extend the original registration period indefinitely, provided the marks are still in use. We intend to continue to use and protect our trademarks and service marks and maintain their registrations. We have also registered our trademarks in other countries where we source our products and where we have established and anticipate establishing franchising operations. We believe our trademarks and service marks have received broad recognition and are of significant value to our business.

Government Regulation
We are subject to extensive federal, state, provincial, and local laws and regulations affecting our business, including product testing and safety, consumer protection, privacy, truth-in-advertising, accessibility, customs, wage and hour laws and regulations, and zoning and occupancy ordinances that regulate retailers generally and/or govern the promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of retail stores and e-commerce.  We also are subject to similar international laws and regulations affecting our business. We believe that we are in material compliance with these laws and regulations.

Each of our product styles currently covered by the CPSIA and the CCPSA are appropriately tested to meet current standards.  
Virtually all of our merchandise is manufactured by third-party factories located outside of the United States.  These products are imported and are subject to U.S. and Canadian customs laws, which impose tariffs, anti-dumping and countervailing duties on certain imported products, including textiles, apparel, footwear, and accessories.  We currently are not restricted by any such duties in the operation of our business.  
Employees
As of January 28, 2017, we had approximately 15,500 employees, approximately 1,500 of whom were based at our corporate offices and distribution centers. Approximately 2,200 were full-time store employees and approximately 11,800 were part-time and seasonal store employees. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good.
