Item 1.    Business.
 

We are a science based direct to consumer (DTC) health company offering products and services focused on aging biology wellness and longevity. Our program is based on the book the Kaufmann Protocol® authored by our co-founder Dr. Sandra Kaufmann, M.D., and on identifying and offering individual specific services, recommendations and treatments designed to improve our customers’ lifespan and health-span. Whereas lifespan represents the total number of years we live, and health-span is how many of those years we remain healthy, active, energetic and free from disease. Our goal is to use science and technology, current and emerging treatments to lengthen lifespan and maximize health-span.
 
We operate a DTC sales model, which means we market our products directly to our target consumers. We currently sell our book, the Kaufmann Protocol online, we offer, the Kaufmann Protocol, a mobile application on the iOS platform, and plan to commercialize and market a line of products, including our own branded molecular agents, health and wellness testing kits and services, as well as published and multimedia content. 
 

Kaufmann Protocol
 
In the book The Kaufmann Protocol, Dr. Kaufmann explores the multifactorial causes of aging and presents strategies where aging is curtailed, these strategies are hereinafter referred to as the “Protocol”.

At the most basic level organisms age because their component cells age, the Protocol addresses the seven known theories, or the “Kaufmann Seven Tenets” of cellular aging into tenets, which are: Information Systems (DNA), Cellular Energy, Cellular Pathways, Quality Control, Immune System, Individual Cells and Waste Management.
 

1. | Information Systems (DNA). DNA is our information depot. Issues with aging in this category include epigenetic modification, accumulation of DNA damage, and telomeric integrity. Epigenetic modification encompasses changes to the “packaging” of the DNA, including methylation, histone modification and the like. Telomeres, the caps or ends of DNA, are known to shorten over time and are broadly correlated to the length of a life.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Cellular Energy. Mitochondria, cellular organelles, serve as our energy source. These organelles are rate limiting over time as their output declines, second to either damage from free radicals or simply declining availability of raw materials. 
3. | Cellular Pathways. The pathways are our aging or anti-aging pathways, such as the AMP Kinase, the Sirtuin or the mTOR pathways. These are like enzymatic dominoes that can either direct your cells and tissues to age or not age. 
4. | Quality Control. This category includes the DNA and Protein Repair mechanisms, which are key to repairing the ongoing damage inside your cells. As you get older and the damage becomes more extensive, these mechanisms get a bit stressed. This category also includes intracellular autophagy, a mechanism for cellular recycling. 
5. | Immune System. The cells that compose the immune system constitute your security system. Over time, unfortunately, this system becomes problematic and causes the body to be in a state of chronic and systemic inflammation. In addition, the failing immune system causes an increase in infection and cancer. 
6. | Individual Cells. Depending on the lifespan of particular cells, some live for days while some last a life time, their particular needs can be specialized. Some require an increased pool of nutrients, while others have more issues with trash accumulation. 
7. | Waste Management. Every cell has requirements for living, such as oxygen and glucose. Unfortunately, these can lead to increased aging. As an example, glucose forms molecular complexes called Advanced Glycation Endproducts (AGEs), which are very destructive. As well, longer lived cells produce cellular waste, called lipofuscin, that accumulates and eventually causes space issues. 

Our Products
 
Based on the Seven Tenets, the Protocol has identified a series of molecular agents, certain of which are dietary supplements and or prescription medications that can be used to combat aging and improve health-span. Many of the molecular agents we recommend have been used in eastern medicine for thousands of years based on their curative effects, and are generally available, none of which are proprietary to us. We do however identify and present individualized and in certain instances dosage specific individualized recommendations, based on algorithmic outputs of our software, based on individual biology, diet, lifestyle and desired outcomes. Three generalized, and our most popular regimens are:

· | The Panacea; The General Strategy 
--+------------------------------------------------
· | The Sweet Tooth; The Anti-Glycation Strategy 
· | The Ache Remedy; The Anti-Inflammatory Strategy

 
We do not currently offer the molecular agents that makeup our Strategies. Our designed strategies, include a regimen of molecular agents, which currently must be sourced from third parties, however it is our plan to source and market the products which make up our proprietary strategies under our own brand, the Kaufmann Protocol, which we plan to offer through our website and mobile application.
 
Our Mobile Application
 
The mobile application guides users through a specific set of questions relating to your age and aging concerns and will use our proprietary algorithm to design a regimen scientifically calculated to achieve optimum results addressing your needs, based on the users’ responses. We expect our mobile and web applications will serve as a sales tool, for initial sales, reorders and as a means to connect with our customers to track their progress, deliver relevant and meaningful content and serve as a platform for future growth and expansion of our DTC product offerings.

Fitwell App Acquisition
 
On May 29, 2021, we entered into a binding letter of intent (the “LOI”) with Fitwell Limited a company organized under the laws of the United Kingdom (“Fitwell”) to acquire Fitwell and its fitness and nutrition app, that same letter of intent expired, pursuant to the terms therein on July 29, 2021. Subsequent thereto, on September 24, 2021, we entered into a contingent Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Fitwell pursuant to which we have agreed to acquire one hundred percent of issued and outstanding shares of Fitwell for a purchase price of $1,000,000 payable in cash and our common stock. Worldwide Strategies will pay an aggregate cash purchase price of $500,000 and will issue shares of the Registrant’s common stock valued at $500,000 with the price per share being the price that we price our shares for sale in our planned Regulation A+ offering (“the Offering”), notwithstanding, the price of the offering, the price per share of the shares to be issued to Fitwell shall not exceed a per share price of $0.40. The acquisition is contingent on our conducting a Regulation A+ offering, wherein we raise a minimum of $2,000,000 (the “Offering”). The Fitwell shareholders will receive the cash component of our purchase price from the proceeds of our Offering and the shares to be issued shall be issued subsequent to the closing of the Offering. In connection with the Buyer’s acquisition of the Business, the Buyer and the Seller will enter into customary transition services and other ancillary arrangements. The Agreement also contains representations, warranties, covenants, indemnification obligations and closing conditions which are customary for transactions of this nature. The Buyer and the Seller have the right to terminate the Agreement prior to the closing under certain circumstances, including, without limitation: (i) by mutual written consent; (ii) by either the Buyer or the Seller if the closing has not occurred on or before the date that is 90 days following the qualification of the Registrant’s offering by the Securities and Exchange Commission; (iii) by the Seller if the Offering does not raise a minimum of $2,000,000in proceeds or (iv) by either the Buyer or the Seller if a material breach occurs and is not cured within the required amount of time.
The Fitwell Personal Fitness Coach app is an Artificial intelligence (“AI”) powered fit-tech mobile application that optimizes health and fitness through a state of the art mobile app and chatbot. Fitwell has more than 1.9 million registered users globally and been selected “Best of PlayStore” and “Top Developer” by Google; featured among best apps by Apple.

Corporate History
 
Worldwide Strategies Incorporated ("we", "us", or "our") was originally incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 6, 1998 as Boyd Energy Corporation, on July 17, 2001 the corporation’s name was changed to Barnett Energy Corporation and on June 15, 2005, pursuant to a business combination with Worldwide Business Solutions Incorporated, a Colorado corporation ("WBSI"), WBSI became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company and the corporation’s name was changed to Worldwide Strategies Inc. On July 31, 2007, we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Centric Rx, Inc., a Nevada corporation which was merged out of existence in connection with the share exchange. We subsequently ceased operations in 2015 and the Company has fully impaired all assets since the shutdown of its operations in 2015 and recorded the effects of this impairment as part of its discontinued operations. As a result of our discontinuation of operations, on August 1, 2017 and January 2, 2018, respectively our two subsidiaries were dissolved for non-payment of annual fees. Therefore, Worldwide Business Solutions Incorporated, a Colorado corporation and Worldwide Business Solutions Limited, a United Kingdom corporation, a subsidiary of Worldwide Business Solutions Incorporated, are no longer subsidiaries of the Company.
 
On May 7, 2019, the Eighth Judicial District Court of Nevada appointed Small Cap Compliance, LLC (“Custodian”) as custodian for Worldwide Strategies Inc., and on May 8, 2019, the Custodian appointed an executive officer and board member, who on July 10, 2019, filed a certificate of reinstatement of WWSG with the state of Nevada. On October 16, 2019, the Eighth Judicial District Court of Nevada discharged Small Cap Compliance, LLC as custodian for Worldwide Strategies Inc. On July 10, 2019 the Custodian appointed board member and sole executive officer, appointed a new member to the board of directors and subsequently resigned from the board and as the company’s sole executive officer. The board of directors subsequently appointed the current management team, who are reorganizing the business as a health technology company.
