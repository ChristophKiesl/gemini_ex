Item 1. Business.
General Development of Business
On April 4, 2017, Liberty Interactive Corporation, now known as Qurate Retail, Inc. ("Qurate Retail"), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (as amended, the "reorganization agreement" and the transactions contemplated thereby, the "Transactions") with General Communication, Inc. ("GCI"), an Alaska corporation, and Liberty Interactive LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Qurate Retail ("LI LLC"). Pursuant to the reorganization agreement, GCI amended and restated its articles of incorporation (which resulted in GCI being renamed GCI Liberty, Inc. ("GCI Liberty")) and effected a reclassification and auto conversion of its common stock. Following these events, Qurate Retail acquired GCI Liberty on March 9, 2018 through a reorganization in which certain Qurate Retail interests, assets and liabilities attributed to its Ventures Group (following the reattribution by Qurate Retail of certain assets and liabilities from its Ventures Group to its QVC Group) were contributed to GCI Liberty in exchange for a controlling interest in GCI Liberty (the "contribution"). Qurate Retail and LI LLC contributed to GCI Liberty their entire equity interests in Liberty Broadband Corporation ("Liberty Broadband"), Charter Communications, Inc. ("Charter"), and LendingTree, Inc. ("LendingTree"), the Evite, Inc. ("Evite") operating business and other assets and liabilities (collectively, "HoldCo"), in exchange for (a) the issuance to LI LLC of a number of shares of GCI Liberty Class A common stock and a number of shares of GCI Liberty Class B common stock equal to the number of outstanding shares of Qurate Retail's Series A Liberty Ventures common stock and Qurate Retail's Series B Liberty Ventures common stock on March 9, 2018, respectively, (b) cash and (c) the assumption of certain liabilities by GCI Liberty.
The contribution was treated as a reverse acquisition under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP"). For accounting purposes, HoldCo is considered to have acquired GCI Liberty in the contribution based, among other considerations, upon the fact that in exchange for the contribution of HoldCo, Qurate Retail received a controlling interest in the combined company of GCI Liberty.
Following the contribution and acquisition of GCI Liberty, Qurate Retail effected a tax free separation of its controlling interest in the combined company, GCI Liberty, to the holders of Qurate Retail's Liberty Ventures common stock in full redemption of all outstanding shares of such stock (the "HoldCo Split-Off"), in which each outstanding share of Qurate Retail's Series A Liberty Ventures common stock was redeemed for one share of GCI Liberty Class A common stock and each outstanding share of Qurate Retail's Series B Liberty Ventures common stock was redeemed for one share of GCI Liberty Class B common stock. In July 2018, the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") completed its review of the HoldCo Split-Off and informed Qurate Retail that it agreed with the nontaxable characterization of the transactions. Qurate Retail received an Issue Resolution Agreement from the IRS documenting this conclusion.
On May 10, 2018, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of March 22, 2018, GCI Liberty completed its reincorporation into Delaware by merging with its wholly owned Delaware subsidiary, which was the surviving corporation (the “Reincorporation Merger”). References to GCI Liberty or the Company prior to May 10, 2018 refer to GCI Liberty, Inc., an Alaska corporation and references to GCI Liberty after May 10, 2018 refer to GCI Liberty, Inc., a Delaware corporation.
Following the HoldCo Split‑Off, Qurate Retail and GCI Liberty operate as separate, publicly traded companies, and neither have any stock ownership, beneficial or otherwise, in the other. In connection with the HoldCo Split‑Off, Qurate Retail, Liberty Media Corporation ("Liberty Media") (or its subsidiary) and GCI Liberty entered into certain agreements in order to govern certain of the ongoing relationships among the companies after the HoldCo Split‑Off and to provide for an orderly transition. These agreements include an indemnification agreement, a reorganization agreement, a services agreement, a facilities sharing agreement and a tax sharing agreement.
The reorganization agreement provides for, among other things, the principal corporate transactions (including the internal restructuring) required to effect the Transactions and certain conditions to and provisions governing the relationship between GCI Liberty and Qurate Retail (for accounting purposes a related party of GCI Liberty) with respect to and resulting from the Transactions. The tax sharing agreement provides for the allocation and indemnification of tax liabilities and benefits between Qurate Retail and GCI Liberty and other agreements related to tax matters. Pursuant to the tax sharing agreement, GCI Liberty has agreed to indemnify Qurate Retail for taxes and tax-related losses resulting from the Holdco Split-Off to the extent such taxes or tax-related losses (i) result primarily from, individually or in the aggregate, the breach of certain restrictive covenants made by GCI Liberty (applicable to actions or failures to act by GCI Liberty and its subsidiaries following the completion of the Holdco Split-Off), or (ii) result from Section 355(e) of the Internal Revenue Code applying to the Holdco 
I-1

Split-Off as a result of the Holdco Split-Off being part of a plan (or series of related transactions) pursuant to which one or more persons acquire, directly or indirectly, a 50-percent or greater interest (measured by vote or value) in the stock of GCI Liberty (or any successor corporation). Pursuant to the services agreement, Liberty Media provides GCI Liberty with general and administrative services including legal, tax, accounting, treasury and investor relations support. See below for a description of an amendment to the services agreement entered into in December 2019. Under the facilities sharing agreement, GCI Liberty shares office space with Liberty Media and related amenities at its corporate headquarters. GCI Liberty reimburses Liberty Media for direct, out‑of‑pocket expenses incurred by Liberty Media in providing these services and for costs negotiated semi‑annually. 

In December 2019, the Company entered into an amendment to the services agreement with Liberty Media in connection with Liberty Media’s entry into a new employment arrangement with Gregory B. Maffei, the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer. Under the amended services agreement, components of his compensation will either be paid directly to him by each of the Company, Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc., Liberty Broadband, and Qurate Retail (collectively, the “Service Companies”) or reimbursed to Liberty Media, in each case, based on allocations among Liberty Media and the Service Companies set forth in the amended services agreement, currently set at 14% for the Company. The new agreement between Liberty Media and Mr. Maffei provides for a five year employment term which began on January 1, 2020 and ends December 31, 2024, with an aggregate annual base salary of $3 million (with no contracted increase), an aggregate one-time cash commitment bonus of $5 million, an aggregate annual target cash performance bonus of $17 million, aggregate annual equity awards of $17.5 million and aggregate equity awards granted in connection with his entry into his new agreement of $90 million (the “upfront awards”). 
We refer to the combination of GCI Holdings, LLC (“GCI Holdings”), non controlling interests in Liberty Broadband, Charter and LendingTree, a controlling interest in Evite, and certain other assets and liabilities as “GCI Liberty”, the “Company”, “us”, “we” and “our.”

Narrative Description of Business
The following table identifies the Company's more significant subsidiaries and minority investments:
Consolidated Subsidiaries
GCI Holdings, LLC
Evite, Inc.

Equity Method Investments
Liberty Broadband Corporation (Nasdaq: LBRDA; LBRDK)
LendingTree, Inc. (Nasdaq: TREE)
GCI Holdings, LLC
GCI Holdings, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, provides a full range of wireless, data, video, voice, and managed services to residential customers, businesses, governmental entities, and educational and medical institutions primarily in Alaska under the GCI brand. Due to the unique nature of the markets it serves, including harsh winter weather and remote geographies, its customers rely extensively on its systems to meet their communication and entertainment needs.
Since its founding in 1979 as a competitive long distance provider, GCI Holdings has consistently expanded its product portfolio and facilities to become the leading integrated communication services provider in markets it serves. Its facilities include redundant and geographically diverse digital undersea fiber optic cable systems linking its Alaska terrestrial networks to the networks of other carriers in the lower 48 contiguous states and a statewide wireless network. 

Throughout its history, GCI Holdings has successfully added and expects to continue to add new products to its product portfolio. GCI Holdings has a demonstrated history of new product evaluation, development and deployment for its customers, and it continues to assess revenue-enhancing opportunities that create value for its customers. Where feasible and where economic analysis supports geographic expansion of its network coverage, it is currently pursuing or expects to pursue opportunities to increase the scale of its facilities, enhance its ability to serve existing customers’ needs and attract new customers. Additionally, due to the unique market conditions in Alaska, GCI Holdings, and in some cases its customers, participate in several federal (and to a lesser extent locally) subsidized programs designed to financially support the implementation and purchase of telecommunications services in high cost areas. With these programs GCI Holdings has been able to expand its network into previously undeveloped areas of Alaska and offer comprehensive communications services in many rural parts of the state where it would not otherwise be able to construct facilities within appropriate return-on-investment requirements.
I-3

GCI Holdings' revenue was comprised of 51% from data services, 22% from wireless services and 27% from video, voice and other services for 2019. GCI Holdings' revenue was comprised of 49% from data services, 22% from wireless services and 29% from video, voice and other services from March 9, 2018 through December 31, 2018.
GCI Holdings has a history of making and integrating acquisitions of telecommunications providers and other providers of complementary services. Its management team will continue to pursue investments that it believes fit with its strategy and networks and that enhance earnings.
GCI Holdings sells new and enhanced services and products to its existing customer base to achieve increased revenue and penetration of its services. Through close coordination of its customer service and sales and marketing efforts, its customer service representatives suggest to its customers other services they can purchase or enhanced versions of services they already purchase. Many calls into the customer service centers or visits into one of the retail stores result in sales of additional services and products.
GCI Holdings operates its own customer service department and has empowered its customer service representatives to handle most service issues and questions on a single call. GCI Holdings prioritizes its customer services to expedite handling of its most valuable customers’ issues, particularly for its largest commercial customers. GCI Holdings believes its integrated approach to customer service, including service set-up, programming various network databases with the customer’s information, installation, and ongoing service, allows it to provide a customer experience that fosters customer loyalty.
GCI Holdings continues to expand and evolve its integrated network for the delivery of its services. GCI Holdings' bundled strategy and integrated approach to serving customers creates efficiencies of scale and maximizes network utilization. By offering multiple services, GCI Holdings is better able to leverage its network assets and increase returns on its invested capital. GCI Holdings periodically evaluates its network assets and continually monitors technological developments that it can potentially deploy to increase network efficiency and performance.
GCI Holdings does not hold franchises (with the exception of video services as described below) or concessions for communications services or local access services. GCI Holdings holds a number of federally registered service marks used by its business. It owns two utility patents issued in 2017 pertaining to device diagnostics and network connectivity. The Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the "Communications Act"), gives the FCC the authority to license and regulate the use of the electromagnetic spectrum for radio communications. GCI Holdings holds licenses for its satellite and microwave transmission facilities for provision of long-distance services. GCI Holdings holds various licenses for spectrum and broadcast television use. These licenses may be revoked and license renewal applications may be denied for cause. However, GCI Holdings expects these licenses to be renewed in due course when, at the end of the license period, a renewal application will be filed.
GCI Holdings has licenses for earth stations that are generally licensed for fifteen years. The FCC also issues a single blanket license for a large number of technically identical earth stations. Its operations may require additional licenses in the future.
GCI Holdings is certified through the Regulatory Commission of Alaska ("RCA") to provide local, long distance, and video service by Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity (“CPCN”). These CPCNs are nonexclusive certificates defining each authorized service area. Although CPCNs have no stated expiration date, they may be revoked due to cause.
Facilities. GCI Holdings operates a modern, competitive communications network providing switched and dedicated voice and broadband services. Its fiber network employs digital transmission technology over its fiber optic facilities within Alaska and between Alaska and the lower 48 states.
GCI Holdings serves many rural and remote Alaska locations solely via satellite communications. It operates a hybrid fiber optic cable and digital microwave system (“TERRA”) linking Anchorage with the Bristol Bay, Yukon-Kuskokwim, and northwest regions of the state.
GCI Holdings owns and operates a statewide network providing voice and data services to the urban and rural communities of Alaska. Its statewide wireless network provides 4G LTE data service, EVDO, 3G UMTS/HSPA+, 2G CDMA, and 2G GSM/EDGE service. It continues to expand and upgrade these services to provide a modern network for Alaska.
GCI Holdings' dedicated Internet access and Internet protocol data services are delivered to an Ethernet port located at the service end-point. GCI Holdings' management platform continuously monitors the network and service end-points for 
I-4

performance. The availability and quality of service, as well as statistical information on traffic loading, are continuously monitored for quality assurance. The management platform has the capability to remotely access network elements and service end-points, permitting changes in configuration without the need to physically be at the service end-point. This management platform allows GCI Holdings to offer network monitoring and management services to businesses and governmental entities.
GCI Holdings' video businesses are located throughout Alaska and serve the majority of the population. Its facilities include hybrid-fiber-coax plant and head-end distribution equipment. The majority of its locations on the fiber routes are served from head-end distribution equipment in Anchorage. All of its cable systems are completely digital.
Evite
Evite is a digital invitation platform focused on bringing people together. With thousands of free and premium customizable designs which can be sent by email or text message, Evite makes celebrating face-to-face easier and more memorable for its over one hundred million annual users and their guests. Real-time messaging and RSVP tracking continue to make planning easier. Through Evite Donations, which has raised close to $20 million dollars, users can invite guests to support a favorite charity or personal cause without leaving their invitation. Launched in 1998, Evite has sent nearly 3 billion invitations. Evite generates revenue primarily from the sale of digital advertising for publication on its platform, including custom display advertising, native advertising content, custom integrations and brand partnerships. Evite conducts advertising sales through its direct regional sales teams and programmatically through ad exchanges. Diversified revenue streams are an increasing part of Evite's business with a focus on premium invitation purchases and Evite Pro subscriptions, which accounted for more than a quarter of Evite revenue in 2019. Evite is headquartered in Los Angeles. Evite's competitors include Paperless Post and various social media platforms.
Liberty Broadband
Liberty Broadband consists of its wholly owned subsidiary Skyhook Holding, Inc. (“Skyhook”) and an interest in Charter Communications, Inc. ("Charter"). Skyhook provides location determination and location intelligence and data insight services.
Charter is the second largest cable operator in the United States and a leading broadband communications services company providing video, Internet and voice services to approximately 29.2 million residential and small and medium business customers at December 31, 2019. Charter also offers mobile services to residential customers and recently launched mobile services to small and medium business customers. In addition, Charter sells video and online advertising inventory to local, regional and national advertising customers and tailored communications and managed solutions to large enterprise customers. Charter also owns and operates regional sports networks and local sports, news and community channels. 
The Company owns an approximate 23.5% economic interest in Liberty Broadband as of December 31, 2019. Due to overlapping boards of directors and management, GCI Liberty has been deemed to have significant influence over Liberty Broadband (for accounting purposes) even though GCI Liberty does not have any voting rights (see note 7 of the Company's consolidated financial statements found in Part II of this report for additional information). GCI Liberty has elected to apply the fair value option for its investment in Liberty Broadband as it is believed that the Company’s investors value this investment based on the trading price of Liberty Broadband.
LendingTree
LendingTree operates an online consumer platform for consumers seeking loans and other credit-based offerings. LendingTree offers consumers tools and resources, including free credit scores, that facilitate comparison-shopping for mortgage loans, home equity loan and lines of credit, reverse mortgage loans, auto loans, credit cards, deposit accounts, personal loans, student loans, small business loans, insurance quotes and other related offerings. LendingTree primarily seeks to match in-market consumers with multiple providers on its marketplace who can provide them with competing quotes for loans, deposit products, insurance or other related offerings they are seeking. LendingTree also serves as a valued partner to lenders and other providers seeking an efficient, scalable and flexible source of customer acquisition with directly measurable benefits, by matching the consumer inquiries it generates with these lenders. LendingTree is headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina.
The Company owns approximately 26.5% of the outstanding common stock of LendingTree as of December 31, 2019. The Company has entered into an agreement with LendingTree pursuant to which, among other things, it has the right to nominate 20% of the members of LendingTree’s board of directors. The Company has nominated two of the ten current board members.

Regulatory Matters
The Company's businesses are subject to substantial government regulation and oversight. The following summary of regulatory issues does not purport to describe all existing and proposed federal, state, and local laws and regulations, or judicial and regulatory proceedings that affect the Company's businesses. Existing laws and regulations are reviewed frequently by legislative bodies, regulatory agencies, and the courts and are subject to change. The Company cannot predict at this time the outcome of any present or future consideration of proposed changes to governing laws and regulations.
Wireless Services and Products
General. The FCC regulates the licensing, construction, interconnection, operation, acquisition, and transfer of wireless network systems in the United States pursuant to the Communications Act. The Company's wireless licensee subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the FCC, and must comply with certain build-out and other license conditions, as well as with the FCC’s specific regulations governing wireless services. The FCC imposes significant regulation on licensees of wireless spectrum with respect to how radio spectrum is used by licensees, the nature of services licensees may offer and how such services may be offered, and the resolution of issues of interference between spectrum bands. The FCC does not currently regulate rates for services offered by commercial mobile radio service providers (the official legal description for wireless service providers).
Commercial mobile radio service wireless systems are subject to Federal Aviation Administration ("FAA") and FCC regulations governing the location, lighting, construction, modification, and registration of antenna structures on which GCI Holdings' antennas and associated equipment are located and are also subject to regulation under federal environmental laws and the FCC’s environmental regulations, including limits on radio frequency radiation from wireless handsets and antennas.
Universal Service. The High Cost Program of the Universal Service Fund ("USF") pays Eligible Telecommunications Carriers ("ETCs") to support the provision of facilities-based wireless telephone service in high cost areas. A wireless carrier may seek ETC status so that it can receive support from the USF. Under FCC regulations and RCA orders, GCI Holdings is an authorized ETC for purposes of providing wireless telephone service in many rural areas throughout Alaska. Without ETC status, GCI Holdings would not qualify for USF support in these areas or other rural areas where it proposes to offer facilities-based wireless telephone services, and its net cost of providing wireless telephone services in these areas would be materially adversely affected.
On August 31, 2016, the FCC published the Alaska High Cost Order. Per the Alaska High Cost Order, as of January 1, 2017, Remote (as defined by the Alaska High Cost Order) high cost support payments to Alaska High Cost participants are frozen on a per-company basis at adjusted December 2014 levels for a ten-year term in exchange for meeting individualized performance obligations to offer voice and broadband services meeting the service obligations at specified minimum speeds by five-year and ten-year service milestones to a specified number of locations. Remote high cost support is no longer dependent upon line counts and line count filings are no longer required. Under the terms of the Alaska High Cost Order, the FCC is to initiate a process in 2021 to eliminate duplicate support in areas that were served by more than one subsidized mobile wireless carrier as of December 31, 2020. As part of the Alaska High Cost Order, the FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking comment on how to implement that process. The FCC has not to date issued any further orders with respect to that process.
On December 1, 2017, the FCC released a Fourth Report and Order to reform and modernize the USF’s Lifeline program ("Lifeline Order"). The Lifeline program is administered by the Universal Service Administrative Company ("USAC") and is designed to ensure that quality telecommunications services are available to low-income customers at just, reasonable, and affordable rates. The current Lifeline program provides an enhanced $25 monthly subsidy to qualifying subscribers that live on tribal lands ("Enhanced Tribal Subsidy"), which includes all of Alaska, in addition to the $9.25 subsidy provided to all Lifeline subscribers. The Lifeline Order adopted several reforms, but, most significantly, it limited the Enhanced Tribal Subsidy to only those subscribers living in "rural" tribal areas. On February 1, 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ("D.C. Circuit") vacated the Lifeline Order as arbitrary and capricious, remanding the matter to the FCC for a new notice-and-comment-rulemaking proceeding. On November 14, 2019, the FCC released a Fifth Report and Order, Order on Reconsideration and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking ("FNPRM") regarding the Lifeline program. Although that Order adopted, and the FNPRM proposed, further program protections, the FNPRM did not propose limiting the Enhanced Tribal Subsidy to "rural" areas.
I-6

Interconnection. GCI Holdings has completed negotiations and the RCA has approved current direct wireless interconnection agreements with all of the major Alaska Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers ("ILECs"). These are in addition to indirect interconnection arrangements utilized elsewhere.
See “Narrative Description of Business — Regulatory Matters — Wireline Voice Services and Products — Regulatory Regime Applicable to IP-based Networks” for more information.
Emergency 911. The FCC has imposed rules requiring carriers to provide emergency 911 services, including enhanced 911 (“E911”) services that provide the caller's phone number and approximate location to local public safety dispatch agencies. Providers are required to transmit the geographic coordinates of the customer’s location, for both indoor and outdoor locations, within accuracy parameters revised by the FCC, to be implemented over a phase-in period. The FCC also imposed requirements to allow users to text-to-911 if the local public safety dispatch agency requests and is able to receive such texts. Providers may not demand cost recovery as a condition of providing E911, although they are permitted to negotiate cost recovery if it is not mandated by the state or local governments. GCI Holdings has been able to meet FCC requirements for 911 location accuracy and text-to-911 to date; however, it may not be able to do so in the future, depending upon the extent of technology development.
State and Local Regulation. While the Communications Act generally preempts state and local governments from regulating the entry of, and the rates charged by, wireless carriers, it also permits a state to petition the FCC to allow it to impose commercial mobile radio service rate regulation when market conditions fail to adequately protect customers and such service is a replacement for a substantial portion of the telephone wireline exchange service within a state. No state currently has such a petition on file, and all prior efforts have been rejected. 
In addition, the Communications Act does not expressly preempt the states from regulating the “terms and conditions” of wireless service. Several states have invoked this “terms and conditions” authority to impose or propose various consumer protection regulations on the wireless industry. State attorneys general have also become more active in enforcing state consumer protection laws against sales practices and services of wireless carriers. States also may impose their own universal service support requirements on wireless and other communications carriers, similar to the contribution requirements that have been established by the FCC.
States have become more active in attempting to impose new taxes and fees on wireless carriers, such as gross receipts taxes. Where successful, these taxes and fees are generally passed through to customers and result in higher costs to customers.
At the local level, wireless facilities typically are subject to zoning and land use regulation. Neither local nor state governments may categorically prohibit the construction of wireless facilities in any community or take actions, such as indefinite moratoria, which have the effect of prohibiting construction. Pursuant to Section 6409(a) of the Middle Class Tax Relief Act of 2012, state and local governments are further constrained in their regulation of changes to existing wireless infrastructure. Nonetheless, securing federal, state and local government approvals for new antenna structures has been and is likely to continue to be difficult, lengthy and costly.
Data Services and Products
General. There is no one entity or organization that governs the global operation of the Internet. Each facilities-based network provider that is interconnected with the global Internet controls operational aspects of its own network. Certain functions, such as IP addressing, domain name routing, and the definition of the TCP/IP protocol, are coordinated by an array of quasi-governmental, intergovernmental, and non-governmental bodies. The legal authority of these bodies is not precisely defined.
The vast majority of users connect to the Internet over facilities of existing communications carriers. Those communications carriers are subject to varying levels of regulation at both the federal and state level. Thus, non-Internet-specific regulatory decisions exercise a significant influence over the economics of the Internet market.
Many aspects of the coordination and regulation of Internet activities and the underlying networks over which those activities are conducted are evolving. Internet-specific and non-Internet-specific changes in the regulatory environment, including changes that affect communications costs or increase competition from ILECs or other communications services providers, could adversely affect our costs and the prices at which GCI Holdings sells Internet-based services.
I-7

On February 26, 2015, the FCC adopted an order reclassifying Internet service as a telecommunications service under Title II of the Communications Act. This order prohibited broadband providers from blocking or throttling most lawful public Internet traffic, from engaging in paid prioritization of that traffic, and from unreasonably interfering with or disadvantaging end users' and edge providers’ ability to send traffic to, from, and among each other. The order also strengthened the FCC’s transparency rules, which require accurate and truthful service disclosures, sufficient for consumers to make informed choices, for example, about speed, price and fees, latency, and network management practices. The order allowed broadband providers to engage in reasonable network management, including using techniques to address traffic congestion. These rules applied equally to wired and wireless broadband services. The order refrained from applying rate regulation and tariff requirements on broadband services. On January 4, 2018, the FCC released an order ("2018 Order") that returned to a Title I classification of Internet service and eliminated many of the requirements described above. On October 1, 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (“D.C. Circuit”) ruled on numerous appeals of the 2018 Order by interested parties. The D.C. Circuit largely upheld the 2018 Order. However, it vacated that portion of the 2018 Order preempting inconsistent state or local regulations, and remanded the 2018 Order to the FCC for further consideration of its effect on public safety, pole attachment regulation, and the Lifeline support program. The D.C. Circuit’s ruling may be subject to further judicial review.
There are various efforts in Congress and through state legislation to re-impose the rules adopted in 2015. For example, on September 30, 2018, California enacted the California Internet Consumer Protection and Net Neutrality Act of 2018, which establishes many of the requirements adopted by the FCC in 2015. California has agreed not to enforce the new law pending judicial review of the 2018 Order in the D.C. Circuit, and any subsequent proceedings before the U.S. Supreme Court. While GCI Holdings does not believe that the 2015 FCC order conflicts with its existing practices or offerings, the re-imposition of that regulatory framework would impose regulatory burdens, likely would increase its costs, and could adversely affect the manner and price of providing service.
On October 27, 2016, the FCC adopted rules governing how broadband internet access service providers may use and disclose certain customer information. Those rules were more restrictive in certain respects than the rules that apply to other entities in the internet economy, including Google and Facebook. On April 3, 2017, the President signed Pub. Law 115-22, which repealed the FCC’s rules under the Congressional Review Act. Various efforts in Congress, at the FTC, and in state legislatures seek to regulate how service providers in the internet economy may use and disclose customer information. Those efforts could impact GCI Holdings' ability to use customer data and impose costs and operational challenges.
The FCC also has other open dockets through which it might make changes to the regulatory regime applicable to IP-based networks. A change in regulatory obligation or classification that interferes with GCI Holdings' ability to exchange traffic with other providers, that raises the cost of doing so, or that adversely affects eligibility for USF support could materially affect GCI Holdings' net cost of and revenue from providing local services. 
Rural Health Care Program. The USF Rural Health Care ("RHC") Program provides funding to eligible healthcare providers for telecommunications and broadband services. The RHC Telecommunications Program subsidizes the rates for telecommunications services provided to rural health care providers based on the difference between the urban and rural rates for such services. The Healthcare Connect Fund Program provides support for high-capacity broadband connectivity to eligible health care providers. In connection with receiving these subsidies, GCI Holdings prepares annual cost studies in support of the rates it charges, and submits these studies to the FCC for review.
Funding Year 2017 Rate Reduction. In November 2017, USAC requested further information in support of the rural rates charged to a number of GCI Holdings' RHC customers in connection with the funding requests for the year that runs July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2018. On October 10, 2018, GCI Holdings received a letter from the FCC's Wireline Competition Bureau (“Bureau”) notifying it of the Bureau’s decision to reduce the rural rates charged to RHC customers for the funding year that ended on June 30, 2018 by approximately 26% resulting in a reduction of total support payments of $27.8 million. The FCC also informed GCI Holdings that the same cost methodology used for the funding year that ended on June 30, 2018 would be applied to rates charged to RHC customers in subsequent funding years. In response to the letter from the Bureau, GCI Holdings filed an Application for Review of the Bureau’s decision with the FCC. This matter remains pending before the FCC.
RHC Program Funding Cap. On March 15, 2018, USAC announced that the funding requests for the year that runs July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2018 exceeded the funding available for the RHC Program. Since that time, on June 25, 2018, the FCC issued an order resulting in an increase of the annual RHC Program funding cap from $400 million to $571 million and applied it to the funding year that ended on June 30, 2018. The FCC also determined that it would annually adjust the RHC Program funding cap for inflation, beginning with the funding year ending on June 30, 2019 and carry-forward unused funds from past funding years for use in future funding years. As a result, aggregate funding is expected to be available to pay in full 
I-8

the approved funding under the RHC program for the funding years ended on June 30, 2018 and 2019. On June 10, 2019, the FCC released a public notice noting that the funding cap for the funding year ending on June 30, 2020 is $594 million, also noting that USAC projects that $83 million in unused funds will be available for use in the funding year ending on June 30, 2020. On February 14, 2020, USAC informed the FCC that it had identified an additional $162.7 million of unused funds available for use in future years, and that it had begun issuing commitments fully funding qualified single year requests in the Telecom and Healthcare Connect portions of the RHC programs for the funding year ending on June 30, 2020.
Enforcement Bureau Inquiry. In addition, on March 23, 2018, GCI Holdings received a separate letter of inquiry and request for information from the Enforcement Bureau of the FCC relating to the period beginning January 1, 2015 and including all future periods, to which it is in the process of responding. This includes inquiry into the rates charged by GCI Holdings that are still pending, and presently it is unable to assess the ultimate resolution of this rate inquiry. Other aspects related to the Enforcement Bureau’s review of GCI Holdings’ compliance with program rules are discussed separately below. The ongoing uncertainty in program funding, as well as the uncertainty associated with the rate review, could have an adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
USAC Funding Denials. On November 30, 2018, GCI Holdings received multiple funding denial notices from USAC, denying requested funding from the RHC Program operated by a rural health customer (the “Customer”) for the funding year that ended on June 30, 2018. In November 2017, USAC requested information from the Customer related to bidding process documentation for two separate service contracts GCI Holdings has with the Customer. Although the Customer timely responded, USAC found that bids previously received were not submitted with the original funding request and/or that bidding information submitted was related to the wrong bidding year. The Customer appealed this decision in early 2019 and on May 6, 2019 USAC denied the Customer's appeal. The Customer then appealed USAC’s decision to the Bureau on July 5, 2019. As of March 31, 2019, GCI Holdings had accounts receivable of approximately $21.3 million outstanding associated with these two service contracts, which is dependent upon receipt of funding from USAC. Given that USAC denied the Customer’s appeal as specifically outlined in the May 6, 2019 letter received by the Customer, the Company determined at the time it was probable that GCI Holdings incurred a loss and an accounts receivable reserve was recorded in the amount of $21.3 million and an associated bad debt expense was recorded during the first quarter of 2019 and included within Selling, general, and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, because of the uncertainty of the Customer’s future appeals process and uncertainty relating to our ability to recover payment directly from the Customer, the Company no longer believed revenue associated with the two service contracts should be recognized. Historical annual revenue associated with the two service contracts was approximately $12.0 million in total and was expected to be the same in future periods. Revenue has not been recognized beyond the first quarter of 2019.
On February 19, 2020, the Bureau issued an FCC order that granted the Customer’s appeal for the two service contracts that were originally denied funding by USAC. In the order, the FCC has directed USAC to reverse its previous funding denials. Because the FCC order provides the Company with additional information subsequent to December 31, 2019 about the resolution of a contingency that existed as of year-end, the Company has recognized the impact of the FCC order in our consolidated financial statements. Such impact resulted in the reversal of the previously recorded $21.3 million accounts receivable reserve and associated bad debt expense included within Selling, general, and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
Compliance with RHC Program Rules. In the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company became aware of potential RHC Program compliance issues related to certain of GCI Holdings’ currently active and expired contracts with certain of its RHC customers. The Company and its external experts performed significant and extensive procedures to determine whether GCI Holdings’ currently active and expired contracts with its RHC customers would be deemed to be in compliance with the RHC Program rules. Based on these procedures, the Company accrued a loss of approximately $17.0 million for contracts that are deemed probable of not complying with the RHC Program rules. The Company also identified certain contracts where additional loss was reasonably possible and such loss could range from zero to $44 million. An accrual was not made for the amount of the reasonably possible loss in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance. GCI Holdings could also be assessed fines and penalties but such amounts could not be reasonably estimated. GCI Holdings has notified the FCC of its potential compliance issues and will continue to work with the FCC to resolve such matters. See note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
Revision of Support Calculations and Approval. On August 20, 2019, the FCC released an order adopting changes to the RHC Program that will revise the manner in which support issued under the RHC Program will be calculated and approved. Some of these changes will become effective beginning with the funding year ending June 30, 2021, while others will apply beginning with the funding year ending June 30, 2022. On October 21, 2019, GCI Holdings appealed the order to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. On December 6, 2019, that appeal was held in abeyance for nine 
I-9

months due to pending Petitions for Reconsideration filed by other parties at the FCC. The proposed methodology for calculating and approving support under these changes relies on information that has not yet been collected and analyzed by USAC, and therefore GCI Holdings cannot assess at this time the substance, impact on funding, or timing of these changes adopted by the FCC, although these changes could potentially reduce support under the RHC Program.
Schools and Libraries Program. In 2014, the FCC adopted orders modernizing the USF Schools and Libraries Program ("E-Rate"), which aids schools and libraries in obtaining affordable broadband. These orders, among other things, increased the annual E-Rate cap by approximately $1.5 billion, designated funds for internal connections within schools and libraries, and eliminated funding for certain legacy services, such as voice, to increase the availability of 21st century connectivity to support digital learning in schools nationwide. These orders did not have a material effect on the overall E-Rate support available to GCI Holdings' schools and libraries customers, and therefore did not materially affect its revenue from such customers. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional risks related to the Company's participation in this USF program.
Other Federal Activities. Congress and certain federal agencies are considering ways to streamline federal permitting obligations and to provide additional financial support for broadband services in areas that are difficult to serve. GCI Holdings continues to monitor these activities and cannot predict at this time whether those efforts will make a material difference to its ability to deploy broadband infrastructure. 
Video Services and Products
General. Because video communications systems use local streets and rights-of-way, they generally are operated pursuant to franchises (which can take the form of certificates, permits, or licenses) granted by a municipality or other state or local government entity. The RCA is the franchising authority for all of Alaska. GCI Holdings believes that it has generally met the terms of its franchises, which do not require periodic renewal, and has provided quality levels of service. Military franchise requirements also affect its ability to provide video services to military bases.
Must Carry/Retransmission Consent. The Cable Television Consumer Protection Act of 1992 (the "1992 Cable Act") contains broadcast signal carriage requirements that allow local commercial television broadcast stations to elect once every three years to require a cable system to carry the station, subject to certain exceptions, or to negotiate for “retransmission consent” to carry the station. In July 2019, the FCC modified these rules such that broadcasters need only send carriage election notices to multichannel video programming distributors when first electing carriage or changing their carriage election status from must carry to retransmission consent or vice versa.
The FCC rules require cable operators to carry the digital programming streams of broadcast television stations who elect "Must Carry." The current rules do not require any cable operator to carry multiple digital programming streams from a single broadcast television station, but should the FCC change this policy, GCI Holdings would be required to devote additional cable capacity to carrying broadcast television programming streams, a step that could require the removal of other programming services.
Pole Attachments. The Communications Act requires the FCC to regulate the rates, terms and conditions imposed by public utilities for cable systems’ use of utility pole and conduit space unless state authorities can demonstrate that they adequately regulate pole attachment rates. In the absence of state regulation, the FCC administers pole attachment rates on a formula basis. This formula governs the maximum rate certain utilities may charge for attachments to their poles and conduit by companies providing communications services, including cable operators. The RCA, however, does not use the federal formula and instead has adopted its own formula that has been in place since 1987. This formula could be subject to further revisions upon petition to the RCA. In addition, in 2011, the FCC adopted an order to rationalize different pole attachment rates among types of services, and on November 17, 2015, took further steps to bring telecommunications and cable pole attachment rates into parity. Though the general purpose of the rule changes was to ensure pole attachment rates as low and as uniform as possible, GCI Holdings does not expect the rules to have an impact on the terms under which it accesses poles. GCI Holdings cannot predict the likelihood of the RCA changing its formula, adopting the federal formula, or relinquishing its oversight of pole attachments to the FCC, any of which could increase the cost of its operations. 
Copyright. Cable television systems are subject to federal copyright licensing covering carriage of television and radio broadcast signals. In exchange for filing certain reports and contributing a percentage of their revenue to a federal copyright royalty pool that varies depending on the size of the system, the number of distant broadcast television signals carried, and the location of the cable system, cable operators can obtain blanket permission to retransmit copyrighted material included in broadcast signals. The possible modification or elimination of this compulsory copyright license is the subject of continuing legislative review. GCI Holdings cannot predict the outcome of this legislative review, which could adversely affect its ability 
I-10

to obtain desired broadcast programming or affect the cost of that programming. Copyright clearances for non-broadcast programming services are arranged through private negotiations.
Wireline Voice Services and Products
General. As an interexchange carrier, GCI Holdings is subject to regulation by the FCC and the RCA as a non-dominant provider of interstate, international, and intrastate long-distance services. As a state-certificated competitive local exchange carrier, GCI Holdings is subject to regulation by the FCC and the RCA as a non-dominant provider of local communications services, although as of November 2019, the Alaska Legislature eliminated the RCA's regulation of rates but retained its certificate authority related to intrastate long-distance and local communications services through the passage of Senate Bill 83. Military franchise requirements also affect GCI Holdings' ability to provide communications services to military bases.
Universal Service for Rural and High Cost Areas. The USF provides support to ETCs related to their provision of facilities-based wireline telephone service in high cost areas. Under the Alaska High Cost Order, GCI Holdings receives this support for its incumbent local exchange carrier operations, which are Eligible Telecommunications Carriers (ETCs) under FCC regulations and RCA Orders. This support is frozen at the 2011 levels for High Cost Loop Support and Interstate Common Line Support that those operations, with certain adjustments. The support has a ten-year term, from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2026. Without ETC status, GCI Holdings would not qualify for USF support in these areas, and its net cost of providing local telephone services in these areas would be materially adversely affected. See “Description of Our Business - Regulation - Wireless Services and Products - Universal Service” for information on USF reform. Pursuant to the Alaska High Cost Order, GCI Holdings must meet certain performance requirements with respect to the offering of broadband services in its incumbent local exchange carrier areas. The FCC directed its Wireline Competition Bureau to reassess those performance commitments before December 31, 2021. If GCI Holdings fails to meet these performance requirements, it will be subject to repayment of a portion of the high cost support received, as specified in the Alaska High Cost Order. Although GCI Holdings formerly received high cost support for service provided by its competitive local exchange carrier operations, the phase-down of that support pursuant to the Alaska High Cost Order concluded on December 31, 2018.
Rural Exemption and Interconnection. A Rural Telephone Company is exempt from compliance with certain material interconnection requirements under Section 251(c) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, including the obligation to negotiate Section 251(b) and (c) interconnection requirements in good faith, unless and until a state regulatory commission lifts such “rural exemption” or otherwise finds it not to apply. All ILECs in Alaska are Rural Telephone Companies except Alaska Communications Systems Group, Inc. (“ACS”) in its Anchorage study area. GCI Holdings participated in numerous proceedings regarding the rural exemptions of various ILECs in order to achieve the necessary interconnection agreements with the remaining ILECs. In other cases the interconnection agreements were reached by negotiation without regard to the implications of the ILEC’s rural exemption.
GCI Holdings has completed negotiation and/or arbitration of the necessary interconnection provisions and the RCA has approved current wireline Interconnection Agreements between GCI Holdings and all of the major ILECs. GCI Holdings has entered all of the major Alaskan markets with local access services.
See “Narrative Description of Business — Competition — Voice Services and Products Competition” for more information.
Access Charges and Other Regulated Fees. The FCC regulates the fees that local telephone companies charge long-distance companies for access to their local networks. In 2011, the FCC released rules to restructure and reduce over time terminating interstate access charges, along with a proposal to adopt similar reforms applicable to originating interstate access charges. The details of implementation in general and between different classes of technology continue to be addressed by the FCC, and could affect the economics of some aspects of GCI Holdings' business. GCI Holdings cannot predict at this time the impact of this implementation or future implementation of adopted reforms, but GCI Holdings does not expect it to have a material adverse impact on its operations.
Unbundled Network Elements. The ability to obtain unbundled network elements ("UNEs") is an important element of GCI Holdings' local access services business. On August 2, 2019, the FCC released a Memorandum Opinion and Order eliminating certain unbundling and resale requirements. On November 25, 2019, the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing to eliminate all remaining unbundled network elements and avoided-cost resale requirements. GCI Holdings cannot predict the extent to which existing FCC rules governing access to and pricing for UNEs will be changed in the face of additional legal action and the impact of any further rule modifications that are yet to be determined by the FCC. 
I-11

Moreover, changes in the regulatory classification of services that are transmitted over facilities may impact the extent to which GCI Holdings will be permitted access to such facilities. Changes to the applicable regulations could result in a change in its cost of serving new and existing markets. On July 7, 2017, ACS filed a petition in which it asked the FCC to regulate GCI Holdings as an ILEC pursuant to section 251(h)(2) of the Communications Act, including the requirement to provide competitors with access to unbundled network elements. GCI Holdings cannot predict at this time the outcome of this proceeding. However, grant of the petition in its entirety may subject GCI Holdings to regulatory burdens that could materially impact its costs. 
Local Regulation. GCI Holdings may be required to obtain local permits for street opening and construction permits to install and expand its networks. Local zoning authorities often regulate GCI Holdings' use of towers for microwave and other communications sites. GCI Holdings is also subject to general regulations concerning building codes and local licensing. The Communications Act requires that fees charged to communications carriers be applied in a competitively neutral manner, but there can be no assurance that ILECs and others with whom GCI Holdings will be competing will bear costs similar to those it bears in this regard.
Environmental Regulations
GCI Holdings undertakes activities that may, under certain circumstances, affect the environment. Accordingly, they may be subject to federal, state, and local laws designed to preserve or protect the environment, including the Clean Water Act and the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act. The FCC, Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Bureau of Indian Affairs, and National Park Service are among the federal agencies required by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and National Historic Preservation Act to consider the environmental impact of actions they authorize, including facility construction.
The principal effect of GCI Holdings' facilities on the environment would be in the form of construction of facilities and networks at various locations in Alaska and between Alaska, Washington, and Oregon. GCI Holdings' facilities have been constructed in accordance with federal, state and local building codes and zoning regulations whenever and wherever applicable. GCI Holdings obtains federal, state, and local permits, as required, for its projects and operations. GCI Holdings is unaware of any material violations of federal, state or local regulations or permits.
Competition
The Company operates in intensely competitive industries and competes with a number of companies that provide a broad range of communication, entertainment, and information products and services. Technological changes are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape and consumer behavior. 
Retail Wireless Services and Products Competition. The Company competes with AT&T, Verizon, and community or regional-based wireless providers, and resellers of those services in Anchorage and other markets. Regulatory policies favor robust competition in wireless markets. Wireless local number portability helps to maintain a high level of competition in the industry because it allows subscribers to switch carriers without having to change their telephone numbers.
The communications industry continues to experience significant technological changes, as evidenced by the increasing pace of improvements in the capacity and quality of digital technology, shorter cycles for new products and enhancements and changes in consumer preferences and expectations. Accordingly, the Company expects competition in the wireless communications industry to continue to be dynamic and intense as a result of the development of new technologies, services and products.
The national wireless carriers with whom the Company competes, AT&T and Verizon, have resources that are greater than the Company's resources. These companies have significantly greater capital, financial, marketing, human capital, distribution and other resources than the Company. Specifically, as a regional wireless carrier the Company may not have immediate access to some wireless handsets that are available to these national wireless carriers. 
The Company competes for customers based principally upon price, service bundles, the services and enhancements offered, network quality, customer service, billing services, statewide network coverage and capacity, the type of wireless handsets offered, and perceived quality, reliability and availability. The Company's ability to compete successfully will depend, in part, on its marketing efforts and its ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry.
I-12

Data Services and Products Competition. The Internet industry is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and subject to constant technological change. Competition is based upon price, service bundles, the services and enhancements offered, the technologies used, customer service, billing services, and perceived quality, reliability and availability. The Company competes with other providers some of which are headquartered outside of Alaska and have substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources.
The Company expects to continue to provide, at reasonable prices and in competitive bundles, a greater variety of data services than are available through other alternative delivery sources. Additionally, the Company believes it offers superior technical performance and speed, and responsive community-based customer service. Increased competition, however, may adversely affect the Company's market share and results of operations from its data services product offerings.
Presently, there are a number of competing companies in Alaska that actively sell and maintain data and voice communications systems. The Company's ability to integrate communications networks and data communications equipment has allowed it to maintain its market position based on customer support services rather than price competition alone. These services are blended with other transport products into unique customer solutions, including managed services and outsourcing.
Video Services and Products Competition. The Company's video systems face competition from services and devices that offer distribution of movies, television shows and other video programming, using alternative methods such as Internet video streaming and direct broadcast satellite ("DBS"). The Company's video systems also face competition from potential overbuilds of its existing cable systems. The extent to which the Company's video systems are competitive depends, in part, upon its ability to provide quality programming and other services at competitive prices.
Internet video streaming services, such as Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime, are a major source of competition for the Company's video services. Additionally, some online video services produce or acquire their own original content. However, as a major Internet-provider, the competition may result in additional data service subscriber revenue for the Company to the extent it grows average Internet revenue per subscriber.
The DBS industry is another major source of competition for the Company's video services. Two major companies, AT&T-owned DIRECTV and DISH Network Corporation, are currently offering high-power DBS services in Alaska.
Video systems generally operate pursuant to franchises granted on a non-exclusive basis. The 1992 Cable Act gives local franchising authorities jurisdiction over basic video service rates and equipment in the absence of “effective competition.” The 1992 Cable Act also prohibits franchising authorities from unreasonably denying requests for additional franchises and permits franchising authorities to operate video systems. Well-financed businesses from outside the video industry may become competitors for franchises or providers of competing services.
The Company expects to continue to provide, at reasonable prices and in competitive bundles, a greater variety of video services than are available off-air or through other alternative delivery sources. Additionally, the Company believes it offers superior technical performance and responsive community-based customer service. Increased competition, however, may adversely affect the Company's market share and results of operations from its video services product offerings.
Voice Services and Products Competition. The Company's most significant competition for local access and long-distance comes from wireless substitution and voice over Internet protocol services. Wireless local number portability allows consumers to retain the same phone number as they change service providers allowing for interchangeable and portable fixed-line and wireless numbers. A growing number of consumers now use wireless service as their primary voice phone service for local calling. The Company also competes against ILECs, long-distance resellers and certain smaller rural local telephone companies for local access and long-distance. The Company has competed by offering what it believes is excellent customer service and by providing desirable bundles of services.
