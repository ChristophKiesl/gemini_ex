   Overview 
         We are a biopharmaceutical company acquiring and developing novel therapeutics at the leading edge of cancer biology. Our approach is designed to target compelling tumor-promoting and immuno-oncology pathways to generate durable clinical benefit and enhanced outcomes for patients. Our programs are monoclonal antibodies that target key cellular pathways that enable cancer to grow and spread and specific mechanisms that activate the body's immune system to identify and attack cancer. Our two clinical stage programs are: 


 DKN-01:  A monoclonal antibody targeting Dickkopf-related protein 1, or
DKK1, a protein that regulates important cell signaling pathways, known as the Wnt pathways, and influences the immune environment around tumor cells as well as tumor cell growth. When DKN-01 binds to
DKK1, Wnt signaling pathways and the tumor microenvironment are altered, and an anti-tumor effect can be generated. We are testing DKN-01 in ongoing clinical trials in patients with esophagogastric
cancer in combination with paclitaxel and in patients with biliary tract cancer in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin. We have studied DKN-01 as a monotherapy in patients with non-small cell
lung cancer. DKN-01-based therapies have generated responses and clinical benefit in these patient populations. 
 TRX518:  A monoclonal antibody targeting the glucocorticoid-induced tumor
necrosis factor-related receptor, or GITR, a receptor found on the surface of a wide range of immune cells. TRX518 has been specifically engineered to enhance the immune system's anti-tumor response
by activating GITR signaling, or GITR agonism, to activate tumor fighting white blood cells, or 

 1

   

T
effector cells, and decrease the activity of potentially tumor-protective white blood cells, or T regulatory cells, without causing the immune cells to be destroyed. We believe GITR is an ideal
immune system agonist target through this two-pronged approach of stimulating an anti-tumor response and reducing immune suppression. We are conducting two clinical trials of TRX518 in patients with
advanced solid tumors and have evidence of biomarker modulation and clinical activity. 


         We intend to apply our extensive experience identifying and developing transformational products to aggressively develop these antibodies and build a pipeline of programs that has the potential to change the practice of cancer medicine.

         Cancer is the general name for a group of more than 100 diseases in which cells grow and divide out of control. Over 14 million people in the United States have cancer. The National Cancer Institute, or NCI, estimates that approximately 1.6 million people will develop cancer and that nearly 600,000 people will die of cancer this year. According to the NCI, the risk of developing cancer in the United States is 40%, and the risk of dying from cancer is 20%. While progress has been made from the War on Cancer to the Human Genome Project, and despite advances in early detection and new cancer cell targeted treatments, cancer generally remains an uncured disease. 



Esophageal Cancer 

         Esophageal and esophageal-gastric junction cancer, or EC, is a malignancy of the upper digestive tract. The American Cancer Society, or ACS, estimates that there are about 17,000 new patients diagnosed in the United States with EC each year. The World Cancer Research Fund, or WCRF, estimates that there are over 450,000 EC patients diagnosed each year worldwide. EC patients have difficulty swallowing and often have pain while swallowing. Substantial weight loss can result from reduced appetite, poor nutrition and having an active cancer. Pain may be severe, occur almost daily, and be worsened by swallowing any form of food. The disruption of normal swallowing can lead to aspiration of food content, nausea, vomiting and an increased risk of pneumonia. The tumor itself may be irritable and bleed, which can either cause spitting up with blood or blood in the bowels. Compression of local structures in the esophagus occurs in advanced disease, leading to problems such as upper airway obstruction. Many people diagnosed with esophageal cancer have late-stage disease, because people usually do not have significant symptoms until half of the inside of the esophagus is obstructed, by which point the tumor is fairly large. In advanced stages, the cancer frequently spreads into the liver or lungs. There are currently no FDA approved therapies for relapsed or recurrent esophageal cancer, and the antibody, ramucirumab, which was only recently approved by the FDA is only approved for relapsed or recurrent tumors at the gastro-esophageal junction. EC patients have few options, and patients have a 5-year survival rate of 18.4%. The frequently-used therapies in patients who have not had many previous courses of treatment have very low, typically less than 15%, objective response rates, defined as patients with a greater than 30% reduction in tumor volume as determined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, known as RECIST. Published data has demonstrated that paclitaxel monotherapy generated a response rate of between 5 and 9% in EC patients who had received prior chemotherapy. 
 


Biliary Tract Cancer 

         Biliary tract cancer is a cancer that starts in the bile duct, a thin tube about 4 to 5 inches long that reaches from the liver to the small intestine. The major function of the bile duct is to move a fluid called bile from the liver and gallbladder to the small intestine, where it helps digest the fats in food. The Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation estimates that approximately 6,000 patients will be diagnosed with biliary tract cancer in the United States each year, with publications estimating that nearly 200,000 
 2

   patients are diagnosed worldwide each year. The majority of biliary tract cancer cases are diagnosed with advanced stage disease with a 5-year survival rate of less than 10%. The standard treatment option for advanced patients is systemic chemotherapy and supportive care. Published data demonstrated that gemcitabine and cisplatin combination chemotherapy in patients with advanced biliary tract cancer generated a clinical benefit rate, representing patients with either an objective response or stable disease as determined by RECIST, of 68.3% to 81.4%, median progression-free survival of 6 to 8 months, and median overall survival of 11.2 to 11.7 months. 
 


Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer 

         In the United States, lung cancer is the second most common cancer, after prostate cancer in men and breast cancer in women, and the most common cause of cancer deaths. The ACS projects that approximately 225,000 cancers of the lung and bronchus will be diagnosed in the United States each year, with over 150,000 deaths. The WCRF estimates that there are over 1.8 million lung cancer patients diagnosed each year worldwide. Approximately 80% to 85% of lung cancers are non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, and 10% to 15% are small cell lung cancer. Symptoms of lung cancer do not usually appear until the disease is at an advanced stage. Depending on the stage of the cancer and other factors, treatment options for people with NSCLC can include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, targeted therapies, and immunotherapy. The 5-year survival rate for people with the least advanced stage of NSCLC, stage IA, is about 49%. As the cancer becomes more advanced and spreads to other parts of the body, it becomes more difficult to treat and the survival rate decreases. NSCLC that has spread, or stage IV NSCLC, has a 5-year survival rate of about 1%. 
 


Cancer Therapies and New Targets 

         Older, established cancer therapies, or chemotherapies, target all rapidly dividing cells. While chemotherapies can attack and kill cancer cells, these drugs also attack and destroy rapidly dividing non-cancer normal cells and, unfortunately, are associated with unwanted side effects. Even though outcomes can often be improved by giving a cancer patient two or more chemotherapies in combination, physicians and patients desire new drugs with greater efficacy and fewer side effects. Recently, a revolution in the understanding of cancer biology has generated compelling new anti-cancer targets that are based on fundamental mechanisms used by cancer cells to grow, spread, and survive, which are:
 

 cell signaling pathways that promote tumor growth, and 
 evading detection and avoiding destruction by the immune system. 




Cancer Cell Signaling 

         Cancer cells often hijack proteins that are involved in cell signaling pathways, the complex communication system that governs basic cellular functions and activities, such as cell division, cell movement, cell responses to specific stimuli, and even cell death. By blocking signals that tell cancer cells to grow and divide uncontrollably, to generate new blood vessels, a process referred to as angiogenesis, or to spread to other parts of the body, a process referred to as metastasis, a new generation of cancer therapies is seeking to help stop cancer progression, which could lead to cancer cell death. By focusing on cellular signaling pathways and molecules that are used by cancer cells, these targeted cancer therapies may be more effective than other types of treatment, including chemotherapy, and less harmful to normal cells. Several small molecule and monoclonal antibodies that target cell signaling pathways have now been approved by the FDA as cancer therapies for specific patient populations.

Cancer Immunotherapy 

         The immune system has evolved a dynamic ability to identify and attack cells which pose a danger to the body. Often these dangerous cells are foreign, or non-self, cells, but a person's own cells can become a danger, such as in cancer. Ideally, the immune system identifies cancer cells as dangerous and removes them before they can grow into tumors. However, cancer cells can evade or suppress the body's natural immune response by secreting anti-inflammatory molecules and by using receptors on the cell membrane of either immune system cells or cancer cells known as immune checkpoints. Recently approved cancer therapies known as checkpoint inhibitors, such as nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and atezolizumab, are designed to block checkpoint receptors, such as Programmed Cell Death protein-1, or PD-1, or its ligand, PD-L1, and prevent the cancer cell from evading the natural immune response, thus enabling the immune system to mount an attack on the tumor. While there are several FDA-approved checkpoint inhibitors, there is a consensus in the scientific and medical communities that there remains room for improvement in response rate and efficacy. In many cases, the lack of efficacy has been attributed to an insufficient immune response. 
 


Our Approach 

         Our approach to treating cancer patients seeks to enhance the effectiveness of approved chemotherapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors by:
 

 altering cell signaling pathways that promote tumor growth and spreading; 
 stimulating the immune cells that could attack the tumor; and 
 inhibiting immune suppression that would prevent an attack on the tumor. 

  Altering cell signaling.    An important set of signaling pathways in cancer cells are known as the canonical and non-canonical Wnt pathways. DKK1 serves as one of the inhibitors of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway and modulates the non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways. Changes in these Wnt pathways can lead to the expression of several cancer-causing genes and factors associated with cell growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis. We believe that a monoclonal antibody that reduces free DKK1 could shift canonical and non-canonical signaling to healthy levels, thereby resulting in a direct anti-tumor effect as well as a local anti-angiogenic effect in the diseased tissue. These mechanisms could enhance or complement the anti-tumor mechanisms used by chemotherapies or other therapies targeted at different cell signaling pathways. 
  Stimulating anti-tumor immune cells.    A potential way to enhance an immune response against a tumor is by activating tumor-attacking immune cells directly through specific receptors, such as GITR, known as costimulatory receptors. Monoclonal antibodies that stimulate immune cells through these costimulatory receptors are referred to as agonist antibodies and are designed to induce or augment an immune response that may have been insufficient, suppressed, or non-existent. This strategy is expected to overcome mechanisms that would prevent these immune cells from attacking a tumor. Agonist antibodies that costimulate the immune system have the potential to be combined with chemotherapy or checkpoint inhibitors to generate a more robust anti-tumor immune response. 
  Inhibiting immune suppression.    The human immune system has the ability to recognize and protect its own cells and tissues. Certain kinds of white blood cells, such as T regulatory cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, serve to prevent other cells from attacking the body. In the case of cancer, these cells may fail to recognize the danger posed by the tumor and suppress the activity of potentially tumor-fighting white blood cells. We believe that using a monoclonal antibody to signal through GITR could inhibit the immunosuppressive activities of T regulatory cells. In addition, cancer cells promote these suppressor cells by producing anti-inflammatory molecules, such as DKK1. We believe that monoclonal antibodies that reduce the levels of anti-inflammatory molecules, such as 
 4

   DKK1, in the tumor microenvironment could result in the inhibition of immune suppressor cells and create a pro-inflammatory environment to enhance the immune system activity against the tumor. 
         By targeting novel pathways and immune cell types, our therapies are designed to be ideal to combine with existing drugs and have the potential to significantly increase the survival and quality of life of cancer patients. The figure below illustrates the biology underlying our approach:

     DKN-01 
         Dickkopf-related protein 1, or DKK1, is a cell secreted protein that research has found plays a crucial role in embryonic development. DKK1 binds to specific cell surface receptors and affects the signaling of key cellular pathways, known as the canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways. DKK1 serves as one of the inhibitors of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway and modulates the non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways. Changes in these pathways can lead to the expression of several cancer-causing genes and factors associated with cell growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis. DKK1 also has a role in suppressing the immune system from effectively targeting and clearing the cancer. 
         Published data indicates that DKK1 expression levels are significantly higher in many cancers, including esophageal cancer, or EC, biliary tract cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC. In addition, elevated DKK1 expression is associated with worse overall survival for patients with EC, biliary tract cancer and NSCLC. Researchers have shown that when the DKK1 protein is added in certain animal models, the cancer grows larger. 
         Recent publications have also demonstrated a role for DKK1 in maintaining an environment around a tumor that suppresses the immune system's ability to clear the tumor and to prevent metastasis. DKK1 has been shown to activate the suppressive effects of myeloid-derived suppressor cells, or MDSC, a type of white blood cell that can potently block other immune system cells. Other published data has shown that metastatic tumor cells with stem cell-like features avoid the immune system by overexpressing DKK1 and secreting it out of the cell. Secreted DKK1 can then down-regulate certain molecules on tumor cells known as natural killer cell activating ligands, or NK ligands, that would activate the immune system, causing these cancer cells to remain invisible to and evade the immune system. Through these multiple activities, research has shown that DKK1 helps protect the cancer cells from being targeted by the immune system. 
         Preclinical studies that we and others have conducted demonstrated that using an anti-DKK1 antibody led to clinical benefits in xenograft cancer models. The anti-DKK1 antibody is believed to shift canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling to healthy levels, thereby resulting in a direct anti-tumor effect as well as a local anti-angiogenic effect in the diseased tissue. In another model, blocking DKK1 activity using an anti-DKK1 antibody was shown by researchers to impede the suppressive effects of tumor-protecting MDSC and increased the activity of anti-tumor white blood cells in the tumor microenvironment. In these models, researchers demonstrated that an anti-DKK1 antibody allowed the immune system to recognize and attack the cancer cells. We believe that the more selective and local the activity is to the tumor, the more likely a drug will be safe and well tolerated and a potential combination partner to other anti-cancer drugs. 
         DKN-01 is a high affinity, neutralizing monoclonal antibody targeting DKK1. We have shown that DKN-01 reduces free DKK1 levels and has demonstrated an anti-tumor effect in preclinical models. DKN-01 is currently being tested in clinical trials for patients with EC in combination with paclitaxel, in patients with biliary tract cancer in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin, and has previously been tested as a monotherapy in patients with NSCLC and in a pilot study in patients with multiple myeloma in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone. 
 


Phase 1 Monotherapy Studies 


First-in-human study 

         Our first-in-human study of DKN-01 was a single ascending dose Phase 1 trial in patients with low bone density. DKN-01 was administered by intravenous infusion at doses from 7 mg to 300 mg and as a subcutaneous injection at a dose of 44 mg. Eight subjects were treated per cohort, five of whom received DKN-01 and three of whom received placebo, for a total of 48 subjects in six cohorts. There 
 6

   were no adverse events deemed by the physician to be related to DKN-01, or treatment-related adverse events, and no clinically significant safety signals observed. 
 


Advanced Solid Tumors or Multiple Myeloma Study 

         We conducted study P100, a two-part dose-finding Phase 1 study, to establish the safety, maximum tolerated dose, and antitumor activity of DKN-01 as a monotherapy for patients with advanced malignancies. Other endpoints were progression free survival, or PFS, overall response rate, or ORR, and overall survival, or OS. Part A of the study was a dose escalation designed to evaluate increasing doses of DKN-01 between 75 mg and 600 mg administered weekly or biweekly in a 28 day cycle. Part B of the study was an expansion cohort designed to evaluate the activity of DKN-01 as a single agent in patients with advanced NSCLC. For Part B, DKN-01 was administered to refractory NSCLC patients at 300 mg on days 1 and 15 of each 28 day cycle. 
         We enrolled 32 patients in Parts A and B, 24 of whom were patients with NSCLC. DKN-01 was well tolerated with no dose limiting toxicities, or DLTs, or serious adverse events, or SAEs, that were deemed by the physician to be related to DKN-01 treatment. All of the treatment-related adverse events were Grade 1 or Grade 2, the two lowest severity levels. There were no treatment-related SAEs, and no adverse events that emerged or worsened following treatment, but were not deemed to be related to DKN-01 treatment, referred to as treatment-emergent adverse events or TEAEs, leading to study discontinuation. TEAEs were generally those typically observed in cancer patients; and the most frequently reported treatment-related TEAEs were fatigue (25%) and nausea (9.4%). 
         Monotherapy administration of DKN-01 in patients with refractory NSCLC demonstrated clinical activity, with a clinical benefit rate of 45.9%, including one NSCLC patient (4.2%) with more than a 30% reduction in the size of their tumor, referred to as a partial response or PR. In the Part B group of NSCLC patients who were dosed at a level of 300 mg every two weeks, the clinical benefit rate was 47.4%, including the patient with the partial response (5.3%). Patients with more than 20% growth in the size of their tumor are considered to have progressive disease, or PD. Median PFS in the evaluable Part B NSCLC patients was 2.2 months and median OS was 6.6 months. Data from this study was presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology, or ASCO, Annual Meeting in 2014. 
         We believe that DKN-01 may be a targeted treatment for NSCLC and that the clinical profile supports further NSCLC development in combination with other anti-cancer agents, including chemotherapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors. 
 


Esophagogastric Cancer 

         Published studies and our internal preclinical studies have demonstrated that the expression of DKK1 is more prominent in EC tissues when compared with the adjacent normal esophageal tissues. Our preliminary results indicate that over 85% of the EC patient tissue samples that we evaluated expressed DKK1. We believe that these studies support the hypothesis that DKK1 might be a key regulator in the progression of EC and a potential therapeutic target. 
         We are conducting study P102, a multi-part Phase 1/2 study of DKN-01 in combination with paclitaxel in advanced EC patients, all of whom have had previous treatment with standard therapies. Many of these subjects have had multiple lines of prior therapy and/or rapidly growing tumors, representing a difficult to treat population. In Part A, we enrolled nine subjects in two cohorts to evaluate 150 mg and 300 mg of DKN-01 dosed every other week along with weekly paclitaxel at the standard dose. In Part B, we enrolled 20 subjects who received 300 mg of DKN-01 in combination with paclitaxel. Part C and Part D each enroll patients with a specific subtype of EC, either adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma, respectively. Part E may enroll up to 20 gastric cancer patients with specific Wnt pathway alterations. There is also a sub-study of DKN-01 as a monotherapy, without 
 7

   paclitaxel, which may enroll up to 40 patients. The study is intended to establish the safety of DKN-01 in combination with paclitaxel and has the secondary endpoints of ORR, PFS, and OS. 
         We have been collecting the results of our EC study on an ongoing basis, and preliminary data has been presented at the ASCO GI Meeting in January 2017. The data presented at ASCO GI included 44 patients with advanced esophageal and gastroesophageal junction cancers who had received between 1 and 7 prior lines of therapy. We have observed clinical activity of DKN-01 plus paclitaxel in these patients, as 10 of 41 evaluable patients (24.4%) achieved a partial response and 15 patients achieved a best overall response of stable disease (36.6%), representing a total disease control rate of 61%. 
         Our goal is to identify biomarkers or genetic alterations that could define a patient population more likely to respond to treatment with DKN-01. Four of 19 patients evaluated with genetic testing were found to have activating/stabilizing mutations of beta-catenin, which is a molecule in the Wnt signaling pathway implicated in oncogenesis, metastasis, and immune suppression. Of these 4 patients, 2 achieved partial responses and 1 had prolonged stable disease. One patient has an ongoing response exceeding 23 months, of which the past 12 months have been on DKN-01 monotherapy with continued improvements in the disease. 
         DKN-01 and paclitaxel appear to be a tolerable combination. There have been no new emerging safety concerns observed to-date in this study. The majority of adverse events were Grade 1 and 2 in severity. There have been no SAEs that were deemed by the investigators to be related to either DKN-01 or paclitaxel. We expect to present additional data from this study at medical conferences in late 2017. We believe that the results from this study support the continued development of DKN-01 in EC patients in combination with other anti-cancer agents, including chemotherapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors. 
 


Biliary Tract Cancer 

         We have initiated study P103, a three-part Phase 1/2 study of DKN-01 in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin in patients with advanced biliary tract cancer. Our preliminary results indicate that over 85% of biliary tract cancer patient tissue samples that we analyzed expressed DKK1. Patients enrolled in this study had not received prior therapy to treat their disease. We evaluated two dose levels, 150 mg and 300 mg, of DKN-01 in Part A, and then we selected the 300mg dose for further study in Part B. Part C of this study has been added to enroll an additional 20 patients to confirm the activity of the combination and to enhance biomarker collection and analysis. 
         Preliminary data from this study were presented at the Annual Meeting of the Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation in February 2017. At the selected 300mg DKN-01 dose level, 7 of 21 evaluable patients (33%) experienced a partial response and 20 patients experienced a partial response or stable disease, representing a disease control rate of 95%. Data presented from the study also showed that DKN-01 in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin resulted in statistically significant changes in inflammatory and anti-angiogenic biomarkers consistent with the anticipated mechanism of action of DKK1 inhibition. There were no reported DKN-01 related serious adverse events or dose limiting toxicities. 
         In addition, top-line preliminary PFS data has been obtained from the Part A and Part B patients treated at the 300 mg DKN-01 dose level. The preliminary median PFS of DKN-01 combination therapy was 9.4 months, while PFS for standard of care agents has been reported at six to eight months. Additional data from this study has been submitted for presentation at an upcoming medical meeting. 
         We believe that the results from this study support the continued development of DKN-01 in biliary tract cancer patients in combination with other anti-cancer agents, including chemotherapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors.

Future Studies 

         We are planning to conduct multiple future clinical trials that combine DKN-01 with chemotherapy, such as with gemcitabine and cisplatin in biliary tract cancer or paclitaxel in EC, and with other immuno-oncology therapies, such as PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies or TRX518. Because DKN-01's mechanism of action combines cell signaling and enhancing a pro-inflammatory tumor microenvironment, we believe DKN-01 has potential as a targeted cancer treatment in EC, biliary tract cancer, NSCLC, and potentially other tumor types, such as uterine/endometrioid, liver, pancreatic, and prostate cancers and multiple myeloma. 
   TRX518 
         The human immune system has the ability to adapt to and attack foreign cells, or non-self cells, and in doing so it recognizes danger with the goal of protecting the body from harm. It has been well established that cancer cells develop mechanisms to suppress the body's natural immune response and evade destruction by immune cells. Activating signals to augment an immune response in cancer, or costimulation, is a strategy that is being explored by using agonist antibodies targeting activating receptors on immune cells. This strategy is expected to overcome suppressive mechanisms that would prevent these immune system cells from attacking a tumor. Agonist antibodies that costimulate the immune system have the potential to be combined with established therapies such as chemotherapy or checkpoint inhibitors to enable the immune system to yield a robust anti-tumor immune response. 
         We believe glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor-related receptor, or GITR, is an ideal target for costimulation as it is an activating receptor present on a wide range of naive and activated immune system cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ T effector cells, T regulatory cells, natural killer cells, granulocytes, mast cells and monocytes/macrophages. The expression and activation of GITR has been shown to enhance an antigen-specific inflammatory response. Preclinical studies demonstrated that GITR activation led to robust clinical benefits in multiple animal models. GITR agonist antibodies have been found to be effective in combination with chemotherapies, checkpoint inhibitors, and vaccines in various preclinical cancer and vaccine models. 
         TRX518 is a high affinity GITR agonist monoclonal antibody that binds to GITR and generates a signal in the target cell. We expect TRX518 binding to GITR to generate a sufficient signal to enhance the activity of anti-tumor immune system cells and impede the activity of immune system cells that protect the tumor. TRX518 was specifically engineered with a modification in its amino acid backbone sequence, or Fc region, to prevent binding to certain complementary receptors on other immune system cells, or Fc receptors, that would lead to the killing of GITR-expressing cells. We believe that depleting GITR-expressing cells would be harmful in that it would limit efficacy and create a theoretical risk of breakthrough autoimmune disease. Our goal in designing TRX518 was to optimize the efficacy and safety profile of the antibody, as our preclinical studies confirmed activity without Fc receptor binding and demonstrated comparable efficacy to Fc receptor binding intact antibodies. 
         In a recent publication, an Fc inactive GITR agonist antibody was evaluated against an Fc intact GITR agonist antibody, alone and in combination with radiation, in a model of murine glioblastoma. The results demonstrated that the Fc inactive GITR agonist antibody was effective in the model in combination with radiation, whereas the Fc active GITR agonist was not effective, either alone or in combination with radiation. We believe that the removal of Fc function represents an advantage to our GITR agonist antibody and a differentiator from other competing GITR agonist antibodies.

Single Ascending Dose Monotherapy 

         We are conducting study 001, a Phase 1 study of TRX518 as a monotherapy in adults with refractory solid tumors, initially to evaluate the safety of increasing single doses between 0.0001 mg/kg and 8.0 mg/kg. Exploratory objectives include evaluating for immune system responses to tumor antigens and demonstrating evidence of biological activity. The single dose portion of the study has been completed. 
         In the study, no maximum tolerated dose was reached for the single administration of TRX518, with few related treatment-emergent adverse events, all Grade 1 and 2, and no reported autoimmune events. We have observed doses where all the GITR receptors have been bound by TRX518, and this binding lasts for at least several days. We believe that binding at this level is essential to generating sufficient signaling and agonist activity. There have been signs of immune system activation and biological activity in some patients, including evidence of T regulatory cell modulation in the blood and in tumors. Initial data from this study was presented at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) in November 2016. Additional data from this study will be presented at the American Association for Cancer Research 2017 Annual Meeting in April. We believe that the favorable profile and kinetics of TRX518 in this first-in-human, single-dose safety study enabled advancing development to multi-dose studies. 
 


Multiple Dose Studies 

         We are conducting study 003, a two-part, multiple dose Phase 1 study of TRX518 as a monotherapy in adults with advanced solid tumors. Part A of the study is designed to evaluate the safety of escalating doses of TRX518 between 1.0 mg/kg and 4.0 mg/kg. The initial three cohorts were administered as weekly doses to the patient over a three week cycle. Additional cohorts are evaluating the strategy of using a larger initial dose and lower subsequent doses to patients. Part B is designed to be an expansion cohort of up to 20 patients that will use the preferred dosing strategy identified during Part A. Exploratory objectives include evaluating for objective responses, PFS, and demonstrating evidence of immune system activity. 
         In study 003 to date, TRX518 have been found to have dose proportional increases in TRX518 exposure. Two of three patients in the 2 mg/kg weekly dosing cohort have had stable disease, one of whom had a reduction in their index lesions, and two of three patients in the 1 mg/kg cohort have had stable disease, one of whom maintained stable disease for eight cycles of therapy receiving 24 doses of TRX518. We are continuing to enroll patients in this study. 
         We have also amended study 001 to permit the administration of multiple doses of TRX518 to patients in additional cohorts. These multiple dose monotherapy cohorts are open for enrollment. 
 


Future Studies 

         TRX518 was the first GITR agonist antibody tested in humans. We are planning to conduct multiple future clinical trials that combine TRX518 with chemotherapy or other immuno-therapies, including DKN-01. We believe that the use of TRX518 in immuno-responsive tumors, such as NSCLC, melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, gastric, or bladder cancer, could become an important factor in optimizing outcomes for cancer patients. Additionally, because of its distinctive mechanism of action as apart from other checkpoint inhibitors, we believe TRX518 has the potential to restore immune system activity in previously immune unresponsive tumors. 
   Intellectual Property 
         We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to our business, including seeking, maintaining and defending patent rights. We 
 10

   also rely on confidential know-how that may be important to the development of our business. We protect our confidential know-how as trade secrets and through confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and others. We additionally expect to rely on regulatory protection afforded through data exclusivity as well as patent extensions, where available. 
         Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; to defend and enforce our patents; to preserve the confidentiality of our know-how and trade secrets; and to operate without infringing the valid enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. 
         Our ability to prevent third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing competing products to ours, including a competitor to either of DKN-01 or TRX518, depends on the scope of our patents. We have several patents and patent applications relating to each of DKN-01 and TRX518 and their therapeutic uses, and possess substantial know-how relating to the development and commercialization of DKN-01 and TRX518. We cannot be sure that any of our pending patent applications or future patent filings will lead to the issuance of new patents, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be adequate to protect our market. 
         We plan on pursuing in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in our field. We expect to use trademark protection for our products as they are marketed. 
 


Patents 

         We exclusively license from Lilly rights under 19 issued patents and 7 pending patent applications, all of which belong to the same patent family. The patents and applications in this patent family are directed to the composition of matter and use of DKN-01, and include (i) one issued U.S. Patent, (ii) issued patents in the following jurisdictions: Australia, Canada, China, Eurasia, Gulf Cooperation Council, India, Israel, Japan, Lebanon, Macao, Mexico, New Zealand, Pakistan, Singapore, South Africa, Taiwan, Ukraine and South Korea and (iii) pending applications in the following jurisdictions: Argentina, Brazil, Europe (2), Hong Kong, Venezuela and Thailand. The standard 20-year term for patents in this family would expire in 2030. The U.S. patent will expire 87 days after the standard term due to patent term adjustment. Patent term extensions for delays in marketing approval may also extend the terms of patents in this family. 
         We own one U.S. provisional patent application directed to the use of a biomarker in patients receiving DKN-01 therapy. We expect to file a non-provisional patent application claiming the benefit of the pending provisional application in the second half of 2017. Any patents that may issue from such application will expire no earlier than 2037 provided that all maintenance fee payments are timely paid and no terminal disclaimers are filed. 
         We own 42 patents and 12 pending patent applications relating to TRX518 and uses thereof. The patents and applications primarily fall into two families. The standard 20-year term for U.S. patents in the first family would expire in 2026 and in the second family would expire in 2028 provided that all maintenance fee payments are timely paid and no terminal disclaimers are filed. Patent term extensions for delays in marketing approval may also extend the terms of patents in these two families. The various patent applications and patents covering TRX-518 include claims directed to compositions of matter (antibodies and antigen-binding fragments), pharmaceutical compositions, methods for inducing or enhancing an immune response, methods of treating a subject having a tumor, combination therapies, and uses of antibodies and antigen-binding fragments. Patent applications and patents claiming these subject matters have been filed and/or granted in the following jurisdictions: United States, Australia, Canada, Europe (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, 
 11

   Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom), Hong Kong, India and Japan. 
 


Patent Term 

         The base term of a U.S. patent is 20 years from the filing date of the earliest-filed non-provisional patent application from which the patent claims priority. The term of a U.S. patent can be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates the owner of the patent for administrative delays at the USPTO. In some cases, the term of a U.S. patent is shortened by a terminal disclaimer that reduces its term to that of an earlier-expiring patent. 
         The term of a U.S. patent may be eligible for patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act or Hatch-Waxman Amendment, to account for at least some of the time a product is under development and regulatory review after the patent is granted. With regard to a product for which FDA approval is the first permitted marketing of the active ingredient, the Hatch-Waxman Act allows for extension of protection of one U.S. patent that includes at least one claim covering the composition of matter of an FDA-approved product, an FDA-approved method of treatment using the product, and/or a method of manufacturing the FDA-approved product. The extended protection cannot exceed the shorter of five years beyond the non-extended expiration of the patent or 14 years from the date of the FDA approval of the product. Some foreign jurisdictions, including Europe, have patent extension provisions (e.g., supplementary protection certificates), which allow for extension of the protection of a patent that covers a drug approved by the applicable foreign regulatory agency. In the future, if and when each of DKN-01 or TRX518 receives FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extension to extend the protection of one of our U.S. patents covering DKN-01, or its use, and one of our U.S. patents covering TRX518, or its use. We also may pursue extensions in foreign jurisdictions where applicable. 
 


Lilly License Agreement 

         On January 3, 2011, we entered into a license agreement with Lilly, pursuant to which Lilly granted us an exclusive license for certain intellectual property rights relating to pharmaceutically active compounds that may be useful in the treatment of bone healing, cancer and, potentially, other medical conditions. Such license includes a right to sublicense, under certain Lilly intellectual property rights to further develop and commercialize, on a worldwide basis, pharmaceutical products containing such licensed compounds. 
         Pursuant to the Lilly Agreement, we granted to Lilly 657,614 shares of common stock and agreed to pay Lilly a royalty in the low single digits of net sales of a particular product in the territory during the applicable royalty term, with certain adjustments to be made to the royalty rate in connection with third person intellectual property, sales of competing products, and sales of biosimilar or generic products. We have not yet paid any royalties to Lilly pursuant to this agreement. 
         The royalty term, with respect to each country in which a product is sold, on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis, begins on first commercial sale of the product in the country and the later of (i) the tenth anniversary of the first date of commercial sale of the product in the country, (ii) expiration of the last-to-expire issued patent included within the patents licensed under the Lilly Agreement having a valid claim covering the sale of the product, and (iii) the expiration of any data exclusivity period for the product in the country. 
         The term of the Lilly Agreement begins on January 3, 2011 and, unless earlier terminated pursuant to the termination provisions described below, will continue on a country-by-country basis until we have no remaining royalty or other payment obligations in a specific country. Upon expiration in a given country, the licenses granted with respect to such country shall become fully paid up, perpetual and irrevocable. 
 12

           Either party may terminate the Lilly Agreement with immediate effect if the other party enters into bankruptcy or takes similar action. We may terminate the Lilly Agreement (i) at any time without cause upon ninety (90) days written notice to Lilly or (ii) upon material breach of the Lilly Agreement by Lilly upon ninety (90) days written notice to Lilly, unless Lilly cures such breach or violation during such ninety (90) day period. Lilly may terminate the agreement (i) upon our material breach of the Lilly Agreement upon ninety (90) days written notice to us, unless we cure such breach or violation during such ninety (90) day period or (ii) if we challenge, or materially assist any third person to challenge, the validity or enforceability of the licensed intellectual property that is the subject of the Lilly Agreement upon thirty (30) days written notice to us, unless we cure such breach or violation during such thirty (30) day period. 
         If Lilly terminates the Lilly Agreement or if we terminate the Lilly Agreement without cause, (i) all rights under the licensed intellectual property rights will terminate and immediately and automatically revert to Lilly, (ii) any sublicense will be assigned by us to Lilly so that such sublicense becomes a direct license between Lilly and such sublicensee, (iii) subject to certain limitations, we will be required to grant to Lilly an irrevocable, non-exclusive, perpetual, fully paid up license under all patent rights developed or acquired by us during the term of the Lilly Agreement that relate to the Lilly licensed intellectual property, (iv) subject to certain limitations, we will be required to grant to Lilly an irrevocable, non-exclusive, perpetual, fully paid up license to the results of data from all preclinical and clinical studies of any compound or product covered by the Lilly Agreement, (v) subject to certain limitations, we will be required to take all steps necessary to permit Lilly to commence marketing product covered by the Lilly Agreement, and (vi) we will be required to assign or re-assign to Lilly all Lilly patents covered by the Lilly Agreement and that were assigned by Lilly to us. If we terminate the Lilly Agreement for material breach by Lilly or Lilly's bankruptcy, the licenses will remain in full force and effect and we will remain liable for the payment of all royalty obligations under the Lilly Agreement. However, in this case, we may offset against such royalties any damages that we are entitled to for breach of the Lilly Agreement by Lilly. 
         The Lilly Agreement also contains certain standard representations and warranties and certain standard confidentiality and indemnification provisions. 
   Lonza License Agreement 
         On May 28, 2015, we entered into a license agreement with Lonza Sales AG, pursuant to which Lonza granted us a world-wide, non-exclusive license for certain intellectual property rights relating to a gene expression system, solutions of nutrients used in mammalian cell culture and related know-how and patent rights to use, test, develop, manufacture, market, sell offer for sale, distribute, import and export DKN-01. Such license includes a right to sublicense to (i) a competing contract manufacturer solely for the purpose of such manufacturer producing DKN-01 and (ii) our affiliates and strategic partners solely for undertaking commercial activities. 
         In exchange for the license and sublicense described above, we agreed to pay to Lonza a low single-digit royalty calculated as a percentage of net sales on DKN-01. In addition, in connection with DKN-01 manufactured by Lonza, or a strategic partner of Lonza, we agreed to pay (i) an annual payment to Lonza beginning on the date of initiation of phase 1 clinical trials for DKN-01 and (ii) an increased annual payment to Lonza beginning on the date of initiation of phase 2 clinical trials for DKN-01, for so long as Lonza, or a strategic partner of Lonza, manufactures DKN-01. In connection with DKN-01 manufactured by any other party, we agreed to pay (i) an annual amount to Lonza per sublicense beginning on the commencement date of such sublicense and continuing for so long as the sublicense exists and (ii) a low single-digit royalty calculated as a percentage of net sales of DKN-01. All royalty amounts are subject to certain adjustments if, on a country-by-country basis, the manufacture and/or sale of DKN-01 are not protected by a valid claim. All royalty obligations will expire on a country-by-country basis upon the later of (i) the expiration, revocation or complete 
 13

   rejection of all valid claims covering product in such country or (ii) ten (10) years from first commercial sale of DKN-01 in such country. 
         The Lonza Agreement will remain in force in each country of the world until either the expiration of the last valid patent claim or for so long as the know-how is identified and remains secret and substantial, whichever is later. Upon expiration of the Lonza Agreement with respect to DKN-01 in a particular country, the licenses granted under the Lonza Agreement with respect to DKN-01 in that country will become fully paid and royalty free. 
         Either party may terminate the Lonza Agreement (i) if the other party commits a breach of the Lonza Agreement and such breach is not cured within forty-five (45) days of receiving notice of the breach (or thirty (30) days in the case of payment defaults) or (ii) if the other party is unable to pay its debts and enters into compulsory or voluntary liquidation or enters into a bankruptcy or takes other similar action. We may terminate the Lonza Agreement by giving sixty (60) days written notice to Lonza. Lonza may, at its option, immediately terminate any or all of the licenses granted under the Lonza Agreement if we knowingly oppose any patent application within the patent rights granted or dispute the validity of any patent within under the Lonza Agreement or assist any third party to do so. Termination of the Lonza Agreement will terminate all licenses granted under the Lonza Agreement. 
         The Lonza Agreement also contains certain standard confidentiality and indemnification provisions. 
 


Competition 

         The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by continuing technological advancement and significant competition. While we believe that our product candidates, technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, among others. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. Key product features that would affect our ability to effectively compete with other therapeutics include the efficacy, safety and convenience of our products and the ease of use and effectiveness of any companion diagnostics. The level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors will also significantly affect the pricing and competitiveness of our products. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. 
         Many of the companies against which we may compete have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. For example, Novartis, Merck, and Pfizer are all currently developing or have previously been developing anti-DKK1 monoclonal antibodies. Additionally, Merck, Novartis, Bristol-Myers Squibb, AstraZeneca, and Incyte are all developing a GITR agonist monoclonal antibody. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. 
 14

   


Manufacturing and Distribution 

         We do not have, and we do not currently plan to acquire or develop, the facilities or capabilities to manufacture clinical trial material for use in human clinical trials or finished drug product for commercialization. We depend on third-party contract manufacturers, or CMOs, for the production of clinical trial material for our studies. Our bulk drug substance, or DS, is produced at our CMOs, Patheon Biologics and Lonza, which are required to comply with the FDA's Current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, regulations. Our finished drug product is produced at a contract fill/ finisher provider, which is also required to comply with cGMP regulations. We have personnel with significant technical, manufacturing, analytical, quality and project management experience to oversee our third-party CMOs and to manage manufacturing and quality data and information for regulatory compliance purposes. 
         We must manufacture drug product for clinical trial use in compliance with cGMP. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports, and returned or salvaged products. Our third-party CMOs are also subject to periodic inspections of facilities by the FDA and other authorities, including procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of our products to assess our compliance with applicable regulations. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including warning letters, the seizure or recall of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations and civil and criminal penalties. These actions could have a material impact on the availability of our products. CMOs often encounter difficulties involving production yields, quality control and quality assurance, as well as shortages of qualified personnel. 
         We have not yet established a sales, marketing or product distribution infrastructure because our lead candidates are still in early clinical development. We eventually may, however, choose to build (or obtain through strategic acquisition) our own sales and marketing team to commercialize some or all of our products if they receive FDA approval and if it is in our long-term interests. We may also choose to enter into distribution agreements with larger strategic partners with their own robust distribution channels. 
 


Government Regulation and Product Approval 

         Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state, and local level, and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, approval, manufacture, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing, import, and export of biopharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. In addition, manufacturers of biopharmaceutical products participating in Medicaid and Medicare are required to comply with mandatory price reporting, discount, and rebate requirements. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. The following is a summary of the primary government regulations applicable to our business. 
 


FDA Regulation 

         In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, regulates biologics under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, the Public Health Services Act, or PHSA, and their implementing regulations. Any product we may develop must be cleared by the FDA before it is 
 15

   marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 

 completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA's GLP regulations; 
 submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
 approval by an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, for each clinical site, or centrally, before each trial may be initiated; 
 adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed product candidates for its intended
use, performed in accordance with GCPs; 
 development of manufacturing processes to ensure the product candidate's identity, strength, quality, and purity; 
 submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application, or BLA; 
 satisfactory completion of a FDA advisory committee review, if applicable; 
 satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the products are produced to assess
compliance with cGMPs, and to assure that the facilities, methods, and controls are adequate to preserve the therapeutics' identity, strength, quality, and purity, as well as satisfactory completion
of an FDA inspection of selected clinical sites and selected clinical investigators to determine GCP compliance; and 
 FDA review and approval of the BLA to permit commercial marketing for particular indications for use. 

   Preclinical Studies and IND Submission 
         The testing and approval process of product candidates requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of chemistry, pharmacology, toxicity, and product formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. Such studies must generally be conducted in accordance with the FDA's GLPs. Prior to commencing the first clinical trial with a product candidate, an IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests and preclinical literature, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature, and proposed clinical study protocols among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. 
         An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, notifies the applicant of safety concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. 
   Clinical Trials 
         Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with federal regulations and GCP requirements, 
 16

   which include the requirements that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial, as well as review and approval of the study by an IRB. Investigators must also provide certain information to the clinical trial sponsors to allow the sponsors to make certain financial disclosures to the FDA. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the trial procedures, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, and a statistical analysis plan. A protocol for each clinical trial, and any subsequent protocol amendments, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each study site participating in the clinical trial or a central IRB must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial, informed consent forms, and communications to study subjects before a study commences at that site. An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits and whether the planned human subject protections are adequate. The IRB must continue to oversee the clinical trial while it is being conducted. Once an IND is in effect, each new clinical protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the IND for FDA review, and to the IRB for approval. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must also be submitted at least annually to the FDA and the IRB and more frequently if serious adverse events or other significant safety information is found. 
         The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB's requirements or if the trial poses an unexpected serious harm to subjects, or may impose other conditions. We may also discontinue clinical trials as a result of risks to subjects, a lack of favorable results, or changing business priorities. 
         Information about certain clinical trials, including a description of the study and study results, must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their clinicaltrials.gov website. 
         Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group regularly reviews accumulated data and advises the study sponsor regarding the continuing safety of trial subjects, potential trial subjects, and the continuing validity and scientific merit of the clinical trial. The data safety monitoring board receives special access to unblinded data during the clinical trial and may advise the sponsor to halt the clinical trial if it determined there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or on other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. 
         The manufacture of investigational biologics for the conduct of human clinical trials is subject to cGMP requirements. Investigational biologics and active ingredients imported into the United States are also subject to regulation by the FDA relating to their labeling and distribution. Further, the export of investigational products outside of the United States is subject to regulatory requirements of the receiving country as well as U.S. export requirements under the FDCA. 
         In general, for purposes of BLA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined. 
 

Phase 1Studies are initially conducted in healthy human volunteers or
subjects with the target disease or condition and test the product candidate for safety, dosage tolerance, target engagement, mechanism of action, absorption, metabolism, distribution, and excretion.
If possible, Phase 1 trials may also be used to gain an initial indication of product effectiveness. 

 17

   

Phase 2Controlled studies are conducted in limited subject populations with
a specified disease or condition to evaluate preliminary efficacy, identify optimal dosages, dosage tolerance and schedule, possible adverse effects and safety risks, and expanded evidence of safety. 
Phase 3These adequate and well-controlled clinical trials are undertaken in
expanded subject populations, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to generate enough data to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and safety of the
product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. Typically, two Phase 3 trials are
required by the FDA for product approval. 

         The FDA may also require, or companies may conduct, additional clinical trials for the same indication after a product is approved. These so-called Phase 4 studies may be made a condition to be satisfied after approval. The results of Phase 4 studies can confirm the effectiveness of a product candidate and can provide important safety information. 
         Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Regulatory authorities, an IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk, the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the FDA's or the IRB's requirements, the product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to the subjects, or based on evolving business objectives or competitive climate. 
         Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency, and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
         During the development of a new therapeutic, a sponsor may be able to request a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, the purpose of which is to reach agreement with the FDA on the Phase 3 clinical trial protocol design and analysis that will form the primary basis of product approval and an efficacy claim as well as preclinical carcinogenicity trials and stability studies. An SPA may only be modified with the agreement of the FDA and the trial sponsor or if the director of the FDA reviewing division determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or efficacy of the product was identified after the testing began. An SPA is intended to provide assurance that, in the case of clinical trials, if the agreed upon clinical trial protocol is followed, the clinical trial endpoints are achieved, and there is a favorable risk-benefit profile, the data may serve as the primary basis for an efficacy claim in support of a BLA. However, SPA agreements are not a guarantee of an approval of a product candidate or any permissible claims about the product candidate. In particular, SPAs are not binding on the FDA if, among other reasons, previously unrecognized public health concerns arise during the performance of the clinical trial, other new scientific concerns regarding the product candidate's safety or efficacy arise, or if the sponsoring company fails to comply with the agreed upon clinical trial protocol. 
   BLA Submission, Review by the FDA, and Marketing Approval 
         Assuming successful completion of the required clinical and preclinical testing, the results of product development, including chemistry, manufacture, and controls, non-clinical studies, and clinical trial results, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, are all submitted to the FDA, along with the proposed labeling, as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product 
 18

   for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of a BLA is subject to a substantial application user fee. These user fees must be paid at the time of the first submission of the application, even if the application is being submitted on a rolling basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances. One basis for a waiver of the application user fee is if the applicant employs fewer than 500 employees, including employees of affiliates, the applicant does not have an approved marketing application for a product that has been introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce, and the applicant, including its affiliates, is submitting its first marketing application. Product candidates that are designated as orphan drugs, which are further described below, are also not subject to application user fees unless the application includes an indication other than the orphan indication. 
         In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or supplement to a BLA for a new active ingredient, indication, dosage form, dosage regimen, or route of administration, must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. 
         The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to ensure that the benefits of the biologic outweigh the risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools. An assessment of the REMS must also be conducted at set intervals. Following product approval, a REMS may also be required by the FDA if new safety information is discovered and the FDA determines that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the biologic outweigh the risks. 
         Once the FDA receives an application, it has 60 days to review the BLA to determine if it is substantially complete to permit a substantive review, before it accepts the application for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept a BLA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. 
         Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA has set the review goal of completing its review of 90% of all applications within ten months from the 60-day filing date for its initial review of an initial BLA. Such deadlines are referred to as the PDUFA date. The PDUFA date is only a goal, thus, the FDA does not always meet its PDUFA dates. The review process and the PDUFA date may also be extended if the FDA requests or the sponsor otherwise provides substantial additional information or clarification regarding the submission. 
         The FDA may also refer certain applications to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, which review, evaluate, and make a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 19



        The FDA reviews applications to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and whether the manufacturing methods and controls are adequate to assure and preserve the product's identity, strength, quality, safety, potency, and purity. Before approving a BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured, referred to as a Pre-Approval Inspection. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities, including contract manufacturers and subcontractors, are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA the FDA will inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs. 
         The approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve a BLA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than an applicant interprets the same data. 
         After evaluating the BLA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a Complete Response Letter, or CRL. If a CRL is issued, the applicant may either: resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter; withdraw the application; or request an opportunity for a hearing. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval and describes all of the specific deficiencies that the FDA identified in the BLA. A CRL generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the BLA, and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes; or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA's satisfaction, the FDA may issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. 
         Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings, or precautions be included in the product labeling, including a boxed warning, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a product's safety and efficacy after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may also not approve label statements that are necessary for successful commercialization and marketing. 
         After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. The FDA may also withdraw the product approval if compliance with the pre- and post-marketing regulatory standards are not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. Further, should new safety information arise, additional testing, product labeling, or FDA notification may be required. 
 


Biosimilars, Orphan Drugs, and Exclusivity 

         The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, creates an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be highly similar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. Biosimilarity sufficient to reference a prior FDA-approved 
 20

   product requires a high similarity to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components, and no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. Biosimilarity must be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and at least one clinical trial, absent a waiver by FDA. There must be no difference between the reference product and a biosimilar in conditions of use, route of administration, dosage form, and strength. A biosimilar product may be deemed interchangeable with a prior approved product if it meets the higher hurdle of demonstrating that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the process by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation which are still being evaluated by the FDA. 
         A reference biologic is granted 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product, and no application for a biosimilar can be submitted for four years from the date of licensure of the reference product. However, certain changes and supplements to an approved BLA, and subsequent applications filed by the same sponsor, manufacturer, licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity do not qualify for the twelve year exclusivity period. 
         The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives for the development of products intended to treat rare diseases or conditions, which generally are diseases or conditions affecting less than 200,000 individuals annually in the United States, or affecting more than 200,000 in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States will be recovered from United States sales. Additionally, sponsors must present a plausible hypothesis for clinical superiority to obtain orphan designation if there is a product already approved by the FDA that is intended for the same indication and that is considered by the FDA to be the same as the already approved product. This hypothesis must be demonstrated to obtain orphan exclusivity. If granted, prior to product approval, Orphan Designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical study costs, tax advantages, and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is generally entitled to orphan exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same product for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity. 
   Special FDA Expedited Review and Approval Programs 
         The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track designation, priority review, and breakthrough designation, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of certain products that are intended for the treatment of serious or life threatening diseases or conditions, and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs or present a significant improvement over existing therapy. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new therapeutics to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures. 
         To be eligible for a Fast Track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if the product will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy, safety, or public health factors. If Fast Track designation is obtained, sponsors may be eligible for more frequent development meetings and correspondence with the FDA. In addition, the FDA may initiate review of sections of an application before the application is complete. This "rolling review" is available if the applicant 
 21

   provides and the FDA approves a schedule for the remaining information. In some cases, a Fast Track product may be eligible for accelerated approval or priority review. 
         The FDA may give a priority review designation to products that are intended to treat serious conditions and, if approved, would provide significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of serious conditions. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA is to review an application within six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines, of the 60-day filing date. 
         Drug or biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means the FDA may approve the product based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. A drug or biologic candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit duringpost-marketing studies, will allow the FDA to withdraw the drug or biologic from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug or biologic candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA. 
         Moreover, under the provisions of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, enacted in 2012, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a "breakthrough therapy." A breakthrough therapy is defined as a product that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Products designated as breakthrough therapies are eligible for the Fast Track designation features as described above, intensive guidance on an efficient development program beginning as early as Phase 1 trials, and a commitment from the FDA to involve senior managers and experienced review staff in a proactive collaborative, cross-disciplinary review. 
         Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. 
   Post-approval Requirements 
         Any products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements related to manufacturing, recordkeeping, and reporting, including adverse experience reporting, shortage reporting, and periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising, marketing, promotion, certain electronic records and signatures, and post-approval obligations imposed as a condition of approval, such as Phase 4 clinical trials, REMS, and surveillance to assess safety and effectiveness after commercialization. 
         After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. In addition, manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved 
 22

   therapeutics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, list their products, and are subject to periodic announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other requirements, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon a company and its third-party manufacturers. Manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. 
         Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval or notification before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and specifications, and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 
         Moreover, the enacted Drug Quality and Security Act, or DQSA, imposes obligations on manufacturers of biopharmaceutical products related to product tracking and tracing. Among the requirements of this legislation, manufacturers are required to provide certain information regarding the products to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, will be required to label products with a product identifier, and are required to keep certain records regarding the product. The transfer of information to subsequent product owners by manufacturers will eventually be required to be done electronically. Manufacturers must also verify that purchasers of the manufacturers' products are appropriately licensed. Further, under this legislation, manufactures will hav product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products that would result in serious adverse health consequences of death to humans, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death. Similar requirements additionally are and will be imposed through this legislation on other companies within the biopharmaceutical product supply chain, such as distributors and dispensers. 
         Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports, including annual reports and deviation reports, are required following FDA approval of a BLA. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in significant regulatory actions. Such actions may include refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold or termination of clinical trials, warning letters, untitled letters, cyber letters, modification of promotional materials or labeling, provision of corrective information, imposition of post-market requirements including the need for additional testing, imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS, product recalls, product seizures or detentions, refusal to allow imports or exports, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, FDA debarment, injunctions, fines, consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment from receiving government contracts, and new orders under existing contracts, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties, including fines and imprisonment, and result in adverse publicity, among other adverse consequences.
