 Principal Products and Services
 We are a top-ranked cybersecurity, privacy and compliance service provider operating under the CynergisTek, Redspin and Backbone Consultants brands. We support the United States healthcare market to help organizations identify and protect against the ever-changing threat factors, to mature their security and privacy programs aligned to the globally recognized NIST frameworks and comply with regulations and standards including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”) Breach Notification Rule, Federal Trade Commission consumer protection guidelines and state privacy standards.
 
Our IT Security business founded in 2004, is one of the few consulting and advisory companies focused in the healthcare industry. Our years of experience of understanding the industry’s unique challenges allows us to provide our customers with services designed around industry best practices and a methodology to evaluate the rigor and effectiveness of their programs to improve security controls, policies and procedures and to protect patient health information. Our team of subject matter experts and consultants are comprised of knowledgeable professionals who have learned their craft both in the classroom and through years of practical on-the-job experience, including as policy makers, attorneys and leaders in cybersecurity, privacy and compliance. 
 
Our services are categorized into four groups which are assessment and audit, technical testing, program development and remediation, and monitoring and advisory services. Fifty percent of these services are delivered under three year recurring managed services agreements with the rest provided under consulting or professional services engagements.
 ·
Assessment and Audit Services - identify and measure security and privacy risk of an organization’s readiness and verify and validate their programs meet compliance and business objectives. 
·
Technical Testing Services - test the effectiveness of controls in an organization’s environment.
·
Program Development and Remediation Services - develop policies and procedures and playbooks to help build out a fully comprehensive risk management program and provide resources to help organizations prioritize, implement and execute initiatives to strengthen their security and privacy programs. 
·
Monitoring and Advisory Services - provide on-going management and oversight of specific components of an organization’s security and privacy programs to address or give alerts when an issue arises and to offer our expertise that they need to accelerate the effectiveness of their programs.

As of March 20, 2019, the Company was focused exclusively on cybersecurity and privacy. Prior to March 20, 2019, we also provided managed print services (MPS). See Note 19 regarding discontinued operations.
 Competition
 The competition in the healthcare industry market for cybersecurity, privacy and compliance services generally come from large or niche consulting and technology firms and regional companies that offer multiple approaches but within a much smaller geographic footprint. Examples include companies like Deloitte, Dell Secureworks, Fire Eye, Coal Fire, Fortified Health Security, Meditology and Clearwater Consulting. 
 We believe our analysis of the competitive landscape shows a very strong opportunity to provide the healthcare and adjacent industries with services to support the demand for security and privacy assessments,

program development, offensive security testing and managed services, and we believe that we have a strong competitive position in the marketplace due to several important factors:
 ·
We are not aware of many other vendors or service providers which have the majority of their business dedicated to addressing the healthcare industry. Our expertise and the depth of our client relationships are unmatched in the market.
·
We believe our offering provides a unique approach to address workforce and expertise shortages. We are able to deploy knowledgeable resources to perform a predefined security role on-site or virtually for a defined amount of time, which results in our customers receiving staff with expertise they need while controlling their costs.
·
We are not restricted to any single supplier, which allows us to bring the best hardware and software solutions to our customers. Our approach is to use the most appropriate technology to provide a superior solution without any prejudice as to manufacturer or developer.
·
We believe our relationship with healthcare providers gives us an advantage when targeting the larger pool of potential clients in the business associate category, including leading Electronic Health Record (EHR) providers and medical device manufacturers who have recently been added as clients.
·
We have a strong referral base within healthcare as a result of serving more than a thousand hospitals and other healthcare clients under managed services agreements.
·
Our employees have a broad experience in and outside of healthcare to bring a wide range of knowledge and best practices. We have employees who formerly worked for the Office of Civil Rights, were Chief Information Security Officers, Chief Information Officers and Chief Compliance Officers at some of the leading healthcare institutions. In addition, our subject matter experts and consultants maintain multiple industry certifications including CISSP, CISM, CGEIT, CRISC, CISA, CBCP, CCIE, CCNP, CCNA, CHPC, CHRC, CHC, CIPP, CHPS, MCSE, SCSA, SCNA, CIA, ISSMP, and ISSAP.
Customers
 Most of our customers are considered part of the healthcare industry and third parties who provide services to the healthcare industry but also include customers that operate in a variety of industries, including education, financial services, government, Internet and media, and manufacturing.  The loss of any key customer could have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition, business, prospects and results of operation.  During the year ended December 31, 2019, our largest customer represented approximately 14% of our revenues.
Intellectual Property
 Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core intellectual property. We rely on, among other things, confidentiality safeguards and procedures, and employee non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. We also license software from third parties for integration into our procedures, including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms.
 We control access to and use of our proprietary information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, end-customers and partners, and our intellectual property is protected by U.S. and international trade secret laws. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary information, unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information without our permission.
 We maintain a database that contains the results of our assessment efforts. This allows us to anticipate our customers’ future needs by developing or offering existing services to meet those needs. These databases provide us with exclusive insight into the state of cybersecurity of our customers and the healthcare industry. We consider our intellectual property an important and valuable asset that enhances our competitive position.
 We have a registered trademark for the name “CynergisTek” and for the Company’s logo.
