ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
 CloudCommerce, Inc. (“CloudCommerce,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company”) is a leading provider of digital advertising solutions. Our flagship solution, SWARM, analyzes a robust mix of audience data to help businesses find who to talk to, what to say to them, and how to market to them. We do this by applying advanced data science, behavioral science, artificial intelligence, and market research techniques to discover, develop and create custom audiences for highly targeted digital marketing campaigns. CloudCommerce was Ranked Number 300th Fastest Growing Company in North America on Deloitte’s 2020 Technology Fast 500™. 
SWARM- An Audience Intelligence Solution
 SWARM is an end-to-end solution that helps businesses find who to talk to, what to say to them, and how to motivate them to take meaningful action. It does this by applying advanced data science, behavioral science, artificial intelligence, and market research techniques to discover, develop and create custom audiences for any business activity. With applications such as marketing, brand perception, customer relationship management, human resources management and operational logistics, SWARM delivers powerful audience-driven business intelligence to convert opportunities into business success.
The Problem
 Marketers have largely taken a blanket approach to communication. The same message is often sent across an entire customer audience with little regard for how different groups of people communicate, build communities, and develop their purchasing habits. When they do segment audiences, they tend to use very objective selection criteria, such as income, geography, education or purchase history to deduce attitudes or intentions.
 However, research has shown that attitudes and intentions are weak predictors of behavior, which is ultimately what marketers want to influence and affect.  Instead, we believe motivations and feelings are much better at predicting behavior. But they are also can be the hardest to deduce from audience data.
 The Solution – SWARM
 SWARM is a behavioral science approach to audience creation and communication. It helps marketers probe deep consumer motivations and triggers, in order to effectively predict and influence their actions. We believe if marketers can influence action, they can get people to buy, change the opinion of, or support a particular brand, business, or person.
 There are 4 major products in SWARM:
 BUZZ - Behavior Based Market Research
 We believe that market research is evolving and that the techniques being developed today are more sophisticated and backed by strong data science. Despite these changes, many traditional research firms have failed to innovate, Small sample sizes, survey design bias, improper weighting, and gut intuition sampling are just some of the issues that plague the industry. BUZZ is designed with the ability to put a finger on the pulse of the marketplace in the moment. It does this by deducing attitudes, emotions, and opinions from various internal and external data sources such as customer data, social media activity, or micro and macro trends. We have automated the market research process that we believe provides a level of statistical depth beyond what traditional firms can offer.
 THE SWARM – Intelligent Audience Building
 The core of our solution, and what we believe separates us from other audience data companies, is our unique approach to audience building. The concept of ‘personas’ has been around for decades, but we aim take that general concept to the next level. THE SWARM was developed to solve not only who to talk to, but also what to say to them, and how to motivate them to take meaningful action. Using our proprietary clustering and behavioral analysis techniques, we believe we are able to create audiences that are more efficient, targeted, and focused than traditional methods. Our clustering is designed to not only find the right people to talk to, but also the message that motivate them.

HIVE – Redefined Geographic Targeting
 Our approach is based on our belief that conventional geographic audience targeting is outdated. Arbitrary units of location like counties, cities, designated market areas, and regions were created hundreds of years ago based on land rights ownership. We believe their use in understanding people’s behavior, purchase habits, and underlying values is minimal. We try to solve this by clustering people into granular geographic tribes, called “Hives.” We define Hives by attributes such as common language (e.g., colloquialisms), shared experience and narratives (e.g., climate, history), and concentrated demography and biology (e.g., ethnicity, age). Based on the needs of our clients, we can redraw the geographic lines based on various Hive selection criteria, which can make marketing more efficient, business decisions more intelligent, and growth more plausible.
 HONEY – Advanced Reporting and Visualization
 We believe advanced audience data analysis technologies are useless if they do not produce simple, powerful and actionable business intelligence. HONEY comes with user-friendly reporting and visualization tools intended to organize and explain all of the advance data science into a simple to understand format for decision makers. HONEY is designed to combine the intelligence of client CRM data with third-party consumer data and targeted market research to create a powerful foundation for any audience intelligence solution.
 Comprehensive Product Ecosystem
 We are constantly striving to help our clients better understand both their current audience and the larger marketplace. Our team has developed a series of products intended to challenge the status quo of how intelligence is done within the marketing industry. Each of our products can stand alone, but grow more powerful as part of a larger ecosystem.

 CloudCommerce can deliver end-to-end marketing solutions through a range of services and capabilities. SWARM implementations can include some or all of these capabilities.

We have data analytics expertise in retail, wholesale, distribution, logistics, manufacturing, political, and several other industries.

Revenue Model
 We currently charge a fixed or variable implementation fees to design, build and execute on digital marketing campaigns, including SWARM solutions. These campaigns or custom SWARM solutions consist of professional services fees as well as mark up on media spend. Our professional services are billed at hourly or monthly rates, depending on the customer’s needs. We believe this flexibility allows us to attract customers while maximizing profits based on time and materials.
 If and when SWARM is fully developed as a self-serviced SaaS platform, we intend to adopt a recurring subscription revenue model.
 There are two ways we invoice customers 1) payment in advance with a deposit/retainer or 2) payment in arrears after the work is completed. We do not track the amounts we are paid under each method, but estimate the majority of such amounts are paid in advance. There are also two ways we charge for services: 1) fixed fee arrangement, so the price remains constant regardless of the work effort, and 2) variable fee arrangements, in which we charge for time and materials.
 In addition, we have several retainer arrangements for other services that vary in term length that provides reliable income.
 Benefits to Clients
 Our complete solution of providing robust technology along with complementary professional services delivers many benefits to our customers.
 Reduced Total Cost of Ownership and Risk
 Utilizing our services, businesses can dramatically reduce or eliminate upfront and ongoing hardware, software, maintenance and support costs associated with developing, customizing, deploying and upgrading sophisticated solutions and campaigns. They can have a global digital presence without assuming the costs and risks of developing it themselves and take immediate advantage of the investments we continually make in our digital systems and associated services. Our commitment to the latest technologies helps ensure that our clients maintain pace with industry advances.

Deployment Speed
 Businesses can reduce the time required to develop their digital presence by utilizing our outsourced business model. Typically, a new client can have their digital properties live much more quickly than if they decided to build, test and deploy resources in-house. Once they are operational, clients can make real-time changes to their digital properties, allowing them to address issues and take advantage of opportunities without technical assistance.
Focus on Core Competency
 By utilizing our services, businesses can focus on developing, marketing and selling their products rather than devoting time and resources to building and maintaining an internal infrastructure. Management can focus their time on their core business while ensuring they have access to the latest technologies, tools and expertise for running a successful digital operation.
Sales and Marketing 
 Our objective is to be the leading global provider of data-driven solutions. To achieve this objective, we have assembled a team of experts working collectively for the best interest of our customers. 
 During the client sales process, our team delivers demonstrations, presentations, proposals and contracts. Many new customers have been retained through email marketing, direct sales, and word-of-mouth referrals. Our direct sales efforts are aimed at senior marketing and information technology (IT) executives within Consumer, B2B and political organizations who are looking to create or expand their digital operations. Word-of-mouth referrals have been very valuable to us and we intend to continue nurturing our customer and industry relationships to maximize these referrals.
 In addition to our direct sales efforts and referrals, we have established and continue to explore channel partnerships to expand our customer base. Prospective channel partners include existing Technology companies, hosting providers, ERP vendors, and e-commerce marketing professionals.

In addition, we may compete with open source initiatives and custom development efforts. We operate in a rapidly growing and rapidly changing market. As a result, we expect competition to continue to increase as other established and emerging companies enter the business analytics market, as customer requirements evolve and as new products and technologies are introduced. We expect this to be particularly true with respect to our SaaS-based offering. This is a relatively new and evolving area of business analytics solutions, and we anticipate competition to increase based on customer demand for these types of products.
 Many of our competitors, particularly the large software companies named above, have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution, professional services or other resources and greater name recognition than we do. In addition, many of our competitors have strong relationships with current and potential customers and extensive knowledge of the business analytics industry. As a result, they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, for example by offering a SaaS-based product that competes with our on-premises products or our SaaS product, SWARM, or devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than us. Moreover, many of these competitors are bundling their analytics products into larger deals or maintenance renewals, often at significant discounts. Increased competition may lead to price cuts, alternative pricing structures or the introduction of products available for free or a nominal price, fewer customer orders, reduced gross margins, longer sales cycles and loss of market share. We may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors, and our business, results of operations and financial condition will be harmed if we fail to meet these competitive pressures.
 Our ability to compete successfully in our market depends on a number of factors, both within and outside of our control. Some of these factors include ease and speed of product deployment and use, discovery and visualization capabilities, analytical and statistical capabilities, performance and scalability, the quality and reliability of our customer service and support, total cost of ownership, return on investment and brand recognition. Any failure by us to compete successfully in any one of these or other areas may reduce the demand for our products, as well as adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Currently, when serving customers in the European Union, we must take precautions to maintain the General Data Protection Regulation requirements. As the United States continues to adopt similar regulations. Our software and services will comply with those requirements.
