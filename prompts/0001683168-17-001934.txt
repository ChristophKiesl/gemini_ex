 Notes to Condensed Financial Statements
 

NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)
 
NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION
 
The accompanying unaudited financial statements were prepared in accordance with instructions for Form 10-Q and, therefore, do not include information or footnotes necessary for a complete presentation of financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles US GAAP. All adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals, which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for fair presentation of the financial statements, have been included. The results of operations for the period ended December 31, 2014, are not necessarily indicative of the results which may be expected for the entire fiscal year or for any other period. For further information, refer to the financial statements and footnotes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2013 included in PureSpectrum Inc.'s Form 10-K.
 
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2014 presentation.
 
NOTE 2 – RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
 
The Company’s management does not believe that recent codified pronouncements by the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB will have a material impact on the Company’s current or future financial statements.
NOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF ORGANIZATION
 
PureSpectrum, Inc. (the “Company”), formerly International Medical Staffing, Inc., is a Delaware corporation incorporated on March 21, 2007. The Company is in the business of developing, marketing, licensing, and contract manufacturing of lighting technology for use in residential, commercial, and industrial applications worldwide.
 
The Company is authorized to issue 950 million shares, consisting of (a) 900 million shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share and (b) 50 million shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share, which may be issuable in one or more series. Each common share is entitled to one vote and shareholders have no preemptive or conversion rights. As of December 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, there were 636,368,278 and 351,691,363 common shares issued and outstanding, respectively. The Company's Board of Directors may, without further action by the shareholders, direct the issuance of preferred stock for any proper corporate purpose with preferences, voting powers, conversion rights, qualifications, special or relative rights and privileges which could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of shareholders of common stock. As of December 31, 2011, and December 31, 2010, there were 2,300,000 and 2,300,000 shares of the Company's preferred stock issued or outstanding, respectively. Each Series B preferred share entitles the holder thereof to five hundred (500) votes per share and may vote on any action requiring any class of shares to vote.
 
NOTE 4 – GOING CONCERN
 
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with US GAAP, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern and the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred net losses from operations of $758,647 for the year ended December 31, 2014. In addition, at December 31, 2014, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $219,615,127 and negative working capital of $3,098,868.
 
These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
 
The Company recorded its first revenues in October 2009 and is no longer a development stage company. The Company has not yet generated sufficient working capital to support its operations. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent, among other things, on its ability to minimize costs, enter into revenue generating contracts and obtain additional revenues to eventually attain a profitable level of operations.

The Company has been engaged in developing, marketing, licensing, and contract manufacturing of fluorescent lighting technology for use in residential, commercial, and industrial applications worldwide. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in the commercialization of the fluorescent lighting technology that will generate sufficient revenues to sustain the operations of the Company.
 
Management plans to obtain additional capital investments to enable the Company to continue operations and decrease revenues in 2014. There is no assurance that management will be able to successfully generate revenue and/or reduce expenses sufficient to attain profitability, or continue to attract the capital necessary to support the business.
 
NOTE 5 - NET LOSS PER SHARE
 
Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to commons shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period, without consideration for common stock equivalents. Diluted net loss per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities were exercised or converted into common stock using the treasury stock method. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common share equivalents outstanding for the period determined using the treasury-stock method. For purposes of this calculation, convertible preferred stock, stock options and warrants are considered to be common stock equivalents and are only included in the calculation of diluted net loss per share when their effect is dilutive.
