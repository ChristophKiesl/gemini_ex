Item 1. Business and Properties
GENERAL
Denbury Inc., a Delaware corporation, is an independent energy company with operations focused in the Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States.  The Company is differentiated by its focus on CO2 EOR and the emerging CCUS industry, supported by the Company’s CO2 EOR technical and operational expertise and its extensive CO2 pipeline infrastructure. The utilization of captured industrial-sourced CO2 in EOR significantly reduces the carbon footprint of the oil that Denbury produces, making the Company’s Scope 1 and 2 CO2 emissions negative today, with a goal to also fully offset Scope 3 CO2 emissions within this decade, primarily through increasing the amount of captured industrial-sourced CO2 used in its operations. Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Form 10-K”) we use the terms “Denbury,” “Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” to refer to Denbury Inc. and, as the context may require, its subsidiaries.
Our CO2 EOR oil recovery operations result in the associated underground storage of CO2. This means that Denbury’s activities are supporting and advancing the national energy transition today through the increasing use of industrially sourced CO2 in EOR operations, as well as building out a dedicated CCUS platform for long-term carbon management at scale.
As part of our corporate strategy, we are committed to creating long-term value for our shareholders through the following key principles:
•leverage our extensive CO2 pipeline assets and CO2 EOR expertise to expand our operations and leadership position in the emerging CCUS industry;
•seek to expand the use of industrial-sourced CO2 in our tertiary recovery operations, with an ultimate objective of producing oil with a negative carbon footprint;
•increase the value of our assets by applying our technical expertise in CO2 tertiary recovery and target specific regions where we either have, or believe we can create, a competitive advantage;
•optimize the timing and allocation of capital among our investment opportunities to maximize the rates of return on our investments;
•exercise financial discipline and maintain a strong balance sheet; and
•attract and maintain a highly competitive team of experienced and incentivized personnel.
As further described in Emergence from Voluntary Reorganization Under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code below, Denbury Inc. became the successor reporting company (the “Successor”) of Denbury Resources Inc. (the “Predecessor”) upon the Predecessor’s emergence from bankruptcy on September 18, 2020. As part of the plan of reorganization, upon emergence from bankruptcy, all of the Predecessor’s previously authorized and/or issued common stock or stock equivalents were cancelled, and new common stock was issued to the Predecessor’s debt holders and equity holders upon cancellation of approximately $2.1 billion principal amount of debt and all of the Predecessor’s equity instruments, respectively. On September 21, 2020, the Successor’s new common stock commenced trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol DEN, as distinguished from, Denbury Resources Inc.’s common stock having been publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange since 1997. Our corporate headquarters is located at 5851 Legacy Circle, Plano, Texas 75024, and our phone number is 972-673-2000.
We make our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, available free of charge on or through our website, www.denbury.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).  The SEC also maintains a website, http://www.sec.gov, which contains periodic reports on Forms 8-K, 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC, along with other reports, proxy and information statements and other information filed by Denbury.
Emergence from Voluntary Reorganization Under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code
On July 30, 2020, Denbury Resources Inc. and its subsidiaries filed petitions for reorganization in a “prepackaged” voluntary bankruptcy under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (the “Bankruptcy Court”) under the caption “In re Denbury Resources Inc., et al., Case No. 20-33801”. On September

Denbury Inc.

2, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming the prepackaged joint plan of reorganization (the “Plan”) and approving the Disclosure Statement, and on September 18, 2020 (the “Emergence Date”), the Plan became effective in accordance with its terms and the Company emerged from Chapter 11 as the successor reporting company of Denbury Resources Inc. On April 23, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court entered a final decree closing the Chapter 11 case captioned “In re Denbury Resources Inc., et al., Case No. 20-33801”; therefore, we have no remaining obligations related to this reorganization.
Upon emergence from bankruptcy, we met the criteria and were required to adopt fresh start accounting in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Codification (“FASC”) Topic 852, Reorganizations. Fresh start accounting requires that new fair values be established for the Company’s assets, liabilities and equity as of the Emergence Date, and therefore certain values and operational results of the condensed consolidated financial statements subsequent to September 18, 2020 are not comparable to those in the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements prior to, and including September 18, 2020. The Emergence Date fair values of the Successor’s assets and liabilities differ materially from their recorded values as reflected on the historical balance sheets of the Predecessor contained in periodic reports previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. References to “Successor” relate to the financial position and results of operations of the Company subsequent to September 18, 2020, and references to “Predecessor” relate to the financial position and results of operations of the Company prior to, and including, September 18, 2020.
BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND 2021 DEVELOPMENTS
Oil prices generally constitute the single largest variable in our operating results. Over the last several years, oil prices have been extremely volatile, with NYMEX WTI oil prices averaging approximately $57 per barrel in 2019, $39 per barrel in 2020 and $68 per barrel in 2021. The impact of the COVID-19 coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic caused a rapid and precipitous drop in oil demand during 2020, which worsened an already deteriorated oil market caused by a concurrent decision among the group of oil producing nations known as OPEC+ to increase oil supply. In 2021, global economies generally began to recover from the impacts of COVID-19 and worldwide oil demand slowly began to increase to near pre-pandemic levels, as oil and gas companies significantly reduced capital investments due to lower oil prices, and OPEC+ proactively worked to reduce excess oil inventories around the world. As we approached the end of 2021, the fundamentals for global oil supply and demand were very tight, with inventory levels in the U.S. rebounding from five-year lows, and a near-term outlook for increasing oil demand as global economies and worldwide travel continued to recover. As oil prices strengthened during 2021, from around $50 per barrel in early 2021 to around $80 per barrel near the end of 2021, the Company’s financial results also improved, although the positive oil price impact was offset in large part by the commodity hedges we were obligated to have in place under our bank credit facility shortly after we emerged from bankruptcy in September 2020.
The following include some of our key 2021 business developments:
•Completed our 105-mile CO2 pipeline from Bell Creek Field to Cedar Creek Anticline (“CCA”).
•Acquired a nearly 100% working interest in the Big Sand Draw and Beaver Creek oil fields (collectively “Wind River Basin”) located in Wyoming, including surface facilities and a 46-mile CO2 pipeline.
•Sold non-producing surface acreage in the Houston area for $15.2 million and divested undeveloped deep mineral rights in Wyoming for $18 million.
•Reduced the Company’s total debt by $103.0 million and exited 2021 with $531.8 million of financial liquidity and total debt of $35.0 million.
In addition to the items listed above, the Company advanced its evolving CCUS business in 2021 through the following:
•Established an executive leadership team for Denbury Carbon Solutions. 
•Executed a term sheet with Mitsubishi Corporation covering a 20-year period for the transport and storage of CO2 captured from Mitsubishi’s proposed ammonia project along the U.S. Gulf Coast.
•Commenced a joint evaluation with Mitsui E&P USA LLC of potential opportunities across the U.S. Gulf Coast to develop carbon-negative oil assets utilizing industrial-sourced CO2.
•Announced joint development of a Texas Gulf Coast sequestration site with Gulf Coast Midstream Partners, with potential to store up to 400 million metric tons of CO2.

CARBON CAPTURE, USE AND STORAGE
CCUS is a process that captures CO2 from industrial sources and reuses it or stores the CO2 in geologic formations in order to avoid its release into the atmosphere. We utilize CO2 from industrial sources in our EOR operations, and our extensive CO2 pipeline infrastructure and operations, particularly in the Gulf Coast, are strategically located in close proximity to one of the nation’s highest concentrations of power generation, industrial and petrochemical plants. We believe that the assets and technical expertise required for CCUS are highly aligned with our existing CO2 EOR operations, which have been a significant focus for us for over 22 years. 
Supportive U.S. government policy and public pressure on industrial CO2 emitters provide strong incentives for them to capture their CO2 emissions; for example, in January 2021, the IRS issued final regulations under Section 45Q of the Internal Revenue Code (“Section 45Q”) on the expanded carbon capture tax credit, implementing a number of changes and clarifications to previous regulations. The tax credit structure provides the capturing parties a tax credit that escalates until 2026, when it reaches $35 per ton for CO2 used in EOR operations or other qualified uses, and $50 per ton for CO2 directly stored in geologic formations, annually escalating for inflation thereafter. The tax credit is available for a 12-year period for qualifying facilities that begin construction before January 1, 2026. Several enhancements to Section 45Q have been discussed and proposed, including increases to the tax credit, a direct pay feature and extensions to the construction commencement deadline. In addition to the Section 45Q tax credits, some entities may be eligible for other financial incentives or benefits for products that are created through CCUS.
We believe the incentives offered under Section 45Q will drive demand for CCUS and will allow us to collect a fee for the transportation and storage of captured industrial-sourced CO2, including its utilization in our EOR operations. While a portion of the CO2 we currently utilize in our EOR operations is captured from industrial sources and qualifies as CCUS, we have historically paid a fee for that CO2 as those arrangements were entered into many years ago. As the enhanced Section 45Q regulations are relatively new, it will likely take several years for new capture facilities to be built and for dedicated storage sites to be developed.
As we seek to grow our CCUS business and pursue new CCUS opportunities, we have focused on the following strategic priorities:
•securing transportation and storage agreements with existing and new-build industrial emitters for the transport and storage of captured CO2;
•adding safe, reliable, uninterruptible and secure permanent storage capacity through development of a diverse portfolio of subsurface sequestration sites;
•increasing our carbon-negative oil production by seeking to replace the use of naturally-sourced CO2 in our EOR operations;
•preparing for a capital efficient expansion of our Green Pipeline capacity to meet expected rapid growth in demand from Gulf Coast industrial facility owners; and
•pursuing strategic partnerships throughout the CCUS value chain.
Since mid-2021, we have executed several term sheets for the future transportation and sequestration of CO2, and we continue to work with numerous third parties on definitive agreements and collaborative discussions for the transportation and storage of CO2 and development of storage sites. We believe our existing CO2 pipeline infrastructure, EOR operations, and experience and expertise in working with CO2 positions us well to be a leader in this rapidly developing industry.
OIL AND NATURAL GAS OPERATIONS
Our oil and natural gas properties are concentrated in the Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States.  Currently our properties with proved and producing reserves in the Gulf Coast region are situated in Mississippi, Texas, and Louisiana, and in the Rocky Mountain region are situated in Montana, Wyoming and North Dakota. Approximately 97% of our production is oil, and over two-thirds of our production is from CO2 EOR. Over time, we have grown primarily through the acquisition of mature oil fields, where we focus on increasing the value of those properties through a combination of exploitation, drilling and proven engineering extraction processes, with our most significant emphasis relating to CO2 EOR operations. Our current portfolio of CO2 EOR projects provides us significant oil production and reserve growth potential, assuming crude oil prices are at levels that support the development of those projects.

Denbury Inc.

We have been conducting and expanding EOR operations on our properties in the Gulf Coast region since 1999, and as a result, we currently have many more CO2 EOR projects in this region than in the Rocky Mountain region. We began operations in the Rocky Mountain region in 2010 in connection with, and following, our merger with Encore Acquisition Company (“Encore”). In 2012, as part of a significant sale and exchange transaction with Exxon Mobil Corporation (“ExxonMobil”), we sold to ExxonMobil our Bakken area assets in North Dakota and Montana in exchange for (1) $1.3 billion in cash, (2) operating interests in Hartzog Draw and Webster fields in Wyoming and Texas, respectively, and (3) an overriding royalty interest equivalent to an approximate one-third ownership interest in ExxonMobil’s CO2 reserves in LaBarge Field in Wyoming (the “Bakken Exchange Transaction”). In the Gulf Coast region, we own what is, to our knowledge, the region’s only significant naturally occurring source of CO2, and these large volumes of naturally occurring CO2 give us a significant competitive advantage in this area. In addition to this naturally occurring CO2 source, we utilize CO2 captured from industrial sources which would otherwise be released into the atmosphere (sometimes referred to as industrial-sourced CO2) in our tertiary operations, including CO2 from the LaBarge Field in Wyoming, which is captured in conjunction with processing helium from the LaBarge Field gas stream at ExxonMobil’s Shute Creek gas plant. These industrial sources of CO2 help us recover additional oil from mature oil fields and, we believe, also provide an economical way to reduce CO2 emissions through the associated underground storage of CO2 which occurs as part of our oil-producing EOR operations.
We own and operate more than 1,300 miles of CO2 transportation pipelines. Our extensive CO2 pipeline infrastructure in the Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain regions gives us the ability to deliver CO2 from our natural and industrial CO2 sources for use in our CO2 EOR fields, as well as to deliver CO2 to our customers who are industrial end-users of CO2 or EOR customers. In the future, we plan to utilize these same pipelines for the transportation and sequestration of CO2 in our emerging CCUS business. Our Green Pipeline currently has ample capacity to handle additional volumes, and we can further expand capacity by adding pump stations or looping sections of the pipeline.
Oil and Natural Gas Reserve Estimates
DeGolyer and MacNaughton (“D&M”) prepared estimates of our net proved oil and natural gas reserves as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 (see the summary of D&M’s report as of December 31, 2021 included as an exhibit to this Form 10-K). These estimates of reserves were prepared using an average price equal to the unweighted arithmetic average of hydrocarbon prices on the first day of each month within the 12-month period in accordance with rules and regulations of the SEC.  These oil and natural gas reserve estimates do not include any value for probable or possible reserves that may exist, nor do they include any value for undeveloped acreage.  The reserve estimates represent our net revenue interest in our properties.
The following table provides estimated proved reserve information prepared by D&M as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, as well as PV-10 Values and Standardized Measures for each period. The Company’s December 31, 2021 proved oil and natural gas reserve quantities and PV-10 Values increased significantly from December 31, 2020 due largely to the increase in oil prices used in preparing the December 31, 2020 and 2021 reserve information, whereby the average NYMEX oil price used in estimating our proved reserves increased from $39.57 per Bbl at December 31, 2020, to $66.56 per Bbl at December 31, 2021. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves and their values, including many factors beyond our control, which are further discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors – Estimating our reserves, production and future net cash flows is difficult to do with any certainty.  See also Field Summary Table below within this

(1)The reference prices were based on the arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month NYMEX commodity prices for each month during the respective year. These prices do not reflect adjustments for market differentials and transportation expenses by field that are utilized in the preparation of our reserve report to arrive at the appropriate net price we receive. Further, we do not designate our oil and natural gas derivative contracts as hedging instruments for accounting purposes under the Derivatives and Hedging topic of the FASC, and as a result, the impact of these contracts is not included in the prices used in determining our reserve quantities or values. See Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations – Financial and Operating Results Tables for details of oil and natural gas prices received, both including and excluding the impact of derivative settlements.
(2)Determined based on the average first-day-of-the-month prices for each month, adjusted to prices received by the field in accordance with standards set forth in the FASC. PV-10 Values and the Standardized Measure are significantly impacted by the oil prices we receive relative to NYMEX oil prices (our NYMEX oil price differential). The weighted average oil price differentials utilized were $2.70 per Bbl below representative NYMEX oil prices as of December 31, 2021, compared to $3.73 per Bbl below NYMEX oil prices as of December 31, 2020, and $0.14 per Bbl below NYMEX oil prices as of December 31, 2019.
Denbury Inc.

(3)PV-10 Value is a non-GAAP measure and is different from the Standardized Measure in that PV-10 Value is a pre-tax number and the Standardized Measure is an after-tax number. See Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Non-GAAP Financial Measure and Reconciliation for further discussion.
Our proved developed non-producing reserves primarily consist of (1) reserves within a proved tertiary flood in areas that have not yet experienced a response from CO2 injection, (2) reserves that will be recovered from currently productive zones utilizing minor modifications to manage the flow of CO2 or water within the reservoir, and (3) reserves that will be recovered through recompletions to other intervals above or below the currently producing interval.
As of December 31, 2021, our estimated proved undeveloped reserves totaled approximately 9.8 MMBOE, or approximately 5% of our estimated total proved reserves.  Approximately 98% (9.6 MMBOE) of our proved undeveloped oil reserves relate to planned future development within our CO2 tertiary operating fields.  We generally consider the CO2 tertiary proved undeveloped reserves to be lower risk than other proved undeveloped reserves that require drilling at locations offsetting existing production, because all of these proved undeveloped reserves are associated with tertiary recovery operations in fields and reservoirs that historically produced substantial volumes of oil under primary production. As of December 31, 2021, 0.8 MMBOE of our total proved undeveloped reserves are not scheduled to be developed within five years of initial booking, all of which are part of CO2 EOR projects. We believe these reserves satisfy the conditions to be included as proved reserves because (1) we have established and continue to follow the previously adopted development plan for each of these projects; (2) we have significant ongoing development activities in each of these CO2 EOR projects and (3) we have a historical record of completing the development of comparable long-term projects.
Our proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2021 were 5.7 MMBOE (139%) higher than at December 31, 2020. During 2021, we spent approximately $5 million to convert 0.7 MMBOE of proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves, primarily related to non-tertiary development activities at CCA. The primary changes in our proved undeveloped reserves during 2021 were related to adding an additional 3.0 MMBOE primarily related to tertiary operations at Hastings, Eucutta and Cranfield fields and 1.0 MMBOE related to the acquisition of our Wind River Basin properties, as well as recognizing net upward revisions of our proved undeveloped reserves of 2.4 MMBOE, primarily the result of the significant improvement in commodity prices between December 31, 2020 and 2021.
During 2021, we provided oil and natural gas reserve estimates for 2020 to the United States Energy Information Agency that were substantially the same as the reserve estimates included in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Internal Controls Over Reserve Estimates
Reserve information in this report is based on estimates prepared by D&M, independent petroleum engineers located in Dallas, Texas, utilizing data provided by our internal reservoir engineering team and is the responsibility of management. We rely on D&M’s expertise to ensure that our reserve estimates are prepared in compliance with SEC rules and regulations and that appropriate geologic, petroleum engineering, and evaluation principles and techniques are applied in accordance with practices generally recognized by the petroleum industry as presented in the publication of the Society of Petroleum Engineers entitled “Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information (Revision as of June 2019)”.  The person responsible for the preparation of the reserve report is a Senior Vice President and Division Manager of North America at D&M. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering in 2003 from Istanbul Technical University and a Master’s degree and Doctorate in Petroleum Engineering in 2005 and 2010, respectively, from Texas A&M University, and he has in excess of 11 years of experience in oil and gas reservoir studies and evaluations.  Our Senior Vice President – Business Development and Technology is primarily responsible for overseeing the independent petroleum engineers during the process.  Our Senior Vice President – Business Development and Technology has a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering from the Colorado School of Mines and over 35 years of industry experience working with petroleum engineering and reserve estimates.  D&M relies on various data provided by our internal reservoir engineering team in preparing its reserve estimates, including such items as oil and natural gas prices, ownership interests, production information, operating costs, planned capital expenditures and other technical data. Our internal reservoir engineering team consists of qualified petroleum engineers who maintain the Company’s internal evaluation of reserves and compare the Company’s information to the reserves prepared by D&M. Management is responsible for designing the internal control procedures used in the preparation of our oil and gas reserves, which include verification of data input into reserve forecasting and economics evaluation software, as well as multi-discipline management reviews.  The internal reservoir engineering team reports directly to our Senior Vice President – Business Development and Technology.  In addition, our Audit Committee of the Board of 
Denbury Inc.

Directors oversees the qualifications, independence, performance and hiring of our independent petroleum engineers and reviews the final report and subsequent reporting of our oil and natural gas reserve estimates.  The Chairman of the Board holds a Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and bachelor’s degrees in Chemistry and Mathematics from Capital University in Ohio. He has more than 40 years of industry experience, with responsibilities including reserves preparation and approval.
Field Summary Table. The following table provides a summary by field and region of selected proved oil and natural gas reserve information, including total proved reserve quantities as of December 31, 2021, and average daily sales volumes for 2021, all based on Denbury’s net revenue interest (“NRI”).  The reserve estimates presented were prepared by D&M, independent petroleum engineers located in Dallas, Texas.  We serve as operator of nearly all of our significant properties, in which we also own most of the interests, although typically less than a 100% working interest, and a lesser NRI due to royalties and other burdens.

Enhanced Oil Recovery Overview. EOR using CO2 is one of the most efficient tertiary recovery mechanisms for producing crude oil. When injected under pressure into underground, oil-bearing rock formations, CO2 acts somewhat like a solvent as it travels through the reservoir rock, mixing with and modifying the characteristics of the oil so it can be produced and sold. The terms “tertiary flood,” “CO2 flood” and “CO2 EOR” are used interchangeably throughout this document.
While enhanced oil recovery projects utilizing CO2 have been successfully performed by numerous oil and gas companies in a wide range of oil-bearing reservoirs in different oil-producing basins, we believe our investments, experience and acquired knowledge give us a strategic and competitive advantage in the areas in which we operate. We apply what we have learned and developed over the years to improve and increase sweep efficiency within the CO2 EOR projects we operate.
We began our CO2 operations in August 1999, when we acquired Little Creek Field, followed by our acquisition of Jackson Dome CO2 reserves and the NEJD pipeline in 2001. Based upon our success at Little Creek and the ownership of the CO2 reserves, we began to transition our capital spending and acquisition efforts to focus more heavily on CO2 EOR and, over time, transformed our strategy to focus primarily on owning and operating oil fields that are well suited for CO2 EOR projects. Prior to tertiary flooding, we strive to maximize the currently sizeable primary and secondary production from our prospective tertiary fields and from fields in which tertiary floods have commenced but still contain significant non-tertiary production. Our asset base today almost entirely consists of, or otherwise relates to, oil fields that we are currently flooding with CO2 or plan to flood with CO2 in the future, or assets that produce CO2.
Although the up-front cost of tertiary production infrastructure and time to construct pipelines and production facilities is greater than in primary oil recovery in most circumstances, we believe tertiary recovery has several favorable, offsetting and unique attributes, including:
•a lower exploration risk, as we are operating oil fields that have significant historical production and reservoir and geological data;
•lower production decline rates than unconventional development;
•reasonable return metrics at currently anticipated long-term prices;
•limited competition for this recovery method in our geographic regions and a strategic advantage due to our ownership of the CO2 reserves and CO2 pipeline infrastructure;
•being generally less disruptive to new habitats in comparison to other oil and natural gas development because we further develop existing (as opposed to new) oil fields; and
•allowing us to concurrently store CO2 captured from industrial sources in the same underground formations that previously trapped and stored oil and natural gas.
Our tertiary operations represent 67% of our 2021 total production (on a BOE basis). At year-end 2021, the proved oil reserves in our tertiary recovery oil fields had an estimated PV-10 Value of approximately $1.8 billion, or 66% of our total PV-10 Value, and represented 60% of our total proved reserves. In addition, there are significant probable and possible reserves at several other fields for which tertiary operations are underway or planned.

CO2 Sources and Pipelines
Natural CO2 Sources
Jackson Dome. Our primary Gulf Coast CO2 source, Jackson Dome, located near Jackson, Mississippi, was discovered during the 1970s by oil and gas companies that were exploring for hydrocarbons. This large and relatively pure source of naturally occurring CO2 (98% CO2) is, to our knowledge, the only significant underground deposit of CO2 in the United States east of the Mississippi River. We acquired Jackson Dome in February 2001 in a purchase that also gave us ownership and control of the NEJD CO2 pipeline and provided us with a reliable supply of CO2 at a reasonable and predictable cost for our Gulf Coast CO2 tertiary recovery operations. Together with its related CO2 pipeline infrastructure, Jackson Dome provides us a significant competitive advantage in the acquisition and development of properties in Mississippi, Louisiana and southeastern Texas that are well suited for CO2 EOR.

Denbury Inc.

Since 2001, we have drilled numerous CO2-producing wells, significantly increasing our estimated proved Gulf Coast CO2 reserves at Jackson Dome from approximately 800 Bcf at the time of acquisition to approximately 4.5 Tcf as of December 31, 2021.  The proved CO2 reserve estimates are based on a gross (8/8ths) basis, of which our net revenue interest is approximately 3.6 Tcf, and is included in the evaluation of proved CO2 reserves prepared by D&M, independent petroleum engineers.  In discussing our available CO2 reserves, we make reference to the gross amount of proved and probable reserves, as this is the amount that is available both for our own tertiary recovery programs and for our customers who are industrial end-users of CO2 or EOR customers, as we are responsible for distributing the entire CO2 production stream.
In addition to our proved reserves, we estimate that we have 910.1 Bcf, on a gross (8/8ths) basis, of probable CO2 reserves at Jackson Dome. While the majority of these probable reserves are located in structures that have been drilled and tested, such reserves are still considered probable reserves because (1) the original well is plugged; (2) they are located in fault blocks that are immediately adjacent to fault blocks with proved reserves; or (3) they are reserves associated with increasing the ultimate recovery factor from our existing reservoirs with proved reserves. In addition, a significant portion of these probable reserves at Jackson Dome are located in undrilled structures where we have sufficient subsurface and seismic data indicating geophysical attributes that, coupled with our historically high drilling success rate, provide a reasonably high degree of certainty that CO2 is present.
Industrial-sourced CO2
In addition to our naturally occurring CO2 source at Jackson Dome, in our tertiary operations we utilize CO2 captured from industrial sources which would otherwise be released into the atmosphere. Industrial sources of CO2 help us recover additional oil from mature oil fields and, we believe, also provide an economical way to reduce CO2 emissions through the associated underground storage of CO2 which occurs as part of our oil-producing EOR operations (see Carbon Capture, Use and Storage below). In the Gulf Coast, we are currently party to two long-term contracts to purchase CO2: an industrial facility in Port Arthur, Texas and an industrial facility in Geismar, Louisiana, which combined supplied an average of approximately 63 MMcf/d of CO2 to our EOR operations during 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 15% of the CO2 utilized in our Gulf Coast oil and gas operations was industrial-sourced CO2.
In the Gulf Coast region, approximately 77% of our average daily CO2 produced from Jackson Dome or captured from industrial sources in 2021 was used in our tertiary recovery operations, compared to 78% in 2020 and 84% in 2019, with the balance delivered to third-party industrial end-users or EOR customers. During 2021, we used an average of 407 MMcf/d of CO2 (including CO2 captured from industrial sources) for our tertiary activities.
Gulf Coast CO2 Pipelines. We acquired the 183-mile NEJD CO2 pipeline that runs from Jackson Dome to near Donaldsonville, Louisiana, as part of the 2001 acquisition of our Jackson Dome CO2 source. Since 2001, we have acquired or constructed nearly 750 miles of CO2 pipelines in the Gulf Coast, and as of December 31, 2021, we own nearly 925 miles of CO2 pipelines, which gives us the ability to deliver CO2 throughout the Gulf Coast region.
Completion of the Green Pipeline allowed for the first CO2 injection into Hastings Field, located near Houston, Texas, in 2010, and gives us the ability to deliver CO2 to oil fields all along the Gulf Coast from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to Alvin, Texas. At the present time, most of the CO2 flowing in the Green Pipeline is delivered from the Jackson Dome area, but also includes the CO2 we are receiving from the industrial facilities in Port Arthur, Texas and Geismar, Louisiana, and we are currently transporting a third party’s CO2 for a fee to the sales point at Hastings Field. We currently have ample capacity within the Green Pipeline to handle additional volumes that may be required to develop our inventory of CO2 EOR projects in this 
13


Denbury Inc.

area, as well as to support the transportation of CO2 for the emerging CCUS business. The following table summarizes our most significant CO2 pipelines owned and operated in the Gulf Coast region as of December 31, 2021:

CO2 pipelines | Completion Date | Pipeline Diameter(in inches) | Pipeline Mileage | Service Area 
Green Pipeline | 2010 | 24” | 320 | Gulf Coast corridor from near Donaldsonville, Louisiana to Hastings Field in Texas; including connections to 2 industrial-source CO2 providers
NEJD Pipeline | 1986 | 20” | 183 | Jackson Dome CO2 source to Green Pipeline connection 
Delta Pipeline | 2009 | 24” | 111 | Jackson Dome CO2 source to Delhi Field in Louisiana 
Free State Pipeline | 2005 | 20” | 91 | Jackson Dome CO2 source to West Yellow Creek in Mississippi

(1)Repurposed from a natural gas pipeline to a CO2 pipeline in 2008.
Oil Fields
Delhi Field. Delhi Field is located east of Monroe, Louisiana. In May 2006, we purchased our initial interest in Delhi for $50 million. We began well and facility development in 2008, began delivering CO2 to the field in 2009 via the Delta Pipeline, and first tertiary production occurred at Delhi Field in 2010. During 2016, we completed construction of a natural gas liquids extraction plant, which provides us with the ability to sell natural gas liquids from the produced stream, improves the efficiency of the CO2 flood, and utilizes extracted methane to power the plant and reduce field operating expenses. Our 2022 development plans include the purchase and installation of an inlet heat exchanger to increase production reliability and reduce costs.
Hastings Field. Hastings Field is located south of Houston, Texas. We acquired a majority interest in this field in February 2009 for $247 million. We initiated CO2 injection in the West Hastings Unit during 2010 upon completion of the construction of the Green Pipeline. Due to the large vertical oil column that exists in the field, we are developing the Frio reservoir using dedicated CO2 injection and producing wells for each of the major sand intervals. We began producing oil from our EOR operations at Hastings Field in 2012, and we booked initial proved tertiary reserves for the West Hastings Unit in 2012.
Heidelberg Field. Heidelberg Field is located in Mississippi off of the Free State Pipeline and consists of an East Unit and a West Unit. Construction of the CO2 facility, connecting pipeline and well work commenced on the West Heidelberg Unit during 2008, with our first CO2 injections into the Eutaw zone. Our first tertiary oil production occurred in 2009, and we began flooding the Christmas and Tuscaloosa zones in 2013 and 2014, respectively. During 2019, we expanded our tertiary flood of the Christmas zone and invested in non-tertiary behind pipe projects. Our 2022 development plans include developing the remaining CO2 flood in the Tuscaloosa reservoir at East Heidelberg.
Oyster Bayou Field. We acquired a majority interest in Oyster Bayou Field in 2007. The field is located in southeast Texas, east of Galveston Bay, and is somewhat unique when compared to our other CO2 EOR projects because the field covers a relatively small area of 3,912 acres. We began CO2 injections into Oyster Bayou Field in 2010, commenced tertiary production in 2011 from the Frio A-1 zone, and booked initial proved tertiary reserves for the field in 2012. Our 2022 development plans include additional A-2 zone development.
Tinsley Field. We acquired Tinsley Field in 2006. This Mississippi field was discovered and first developed in the 1930s and is separated by different fault blocks. As is the case with the majority of fields in Mississippi, Tinsley Field produces from multiple reservoirs. Our CO2 enhanced oil recovery operations at Tinsley Field have thus far targeted the Woodruff formation, although there is additional potential in the Perry sandstone and other smaller reservoirs. We commenced tertiary oil production from Tinsley Field in 2008 and substantially completed development of the Woodruff formation during 2014. Although production from Tinsley Field peaked in 2015 and is generally on decline, we continue to evaluate future potential investment opportunities in this field.

Future Gulf Coast Tertiary Opportunities. Future development projects beyond 2022 may include additional opportunities at Tinsley Field’s Perry sandstone reservoir and expansion of our existing CO2 floods. In addition to our existing CO2 floods, we continue to evaluate tertiary potential in our non-tertiary properties such as Webster, Conroe and Thompson fields, the development of which is primarily dependent upon capital availability and priorities, future oil prices and in some cases pipeline construction.
Rocky Mountain Region Assets
CO2 Sources and Pipelines
LaBarge Field. We acquired an overriding royalty interest equivalent to an approximate one-third ownership interest in ExxonMobil’s CO2 reserves in LaBarge Field in the fourth quarter of 2012 as part of the Bakken Exchange Transaction. LaBarge Field is located in southwestern Wyoming, and as of December 31, 2021, our interest in LaBarge Field held approximately 1.0 Tcf of proved CO2 reserves.
During 2021, we received an average of approximately 110 MMcf/d of CO2 from the Shute Creek gas processing plant at LaBarge Field that we used in our Rocky Mountain region CO2 floods or sold to another third-party operator. Based on current capacity, and subject to availability of CO2, we currently expect our CO2 volumes from Shute Creek to increase in future years. We pay ExxonMobil a fee to process and deliver the CO2, which we use in our Rocky Mountain region CO2 floods.
Other Rocky Mountain CO2 Sources. We have a contract in place to receive all of the CO2 from the Lost Cabin gas plant in central Wyoming, which we estimate has the capability to provide us as much as 30 MMcf/d of CO2 for use in our Rocky Mountain region CO2 floods. We did not receive any CO2 volumes from this source in 2021 but expect to receive CO2 from this source in 2022. We currently estimate that our existing CO2 sources, plus additional CO2 from those or other CO2 sources in the region, are sufficient to carry out our Rocky Mountain region EOR development plans.
Rocky Mountain CO2 Pipelines. The 20-inch Greencore Pipeline in Wyoming is the first CO2 pipeline we constructed in the Rocky Mountain region. The 232-mile pipeline begins at the Lost Cabin gas plant in Wyoming and terminates at Bell Creek Field in Montana. We completed construction of the pipeline in 2012 and received our first CO2 deliveries from the Lost Cabin gas plant during 2013. During 2014, we completed construction of an interconnect between our Greencore Pipeline and an existing third-party CO2 pipeline in Wyoming, which enables us to transport CO2 from LaBarge Field to our Bell Creek Field. In 2021, we completed construction of the CCA CO2 pipeline, which delivers CO2 to our new tertiary development project at CCA. The following table summarizes our most significant CO2 pipelines owned and operated in the Rocky Mountain region as of December 31, 2021:

CO2 pipelines | Completion Date | Pipeline Diameter(in inches) | Pipeline Mileage | Service Area 
Greencore Pipeline | 2012 | 20” | 232 | Lost Cabin gas plant in Wyoming to Bell Creek Field in Montana
CCA Pipeline | 2021 | 16” | 105 | Bell Creek Field in Montana to CCA 
Beaver Creek Pipeline | 2008 | 8” | 46 | Wyoming Wind River Basin properties 

Oil Fields
Cedar Creek Anticline. CCA is the largest property that we own and currently our largest producing property, contributing approximately 23% of our 2021 total sales volumes. Historical production from the property has primarily been from the Red River interval. The field is primarily located in Montana but extends over such a large area (approximately 126 miles) that it also extends into North Dakota. CCA is a series of 13 different operating areas on a common geological trend, each of which could be considered a field by itself. We acquired our initial interest in CCA as part of the Encore merger in 2010 and acquired additional interests from a wholly-owned subsidiary of ConocoPhillips in 2013 for $1.0 billion, adding 42.2 MMBOE of incremental proved reserves at that date. 
During November 2021, we completed a 105-mile CO2 pipeline from Bell Creek Field to CCA. Our first CO2 injections in CCA’s Red River formation commenced in early February 2022, and tertiary oil production response is anticipated in the 
15


Denbury Inc.

second half of 2023. Our CCA EOR development utilizes 100% industrial-sourced CO2. Incremental peak production from phase 1 development is expected to range from 7,500 BOE/d to 12,500 Bbls/d, net to our interest. During 2022, we currently plan for a CO2 pilot project targeting the Interlake formation and to drill additional non-tertiary wells in other oil-bearing intervals including Mission Canyon and the Charles B formation. Future phases of CCA CO2 EOR development are expected to target the Interlake, Stony Mountain and Red River formations across the various fields within CCA, with full development at CCA potentially spanning multiple decades. 
Wind River Basin. During March 2021, we acquired a nearly 100% working interest (approximately 83% net revenue interest) in the Big Sand Draw and Beaver Creek EOR fields located in Wyoming, including surface facilities and a 46-mile CO2 transportation pipeline to the acquired fields. The acquisition purchase price was $10.9 million cash (after final closing adjustments) plus two contingent $4 million cash payments if NYMEX WTI oil prices average at least $50 per Bbl during each of 2021 and 2022. Wind River Basin sales averaged approximately 2,879 BOE/d during the fourth quarter of 2021 utilizing 100% industrial-sourced CO2. During 2022, we plan to further develop the Beaver Creek Madison EOR flood expansion.
Bell Creek Field. The oil-producing reservoir in Bell Creek Field is a sandstone reservoir with characteristics similar to those we have successfully flooded with CO2 in the Gulf Coast region. We began first CO2 injections into Bell Creek Field in 2013, completed the phase five expansion in 2018, and commenced CO2 injection in the phase six field development in April 2019. Although production from Bell Creek Field peaked during the second quarter of 2019 and is generally on decline, we continued to see new production from the phase six expansion during 2021. During 2022, we intend to drill a new phase six horizontal well, along with additional wells in other areas.
Future Rocky Mountain Tertiary Opportunities. In addition to the oil fields described above, we continue to evaluate tertiary potential in Hartzog Draw Field located in the Powder River Basin of northeastern Wyoming, the development of which is primarily dependent upon capital availability and priorities and future oil prices. The field is located approximately 12 miles from our Greencore Pipeline.
Oil and Gas Acreage, Productive Wells and Drilling Activity
In the data below, “gross” represents the total acres or wells in which we own a working interest and “net” represents the gross acres or wells multiplied by our working interest percentage.  For the wells that produce both oil and gas, the well is typically classified as an oil or natural gas well based on the ratio of oil to natural gas production.
Oil and Gas Acreage
The following table sets forth our acreage position at December 31, 2021:

 | Developed | Undeveloped | | Total
 | Gross | Net | | Gross | Net | Gross | | Net
Gulf Coast region | 188,978 | | 147,860 | | 286,700 | | 17,980 | | 475,678 | 165,840

(1)An exploratory well is a well drilled to find a new field or to find a new reservoir in a field previously found to be productive of oil or natural gas in another reservoir.  Generally, an exploratory well is any well that is not a development well, an extension well, a service well or a stratigraphic test well.  A development well is a well drilled within the proved area of an oil or gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive.
(2)A productive well is an exploratory or development well drilled and completed during the year and found to be capable of producing either oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to justify completion as an oil or natural gas well.
(3)A non-productive well is an exploratory or development well that is not a productive well.
(4)Includes 8 productive gross wells and 1 non-productive gross well during 2021, and 2 productive gross wells during 2020, in which we incurred no cost but have an overriding royalty interest prior to the combined payout of the wells. Subsequent to payout, Denbury will hold and bear the cost of its working interest in each well.
(5)During 2019, an additional 7 wells were drilled for water or CO2 injection purposes. There were no wells drilled during 2021 or 2020 for water or CO2 injection purposes.

TITLE TO PROPERTIES
As is customary in the oil and natural gas industry, Denbury conducts a limited title examination at the time of its acquisition of properties or leasehold interests targeted for enhanced recovery, and curative work is performed with respect to significant defects on higher-value properties of the greatest significance. We believe that title to our oil and natural gas properties is good and defensible, subject only to such exceptions that we believe do not materially interfere with the use of such properties, including encumbrances, easements, restrictions and royalty, overriding royalty and other similar interests.
SIGNIFICANT OIL AND GAS PURCHASERS AND PRODUCT MARKETING
Oil and natural gas sales are made on a day-to-day basis or under short-term contracts at the current area market price. We would not expect the loss of any single purchaser to have a material adverse effect upon our operations; however, the loss of a large single purchaser could potentially reduce the competition for our oil and natural gas production, which in turn could negatively impact the prices we receive.  For the year ended December 31, 2021, four purchasers each accounted for 10% or more of our oil and natural gas revenues: Plains Marketing LP (28%), Hunt Crude Oil Supply Company (12%), Marathon Petroleum (11%) and Sunoco Inc. (11%). 
Our ability to market oil and natural gas depends on many factors beyond our control, including the extent of domestic production and imports of oil and natural gas, available oil storage at Cushing, Oklahoma, and other inventory hubs, the proximity of our oil and natural gas production to pipelines and corresponding markets, the available capacity in such pipelines, the demand for oil and natural gas, the effects of weather, and the effects of state and federal regulation.  While we have not experienced significant difficulty in finding a market for our production as it becomes available or in transporting our production to those markets, there is no assurance that we will always be able to market all of our production or obtain favorable prices.
Oil Marketing and Differentials
Prices received in a regional market fluctuate frequently and can differ from NYMEX pricing due to a variety of reasons, including supply and/or demand factors, crude oil quality and location differentials. With the recent exception of 2020 and 2021, our crude oil prices in the Gulf Coast region have generally been positive to NYMEX and highly correlated to the changes in prices of crude oil sold under Light Louisiana Sweet (“LLS”) index. Our current markets at various sales points along the Gulf Coast have sufficient demand to accommodate our production, but there can be no assurance of future demand.
The marketing of our Rocky Mountain region oil production is dependent on transportation through local pipelines to our primary market centers in Guernsey, Wyoming and Cushing, Oklahoma, although some of our production may ultimately be transported by third parties to Wood River, Illinois.  Shipments on some of the pipelines are at or near capacity and may be subject to apportionment.  We currently have access to, or have contracted for, sufficient pipeline capacity to move our oil production; however, there can be no assurance that we will be allocated sufficient pipeline capacity to move all of our oil production in the future.  Because local demand for production is small in comparison to current production levels, much of the production in the Rocky Mountain region is transported to markets outside of the region. Therefore, prices in the Rocky Mountain region are further influenced by fluctuations in prices (primarily Brent and LLS) in coastal markets and by available pipeline capacity in the Midwest and Cushing markets.
COMPETITION AND MARKETS
We face competition from other oil and natural gas companies in all aspects of our business, including acquisition of producing properties, oil and gas leases, drilling rights, and CO2 properties; marketing of oil and natural gas; and obtaining and maintaining goods, services and labor.  Many of our competitors have substantially larger financial and other resources.  Factors that affect our ability to acquire producing properties include available liquidity, available information about prospective properties and our expectations for earning a minimum projected return on our investments.  Because of the primary nature of our core assets (our tertiary operations) and our ownership of relatively uncommon significant natural sources 
19


Denbury Inc.

of CO2 in the Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain regions, we believe that we are effective in competing in the market and have less competition than our peers in certain aspects of our business.

Climate change is a continuing global concern for governments, businesses, and society. The reduction of carbon emissions is important, and we take the responsibility of protecting our environment seriously. Part of our obligation is to report greenhouse gas emissions and develop procedures and methods to collect data critical for calculating these emissions. In addition, our operating strategy, which focuses on CO2 EOR and CCUS, has measurable environmental benefits. We are committed to utilizing emerging technologies, where feasible, to capture or reduce emissions and to improve our carbon efficiency. 
We strive to be environmentally responsible in all aspects of our operations. Our operations have been subject to federal, state and local environmental compliance for many years, the costs of which are well integrated into our budgeting and our operating results. With our focus on CO2 EOR, we offer environmental benefits not generally associated with oil and gas operations. We utilize technology and techniques that reduce the risks to, and impacts on, the environment. Our programs include measures to prevent spills and releases and to quickly respond to incidents if they do occur; efforts to manage, minimize and remediate our environmental impacts; and an operating strategy that is conscious of our carbon footprint. 
As the world demands energy to fuel tomorrow’s economy and provide a better quality of life, we must meet the demand with a focus on reducing CO2 emissions. The Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard classifies a company’s greenhouse gas emissions into three scopes: Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions from owned or controlled sources; Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions from the generation of purchased energy; and Scope 3 emissions are all indirect emissions (not included in Scope 2) that occur in the value chain of the reporting company, including both upstream and downstream emissions. The utilization of industrial-sourced CO2 in EOR significantly reduces the carbon footprint of our oil production, making our Scope 1 and 2 CO2 emissions negative today. We have set a target to fully offset our emissions, including Scope 3 emissions associated with the refining and combustion of our produced hydrocarbons, within this decade.
In our Corporate Responsibility Report, which is published on our website, we report in detail our direct greenhouse gas emissions resulting from our operations, as well as indirect greenhouse gas emissions associated with the consumption of electricity.
In addition, we are committed to engaging with stakeholders, policy makers, regulators, and our industry on climate change issues and to addressing our impact on the environment. The Sustainability and Governance Committee of the Board of Directors oversees our health and safety, climate change, environmental, social and community policies, practices and procedures. The Committee focuses upon climate change risk management and strategy, CCUS activities, sustainability targets, operating efficiencies and asset retirement obligations, along with broader community climate change concerns.
HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES
We recognize that our employees are crucial to Denbury’s future, and we care about our employees’ and their families’ well-being beyond the work environment. As of December 31, 2021, we had 716 employees, of whom 402 were employed in our field operations or at our field offices and 314 were employed at our headquarters in Plano, TX, none of whom are currently covered by a labor union or other collective bargaining arrangement.
Workforce Health and Safety
We continuously seek to improve our health and safety performance by fostering a culture that prioritizes safe work, then ensuring that this culture is exemplified in all levels of leadership. We provide our employees with tools to succeed, including relevant and timely training, and we monitor our performance using established measurement statistics. With oversight from the Sustainability and Governance Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors, each year, Denbury establishes corporate goals specifically related to employee and contractor safety performance and monitors progress toward those goals throughout the year using performance metrics. Results are regularly reported to our Board of Directors, senior management and all employees to ensure accountability and to reinforce their importance. Two safety performance metrics Denbury closely monitors are the Total Recordable Incident Rate (“TRIR”) and the Significant Injury or Fatality Rate (“SIFR”), which also 
Denbury Inc.

captures near misses that may not have resulted in an injury. We have set new record lows for TRIR over the last five consecutive years and our 2021 SIFR was our lowest ever.
We have implemented numerous health and safety protocols in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our COVID-19 task force, comprised of members of senior management and other key employees, has developed a systematic, data-based approach to monitor national, state and local orders and guidelines related to the COVID-19 pandemic, established internal processes, training and communications, conducted contact tracing, and engaged a third-party medical consulting firm to identify and clear COVID-19 cases and exposures. Additionally, we continue to provide voluntary COVID-19 testing for all employees and their dependents and ensure that necessary sanitation supplies are available at all Denbury offices and locations. 
Compensation and Benefits
As part of our compensation philosophy, we believe that we must offer and maintain competitive compensation and benefit programs for our employees in order to attract and retain outstanding talent. In addition to competitive base wages, other benefit programs include an annual bonus plan, long-term incentive plan, Company matched 401(k) plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts and employee assistance programs.
Diversity and Inclusion
We understand the importance of, and are committed to increasing, diversity and fostering an inclusive work environment that supports the workforce and the communities where we operate. Denbury strives to ensure equal opportunity in recruitment and reaching a pool of diverse candidates by utilizing a digital recruiting program that posts available employment opportunities to websites worldwide, several of which are specifically targeted to reach diverse candidates. In 2021, women and minorities accounted for 21% and 16% of our workforce, respectively, and 20% and 26% of our new hires, respectively.
Our diversity, equity and inclusion principles are also reflected in our employee training and policies. To foster a diverse and collaborative workplace, Denbury requires all employees to complete annual training to raise awareness and encourage diversity and inclusion. Each year, our employee training program includes courses related to diversity, anti-discrimination, and anti-harassment to help employees better appreciate diversity, cultural differences, recognize unconscious biases, and increase collaboration. We continue to enhance our diversity, equity and inclusion policies which are guided by our Board of Directors and executive leadership team.
Talent Acquisition, Retention and Development
Our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to hire, develop, and retain highly skilled and experienced personnel, including our executive officers as well as other key management and technical specialists, such as geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other oil and gas industry professionals. Denbury provides employees with many ways to expand their skills and advance their careers through training and development initiatives. We believe this is critical to each employee’s professional growth and success, as well as to our success as a company.
Human Rights
Denbury is committed to protecting human rights in the workplace. This commitment includes respecting the dignity and worth of all individuals, encouraging all individuals to reach their full potential, encouraging the initiative of each employee, and providing equal opportunity for development to all employees. Specifically, Denbury recognizes its responsibility with regards to: workplace health and safety, the prohibition of forced and child labor, a workplace free from harassment or any form of discrimination, freedom of association, complying with all laws regarding hours and wages and employee privacy. Denbury respects international human rights principles and our commitments to human rights are guided by the United National Global Compact and the International Labor Organization’s Declaration of Fundamental Principals and Rights at Work. Our Code of Conduct and Human Rights Policy require employees to report any suspected human rights abuses. Denbury’s Human Rights Policy is available on our website at www.denbury.com under the “Sustainability” link.
FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATIONS
Numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the oil and gas industry.  Additions or changes to these laws and regulations are often made in response to the current political or economic environment. Compliance with the evolving 
Denbury Inc.

regulatory landscape is often difficult, and noncompliance can result in substantial penalties or the potential shutdown of operations. Compliance has also been complicated by an increasing trend for litigation challenging policy and regulatory changes, with judicial decisions increasing regulatory uncertainty, often delaying necessary approvals from agencies that may be the subject of conflicting injunctions, rulings or appeals. Additionally, the future annual cost of complying with all laws and regulations applicable to our operations is uncertain and will be ultimately determined by several factors, including future changes to legal and regulatory requirements. Management believes that continued compliance with existing laws and regulations applicable to our operations and future compliance therewith will not have a materially adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, although such laws and regulations, and compliance therewith, could cause significant delays or otherwise impede operations, which may, among other things, cause our expected production rates and cash flows to be less than anticipated.
The following sections describe some specific laws and regulations that may affect us.  We cannot predict the cost or impact of these or other future legislative or regulatory initiatives.
Regulation of Oil and Gas Exploration and Production
Our operations are subject to various types of laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels.  Such regulation includes requiring sometimes lengthy environmental review prior to approval of potential leasing, drilling, or other development projects; permits for drilling wells; maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells and regulating the location of wells; the method of drilling and casing wells; the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled; the compensation due to surface, and potentially pore space, owners for mineral development, enhanced oil recovery, and fluid disposal activities; the plugging and abandoning of wells; and the composition or disposal of chemicals and fluids used in connection with operations.  Our operations are also subject to various environmental and conservation laws and regulations.  These include regulation of the size of drilling, spacing or proration units and the density of wells that may be drilled in those units, and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties.  In addition, federal and state environmental and conservation laws, which establish maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells, generally prohibit or restrict the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability of production.  The effect of these laws and regulations may delay proposed development projects, limit the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and may limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill.  Regulatory requirements and compliance relative to the oil and gas industry increase our costs of doing business and, consequently, affect our profitability.
Federal Energy and Climate Change Legislation and Regulation
The Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty and Job Creation Act of 2011, among other things, updated federal pipeline safety standards, increased penalties for violations of such standards, gave the Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (the “PHMSA”) authority for new damage prevention and incident notification, and directed PHMSA to prescribe new minimum safety standards for CO2 pipelines. In late 2021, PHMSA adopted new regulations related to incident and annual reporting and safety requirements for onshore, rural natural gas gathering lines. The new regulations extend PHMSA’s jurisdiction to previously unregulated rural gathering lines.
Both federal and state authorities have in recent years proposed and enacted new regulations and policies to limit the emission of pollutants, including greenhouse gas emissions, as part of climate change initiatives and the Clean Air Act.  During the last ten years, both the EPA and Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) have proposed and issued such regulations and policies for the oil and gas industry. Those proposed and final regulations and policies were the subject of extensive administrative, judicial, and Congressional consideration during the Obama and Trump Administrations, which caused significant difficulty in determining which regulations were in force at any given time. The Biden Administration, through various executive orders and other policy statements, has made climate change a primary priority. On January 20, 2021, the Biden Administration issued Executive Order 13990, directing agencies to review all agency actions related to emissions and climate change taken under the Trump Administration. On June 30, 2021, President Biden signed into law a joint Congressional resolution disapproving the EPA’s 2020 policy rules related to greenhouse gas emissions from oil and gas industry activities under the Clean Air Act. On November 2, 2021, the EPA proposed new regulations for greenhouse gas emissions. The comment period for the new proposed rule closed on January 31, 2022, with a potential final rule to be published thereafter. BLM has also announced plans to introduce a new proposed rule related to venting and flaring in the oil and gas industry. While BLM’s proposal is listed on its regulatory agenda, the agency has not yet issued a proposed rule. Any resulting regulations adopted by the EPA or BLM could possibly be similar to, or even more stringent than, those promulgated by the agencies under the Obama Administration. Enforcement of such regulations may impose additional costs related to 
22


Denbury Inc.

compliance with these new emission limits, as well as inspections and maintenance of several types of equipment used in our operations. 
Federal, State or Indian Leases
As of December 31, 2021, approximately 30% of our net developed acreage and 22% of our December 2021 production related to oil and natural gas operations performed on federal acreage, including portions of CCA. Our operations on federal, state or Indian oil and gas leases, especially those in the Rocky Mountain region, are subject to numerous restrictions, including nondiscrimination statutes. Such operations must be conducted pursuant to certain on-site security regulations and other permits and authorizations issued by the BLM, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and other federal and state stakeholder agencies. On January 27, 2021, the Biden Administration, through executive action, suspended new leasing and other oil and natural gas approvals on federal lands. The executive action was challenged in court by a number of States and industry trade associations. A federal court in Louisiana granted a nationwide preliminary injunction against the executive action. While BLM has stated it will resume its oil and gas leasing program, the executive order, judicial challenge, and related additional environmental review have caused significant delay and caused some potentially available parcels to be delayed for bidding. On January 20, 2021, in addition, the Department of the Interior issued a secretarial order rescinding the ability for state and local offices of BLM and other Department of the Interior Bureaus to approve various oil and gas development activities – including permits to drill, certain surface distributing activities, resource management plans, and amendments to existing federal leases. The secretarial order instead consolidated that approval authority to the bureaus’ respective assistant secretaries and higher-ranked management. The secretarial order dissolved by its own terms in March 2021, but, on March 19, 2021, the Department of the Interior issued a memorandum that retained certain authority for approvals related to oil and gas development with the assistant secretary. Also, on January 20, 2021, the Biden Administration, through executive action, mandated that agencies calculate the social cost of potential emissions when considering approval for permits, development, leasing, or related approvals. This executive action was challenged in court by a number of states, and on February 11, 2022, a federal court in Louisiana granted a preliminary injunction preventing federal agencies from using the social cost metric. In subsequent filings with the court, the Department of the Interior stated that the court’s injunction will suspend and delay regulatory consideration of pending permits, development, leasing, and related approvals. While the courts have enjoined the executive actions and the secretarial order has expired, the actions have caused and continue to cause considerable delay related to the ability to obtain new leases and necessary approvals for oil and gas development. The inability to secure new leases or permits to drill on existing leases could prevent us from expanding our oil and gas operations, in both new locations and in areas currently leased for which permits have not yet been obtained. In addition, any action by the federal government to rescind previously issued permits on the Company’s existing leases could significantly disrupt our existing and future operations.
BLM has also announced plans to introduce a new proposed rule to update its oil and gas leasing process. The proposed rule may include increases to the fees, rents, royalty rates, and bonding requirements for new federal oil and gas leases. While BLM’s proposal is listed on its regulatory agenda, the agency has not yet issued a proposed rule. If such a rule is finalized, any increase in the fees related to oil and gas development on federal lands will increase our costs of doing business and, consequently, affect our profitability. 
In September 2021, the Office of Natural Resources Revenue (“ONRR”), the agency primarily responsible for collecting and ensuring correct federal and Indian royalty payments, withdrew a 2020 Trump Administration regulation regarding the valuation of oil and gas products and potential civil penalties for incorrect valuation related to federal royalties. ONRR’s action largely returns the valuation of oil and gas products and potential civil penalties for incorrect payment to the regulations in effect prior to 2020 and is ultimately expected to increase the amount of royalties collected by the federal government and potential civil penalties for incorrect payment, increasing our costs of doing business.
Environmental Regulations
Our oil and natural gas production, saltwater disposal operations, injection of CO2, and the processing, handling and disposal of materials such as hydrocarbons and naturally occurring radioactive materials (“NORM”) are subject to stringent regulation.  We could incur significant costs, including cleanup costs resulting from a release of product, third-party claims for property damage and personal injuries, or penalties and other sanctions as a result of any violations or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations or other laws and regulations applicable to our operations.  Changes in, or more stringent enforcement of, environmental laws and other laws applicable to our operations could also result in delays or additional operating costs and capital expenditures.

Various federal, state and local laws and regulations controlling the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment and human health, directly impact our oil and gas exploration, development and production operations.  These include, among others, (1) regulations adopted by the EPA and various state agencies regarding approved methods of disposal for certain hazardous and nonhazardous wastes; (2) the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act and analogous state laws that regulate the removal or remediation of previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), property contamination (including groundwater contamination), and remedial plugging operations to prevent future contamination; (3) the Clean Air Act and comparable state and local requirements already applicable to our operations and new restrictions on air emissions from our operations, including greenhouse gas emissions and those that could discourage the production of fossil fuels that, when used, ultimately release CO2; (4) the Clean Water Act and comparable state and local requirements already applicable to our operations and new restrictions on wastewater discharges from our operations; (5) the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, which contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of, and response to, oil spills into waters of the United States; (6) the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which is the principal federal statute governing the treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous wastes; (7) the Endangered Species Act and counterpart state legislation, which protects certain species (and their related habitats), including certain species that could be present on our leases, as threatened or endangered; (8) the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, which protects certain bird species, including certain species that could be present on our leases, from intentional and unintentional killing and other disturbances; and (9) state regulations and statutes governing the handling, treatment, storage and disposal of NORM and other wastes.
In the Rocky Mountain region, federal agencies’ actions based upon their environmental review responsibilities under the National Environmental Policy Act can significantly impact the scope and timing of hydrocarbon development by slowing the timing of individual applications for permits to drill and requests for rights-of-way and delaying large scale planning associated with region-level resource management plans, oil and gas lease sales, and project-level master development plans. In 2020, the Trump Administration enacted new regulations designed to streamline the federal environmental review process. In June 2021, the Biden Administration, acting through the Council on Environmental Quality (“CEQ”) responsible for enacting National Environmental Policy Act regulations, postponed federal agencies’ compliance with the 2020 regulations. On October 7, 2021, CEQ issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to largely return the National Environmental Policy Act regulations to those that existed prior to 2020 and to ensure federal agencies are adequately analyzing the potential climate change impacts from proposed projects. If such a rule is finalized, the federal environmental review process is expected to continue or even increase delay in federal decision making related to oil and gas development.
Management believes that we are currently in substantial compliance with existing applicable environmental laws and regulations, and does not currently anticipate that future compliance will have a materially adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, although such laws and regulations, and compliance therewith, could cause significant delays or otherwise impede operations, which may, among other things, cause our expected production rates and cash flows to be less than anticipated.
