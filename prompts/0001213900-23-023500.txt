ITEM 1. BUSINESS



We were incorporated in Delaware on August 7, 2017 for the purpose of entering into a merger, stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities (a “business combination”). To date, Allegro’s efforts have been limited to organizational activities, completion of its initial public offering and the evaluation of possible business combinations.



Initial Public Offering



Prior our initial public offering, we issued to Eric Rosenfeld, our Chief Executive Officer, an aggregate of 4,312,500 shares of common stock in exchange for a capital contribution of $25,000, or approximately $0.01 per share. Mr. Rosenfeld then transferred all of the shares to two trusts for the benefit of his immediate family members, and subsequently, a portion of such shares was transferred to the other initial stockholders in exchange for $0.01 per share. In April 2018, the initial stockholders contributed to our capital an aggregate of 575,000 shares for no additional consideration, leaving them with an aggregate of 3,737,500 shares of common stock.



On July 6, 2018, we closed our initial public offering of 14,950,000 units, including 1,950,000 units that were issued pursuant to the exercise in full of the underwriters’ over-allotment option, with each unit consisting of one share of common stock, one right, and one warrant. The initial public offering generated gross proceeds of $149,500,000.



Simultaneously with the consummation of the initial public offering, we consummated the private placement of 372,500 private placement units at a price of $10.00 per private placement unit, generating gross proceeds of $3,725,000. The private placement units were purchased by the initial stockholders, Cantor, and Chardan.



Following the closing of the initial public offering on July 6, 2018, an amount of $149,500,000 ($10.00 per unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the units and private placement units was placed in the Trust Account.



Dissolution of Trust Account; Delisting and Deregistration of Securities



Pursuant to the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, on March 31, 2020, the Company began the process of liquidating and distributing to its public stockholders their pro rata portion of the funds contained in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the amounts on deposit, less amounts that were able to be released to the Company to pay franchise and income taxes and up to $100,000 of interest that was able to be released to the Company to pay dissolution expenses. On April 21, 2020, all of the public shares were redeemed at a per share redemption price of $10.30. On August 23, 2021, we distributed the remaining restricted cash pro rata, to our former public stockholders in the amount of $129,957. The restricted cash balance represented the unused portion of our dissolution allowance and allowance for taxes.



An aggregate of approximately $781,700 of loans made by the initial stockholders to the Company in connection with extensions of time to complete an initial business will not be repaid and will be forgiven if we are unable to consummate a business combination and determine to liquidate and dissolve.



The initial stockholders waived their redemption rights with respect to the common stock issued prior to the Company’s initial public offering and the common stock underlying the Private Units. Accordingly, such initial stockholders did not participate in the redemption and an aggregate of 4,110,000 shares of common stock remain outstanding. Additionally, the Company’s rights and warrants remain outstanding.



On April 20, 2020, Nasdaq filed a Form 25 to delist and deregister the units, common stock, rights and warrants. Such securities were delisted from Nasdaq as of April 30, 2020 and deregistered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act as of July 9, 2020.

Current Operations



The Company’s current business plan is to seek, investigate, and, if warranted, acquire one or more businesses, and to pursue other related activities intended to enhance shareholder value. The acquisition of a business opportunity may be made by purchase, merger, exchange of stock, or otherwise, and may encompass assets or a business entity, such as a corporation, joint venture, or partnership. The Company has limited capital, and it is unlikely that the Company will be able to take advantage of more than one such business opportunity. The Company intends to seek opportunities demonstrating the potential of long-term growth as opposed to short-term earnings.



We currently have no agreements or understandings with any prospective business combination candidates and there are no assurances that we will find a suitable business with which to combine. The implementation of our business objectives is wholly contingent upon a business combination and/or the successful sale of our securities. We intend to utilize the proceeds of any offering, any sales of equity securities or debt securities, bank and other borrowings or a combination of those sources to effect a business combination with a target business which we believe may have significant growth potential. While we may, under certain circumstances, seek to effect business combinations with more than one target business, unless additional financing is obtained, we will not have sufficient proceeds remaining after an initial business combination to undertake additional business combinations.



The Company is unable to predict when it may participate in a business opportunity. Prior to making a decision to participate in a business opportunity, the Company will generally request that it be provided with written materials regarding the business opportunity containing such items as a description of products, services and company history; management resumes; financial information; available projections, with related assumptions upon which they are based; an explanation of proprietary products and services; evidence of existing patents, trademarks, or services marks, or rights thereto; present and proposed forms of compensation to management; a description of transactions between such company and its affiliates during relevant periods; a description of present and required facilities; an analysis of risks and competitive conditions; a financial plan of operation and estimated capital requirements; audited financial statements, or if they are not available, unaudited financial statements, together with reasonable assurances that audited financial statements would be able to be produced within a reasonable period of time following completion of a merger transaction; and other information deemed relevant.



As part of the Company’s investigation, the Company’s officers may meet personally with management and key personnel, may visit and inspect material facilities, obtain independent analysis or verification of certain information provided, check references of management and key personnel, and take other reasonable investigative measures, to the extent of the Company’s limited financial resources.



Competition



The Company expects to encounter substantial competition in its efforts to locate attractive opportunities, primarily from business development companies, venture capital partnerships and corporations, venture capital affiliates of large industrial and financial companies, small investment companies, and wealthy individuals. Many of these entities will have significantly greater experience, resources and managerial capabilities than the Company and will therefore be in a better position than the Company to obtain access to attractive business opportunities.
Employees



As of December 31, 2022, the Company had no employees.
