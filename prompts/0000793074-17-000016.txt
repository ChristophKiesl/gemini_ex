ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

General
We are a transportation and logistics company engaged primarily in transporting truckload shipments of general commodities in both interstate and intrastate commerce. We also provide logistics services through our Werner Logistics division (formerly Value Added Services or “VAS”). We believe we are one of the largest truckload carriers in the United States (based on total operating revenues), and our headquarters are located in Omaha, Nebraska, near the geographic center of our truckload service area. We were founded in 1956 by Clarence L. Werner, who started the business with one truck at the age of 19 and serves as our Executive Chairman. We were incorporated in the State of Nebraska in September 1982 and completed our initial public offering in June 1986 with a fleet of 632 trucks as of February 1986. At the end of 2016, our Truckload Transportation Services (“Truckload”) segment had a fleet of 7,100 trucks, of which 6,305 were company-operated and 795 were owned and operated by independent contractors. Our Werner Logistics division operated an additional 74 intermodal drayage trucks at the end of 2016.
We have two reportable segments – Truckload and Werner Logistics. You can find financial information regarding these segments and the geographic areas in which we conduct business in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Our Truckload segment is comprised of the One-Way Truckload and Specialized Services units. One-Way Truckload includes the following operating fleets: (i) the medium-to-long-haul van (“Van”) fleet transports a variety of consumer nondurable products and other commodities in truckload quantities over irregular routes using dry van trailers; (ii) the expedited (“Expedited”) fleet provides time-sensitive truckload services utilizing driver teams; and (iii) the regional short-haul (“Regional”) fleet provides comparable truckload van service within geographic regions across the United States. Specialized Services provides truckload services dedicated to a specific customer, generally for a retail distribution center or manufacturing facility, including services for products requiring specialized trailers such as flatbed or temperature-controlled trailers. Our Truckload fleets operate throughout the 48 contiguous U.S. states pursuant to operating authority, both common and contract, granted by the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) and pursuant to intrastate authority granted by various U.S. states. We also have authority to operate in several provinces of Canada and to provide through-trailer service into and out of Mexico. The principal types of freight we transport include retail store merchandise, consumer products, grocery products and manufactured products. We focus on transporting consumer nondurable products that generally ship more consistently throughout the year and whose volumes are generally more stable during a slowdown in the economy.
Our Werner Logistics segment is a non-asset-based transportation and logistics provider. Werner Logistics is comprised of the following four operating units that provide non-trucking services to our customers: (i) truck brokerage (“Brokerage”) uses contracted carriers to complete customer shipments; (ii) freight management (“Freight Management”) offers a full range of single-source logistics management services and solutions; (iii) the intermodal (“Intermodal”) unit offers rail transportation through alliances with rail and drayage providers as an alternative to truck transportation; and (iv) Werner Global Logistics international (“WGL”) provides complete management of global shipments from origin to destination using a combination of air, ocean, truck and rail transportation modes. Our Brokerage unit had transportation services contracts with 15,664 carriers as of December 31, 2016.
Marketing and Operations
Our business philosophy is to provide superior on-time customer service at a significant value for our customers. To accomplish this, we operate premium modern tractors and trailers. This equipment has fewer mechanical and maintenance issues and helps attract and retain experienced drivers. We continually develop our business processes and technology to improve customer service and driver retention. We focus on customers who value the broad geographic coverage, diversified truck and logistics services, equipment capacity, technology, customized services and flexibility available from a large, financially-stable transportation and logistics provider.
We operate in the truckload and logistics sectors of the transportation industry. Our Truckload segment provides specialized services to customers based on (i) each customer’s trailer needs (such as van, flatbed and temperature-controlled trailers), (ii) geographic area (regional and medium-to-long-haul van, including transport throughout Mexico and Canada), (iii) time-sensitive shipments

(expedited) or (iv) conversion of their private fleet to us (dedicated). In 2016, trucking revenues (net of fuel surcharge) and trucking fuel surcharge revenues accounted for 75% of total operating revenues, and non-trucking and other operating revenues (primarily Werner Logistics revenues) accounted for 25% of total operating revenues. Our Werner Logistics segment manages the transportation and logistics requirements for customers, providing customers with additional sources of truck capacity, alternative modes of transportation, a global delivery network and systems analysis to optimize transportation needs. Werner Logistics services include (i) truck brokerage, (ii) freight management, (iii) intermodal transport and (iv) international. The Werner Logistics international services are provided through our domestic and global subsidiary companies and include (i) ocean, air and ground transportation services, (ii) door-to-door freight forwarding and (iii) customs brokerage. Most Werner Logistics international services are provided throughout North America and Asia with additional coverage throughout Australia, Europe, South America and Africa. Werner Logistics is a non-asset-based transportation and logistics provider that is highly dependent on qualified associates, information systems and the services of qualified third-party capacity providers. You can find the revenues generated by services that accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues, consisting of Truckload and Werner Logistics, for the last three years under Item 7 of Part II of this Form 10-K.
We have a diversified freight base but are dependent on a relatively small number of customers for a significant portion of our freight. During 2016, our largest 5, 10, 25 and 50 customers comprised 27%, 43%, 61% and 74% of our revenues, respectively. No single customer generated more than 10% of our revenues in 2016. The industry groups of our top 50 customers are 48% retail and consumer products, 29% grocery products, 11% manufacturing/industrial and 12% logistics and other. Many of our One-Way Truckload customer contracts may be terminated upon 30 days’ notice, which is common in the truckload industry. Most of our Specialized Services customer contracts are one to three years in length and may be terminated by either party upon 30 to 90 days’ notice following the expiration of the contract’s first year, and we review rates in these contracts annually.
All of our company and independent contractor tractors are equipped with communication devices. These devices enable us and our drivers to conduct two-way communication using standardized and freeform messages. This technology also allows us to plan and monitor shipment progress. We automatically monitor truck movement and obtain specific data on the location of all trucks in the fleet every 15 minutes. Using the real-time global positioning data obtained from the devices, we have advanced application systems to improve customer and driver service. Examples of such application systems include: (i) an electronic logging system which records and monitors drivers’ hours of service and integrates with our information systems to pre-plan driver shipment assignments based on real-time available driving hours; (ii) software that pre-plans shipments drivers can trade enroute to meet driver home-time needs without compromising on-time delivery schedules; and (iii) automated “possible late load” tracking that informs the operations department of trucks possibly operating behind schedule, allowing us to take preventive measures to avoid late deliveries. In 1998, we began a successful pilot program and subsequently became the first trucking company in the United States to receive an exemption from DOT to use a global positioning-based paperless log system as an alternative to the paper logbooks traditionally used by truck drivers to track their daily work activities. We have used electronic logging devices (“ELDs”) to monitor and enforce drivers’ hours of service since 1996.
Seasonality
In the trucking industry, revenues generally follow a seasonal pattern. Peak freight demand has historically occurred in the months of September, October and November. After the December holiday season and during the remaining winter months, our freight volumes are typically lower because some customers reduce shipment levels. Our operating expenses have historically been higher in the winter months due primarily to decreased fuel efficiency, increased cold weather-related maintenance costs of revenue equipment and increased insurance and claims costs attributed to adverse winter weather conditions. We attempt to minimize the impact of seasonality through our marketing program by seeking additional freight from certain customers during traditionally slower shipping periods and focusing on transporting consumer nondurable products. Revenue can also be affected by adverse weather conditions, holidays and the number of business days that occur during a given period because revenue is directly related to the available working days of shippers.
Employee Associates and Independent Contractors
As of December 31, 2016, we employed 8,733 drivers; 607 mechanics and maintenance associates for the trucking operation; 1,225 office associates for the trucking operation; and 1,173 associates for Werner Logistics, international and other non-trucking operations. We also had 795 independent contractors who provide both a tractor and a driver or drivers. None of our U.S., Canadian or Chinese associates are represented by a collective bargaining unit, and we consider relations with our associates to be good.
We recognize that our professional driver workforce is one of our most valuable assets. Most of our professional drivers are compensated on a per-mile basis. For most company-employed drivers, the rate per mile generally increases with the drivers’ length of service. Professional drivers may earn additional compensation through incentive performance pay programs and for performing additional work associated with their job (such as loading and unloading freight and making extra stops and shorter mileage trips).

At times, there are driver shortages in the trucking industry. Availability of experienced drivers can be affected by (i) changes in the demographic composition of the workforce; (ii) alternative employment opportunities other than truck driving that become available in the economy; and (iii) individual drivers’ desire to be home more frequently. The driver market remained challenging in 2016, and the supply of recent driver training school graduates continues to tighten. We believe that a declining number of, and increased competition for, driver training school graduates, a low national unemployment rate, aging truck driver demographics and increased truck safety regulations are tightening driver supply. We believe our strong mileage utilization, financial strength and safety record are attractive to drivers when compared to many other carriers. Additionally, we believe our large percentage of driving jobs in shorter-haul operations (such as Dedicated and Regional) that allow drivers to return home more often is attractive to drivers.
We utilize recent driver training school graduates as a significant source of new drivers. These drivers have completed a training program at a driver training school, hold a commercial driver’s license (“CDL”) and are further trained by Werner-certified trainer drivers prior to that driver becoming a solo driver with their own truck. As mentioned above, the recruiting environment for recent driver training school graduates remained challenging in 2016. The availability of these drivers has been negatively impacted by the decreased availability of student loan financing for driver training schools. We own two driver training schools that operate a total of 13 driver training locations to assist with the training and development of drivers for our company and the industry. 
As economic conditions improve, competition for experienced drivers and recent driver training school graduates may increase and could become more challenging in 2017. We cannot predict whether we will experience future shortages in the availability of experienced drivers or driver training school graduates. If such a shortage were to occur and additional driver pay rate increases became necessary to attract and retain experienced drivers or driver training school graduates, our results of operations would be negatively impacted to the extent that we could not obtain corresponding freight rate increases.
We also recognize that independent contractors complement our company-employed drivers. Independent contractors supply their own tractors and drivers and are responsible for their operating expenses. Independent contractors also provide us with another source of drivers to support our fleet. We intend to maintain our emphasis on independent contractor recruiting, in addition to company driver recruitment. We, along with others in the trucking industry, however, continue to experience independent contractor recruitment and retention difficulties that have persisted over the past several years. Challenging operating conditions, including inflationary cost increases that are the responsibility of independent contractors and a shortage of financing available to independent contractors for equipment purchases, continue to make it difficult to recruit and retain independent contractors. If a shortage of independent contractors occurs, additional increases in per-mile settlement rates (for independent contractors) and driver pay rates (for company drivers) may become necessary to attract and retain a sufficient number of drivers. These increases could negatively affect our results of operations to the extent that we could not obtain corresponding freight rate increases.
Revenue Equipment
As of December 31, 2016, we operated 6,305 company tractors and 795 tractors owned by independent contractors in our Truckload segment. Our Werner Logistics segment operated an additional 74 company tractors at the end of 2016. The company tractors were primarily manufactured by Freightliner (a Daimler company), Peterbilt and Kenworth (both divisions of PACCAR) and Volvo. We adhere to a comprehensive maintenance program for both company tractors and trailers. We inspect independent contractor tractors prior to acceptance for compliance with Werner and DOT operational and safety requirements. We periodically inspect these tractors, in a manner similar to company tractor inspections, to monitor continued compliance. We also regulate the vehicle speed of company trucks to improve safety and fuel efficiency, and we have them set to not exceed 65 miles per hour.
The average age of our company truck fleet was 1.8 years at December 31, 2016, compared to 1.9 years at December 31, 2015. We increased our capital expenditures in 2015 and 2016 to lower the average age of our truck and trailer fleet. All of our trucks are equipped with satellite tracking devices. Approximately 72% of our company-owned trucks have collision mitigation safety systems and 62% of our company-owned trucks have automatic manual transmissions.
We operated 24,350 company-owned trailers at December 31, 2016. This total is comprised of 22,763 dry vans; 208 flatbeds; 1,333 temperature-controlled trailers; and 46 specialized trailers. Most of our trailers were manufactured by Wabash National Corporation. As of December 31, 2016, nearly all of our dry van trailer fleet consisted of 53-foot composite (DuraPlate®) trailers. We also provide other trailer lengths, such as 48-foot and 57-foot trailers, to meet the specialized needs of certain customers. Approximately 70% of our trailer fleet has satellite tracking; this is expected to grow to 90% of our trailer fleet by the end of 2017.
Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Werner Fleet Sales, sells our used trucks and trailers. Werner Fleet Sales has been in business since 1992 and operates in six locations. We may also trade used trucks to original equipment manufacturers when purchasing new trucks.

Fuel
In 2016, we purchased nearly all of our fuel from a predetermined network of fuel stops throughout the United States, of which approximately 96% was purchased from three large fuel stop chains. We negotiate discounted pricing based on historical purchase volumes with these fuel stop chains.
Shortages of fuel, increases in fuel prices and rationing of petroleum products can have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability. Our customer fuel surcharge reimbursement programs generally enable us to recover from our customers a majority, but not all, of higher fuel prices compared to normalized average fuel prices. These fuel surcharges, which automatically adjust depending on the U.S. Department of Energy (“DOE”) weekly retail on-highway diesel fuel prices, enable us to recoup much of the higher cost of fuel when prices increase and provide customers with the benefit of lower fuel costs when fuel prices decline. We do not generally recoup higher fuel costs for empty and out-of-route miles (which are not billable to customers) and truck idle time. We cannot predict whether fuel prices will increase or decrease in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges will be collected from customers. As of December 31, 2016, we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations.
We maintain aboveground and underground fuel storage tanks at many of our terminals. Leakage or damage to these facilities could expose us to environmental clean-up costs. The tanks are routinely inspected to help prevent and detect such problems.
Regulations
We are regulated by the U.S. DOT, and certain areas of our business are subject to various federal, state and international laws and regulations. DOT generally governs matters such as safety requirements, registration to engage in motor carrier operations, drivers’ hours of service (“HOS”), and certain mergers, consolidations, and acquisitions. Werner maintains a satisfactory DOT safety rating, which is the highest available rating. A conditional or unsatisfactory DOT safety rating could adversely impact our business as a proportion of our customer contracts require a satisfactory rating. Equipment weight and dimensions are also subject to federal, state, and international regulations with which we are required to comply.
The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration’s (“FMCSA”) Compliance, Safety, Accountability, (“CSA”) safety initiative monitors the safety performance of carriers. In December 2010, FMCSA made public the Safety Measurement System (“SMS”), which includes monthly updates of specific safety rating measurement and percentile ranking scores for over 500,000 trucking companies. Through SMS, the public could access carrier scores for CSA’s Behavior Analysis and Safety Improvement Categories (“BASICs”), as well as raw data as it relates to carriers’ roadside safety inspection performance, out-of-service rates, and moving violation histories. Within the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (“FAST”) Act of 2015 was a provision instructing FMCSA to commission a Transportation Research Board study of the accuracy of CSA and SMS data to identify high risk carriers and predict future crash risk. FMCSA must submit the study to Congress and issue a corrective action plan to address the deficiencies identified in the study. The day after enactment of the FAST Act, information regarding carrier alerts and percentile ranks (i.e., scores) was removed from public view until FMCSA completes the corrective action plan. We continue to monitor any CSA related developments.
FMCSA proposed to change the method for assigning a motor carrier’s Safety Fitness Determination (“SFD”) in January 2016. The proposed methodology would determine when a carrier is not fit to operate commercial motor vehicles (“CMVs”) in or affecting interstate commerce based on (i) the carrier’s performance in relation to a fixed failure standard across the CSA BASICs; (ii) an investigation; or (iii) a combination of on-road safety data and investigation information. Currently, the assignment of an SFD follows the completion of a labor-intensive compliance review conducted at the carrier’s place of business. These audits are primarily an assessment of paper records instead of on-road safety performance. The proposed SFD rule would replace the three-tier federal rating system in place since 1982 that assigns the rating of “satisfactory,” “conditional,” or “unsatisfactory” to federally regulated motor carriers with a single determination of “unfit,” which would require the carrier to either improve its operations or cease operations.
Interstate carriers are subject to the FMCSA HOS regulations. FMCSA adopted a final rule in December 2011 that included provisions affecting restart periods, rest breaks, on-duty time, and penalties for violations. We modified and tested our electronic HOS system and began dispatching drivers under the revised HOS rules effective July 1, 2013. We believe these HOS changes negatively impacted miles per truck by two to three percent when they became effective in 2013. We have taken steps to minimize the financial impact of the HOS changes. However, government restrictions of available driving hours will continue to negatively impact the productivity of some drivers and some fleets within our company. Several attempts have been made to address these negative effects of the HOS changes through the courts and legislative process. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 was passed by Congress with HOS language intended to provide additional certainty for the industry and reduce negative effects of restricted hours. The language requires the FMCSA study to demonstrate results with statistically significant improvements in safety and driver health, among other things, before the agency could reinstate restart rule restrictions that became effective in July 2013. However, the new legislation did not include language specifically stipulating the industry would continue to operate 
4

under the pre-July 2013 restart rules if the study does not conclude the restrictions offer significant improvements. Due to this oversight, there was a risk of the restart provisions being eliminated unless corrected. This oversight was addressed by Congress in December 2016 through the passage of the Fiscal Year 2017 Continuing Resolution, which allows carriers to comply with the pre-July 2013 restart provision. If the FMCSA study does not meet the criteria required by Congress, the pre-July 2013 restart rule continues to be in effect indefinitely because of the corrective language.
Werner is the industry leader for ELDs for driver hours. We pioneered the Werner Paperless Logging System in 1996 that was subsequently approved for our use by FMCSA in 1998. In an effort to increase highway safety and improve compliance, Werner supports FMCSA’s ELD mandate. In January 2011, FMCSA proposed a rule requiring installation and use of ELDs by nearly all carriers to enhance the monitoring and enforcement of the driver HOS rules. Federal legislation required DOT to promulgate rules and regulations mandating the use of ELDs. The final rule was issued in December 2015, and carriers have until December 2017 to adopt and use compliant ELDs. In March 2016, a legal complaint was filed by the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association (“OOIDA”) to overturn the ELD mandate. OOIDA asked the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals to strike down the rule, arguing the rule is an unconstitutional violation of truckers’ rights and will do little to enhance safety. On October 31, 2016, OOIDA’s lawsuit was denied, and it is expected that OOIDA will appeal the decision to the Supreme Court.
FMCSA published a final rule that establishes the CDL Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse in December 2016, which requires motor carriers, designated service agents, medical review officers, and substance abuse professionals to submit records related to drug and alcohol tests to a nationwide database. Carriers and service agents are required to report test refusals and positive results as well as query the database prior to hiring an applicant. The rule is effective January 5, 2017, with final compliance required by January 6, 2020.
The minimum requirements for entry-level driver training (“ELDT”) have been an ongoing FMCSA rulemaking for over 25 years. In early 2015, FMCSA convened a “Negotiated Rulemaking” advisory committee to broker a compromise. In March 2016, FMCSA issued a proposed rule that was primarily a reflection of the majority opinion of the committee. FMCSA issued its final rule in December 2016. Unlike the proposal, the final rule did not include minimum hours in the classroom or behind-the-wheel, but instead requires that the behind-the-wheel proficiency be determined by the instructor’s evaluation. Overall, we believe the rule succeeds in outlining a core curriculum that can lead to improved trucking safety for the industry and general public. On December 27, 2016, four members of the advisory committee petitioned FMCSA to reconsider the final rule in regard to the issue of minimum behind-the-wheel hours. This final rule was slated to take effect February 6, 2017, with a compliance date of February 7, 2020. However, agencies were directed by the President in January 2017 to temporarily postpone the effective date of rules published in the Federal Register but not yet effective. We will continue to monitor the status of this rulemaking as it will directly impact our schools and the hiring of professional drivers.
The Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and DOT announced in August 2011 Phase I of the Clean Power Plan, which was the first-ever program to reduce greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions and improvements to fuel efficiency for model year (“MY”) 2014-2018 heavy-duty trucks. In August 2016, EPA and DOT issued Phase II of the GHG and fuel economy plan impacting trucks beginning in MY 2021 with requirements phased in to 2027. The final rule requires a reduction of up to 25 percent in carbon emissions from tractor-trailers over the next decade. Newly manufactured trailers, left out of the first phase, will have aerodynamic requirements beginning in 2021 with tighter standards phased in until 2027. On December 20, 2016, EPA issued a statement acknowledging the need to further reduce nitrogen oxide emissions and is committed to finalize a rule by the end of 2019 and begin implementing new standards with MY 2024 vehicles. The implementation timing is being aligned with engine and vehicle GHG and fuel standard milestones under Phase II.
California’s ongoing emissions reduction goals have significantly impacted the industry. On-Road Heavy Duty Vehicle Emissions Regulations adopted by the state, not only apply to California intrastate carriers, but also to carriers outside of California who enter the state with their equipment. Werner continues to comply with California’s Low Emission Transportation Refrigerated Unit (“TRU”) In-Use Performance Standards and its Tractor-Trailer GHG Reduction Rule, which is structured over a period of years to ensure ongoing compliance. We continue undertaking strategies to structure our fleet plans to operate compliant equipment in California.
WGL, through its domestic and global subsidiary companies, holds a variety of licenses required to carry out its international services. These licenses permit us to provide services as a Non-Vessel Operating Common Carrier (“NVOCC”), customs broker, freight forwarder, indirect air carrier, accredited cargo agent and others. These international services subject us to regulation by the Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”) and Customs and Borders Protection (“CBP”) agencies of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission (“FMC”), the International Air Transport Association (“IATA”), as well as similar regulatory agencies in foreign jurisdictions.

Our operations are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, many of which are implemented by the EPA and similar state regulatory agencies. These laws and regulations govern the management of hazardous wastes, discharge of pollutants into the air and surface and underground waters and disposal of certain substances. We do not believe that compliance with these regulations has a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position.
Various provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”) may alter the competitive environment regarding shipments in and out of Mexico and Canada. Recent political activity suggests that changes to NAFTA may be forthcoming, but we believe we are prepared to respond to any changes that may occur to this agreement. We conduct a substantial amount of business in international freight shipments to and from the United States, Mexico, and Canada (see Note 9 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10-K). We believe we are one of the largest truckload carriers in terms of freight volume shipped to and from the United States, Mexico, and Canada.
Werner is dedicated to increasing driver safety and driver capability through participating in the development of meaningful public policy by continuing to evaluate the actions of regulatory agencies that have impact on our operations.
Competition
The freight transportation industry is highly competitive and includes thousands of trucking and non-asset-based logistics companies. We have a small share of the markets we target. Our Truckload segment competes primarily with other truckload carriers. Logistics companies, intermodal companies, railroads, less-than-truckload carriers and private carriers provide competition for both our Truckload and Werner Logistics segments. Our Werner Logistics segment also competes for the services of third-party capacity providers.
Competition for the freight we transport or manage is based primarily on service, efficiency, available capacity and, to some degree, on freight rates alone. We believe that few other truckload carriers have greater financial resources, own more equipment or carry a larger volume of freight than us. We believe we are one of the largest carriers in the truckload transportation industry based on total operating revenues.
