Overview
 We are a gene therapy company leveraging breakthroughs in human genetics with the goal of developing and commercializing disease-modifying AAV-based gene therapies for patients with devastating neurodegenerative diseases. We are applying a precision medicine approach to neurodegeneration by studying our gene therapies in genetically defined patient populations. We believe this will increase the probability of creating disease-modifying therapies that improve patients’ lives. Our lead program is PR001 for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease with GBA1 mutation, or PD-GBA, and neuronopathic (Type 2 or Type 3) Gaucher disease, or nGD. We are focused on developing a broad pipeline of gene therapies for a range of neurodegenerative diseases, including PR006 for the treatment of frontotemporal dementia with GRN mutation, or FTD-GRN, and PR004 for the treatment of synucleinopathies. 
 Our differentiated approach to developing gene therapies for neurodegenerative diseases is designed to mitigate challenges faced by others in the development of therapeutics for the central nervous system, or CNS. We select targets for diseases that correspond to patient populations with particular genetic mutations whom we believe can be treated by increasing or decreasing the expression of a particular gene, which makes them well-suited for gene therapy. We apply our deep understanding of human genetics to design our gene therapy product candidates, each of which is intended to be a one-time treatment to address the key underlying genetic mutation that we believe drives disease progression. 
 We are developing our lead program, PR001, to treat patients with PD-GBA and nGD. PD-GBA affects 7% to 10% of the total Parkinson’s disease population worldwide, and an estimated 90,000 individuals in the United States alone. Gaucher disease is among the most common lysosomal storage disorders, with an estimated global prevalence of one per 30,000 to one per 100,000. Patients with nGD exhibit neurological manifestations in addition to the non-CNS manifestations of Gaucher disease, and represent approximately 6% of all Gaucher disease cases in the United States. 
 PD-GBA and Gaucher disease share the same underlying genetic mechanism, and we believe they represent a continuum of pathology. The symptoms and severity of the CNS disease in PD-GBA and Gaucher disease depend on the level of enzyme deficiency, which is driven by both the severity and number of GBA1 mutations. GBA1 encodes the lysosomal enzyme, beta-glucocerebrosidase, or GCase. PD-GBA patients have a mutation in one chromosomal copy of GBA1 and Gaucher disease patients have mutations in both chromosomal copies of GBA1. These mutations lead to a deficiency of GCase, resulting in the non-CNS manifestations of Gaucher disease as well as lysosomal dysfunction in CNS cells, which we believe leads to the inflammation and neurodegeneration present in PD-GBA and nGD patients. Approved enzyme replacement therapies, or ERTs, which restore GCase, are effective for the treatment of the non-CNS manifestations of Gaucher disease, but ERTs cannot cross the blood-brain barrier to treat neurodegeneration. Based on the common genetically driven mechanism of PD-GBA and Gaucher disease, we have designed PR001 to express GBA1 in patients’ CNS cells. We believe that restoring GBA1 in the CNS will slow or stop disease progression in PD-GBA and nGD patients. 
 We have initiated dosing in the PROPEL trial, our Phase 1/2 clinical trial of PR001 for the treatment of PD-GBA patients.  We currently intend to report interim data on a subset of patients from this trial in the second half of 2020.  In December 2019, we announced that our Investigational New Drug application, or IND, for PR001 for the treatment of nGD is now active. We currently intend to initiate two Phase 1/2 clinical trials of PR001 for the treatment of nGD patients in 2020, the first for patients with Type 2 Gaucher disease and the second for patients with Type 3 Gaucher disease. Our Phase 1/2 clinical trials in the PD-GBA and nGD patient populations will investigate the safety and tolerability of PR001, and will also measure key biomarkers and exploratory efficacy endpoints. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, has granted PR001 Orphan Drug designation for the treatment of Gaucher disease and Rare Pediatric Disease Designation for the treatment of nGD. In addition, the FDA has granted Fast Track designation for PR001 for the treatment of PD-GBA. In our comprehensive preclinical program in both mouse models and non-human primates, PR001 was observed to be well tolerated and demonstrated robust and widespread biodistribution. Additionally, in mouse models, we observed significant increases in enzyme activity, reductions in lipid accumulation and improvements in motor function.

We are also developing PR006 for the treatment of FTD-GRN. FTD is the most common cause of dementia in people under age 60 and results from the progressive degeneration of the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain, which control decision-making, behavior, emotion and language. Prevalence of FTD is estimated to be 50,000 to 60,000 individuals in the United States and 80,000 to 110,000 individuals in the European Union. Five to 10% of FTD patients have a GRN mutation.
 GRN encodes the human glycoprotein progranulin. Healthy levels of progranulin are necessary for cellular processes such as lysosomal function, neuronal survival and normal microglial activities. FTD-GRN patients have a loss-of-function mutation in a single copy of GRN leading to a 50% or greater decrease in the level of progranulin which results in lysosomal dysfunction and ineffective protein degradation and recycling. We have designed PR006 to express GRN in patients’ CNS cells. We believe that restoring GRN in the CNS will slow or stop disease progression in FTD-GRN patients. 
 In March 2020, we announced that our IND for PR006 for the treatment of FTD-GRN is now active. Study startup activities are ongoing for the PROCLAIM trial, our Phase 1/2 clinical trial of PR006 for the treatment of FTD-GRN patients, and we anticipate that this trial will initiate in mid-2020. The FDA has granted Fast Track designation for PR006 for the treatment of FTD-GRN and Orphan Drug designation for PR006 for the treatment of FTD. In our comprehensive preclinical program in in vitro models, mouse models and non-human primates, PR006 was observed to be well tolerated and demonstrated robust and widespread biodistribution. Additionally, in mouse models, PR006 increased expression of progranulin protein in the brain and CSF, reduced indicators of lysosomal dysfunction in the brain, and suppressed expression of markers of inflammation in the brain.  
 We are also currently conducting preclinical studies of PR004 for the treatment of synucleinopathies and developing a broad pipeline of potentially disease-modifying AAV gene therapies for the potential treatment of a range of neurodegenerative diseases with high unmet medical need. 
 All of our current programs utilize adeno-associated virus, or AAV, gene therapy technology, which we believe is particularly well-suited for the treatment of CNS diseases. AAV-based viral vectors have been observed in third-party clinical trials to be well-tolerated and to have promise in delivering stable, long-lasting transgene expression in a range of tissues, including the CNS. We have initially chosen to use AAV9 based on its transformational biological properties and track record, which we believe will translate into a positive clinical effect in our initial indications. In a third-party Phase 1 clinical trial in Type 1 spinal muscular atrophy, AAV9 was observed to enable gene delivery in the CNS and broad brain-wide biodistribution with a single administration. We have entered into license agreements with REGENXBIO Inc., or REGENXBIO, pursuant to which they granted us an exclusive, worldwide license to use AAV9 delivering the gene encoding for GBA1 for the treatment of disease, as well as three distinct exclusive options for specified genes for the treatment of disease. In April 2019, we exercised all three options, including for AAV9 delivering the genes encoding for progranulin and α-Synuclein. For our initial programs, we plan to deliver directly to the cerebrospinal fluid via a minimally invasive non-surgical procedure. 
 Our company was founded through a collaborative effort by Asa Abeliovich, M.D., Ph.D., our Chief Executive Officer, OrbiMed and The Silverstein Foundation for Parkinson’s with GBA, who shared a common vision: to cure Parkinson’s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. Dr. Abeliovich and our other scientific and clinical leaders bring a deep understanding of the human genetics of neurodegenerative diseases, the underlying molecular mechanisms by which genetic mutations cause these diseases, and how to optimally design potential therapies to restore the function impaired by these genetic mutations. We intend to apply our expertise to developing therapies that have potential to slow or stop disease progression for patients.

Our Approach 
 Our Precision Medicine Approach to Neurodegeneration 
 Major degenerative disorders of the CNS, including Parkinson’s disease, FTD, Alzheimer’s disease, ALS and DLB, are characterized by their relentless and devastating courses. Patients suffering from these diseases currently have no therapies available to them that slow or reverse disease progression. 
 In the past, attempts to identify potential drug targets for neurodegenerative diseases have largely focused on addressing pathological manifestations instead of the underlying genetic cause of disease. Clinical trials have often enrolled patients diagnosed by symptoms only, leading to heterogeneity of the patient populations studied, which can confound trial results. Further, many clinical studies have lacked meaningful early clinical or biomarker endpoints to provide timely proof-of-concept data. As a result of these challenges, the vast majority of potential therapeutics developed to modify or cure neurodegenerative diseases have failed. 
 Our differentiated approach to developing therapies for neurodegenerative diseases is designed to mitigate these challenges. We select our targets based on our deep understanding of human genetics. By studying our gene therapies in genetically defined patient populations, we are applying a precision medicine approach to neurodegeneration, which we believe will increase the probability of creating disease-modifying therapies that improve patients’ lives. 
 Our founder and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Abeliovich, and our other scientific leaders bring a deep understanding of the human genetics of neurodegenerative diseases, the underlying molecular mechanisms by which genetic mutations cause these diseases, and how to optimally design potential therapies to restore the function impaired by these genetic mutations. Dr. Abeliovich has spent more than 25 years researching the genetics of neurodegenerative diseases and the molecular mechanisms that translate risk-associated gene variants into disease-causing pathology. In recent years, human genetic studies, including genome-wide association and deep sequencing studies that compare patients with a particular neurodegenerative disease to healthy controls, have identified a number of genes that are directly associated with neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s disease, FTD, Alzheimer’s disease, ALS and DLB. Many of these identified risk genes are known to play a role in lysosomal function and lysosomal trafficking, and Dr. Abeliovich has been a pioneer in investigating and explaining how these identified genetic mutations, and the resulting lysosomal dysfunction, can cause neurodegeneration. Our team is at the forefront of scientific discovery in the areas of human genetics of neurodegenerative disease, and we intend to apply our expertise to developing therapies that have the potential to slow or stop disease progression for patients. 
 Human Genetics and the Role of Lysosomal Dysfunction in Neurodegeneration 
 Lysosomes are membrane-bound organelles found in all cells and serve as the cell’s “recycling center.” Enzymes within the lysosome act to degrade proteins, lipids and sugars, as well as entire organelles such as mitochondria, that come in from the cell’s cytoplasm (through autophagic trafficking) or its exterior (through endosomal trafficking). Lysosomes play an especially critical role in long-lived cells, such as neurons, and in the aging process. 
 Genetic mutations in lysosomal genes alter the function of key lysosomal components, such as enzymes, which leads to the accumulation of macromolecules, such as glycolipids and toxic proteins. This in turn leads to 
 6
 
insufficient lysosomal function, resulting in toxicity and inflammation, which we believe causes neurodegenerative disease, as shown in the figure below. 
 Mutations in Lysosomal Genes Cause Lysosomal Dysfunction 
 Leading to Toxicity, Inflammation and Neurodegenerative Disease
 
Severe lysosomal deficiencies lead to rare childhood illnesses, called lysosomal storage disorders. More modest lysosomal deficiencies can lead to the gradual accumulation of toxic substrates in long-lived cells, particularly in the CNS, and present as neurodegenerative diseases of aging. Enzyme replacement therapy, or ERT, has been shown to be efficacious in treating certain lysosomal storage disorders, but ERTs cannot cross the blood-brain barrier to treat neurodegenerative diseases or the neurological manifestations of lysosomal storage disorders, such as nGD. 
 Numerous studies have elucidated the molecular mechanisms by which lysosomal dysfunction causes the pathology observed in neurodegenerative diseases. For example, PD-GBA patients have reduced levels of the lysosomal acid beta-glucocerebrosidase, or GCase, the lysosomal enzyme encoded by the GBA1 gene that catalyzes the conversion of the glycosphingolipid substrate glucosylceramide, or GluCer, into glucose and ceramide. In these patients the accumulation of toxic glycolipids induces further lysosomal dysfunction as well as aggregation of α-Synuclein, a pathological hallmark of Parkinson’s disease. Lysosomal dysfunction is also an important feature of FTD in patients with reduced levels of progranulin, caused by GRN mutations. Progranulin is required for the maintenance of lysosomes. Other genes associated with Parkinson’s disease, FTD, Alzheimer’s disease, ALS and DLB are also known to encode components of lysosomes or components of the machinery that traffic protein cargo to lysosomes. 
 We believe that restoring or enhancing lysosomal function will improve the health of CNS cells and slow or stop the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. 
 Indication and Target Selection 
 We are applying a precision medicine approach to developing gene therapies for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases by leveraging our deep understanding of human genetics. We select the indications and targets for our pipeline programs based on the following criteria: 

• | Patient populations with high unmet need. We aim to help patient populations with devastating neurodegenerative diseases where gene therapy could have a transformational impact.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Clearly defined and genetically driven disease mechanism. We believe our deep understanding of human genetics and neurodegenerative disease biology allows us to effectively select targets.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 7
 
 
• | Well-suited for gene therapy. We select targets for diseases that we believe can be treated by increasing or decreasing the expression of a particular gene, which makes them well-suited for gene therapy.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Compelling preclinical data. When possible, we leverage existing preclinical or clinical evidence suggesting that modulating the target will be safe and will modify or cure the underlying pathology.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Genetically defined patient populations. We select targets that correspond to patient populations with a particular genetic mutation, increasing the homogeneity of our studied patient populations and potentially increasing the likelihood of demonstrating efficacy.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Biomarkers that may provide early clinical proof-of-mechanism. We plan to measure biomarkers of target engagement at an early time point in each of our clinical trials, potentially enabling us to establish proof-of-mechanism.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Targets with large potential market opportunity. We are pursuing targets that have application in at least one sizeable patient population with high unmet need. For example, our lead indication for PR001 is PD-GBA, which affects more than 90,000 individuals in the United States alone.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Technological Approach 
 We are leveraging breakthroughs in human genetics and the transformational potential of AAV gene therapy with the goal of developing and commercializing disease-modifying gene therapies for patients with neurodegenerative diseases with high unmet medical need. AAV-based viral vectors have been observed in third-party clinical trials to be well-tolerated and to have promise in delivering stable, long-lasting transgene expression in a range of tissues, including in the CNS. Many clinical trials of AAV-based gene therapies are currently ongoing, and at least two AAV-based gene therapies have been approved in the United States. 
 We believe AAV gene therapy is a modality particularly well-suited for treating CNS diseases. Long-term gene expression and durable results may be achievable in the CNS following one-time dosing with an AAV vector, because most CNS cells typically do not divide or turn over. The CNS is an immune privileged site, which increases the likelihood of efficacy and reduces the risk of harmful immune response when delivery is localized. Targeted delivery to the CNS potentially requires a lower dose than systemic delivery, thereby lowering manufacturing requirements. Further, AAV is not known to cause any disease in humans and AAV gene therapies do not readily integrate into the genome of the target cell, reducing the potential for developing cancer as a result of treatment. 
 We have chosen to use AAV9 as the capsid, or the outer viral protein shell that encloses the DNA cargo, for our initial programs based on its transformational biological properties and track record, which we believe will translate into a positive clinical effect in our initial target indications. In a third-party Phase 1 clinical trial in Type 1 spinal muscular atrophy, AAV9 was observed to enable gene delivery in the CNS and broad brain-wide biodistribution with a single administration. Once the therapeutic gene is transduced to cells of the CNS, we believe the cells will be able to continue to produce the therapeutic protein for years and, potentially, the rest of the patient’s life. 
 By developing our AAV9-based gene therapies for genetically defined patient populations, we are applying a precision medicine approach to neurodegeneration, which we believe will increase the probability of creating disease-modifying therapies that improve patient outcomes. We are seeking to replace deficient proteins in genetically defined patient populations where CNS disease is driven by a loss-of-function mutation, and inhibit expression of toxic proteins in the context of a gain-of-function mutation. We have entered into a license agreement with REGENXBIO pursuant to which REGENXBIO granted us an exclusive, worldwide license to use AAV9 delivering the gene encoding for GBA1 for the treatment of disease. We have also entered into a license agreement with REGENXBIO pursuant to which REGENXBIO granted us three distinct exclusive options for specified genes for the treatment of disease. In April 2019, we exercised all three options, including for AAV9 delivering the genes encoding for progranulin and α-Synuclein. 
 We are engineering and optimizing AAV gene therapies that we believe are best suited for each of our target indications. The key components of an AAV gene therapy include: (1) the capsid, or the outer viral protein shell that encloses the DNA cargo; (2) the therapeutic gene, or transgene; and (3) the regulatory elements that drive the ultimate level of expression of the transgene. 
 8
 
To design the optimal gene therapy for a target patient population, we focus on optimizing each element in order to improve therapeutic outcomes: 
  
• | Selection of capsid. We believe AAV viral vectors are uniquely well-suited to deliver genetic material to the CNS. We have initially selected AAV9 because it has demonstrated efficacy, an acceptable safety profile, efficient gene delivery in the CNS, broad brain-wide biodistribution and manufacturability in third-party clinical trials in other indications. We will continue to evaluate the latest scientific understanding of capsid technology to select the optimal capsid for each of our future programs.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Selection of transgenes. We design gene therapies with transgenes that express and/or knock down one or more genes that have been identified as potentially disease-modifying based on human genetic studies of neurodegenerative diseases. In the case of diseases caused by loss-of-function mutations, we design codon-optimized DNA encoding wild-type protein, in order to minimize safety risk. In the case of diseases caused by gain-of-function mutations, we design DNA encoding RNA molecules that inhibit expression of the target gene based on RNA interference, or RNAi, technology. We also have a unique approach that combines overexpression and RNAi.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Optimization of regulatory elements. We select the other elements of our vectors, including promotors and enhancers, to optimize expression level, localization, manufacturability and safety. For our initial programs, we have chosen elements that have been validated via inclusion in other gene therapy programs that have been tested in humans.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Route of administration. Our goal is to utilize vectors that can achieve the desired therapeutic effect efficiently following a one-time treatment via a minimally invasive route of administration. For our initial programs, we have chosen to deliver our gene therapies directly to the cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF, via a non-surgical procedure. In preclinical studies, CSF administration of AAV9 has demonstrated effective biodistribution broadly across the CNS and limited toxicity. Intra-CSF delivery typically requires less drug product than systemic delivery.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Feasibility of manufacturing. We seek to utilize vectors that can be produced in a cost-effective, reliable and scalable manner. We selected AAV9 for our initial programs in part due to its well-characterized manufacturing process.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We will continue to evaluate the optimal vector technology for the biology we are addressing and expect that our current and future product candidates will make use of technological advances. 
 Our Manufacturing Approach 
 Our strategy is to advance potential therapies into clinical trials as efficiently and safely as possible. To accomplish this goal, we have established our own internal process development capabilities, and we are working with one of our experienced contract development and manufacturing organizations, or CDMOs, to produce material compliant with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, in a robust, state-of-the-art process based on adherent HEK293 cells. This approach was designed to increase our speed of development, ensure consistent product quality and regulatory compliance, and ensure predictable production costs. With this CDMO, we have now completed GMP production of sufficient quantities of PR001 and PR006 to supply our planned Phase 1/2 clinical trials for PD-GBA, nGD and FTD-GRN.
 Since our goal is to develop therapies that may benefit patient populations of significant size, we are also developing a late stage and commercial manufacturing process that can scale to supply a large market. We are working with another CDMO, Lonza, in close collaboration with our internal process development team, on a scalable baculovirus/Sf9 production system to manufacture PR001 and PR006 for late-stage clinical and commercial supplies. Our collaboration with Lonza also has the potential to extend to our future pipeline of AAV-based gene therapy programs. In collaboration with Lonza, we have developed and scaled up a process that demonstrates promising yield and potency, and our GMP manufacturing preparations are underway. We have also initiated studies and assessments to demonstrate comparability between the material produced in the baculovirus/Sf9 production system and the material produced in the HEK293 production system.

In the baculovirus/Sf9 production system, AAV vectors are produced by infection of insect cells with recombinant baculoviruses. This scalable suspension production system, using single-use bioreactors, is designed to produce higher yields of vectors more cost-effectively and efficiently than current mammalian cell-based approaches. Other gene therapy companies have used baculovirus/Sf9 production systems to produce AAV material that has been used in human clinical trials and have demonstrated consistent process yields and product qualities. We believe the baculovirus production system maximizes our ability to ensure cost-efficient, safe and scalable supply at the higher quantities required for late-stage clinical development and commercialization.
 PR001 for the Treatment of PD-GBA and nGD 
 We are currently developing PR001, our gene therapy candidate which utilizes an AAV9 vector to deliver codon-optimized DNA encoding wild-type GCase, for PD-GBA and nGD. We have initiated dosing in the PROPEL trial, our Phase 1/2 clinical trial of PR001 for the treatment of PD-GBA patients, and we currently intend to report interim data on a subset of patients from this trial in the second half of 2020. In December 2019, we announced that our IND for PR001 for the treatment of nGD is now active. We currently intend to initiate two Phase 1/2 clinical trials of PR001 for the treatment of nGD patients in 2020, the first for patients with Type 2 Gaucher disease and the second for patients with Type 3 Gaucher disease. Our Phase 1/2 clinical trials in the PD-GBA and nGD patient populations will investigate the safety and tolerability of PR001, and will also measure key biomarkers and exploratory efficacy endpoints. The FDA has granted PR001 Orphan Drug designation for the treatment of Gaucher disease and Rare Disease Designation for the treatment of neuronopathic Gaucher disease. In addition, the FDA granted Fast Track designation for PR001 for the treatment of PD-GBA. The close causal link between PD-GBA and Gaucher disease has been established by both human genetic and clinical studies, supporting our strategy of developing PR001 for both indications. We believe Parkinson’s and Gaucher diseases represent a continuum of pathology with the same underlying mechanism. The symptoms and severity of the CNS disease depend on the level of enzyme deficiency, which is driven by both the type and number of GBA1 mutations. 
 Overview of Parkinson’s Disease and Gaucher Disease 
 Parkinson’s Disease 
 Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder most commonly characterized by resting tremor, bradykinesia (slow movement), rigidity and gait difficulty. While Parkinson’s disease is generally thought of as a disease of motor function, it is now well-recognized that it broadly affects the peripheral and central nervous system. Patients suffer from a range of non-motor symptoms, including loss of sense of smell, difficulty swallowing, urinary symptoms, constipation, sleep behavior disorders, hypotension, depression, psychosis, dementia and cognitive impairment. We estimate that Parkinson’s disease affects up to one million people in the United States and seven million people worldwide. 
 Parkinson’s disease pathology involves loss of certain neuronal populations (including dopamine neurons), the presence of intraneuronal protein aggregates and other lysosomal abnormalities. These are a consequence of ineffective lysosome-mediated degradation and recycling of defective proteins and other cellular components. 
 This lysosomal dysfunction leads to toxicity and inflammation as well as the accumulation of a-Synuclein. Alpha-Synuclein is a protein that, in Parkinson’s disease patients, forms toxic aggregates in the brain. Lewy bodies, which characterize Parkinson’s disease, are intraneuronal structures composed in part of these a-Synuclein aggregates. 
 The scientific and medical communities now acknowledge that Parkinson’s disease is a brain-wide disorder. The progression of Lewy body pathology occurs in a predictable, anatomical sequence called Braak stages, with the clinical manifestations generally reflecting the areas of the nervous system involved. At the onset of motor symptoms, patients typically display abundant Lewy body pathology in the ventral midbrain, within the brain stem. However, as the disease progresses, Lewy bodies accumulate more broadly throughout the brain. Such progression can manifest as severe motor symptoms with gait impairment, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and dementia. We believe that disease-modifying therapeutic approaches for Parkinson’s disease should address this brain-wide pathology. 
 10
 
Human genetic studies have identified over 40 potentially causative and risk genes for Parkinson’s disease. Many of these genes are implicated in lysosomal function or lysosomal trafficking, indicating that lysosome dysfunction is the common denominator that underlies Parkinson’s disease pathology. We believe that these genetic mutations cause lysosomal defects, which lead to the neuropathological hallmarks of Parkinson’s disease including a-Synuclein aggregate accumulation, inflammation and further lysosomal abnormalities. 
 Among these Parkinson’s-associated genes, the GBA1 gene is considered to be highly clinically relevant. Individuals with a single mutated copy of the GBA1 gene have a three to ten times higher risk of developing Parkinson’s disease than individuals with no mutations in the GBA1 gene. Seven to ten percent of Parkinson’s disease patients worldwide and 9% to 10% of Parkinson’s disease patients in the United States have a GBA1 mutation, yielding an estimated prevalence of an estimated 90,000 to 100,000 PD-GBA patients in the United States alone. GBA1 mutations impact the risk of developing Parkinson’s disease as well as many other aspects of the disease course, including the severity, age of onset and rate of progression of disease and the likelihood of dementia. 
 The GBA1 gene encodes the lysosomal enzyme GCase, which catalyzes the conversion of GluCer into glucose and ceramide. Reduced levels of GCase activity in PD-GBA patients may lead to accumulation of glycolipid substrates including GluCer and glucosylsphingosine, or GluSph, as well as altered production of ceramide and secondary changes in other lipids. The glycolipid substrate accumulation is toxic and pro-inflammatory, leading to lysosomal dysfunction and accumulation and aggregation of a-Synuclein in cells. The reduction in ceramide has also been linked to neurodegeneration and a-Synuclein pathology in model systems, and has been observed in Parkinson’s disease brains. The mechanism by which GBA1 mutation causes Parkinson’s disease is depicted in the figure below. 
 
Parkinson’s Disease with GBA1 Mutation
 
Alpha-Synuclein aggregation and GCase deficiency are thought to act in a “vicious cycle.” GCase deficiency causes the accumulation of GluSph substrate, which has been reported to directly affect the accumulation and aggregation of a-Synuclein. In addition, increased a-Synuclein levels lead to less GCase activity, which in turn leads to more a-Synuclein accumulation. 
 The genetics of GBA1 mutations and the function of GCase are well-studied and characterized as a result of the study of Gaucher disease, a lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficient levels of active GCase enzyme due to mutations in both copies of the GBA1 gene.

Gaucher Disease 
 Gaucher disease is a heterogeneous lysosomal storage disorder characterized by multi-organ pathology. It impacts the liver, spleen, hematopoietic system, bones, lungs and CNS. Gaucher disease pathology in these organs is characterized by accumulation of lipid substrate and degenerative and inflammatory changes. Gaucher disease is among the most common lysosomal storage disorders, with an estimated global prevalence of one per 30,000 to one per 100,000, with a substantially higher incidence in certain populations, such as in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, who have a prevalence of 118 per 100,000. 
 Gaucher disease has three subtypes, which are distinguished by the presence or absence of neurological symptoms, severity of symptoms, age at onset and age at death. Type 1, or non-neuronopathic, Gaucher disease is the most common form of the disease. It can occur at any age and involves symptoms including enlarged liver, enlarged spleen, anemia, bone pathology and lung disease. Historically, Type 1 Gaucher disease was distinguished by the absence of neurological symptoms, although it is now recognized that these patients are at elevated risk of developing Parkinson’s disease. Type 2 Gaucher disease represents approximately 1% of Gaucher disease cases in the United States, presents in infancy, affects the CNS and involves rapidly progressing neurodegeneration leading to death in infancy or early childhood. Type 3 Gaucher represents approximately 5% of Gaucher disease cases in the United States, presents in childhood or adulthood, affects the CNS, and involves neurological symptoms such as gaze and motor abnormalities, ataxia, spasticity, myoclonus (involuntary muscle jerks) and seizures. Both Type 2 and Type 3 Gaucher disease, together referred to as nGD, also result in severe systemic manifestations of the type seen in Type 1 Gaucher disease patients. Although relatively rare in the United States, neuronopathic Gaucher makes up a higher percentage of Gaucher patients in certain non-Western countries, including Japan, Korea, Egypt, India and China. We estimate that there are at least 1,000 nGD patients across North America, Europe and Japan. 
 The relationship between Gaucher disease and PD-GBA has been established by both human genetic and clinical studies, supporting our strategy of developing PR001 for both indications. We believe Gaucher disease and PD-GBA represent a continuum of pathology with the same underlying genetic mechanism. The symptoms and severity of the CNS disease depend on the level of enzyme deficiency, which is driven by both the type and number of GBA1 mutations, as depicted in the figure below. 
 
Gaucher disease patients have mutations in both chromosomal copies of GBA1. Patients with the most severe GBA1 mutations, which cause severe enzyme deficiency, present with severe neuronopathic (Type 2) Gaucher disease. Patients with less severe mutations generally present with less severe neuronopathic (Type 3) Gaucher, although patients with more severe mutations can also present with Type 3 Gaucher disease. Patients with moderate GBA1 mutations present with Type 1 non-neuronopathic Gaucher disease, and are at elevated risk of developing Parkinson’s disease. Individuals with a mutation in a single chromosomal copy of GBA1 do not present with Gaucher disease, but have an elevated risk of developing Parkinson’s disease. In these PD-GBA patients, the 
 12
 
severity of the mutation correlates with the severity of the symptoms and the rate of progression of the disease. In addition, clinical studies of Parkinson’s disease patients who do not carry GBA1 or other known Parkinson’s disease mutations, referred to as “sporadic” Parkinson’s disease patients, also display reduced GCase activity. 
 Limitations of Current Therapies for Parkinson’s Disease and Gaucher Disease 
 Parkinson’s Disease 
 There are no treatments that modify the progressive underlying disease process of Parkinson’s disease. Current approved therapies for Parkinson’s disease are limited to symptomatic treatments and include levodopa, dopaminergic receptor agonists and inhibitors of enzymes related to dopamine metabolism such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors and catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitors. These therapies aim to improve overall dopaminergic function. Deep brain stimulation, a procedure in which electrodes are surgically placed in the basal ganglia, either in the subthalamic nucleus or internal globus pallidus, is another option for the treatment of advanced Parkinson’s disease. The benefits of each of these treatments diminishes over time as the disease progresses, and they do not impact the non-motor symptoms or the progression of the disease. As the disease progresses, the non-motor symptoms, such as dementia and cognitive impairment, can lead to severe morbidity and mortality. 
Gaucher Disease 
 There are no therapies approved by the FDA for the treatment of neuronopathic (Type 2 or Type 3) Gaucher disease. 
 In the United States, several ERTs that consist of recombinant GCase have been approved for the treatment of Type 1 Gaucher disease, including Cerezyme (marketed by Genzyme Corporation, a Sanofi company, or Sanofi Genzyme), Vpriv (marketed by Shire plc, an operating subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited) and Elelyso (marketed by Pfizer Inc.). ERTs are sometimes used off-label for the non-neurological manifestations of neuronopathic Gaucher patients; however, ERTs cannot cross the blood-brain barrier to treat the neurological manifestations. ERTs have further limitations, as some patients continue to experience bone pain, lung pathology, thrombocytopenia and enlargement of spleen following long-term ERT treatment. In addition, ERTs are dosed by intravenous infusion approximately once every two weeks, impacting patients’ and caregivers’ quality of life and productivity. 
 The FDA has approved several oral substrate reduction therapies, or SRTs, for the treatment of adults with Type 1 Gaucher disease, including Zavesca (marketed by Actelion) and Cerdelga (marketed by Sanofi Genzyme). These therapies are not approved for nGD. 
 As a result, we believe there is still significant unmet need among patients with Gaucher disease. 
 Our Solution 
 We are developing PR001 as a potentially disease-modifying, single-dose treatment for PD-GBA and nGD. PR001 is a gene therapy that utilizes an AAV9 viral vector to deliver codon-optimized DNA encoding wild-type GCase to a patient’s cells. Our understanding that the pathological process in Parkinson’s disease is brain-wide led us to select AAV9 for gene delivery because of its potential to broadly transduce the CNS. These properties are also important for nGD, which affects many regions of the CNS. Our intended route of administration for PR001 is via injection into the intra cisterna magna, or ICM, an intrathecal space above the spinal canal containing CSF. We believe that PR001, when administered via injection into the CSF, will broadly transduce the cells of a patient’s CNS and produce sufficient GCase to restore healthy lysosomal function and neuronal survival, thereby slowing the progression of disease. 
 PROPEL Trial: Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial for the Treatment of PD-GBA
 We have initiated dosing in the PROPEL trial, our randomized, double-blind, sham procedure-controlled, ascending dose Phase 1/2 clinical trial of PR001 in moderate-to-severe PD-GBA patients. This trial is enrolling up to 16 patients with at least one GBA1 mutation who are receiving a stable regimen of standard-of-care treatment. In each of the two escalating dose cohorts (1×1014 vg and 2×1014 vg of PR001), six patients will receive PR001 and two 
 13
 
patients will receive a sham procedure as control. We are investigating the effect of PR001 administered as a single injection into the ICM. 
 The primary outcomes of the trial include safety and tolerability. Secondary outcomes include biomarkers, including GCase, GluCer and GluSph in the blood and CSF. Exploratory outcomes include clinical efficacy endpoints used in Parkinson’s disease and additional biomarkers. Change from baseline in GluCer, GluSph, and GCase enzyme activity will be measured in CSF and blood at three and 12 months, and in blood at additional timepoints. An unblinded interim analysis will be performed once all patients in the first cohort complete 12 months of treatment, and a second unblinded interim analysis will be performed once all patients in the second cohort complete 12 months of treatment. Provided that the safety and tolerability profile of PR001 is acceptable at the time of each of these interim analyses, we will consider rolling over patients who received the sham procedure to a separate protocol under which they would be administered PR001. Additional interim analyses may be performed. All patients will be followed for a total of five years to monitor safety and selected biomarker and efficacy measures. 
 In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, patient screening and enrollment at currently active trial sites for the PROPEL trial has been temporarily suspended. We still intend to report interim data on a subset of patients from the PROPEL trial in the second half of 2020, however, this may be impacted if there is a prolonged suspension of enrollment. Based on the results from this initial trial, we plan to obtain input from regulatory agencies and plan additional trials to obtain regulatory approvals for commercialization in geographies worldwide. 
 PROVIDE and PROGRESS Trials: Planned Phase 1/2 Clinical Trials of PR001 for the Treatment of nGD
 We currently intend to initiate two Phase 1/2 clinical trials of PR001 for the treatment of nGD patients in 2020, the first for patients with Type 2 Gaucher disease and the second for patients with Type 3 Gaucher disease. 
 Study startup activities are ongoing for the PROVIDE trial, an open-label Phase 1/2 clinical trial of PR001 for patients with Type 2 Gaucher disease. We anticipate that this trial will initiate in mid-2020, subject to any delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This trial will include up to 15 infants with two GBA1 mutations and a diagnosis of Type 2 Gaucher disease. We plan to investigate the effect of PR001 administered as a single injection into the ICM at a dose of 1.3×1011 vg per gram brain mass, or up to 1.7×1014 vg in total. The primary outcomes of the trial will include safety and tolerability. Secondary and exploratory outcomes will include biomarkers, including GCase, GluCer and GluSph in the blood and CSF, as well as clinical efficacy endpoints appropriate for nGD. Change from baseline in GluCer, GluSph, and GCase enzyme activity will be measured in CSF at six (initial interim analysis) and 12 months, and in blood at additional timepoints. An additional interim analysis including clinical endpoints will be performed at 12 months. All patients will be followed for a total of five years to monitor safety and selected biomarker and efficacy measures. 
 We anticipate that the PROGRESS trial, a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of PR001 for patients with Type 3 Gaucher disease, will initiate in the second half of 2020, subject to any delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This trial will include up to 21 patients with two GBA1 mutations and a diagnosis of Type 3 Gaucher disease. We plan to investigate the effect of PR001 administered as a single injection into the ICM. The primary outcomes of the trial will include safety and tolerability. Secondary and exploratory outcomes will include biomarkers, including GCase, GluCer and GluSph in the blood and CSF, as well as clinical efficacy endpoints appropriate for nGD. Change from baseline in GluCer, GluSph, and GCase enzyme activity will be measured in CSF at three and 12 months, and in blood at additional timepoints. An analysis of clinical endpoints will be performed at 12 months. All patients will be followed for a total of five years to monitor safety and selected biomarker and efficacy measures. 
 Based on the results from these initial trials, we plan to obtain input from regulatory agencies on the requirements to file for regulatory approval for commercialization in geographies worldwide. 
 Compassionate Use
 In January 2020, we announced that we granted a compassionate use request for the administration of PR001 to a single patient with Type 2 Gaucher disease via a compassionate use pathway, following approval by an international regulatory authority, and that the patient had been dosed. This patient was treated at Sheba Medical Center in Israel.

PR001 Life Cycle Planning
 We are continuing to evaluate the opportunity to further develop PR001 in other diseases caused by a deficiency in GCase activity, such as sporadic Parkinson’s disease and Type 1 Gaucher disease.Preclinical Studies 
of PR001 
 Our comprehensive preclinical program for PR001 was designed to inform efficacy, biodistribution, dosing and safety. 
 Mouse Models of PD-GBA and nGD 
 GBA1 mutations are associated with a spectrum of disorders that include PD-GBA and Gaucher disease. Because PD-GBA and Gaucher disease result from the same core biochemical mechanism, many preclinical models are relevant for both diseases. We utilized three mouse models to study the amelioration of GCase deficiency and the associated phenotypes with PR001: 

• | Pharmacological model: Conduritol-ß-epoxide, or CBE, is a pharmacological inhibitor of GCase, and mice treated with CBE display phenotypes consistent with GCase loss-of-function, including lipid accumulation, motor behavior abnormalities and widespread neuropathology, which is a signal of CNS injury. By varying CBE dosage and thus the degree of GCase inhibition in vivo, it is possible to recapitulate the degrees of enzyme deficiency seen in PD-GBA and different Gaucher disease types. In our experiments using this model, mice were dosed daily with CBE treatment to create and maintain GCase deficiency and associated phenotypes.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Genetic model: The 4L/PS-NA model of PD-GBA and Gaucher disease combines Gba1 mutations with mutations in the gene encoding saposin C, an essential activator of GCase. This combination is designed to lead to a more severe reduction in GCase enzyme activity and phenotypes relevant to both PD-GBA and Gaucher disease, including motor behavior abnormalities, α-Synuclein accumulation, neuropathology and visceral involvement.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | α-Synuclein model: A53T-SNCA mice, or A53T mice, express a human α-Synuclein A53T mutant transgene and are deficient in murine α-Synuclein. The A53T mutation is associated with familial PD in humans. However, A53T mice display relatively subtle phenotypes, including reduced gastrointestinal motility and variable motor abnormalities between six and 12 months of age. This mouse model does not exhibit widespread α-Synuclein pathology in the brain. Reduction of GCase activity by CBE can lead to changes in the levels of aggregated and toxic forms of α-Synuclein.

 Review of Preclinical Data in CBE-Treated Mice 
 In a dose-finding study, three separate doses of PR001 were administered to CBE mice by intracerebroventricular, or ICV, injection, as ICM injection is not possible in mice. Viral vector doses are denoted by the number of vector genomes, or vg, delivered. For example, our low dose in this study was 2,000,000,000 vector genomes, or 2.0 x 109 vg; our medium dose in this study was 6,200,000,000 vector genomes, or 6.2 x 109 vg; and our high dose in this study was 20,000,000,000 vector genomes, or 2.0 x 1010 vg. Virus titer values have been updated to reflect results from a new qPCR analytical method that is transgene specific and has improved precision and accuracy. 
 At all three doses, vector genomes were detected in the brain and spinal cord five weeks after administration. GCase activity was reduced in CBE-treated mice and was increased by the highest dose of PR001 in the brain and spinal cord at five weeks. CBE-treated mice also exhibited accumulation of the toxic glycolipids, GluCer and GluSph, in the brain, which was reduced by PR001 administration in a dose-dependent manner.

P-value is a conventional statistical method for measuring the statistical significance of results. A p-value of 0.05 or less represents statistical significance, meaning there is a less than 1-in-20 likelihood that the observed results occurred by chance.
 In this study, PR001 demonstrated impact on behavior. CBE-treated mice exhibited reduced performance on tests of motor function (rotarod and tapered beam). The highest dose of PR001 resulted in a statistically significant improvement in motor function.

Lysosomal dysfunction in PD-GBA is thought to lead to neuroinflammation, a process which includes an abnormal increase in astrocytes, or reactive astrogliosis, and microglia, or microgliosis. In CBE-treated mice, CBE induced reactive astrogliosis (evidenced by glial scarring) and microgliosis (evidenced by Iba1 immunoreactivity). In this study, PR001 was observed to reduce reactive astrogliosis and microgliosis in a dose-dependent manner, as shown in the graphs below.

In a second, longer-term study of PR001 in CBE-treated mice, we observed persistent and durable effects. Six months following ICV administration of a single PR001 dose, GCase activity levels remained significantly increased in the cerebral cortex and a corresponding reduction of lipid accumulation was observed, as shown in the graphs below.

In this study, administration of PR001 resulted in statistically significant improvement in performance on a beam walk test, a test of motor function, at all doses tested except the second lowest, as shown in the graph below. 
 PR001 Observed to Improve Motor Function in Genetic Mouse Model

 Each bar represents the mean ± SEM. 
 P-value: *p<0.05; ***p<0.001 by ANOVA followed by Tukey HSD. 
 These models display phenotypes representative of PD-GBA and nGD. Because of known limitations of these preclinical mouse models, we believe that data from both mouse models may not fully reflect the potential efficacy of PR001. In the pharmacological model, CBE administered to mice is known to inhibit both endogenous GCase and GCase expressed by PR001. In the genetic model, mutations in an activator of GCase, saposin C, reduce both the activity of both endogenous GCase and GCase expressed by PR001. Despite the limitations of these animal models, we observed strong evidence of increased GCase activity, reduced glycolipid accumulation and attenuation of behavioral phenotypes, which support our ongoing development of PR001. 
 There were no negative histopathologic findings and no evidence of toxicity in either mouse model due to treatment with PR001. 
 Preclinical a-Synuclein Data 
 Defects in lysosomal recycling resulting from GCase deficiency are known to result in the accumulation of a-Synuclein protein, a hallmark of Parkinson’s disease. It has been reported that the glycolipid substrates that accumulate in the context of GCase insufficiency may interact directly with a-Synuclein, leading to increased aggregation and toxicity. 
 
Published third-party studies using the 4L/PS-NA genetic mouse model have described the accumulation of insoluble, high molecular weight, or HMW, aggregates of a-Synuclein protein in brain samples. In a study we conducted, we observed a trend toward increased levels of insoluble a-Synuclein protein in the cerebral cortex of 4L/PS-NA mice. In this study, PR001 administration via ICV injection was observed to suppress the accumulation of insoluble a-Synuclein at 14 weeks after PR001 administration, as depicted in the graph below.

 Each bar represents the mean ± SEM. 
 Levels of insoluble α-Synuclein in the 4L/PS-NA genetic mouse model were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, or ELISAs, an analytical biochemistry assay. 
 We also studied the levels of HMW a-Synuclein in another mouse model, A53T mice treated with CBE. We observed a reduction in HMW a-Synuclein aggregates with PR001 treatment of CBE-dosed A53T mice, as depicted in the graph below.

 Each bar represents the mean ± SEM. 
 P value: *p<0.05 by ANOVA followed by Tukey’s HSD multiple tests correction. 
 Published third-party studies have reported that, in cell lines, increased levels of GCase activity lead to a reduction in the accumulation of a-Synuclein protein. We conducted in vitro studies of PR001 in HeLa cells, a widely studied human cell line, and in mouse hippocampal neuron cultures. In these studies, we observed that administration of PR001 in vitro resulted in increased GCase activity and reduced a-Synuclein accumulation, as depicted in the graphs below.

 Safety and Biodistribution in Non-Human Primates 
 We conducted PR001 safety and biodistribution testing in healthy non-human primates, or NHPs. NHPs were selected for these studies because of their similarity to humans and because it is possible to deliver PR001 via ICM injection, which is the intended route of administration for our ongoing and planned clinical trials. There are no NHP models for either PD-GBA or Gaucher disease that are suitable for efficacy measurements. 
 Review of GLP Toxicology Study in NHPs
 Our Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, toxicology study included a total of 19 NHPs receiving one of three treatments: vehicle only, PR001 low dose (6.2 x 1010 vg/g brain, or vector genomes per gram of brain mass), or PR001 high dose (2.3 x 1011 vg/g brain). Pursuant to our pre-determined study design, the NHPs were sacrificed at three timepoints as follows: one NHP receiving PR001 high dose was sacrificed at Day 7 and nine NHPs, three receiving vehicle only, three receiving PR001 low dose and three receiving PR001 high dose, were sacrificed at each of Day 30 and Day 183. To characterize the biodistribution of PR001, we measured the levels of PR001 vector genome copies present in different NHP brain regions at 30 days and six months after ICM injection of vehicle only, the low dose of PR001 or the high dose of PR001. In the NHPs that received PR001, we observed robust and widespread levels of PR001 vector genome copies throughout the CNS as well as peripheral organs at both time points measured, consistent with published studies of the biodistribution of other AAV9-based gene therapy programs with similar routes of administration. 
 23
 
Consistent with widespread vector genome copy distribution, we observed widespread expression of the GCase enzyme encoded by PR001. GCase levels were quantified using an antibody-based automated assay, SimpleWestern. Results from cortex, hippocampus and midbrain samples were obtained from NHPs dosed with ICM injection of vehicle only, a low dose of PR001 or a high dose of PR001. NHPs that received either the low dose or high dose of PR001 exhibited consistently elevated levels of GCase six months after ICM injection, compared to samples from NHPs that received vehicle only. The graph below depicts the data across the cortex, hippocampus and midbrain regions, analyzed in aggregate. 
 PR001 GCase Expression Observed at Six Months After Dosing
 
 Excipient Dose = 0 vg/g brain weight; Low Dose = 6.2 x 1010 vg/g brain weight PR001; High Dose = 2.3 x 1011 vg/g brain weight PR001; N=3 per group; Dose dependent trend analysis using Williams’ Trend test across all brain regions and dose groups: p<0.05
 We also observed the presence of anti-human GCase antibodies in the NHPs following PR001 administration, consistent with previous third-party studies that evaluated human proteins in NHPs. The presence of these antibodies provided further evidence of the expression of human GCase protein in PR001-treated NHPs. 
 Overall, this study demonstrated enduring and broad GCase protein expression in NHPs treated with PR001 via ICM injection. In this GLP toxicology study, PR001 administered via ICM injection was well tolerated, and no toxicity was observed up to six months post-injection at any of the PR001 doses tested.
 Review of Higher-Dose Toxicology Study in NHPs
 We also conducted an additional non-GLP study of NHPs to evaluate the safety of PR001 administered at a higher dose than in the GLP toxicology study described above. This study included a total of 12 NHPs receiving one of two treatments: vehicle only or PR001 (7.0 x 1011 vg/g brain). Pursuant to our pre-determined study design, the NHPs were sacrificed at two timepoints as follows: six NHPs, three receiving vehicle only and three receiving PR001, were sacrificed at each of Day 30 and Day 90. 
 In the NHPs that received PR001, we observed robust and widespread levels of PR001 vector genome copies throughout the CNS as well as peripheral organs at both time points measured.
 PR001 administered via ICM injection was well tolerated, and no toxicity was observed up at either time point at the PR001 doses tested.
 Summary of PR001 Preclinical Study Findings
 In our comprehensive preclinical program in both mouse models and non-human primates, PR001 was observed to be well tolerated and demonstrated robust and widespread biodistribution. Based on the biodistribution and efficacy data observed in our NHP and mouse studies, we believe that PR001 administered via ICM injection has the 
 24
 
potential to increase GCase to non-pathological levels in the CNS of our target patient populations. Additionally, in mouse models, we observed significant increases in enzyme activity, reductions in lipid accumulation and improvements in motor function. 
 To characterize the safety profile of PR001, we analyzed multiple time points from the mouse efficacy studies and the NHP studies described above. We did not observe any adverse histopathology or evidence of toxicity attributable to PR001 treatment in any of these studies.
 PR006, Our Gene Therapy Product Candidate for the Treatment of FTD-GRN 
 We are developing PR006, our gene therapy candidate which utilizes an AAV9 vector to deliver codon-optimized DNA encoding wild-type progranulin for patients with FTD-GRN. In March 2020, we announced that our IND for PR006 for the treatment of FTD-GRN is now active. Study startup activities are ongoing for the PROCLAIM trial, our Phase 1/2 clinical trial of PR006 for the treatment of FTD-GRN patients, and we anticipate that this trial will initiate in mid-2020. The FDA has granted Fast Track designation for PR006 for the treatment of FTD-GRN and Orphan Drug designation for PR006 for the treatment of FTD. 
 Overview of FTD and FTD-GRN 
 FTD is the most common cause of dementia in people under age 60 and results from the progressive degeneration of the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. These areas of the brain control decision-making, behavior, emotion and language. FTD patients present with a spectrum of symptoms, which have been broadly subdivided into behavioral, language and motor manifestations. Patients can experience personality changes, disinhibition, apathy, slow speech production, misuse of grammar, impaired word comprehension, memory loss and, in some cases, motor alterations. Although the clinical presentation of FTD is heterogeneous, FTD is rapidly progressive and invariably devastating. There are currently no approved therapies for FTD.
 The age of onset of FTD is typically between 45 and 64 years and death typically occurs three to 10 years after symptom onset. Prevalence of FTD is estimated to be 50,000 to 60,000 individuals in the United States and 80,000 to 110,000 individuals in the European Union. 
 There are multiple forms of FTD that are caused by genetic mutations, including FTD-GRN. FTD-GRN represents 5% to 10% of all patients with FTD, and approximately 22% of heritable FTD cases. Healthy individuals carry two normal copies of the GRN gene that function together to produce sufficient levels of progranulin protein throughout the body. Loss-of-function mutations in a single copy of GRN lead to a 50% or greater decrease in the level of progranulin and a greater than 90% probability of developing FTD-GRN. Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, a very rare and severe lysosomal storage disorder, results from mutations in both copies of GRN and is characterized by childhood dementia, vision loss and epilepsy.

Progranulin is a glycoprotein encoded in humans by the GRN gene. Progranulin is found both extracellularly and in lysosomes. It is highly expressed by astroglia and microglia, which are immune cells that reside in the brain. Healthy levels of progranulin are necessary for cellular processes such as lysosomal function, neuronal survival and normal microglial activities. In FTD-GRN patients, reduced levels of progranulin lead to lysosomal dysfunction and ineffective protein degradation and recycling. Consistent with this, FTD-GRN pathology is characterized by aggregates of ubiquitin and TDP-43 proteins, which are believed to be toxic and inflammatory. 
 Role of Progranulin in FTD-GRN
 

Our Solution 
 We believe PR006 has the potential to be a first-in-class, disease-modifying treatment for patients with FTD-GRN. PR006 is a gene therapy that utilizes an AAV9 viral vector to deliver codon-optimized DNA encoding wild-type progranulin to a patient’s cells. We believe that PR006, when administered via injection into the CSF, will broadly transduce the cells of a patient’s CNS. Our goal is to produce sufficient progranulin to restore healthy lysosomal function and neuronal survival, thereby slowing or stopping the progression of disease. 
 PROCLAIM Trial: Planned Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial of PR006 for the Treatment of FTD-GRN
 Study startup activities are ongoing for our PROCLAIM Phase 1/2 clinical trial of PR006 for the treatment of FTD-GRN patients. We anticipate that this trial will initiate in mid-2020, subject to any delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This trial will include frontotemporal dementia patients who are GRN mutation carriers. We plan to investigate the effect of PR006 administered as a single injection into the ICM. The primary outcomes of the trial will include safety and tolerability as well as progranulin levels. Secondary and exploratory outcomes will include biomarkers of neurodegeneration as well as clinical efficacy endpoints appropriate for FTD-GRN. Change from baseline in key biomarkers will be measured in CSF at three and 12 months, and in blood at additional timepoints. An analysis of clinical endpoints will be performed at 12 months. All patients will be followed for a total of five years to monitor safety and selected biomarker and efficacy measures. 
 26
 
Based on the results from this initial trial, we plan to obtain input from regulatory agencies on the requirements to file for regulatory approval for commercialization in geographies worldwide. 
 Preclinical Studies of PR006
 Our comprehensive preclinical program for PR006 was designed to inform efficacy, biodistribution, dosing and safety. Our program includes several studies conducted in induced pluripotent stem cells, or iPSCs, derived from FTD-GRN mutation carriers, a mouse model of disease, and healthy NHPs. 
 Review of Preclinical Data in Neurons from FTD-GRN Mutation Carriers 
 To examine the activity of PR006 in a human model of FTD-GRN, iPSCs from two heterozygous GRN mutation carriers, FTD-GRN #1 and FTD-GRN #2, and a wild-type age-matched Control were differentiated into neuronal stem cells. Neuronal stem cells with heterozygous GRN mutations were observed to have ~25-50% lower intracellular and secreted progranulin levels compared to Control neuronal stem cells, as shown in the graphs below. This suggests that this FTD-GRN cell model recapitulates the clinical progranulin deficiency observed in FTD-GRN patients, who express one third to one half of normal progranulin levels in plasma. 
 FTD-GRN iPSC-derived Neuronal Stem Cells Observed to have Reduced Progranulin Expression and Secretion than Neuronal Stem Cells from Controls
 
 Progranulin expression was measured in cell lysates (intracellular progranulin) and cell media (secreted progranulin). Progranulin expression was normalized to total protein concentration to account for differences in cell number.

 P-value: ***p < 0.001 by a paired t-test, a statistical test comparing two population means.

After establishing that the iPSC-derived neuronal stem cells exhibit reduced progranulin expression, the cell lines were differentiated into neurons to generate a clinically representative cell type for nonclinical efficacy studies of PR006. We utilized these FTD-GRN iPSC-derived neuronal cultures to evaluate the efficacy of PR006 in vitro. FTD-GRN neurons were treated with excipient or PR006 at a multiplicity of infection, or MOI, of 5.3 x 105 vg/cell. PR006 transduction resulted in robust, dose-dependent expression of secreted progranulin, as measured by ELISA, in FTD-GRN neurons, as shown in the graph below.

 Progranulin has been reported to regulate the lysosomal protease Cathepsin D, or CTSD. Loss of CTSD function has been implicated in lysosomal storage disorders and neurodegeneration. CTSD is expressed as an inactive full-length protein, or proCTSD, that is processed into an enzymatically active mature protease, or matCTSD. Progranulin has been reported to act as a molecular chaperone that binds to proCTSD to enhance its maturation into the matCTSD protease, and absence of progranulin has been reported to decrease CTSD activity by reducing proCTSD processing. 
 To assess the impact of PR006 on promoting maturation of CTSD, we analyzed the maturation of CTSD in FTD-GRN neurons treated with PR006 versus controls. FTD-GRN neurons displayed reduced maturation of CTSD quantified as the ratio of matCTSD to proCTSD, compared to controls. We observed a significant increase in this ratio in FTD-GRN neurons after transduction with PR006, indicating a potential role for PR006 in promoting lysosomal function in FTD-GRN neurons, as shown in the graphs below.

 TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is an RNA-binding protein that normally localizes to the nucleus. In post-mortem brains of FTD-GRN patients, aggregation of TDP-43 in the cytoplasm of neurons is observed, and nuclear accumulation of TDP-43 is reduced. Decreased accumulation of TDP-43 in the nucleus, and increased accumulation of insoluble TDP-43, have been reported in iPSC-derived neurons from FTD-GRN mutation carriers, relative to control neurons that do not carry a GRN mutation. In this study, PR006 transduction of neuronal cultures from both FTD-GRN mutation carrier lines was observed to reverse TDP-43 abnormalities, resulting in decreased insoluble TDP-43 and increased nuclear localization of TDP-43, as shown in the graphs below.

Review of Preclinical Data in Aged Grn Knockout Mice 
 Grn homozygous knockout, or Grn-/-, mice, which completely lack progranulin, are used to study progranulin function. Grn-/- mice develop age-dependent pathologies that overlap with FTD-GRN and are consistent with loss of progranulin function, including lysosomal alterations, microgliosis and neuroinflammation. However, these mice do not fully recapitulate FTD-GRN as they do not exhibit FTD-GRN-like neurodegeneration, TDP-43 pathology or cortical atrophy. We used these mice to study the ability of PR006 to restore progranulin function. In contrast to Grn-/- mice, FTD-GRN patients have mutations in only one of the two chromosomal copies of GRN, but mice with mutations in only one copy of Grn do not display robust phenotypes that resemble FTD-GRN and thus are not useful as disease models. 
 In a study using 16-month old Grn-/- mice, we observed a statistically significant increase in levels of human progranulin in the CNS (brain, spinal cord) two months following ICV administration of 9.7 x 1010 vg (2.4 x 1011 vg/g brain) PR006. Human progranulin was also detected in the CSF of PR006-treated mice, but because of the small sample volume and the technical limitations of obtaining sufficient volume of CSF in mice, the measurements of CSF progranulin level were below the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of the assay, as shown in the graphs below.

 Accumulation of neuronal lipofuscin, an electron-dense, auto-fluorescent material that accumulates progressively over time in lysosomes of postmitotic cells and is an indicator of lysosomal dysfunction, is a hallmark age-dependent phenotype of Grn-/- mice. Grn-/- mice exhibited substantial lipofuscinosis throughout the brain, and we observed significant reductions in lipofuscin score severity and accumulation in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus two months following ICV administration of PR006. 
 In addition, ubiquitin-positive inclusions are a defining pathological feature of FTD-GRN patients that also accumulate in the Grn-/- mouse model in an age-dependent manner. We observed significantly reduced ubiquitin accumulation in Grn-/- mice two months following ICV administration of PR006, as shown in the graphs below.

Review of Preclinical Data in Adult Grn Knockout Mice 
 To further assess efficacious doses of PR006, a larger, dose-ranging study in adult Grn-/- mice was performed delivering PR006 via ICV to 4-month-old animals. PR006 was administered at three escalating doses: low dose = 1.1 x 109 vg (2.7 x 109 vg/g brain); middle dose = 1.1 x 1010 vg (2.7 x 1010 vg/g brain); high dose = 1.1 x 1011 vg (2.7 x 1011 vg/g brain). We observed increasing vector genomes in the cerebral cortex in a dose-dependent manner three months following ICV administration of PR006. We also observed increased levels of human progranulin in the brain and detected and quantified human progranulin levels in brain tissue at the highest PR006 dose, as shown in the graphs below. 
 PR006 Observed to Result in Dose-Dependent Biodistribution and Progranulin Expression in the CNS in Adult Dose-Ranging FTD-GRN Mouse Model
 
 PR006 dose: Low Dose = 2.7 x 109 vg/g brain; Mid Dose = 2.7 x 1010 vg/g brain; High Dose = 2.7 x 1011 vg/g brain. N = 8-10 per group
Each bar represents the mean ± SEM.

 33
 
Similar to the study in aged mice, adult Grn-/- mice exhibited lipofuscinosis throughout the brain whereas wild type mice did not have detectable lipofuscin the brain. We observed a dose-dependent reduction in the severity scores of intracellular lipofuscin accumulation in the brains of Grn-/- mice three months following ICV administration of PR006. We also observed reduced ubiquitin accumulation three months following ICV administration of PR006 to near wildtype levels at all three doses, as shown in the figure below:

 PR006 dose: Low Dose = 2.7 x 109 vg/g brain; Mid Dose = 2.7 x 1010 vg/g brain; High Dose = 2.7 x 1011 vg/g brain. N = 8-10 per group
Each bar represents the mean ± SEM. 
 P-value: *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 by ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s test to compare to the excipient treated Grn-/- mouse group. vg = vector genomes; WT = wildtype
 34
 
Treatment with PR006 also suppressed inflammatory marker levels in the brain of adult Grn-/- mice. We observed decreased gene expression of the proinflammatory cytokine Tnf (TNFa) and Cd68 (CD68), a marker of microglia, in the cortex three months after ICV administration of PR006 at all dose levels. We also observed significant reduction in Iba1, a marker of microgliosis, three months after ICV administration of PR006 at all dose levels, as shown in the figure below:

 P-value: *p < 0.05, ***p < 0.001 by ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s test to compare to the excipient treated Grn-/- mouse group. vg = vector genomes; WT = wildtype
 Safety and Biodistribution in Non-Human Primates 
 We conducted PR006 safety and biodistribution testing in healthy non-human primates, or NHPs. NHPs were selected for this GLP toxicology study because of their similarity to humans and because it is possible to deliver PR006 via ICM injection, which is the intended route of administration for our planned clinical trials. There are no NHP models for FTD that are suitable for efficacy measurements. This study included a total of 19 NHPs receiving one of three treatments: vehicle only, PR006 low dose (6.5 x 109 vg/g brain), or PR006 high dose (6.5 x 1010 vg/g brain). The NHPs were sacrificed at three timepoints as follows: one NHP receiving PR006 high dose was sacrificed at Day 7 and nine NHPs, three receiving vehicle only, three receiving PR006 low dose and three receiving PR006 high dose, were sacrificed at Day 30 and Day 183. We used the safety and biodistribution results from this study to inform dose selection in our clinical trials. 
 Safety 
 To characterize the safety profile of PR006, we analyzed standard safety measures in the mouse efficacy studies and the GLP toxicology study in NHPs described above. We did not observe any adverse pathology or evidence of toxicity attributable to PR006 treatment in either the mouse or NHP studies.
 35
 
Given the literature regarding dorsal root ganglia (DRG) toxicity findings in NHPs resulting from administration of some third-parties’ AAV9-based gene therapies, we had two independent, board-certified pathologists review tissue sections from the PR006 GLP toxicology study in NHPs.  Both pathologists found no evidence of adverse changes in the DRGs or elsewhere in treated animals.  Specifically, findings seen in PR006-treated animals in the GLP study consisted of minimal, rare degenerative changes in axons and minimal increased glial cellularity in DRGs, but these findings were not considered adverse because of their limited nature.  In contrast, some third-party AAV vector test articles have been associated with specific adverse pathological changes in DRG, including mild to moderate neuronal loss and mononuclear cell infiltration or inflammation.  
 In summary, there have been no adverse safety findings or toxicity concerns in any of the nonclinical studies, including a GLP study in NHPs through Day 183, that would preclude the initiation of a clinical trial.
 Biodistribution
 To characterize the biodistribution of PR006, we measured the levels of PR006 vector genome copies present in different NHP brain regions at 30 days and 183 days after ICM injection of vehicle only, the low dose of PR006 or the high dose of PR006. In the NHPs that received PR006, we observed robust and widespread levels of PR006 vector genome copies throughout the CNS, consistent with published studies of the biodistribution of other AAV9-based gene therapy programs with similar routes of administration. The levels of PR006 vector genome copies present in NHPs observed 183 days after dosing are depicted in the graphs below. 
PR006 Biodistribution Observed at 183 Days After Dosing
 
 PR006 dose: Low Dose: 6.5 x 109 vg/g brain; High Dose: 6.5 x 1010 vg/g brain; N = 3 per group. 
 Each bar represents the average ± SEM. The yellow line indicates the lower limit of quantitation at 50 vg/μg DNA
 To confirm that human progranulin was produced in the treated NHPs, protein levels in CSF were measured 183 days following administration of PR006 using a Simple Western (Jess) analysis. We observed dose-dependent elevation of progranulin levels in the CSF in animals treated with both the low and high doses of PR006 as shown in the figure below:
 36
 
PR006 Observed to Increase Progranulin Levels in the CSF
 
 PR006 dose: Low Dose: 6.5 x 109 vg/g brain; High Dose: 6.5 x 1010 vg/g brain; N = 3 per group. 
 Each bar represents the mean ± SEM. the yellow line indicates the lower limit of quantitation at 50 vg/μg DNA
 
We also observed the presence of anti-human progranulin antibodies in the NHPs following PR006 administration, consistent with previous third-party studies that evaluated human proteins in NHPs. The presence of these antibodies provided further evidence of the expression of human progranulin protein in PR006-treated NHPs. 
 Overall, this study demonstrated enduring and broad progranulin protein expression in NHPs treated with PR006 via ICM injection.
 Based on the biodistribution and efficacy data observed in our NHP and mouse studies, we believe that PR006 administered via ICM injection has the potential to increase progranulin to non-pathological levels in the CNS of our target patient populations.
 PR004, Our Gene Therapy Product Candidate for the Treatment of Synucleinopathies 
 We are developing PR004 as a potentially disease-modifying, single-dose treatment for certain synucleinopathies. PR004 utilizes an AAV9 vector to deliver codon-optimized DNA encoding wild-type GCase and a molecule that suppresses expression of, or knocks down, a-Synuclein. Our goal is to create an effective therapeutic for patients with neurodegenerative diseases where disease is driven by both synucleinopathy and GCase deficiency. 
Overview of Synucleinopathies 
 Lewy bodies are the main component of brain pathology in synucleinopathies, including Parkinson’s disease and DLB. Genetic mutations in the a-Synuclein gene, including gene multiplications, cause rare familial types of synucleinopathy, demonstrating the relationship between the level of a-Synuclein and disease. The precise pathological form of a-Synuclein remains to be determined. Various presentations of a-Synuclein have been 
 37
 
implicated in disease pathology, including large insoluble neuronal aggregates, small soluble neuronal forms and extracellular forms. 
 Published third-party studies have highlighted the relationship between synucleinopathy pathology and GCase deficiency. GCase has been shown to directly suppress the accumulation of a-Synuclein and protect from synucleinopathy-related neuronal degeneration in animal models. Both a-Synuclein and GCase are directly implicated in lysosomal function, and abnormal levels of these proteins are thought to synergistically contribute to synucleinopathy pathology. 
 Our Solution 
 PR004 is designed to both reduce expression of a-Synuclein and increase expression of GCase. We believe that PR004 is distinct from other potential a-Synuclein-targeted therapies in that it is designed to reduce the expression of all pathological forms of a-Synuclein. In published third-party studies of mouse and cell models of synucleinopathy, it has been observed that higher than normal expression of GCase is protective against disease. We believe our dual-acting approach could have broad applicability across synucleinopathies. 
 Our preclinical program for PR004 is designed to inform efficacy, biodistribution, dosing and safety. Preclinical studies of PR004 in animal models are ongoing. 
 Additional Program Opportunities 
 We are focused on developing a broad pipeline of potentially disease-modifying AAV gene therapies for the treatment of a range of neurodegenerative diseases with high unmet medical need. Beyond PR001, PR006 and PR004, we are studying a number of additional targets. Each of our programs uses AAV vector technology to deliver nucleic acids designed to express and/or knock down one or more genes that have been identified as causal based on human genetic studies of neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s disease, FTD, Alzheimer’s disease, ALS, DLB and related lysosomal disorders. We believe we have established the capabilities to rapidly advance these programs towards clinical testing.

Under the REGENXBIO Option Genes License we granted a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty- free, transferable, sublicenseable, irrevocable, perpetual license back to REGENXBIO to (1) use any patentable modifications or improvements to the licensed technology that we or our 
 39
 
affiliates or sublicensees develop, or licensed back improvements, consummate in scope to REGENXBIO’s retained rights, and (2) to practice the licensed back improvements in connection with AAV9 outside of our field of use. 
 REGENXBIO and its upstream licensors,GSK and UPenn, retain the exclusive right over certain antibodies expressed by AAV9. GSK and UPenn retain a non-exclusive right over products that deliver RNA interference and antisense drugs using AAV9, and a non-exclusive right to use the licensed technology for non-commercial research purposes and discovery research efforts with non-profit organizations and collaborators. We do not expect the retention of these rights to affect our intellectual property rights licensed under the REGENXBIO Option Genes License or our ability to develop and commercialize any product candidate that we may choose to pursue, however, the license of these technologies by GSK and UPenn to others could potentially lead to increased competition. 
 Under the terms of the REGENXBIO Option Genes License, we paid REGENXBIO an initial fee of $0.6 million, and upon the exercise of the options, an additional up-front fee of $0.6 million per exercised option, or an aggregate of $1.8 million. In addition, with respect to each licensed Option Gene, we are required to pay REGENXBIO: (1) an annual maintenance fee; (2) mid- to high-single digit royalty percentages on net sales of the licensed product, subject to reduction in specified circumstances; and (3) mid-teen to low-twenties royalty percentages of any sublicense fees we receive from sublicensees for the licensed intellectual property rights. If a licensed product includes the GBA1 gene and otherwise would be subject to royalties under the REGENXBIO GBA1 License, then royalties for that licensed product will only be due under the REGENXBIO Option Genes License. 
 The REGENXBIO Option Genes License requires us to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, commercialize, market, promote and sell a licensed product for each licensed Option Gene in our field of use. We are also obligated to achieve a certain development milestone with respect to a licensed product for each licensed Option Gene in our field of use within a specified time period. We do not have the right to control prosecution or undertake prosecution of any infringement of the in- licensed patent applications. 
 The REGENXBIO Option Genes License will expire on a country-by-country, licensed product-by-licensed product basis upon the later of (1) the expiration, lapse, abandonment or invalidation of the last valid claim of the licensed intellectual property and (2) seven years from the first commercial sale of each licensed product. The licensed patents under the REGENXBIO Option Genes License have expiration dates ranging from 2024 to 2026 in the United States and in 2024 outside of the United States in the absence of regulatory extension. In addition, patents issuing in the future from any licensed patent applications are expected to have expiration dates in 2024 both inside and outside of the United States in the absence of regulatory extension. We have the right to terminate the REGENXBIO Option Genes License upon a specified period of prior written notice. REGENXBIO may terminate the REGENXBIO Option Genes License immediately if we become insolvent, if we are late by a specified number of days in paying money due under the REGENXBIO Option Genes License, or if we or our affiliates commence any action against REGENXBIO or its licensors to declare or render any claim of the licensed patent rights invalid or unenforceable. Either party may terminate the REGENXBIO Option Genes License for material breach if such breach is not cured within a specified number of days. 
 Manufacturing 
 The ability to consistently produce cGMP-quality AAV vectors at a sufficient scale is a critical success factor for a gene therapy company. We have established our own internal process development capabilities, and we are working with our experienced CDMOs to supply our clinical trials with drug product. We are supplying our first-in-human PR001 and PR006 clinical trials with drug product compliant with cGMPs, produced at one of our experienced CDMOs, using a robust, state-of-the-art process based on adherent HEK293 cells. Our team has developed the analytical testing methods needed to support consistency and strict standards of quality and potency. This approach was designed to increase our speed of development, ensure consistent quality and regulatory compliance, and ensure predictable production costs. With this CDMO, we have now completed GMP production of sufficient quantities of PR001 and PR006 to supply our planned Phase 1/2 clinical trials for PD-GBA, nGD and FTD-GRN. 
 In October 2019, we announced our strategic collaboration with Lonza, with whom we have been working since 2018, with an initial focus on process development and GMP, or good manufacturing practices, manufacturing of our two lead programs, PR001 and PR006. Under this collaboration, focused on the baculovirus/Sf9 production system for gene therapies, we and Lonza work together closely on process development and scaling up production 
 40
 
of PR001 and PR006, and Lonza will manufacture PR001 and PR006 for late-stage clinical and commercial supply at its gene therapy center of excellence in Houston, Texas. Our collaboration with Lonza also has the potential to extend to our future pipeline of AAV-based gene therapy programs. 
 In collaboration with Lonza, we have developed and scaled up a process that demonstrates promising yield and potency, and our GMP manufacturing preparations are underway. We have also initiated studies and assessments to evaluate comparability between the material produced in the baculovirus/Sf9 production system and the material produced in the HEK293 production system. 
 In the baculovirus/Sf9 production system, AAV vectors are produced by infection of insect cells with recombinant baculoviruses. This scalable suspension production system, using single-use bioreactors, is designed to produce higher yields of vectors more cost-effectively and efficiently than mammalian cell-based approaches. We anticipate that we will produce cGMP-compliant batches of PR001 and PR006 at Lonza in time to support our pivotal clinical trials for each of those programs. We believe the baculovirus/Sf9 production system maximizes our ability to ensure cost-efficient, safe and scalable supply at the higher quantities required for late-stage clinical development and commercialization. 
 At each stage, we continually work together with our CDMOs to improve our manufacturing processes and to optimize productivity, efficiency, yield, purity and scalability, and to meet the standards of global regulatory authorities. We own or license the intellectual property created by our process development activities and will maintain the ability to transfer the process to other third-party CDMOs and/or to our own potential facility to ensure ongoing redundancy and reliability.
 Competition 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly changing technologies, significant competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. This is also true for the development and commercialization of treatments for Parkinson’s disease and other neurodegenerative diseases, Gaucher disease, and broadly across gene therapies. While we believe that our focus, strength of team, expertise in gene therapy, scientific knowledge and intellectual property provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from several different sources, including large and small biopharmaceutical companies, academic research institutions, government agencies and public and private research institutions. Not only must we compete with other companies that are focused on gene transfer technology, but any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
 Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, clinical trials, regulatory approvals and product marketing than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. 
 We consider our most direct competitors with respect to PR001 to be companies developing GCase pathway-targeting therapies, including Sanofi Genzyme and Lysosomal Therapeutics, Inc. Sanofi Genzyme is developing SAR402671, a small molecule GluCer synthase inhibitor for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease with a GBA mutation and for the treatment of Type 3 Gaucher disease in adult patients. Lysosomal Therapeutics, Inc. is developing LTI-291, a small molecule activator of the GCase enzyme, for the treatment of Parkinson’s patients with a heterozygous mutation in the GBA gene. In addition to these investigational programs, there are several products targeting the GCase pathway that are approved or in development for Type 1 Gaucher disease, including approved ERTs and SRTs, but these ERTs and SRTs are not approved for nGD in the United States. There are other gene therapy companies that are attempting to use both AAV and lentiviral gene therapy approaches to treat Gaucher disease, but to our knowledge, none of those companies has noted plans to pursue PD-GBA. 
 41
 
We consider our most direct competitors with respect to PR006 to be companies developing GRN pathway-targeting therapies, the most advanced of which is Alector, Inc., which is conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial of immune-neurology treatment for FTD-GRN. Passage Bio, Inc. is conducting preclinical research using a gene therapy for the treatment of FTD-GRN. Alkermes plc and Arkuda Therapeutics, Inc. are conducting preclinical research using small molecule approaches to treat FTD-GRN patients. There are other therapeutic approaches in preclinical development that may target FTD-GRN patients.
 Several companies are also developing therapies designed to prevent the progression of Parkinson’s disease and FTD. Examples include therapies in development by AbbVie Inc., BlueRock Therapeutics, Biogen Inc., Denali Therapeutics Inc., Prothena Corporation plc, Roche Holding AG and Voyager Therapeutics, Inc. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Overview 
 We actively seek to protect our proprietary technology, inventions, and other intellectual property that is commercially important to the development of our business by a variety of means, for example seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also may rely on trade secrets and know-how relating to our proprietary technology platform, on continuing technological innovation and on in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain the strength of our position in the field of gene therapy that may be important for the development of our business. Additional regulatory protection may also be afforded through data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions where available. 
 We have fourteen patent applications pending in the United States and foreign jurisdictions, of which six are international patent applications and eight are United States provisional patent applications. Of these, three international patent applications and three United States provisional patent applications relate to PR001, PR006 and PR004, and three international patent applications and five United States provisional patent applications relate to other technologies, in each case as described in more detail below. Each of our pending international patent applications has been filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty and has not yet entered any national jurisdictions. Our policy is to file patent applications to protect technology, inventions and improvements to inventions that may be commercially important to the development of our business. 
 We seek United States and international patent protection for a variety of technologies, and own patent applications with claims directed to compositions of matter that relate to our gene therapy products, PR001, PR006 and PR004, and methods for treating diseases of interest using our gene therapy products. We also intend to seek patent protection or rely upon trade secret rights to protect other technologies that may be used to discover and validate targets, and that may be used to manufacture and develop novel gene therapy products. We are a party to license agreements that give us rights to use specific technologies in our gene therapy products and in manufacturing our products. 
 Patent applications directed to our most advanced programs are summarized below. 
 PR001 
 PR001 is an AAV-based gene product configured to express a codon-optimized, human beta-glucocerebrosidase (GBA1) gene, which encodes a wild-type GCase therapeutic protein. We own one pending international patent application and one pending United States provisional patent application that contain claims or supporting disclosure directed to the PR001 composition of matter and to methods of treating diseases of interest using PR001. Patents issuing from this application, if any, will have standard expiration dates in 2038.

 We own one pending United States provisional patent application that include claims directed to methods of delivering therapeutic molecules. Patents issuing from this application, if any, will have standard expiration dates in 2039. 
 Trade Secrets 
 We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and confidential information to develop and maintain our proprietary position and protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and others who may have access to proprietary information, under which they are bound to assign to us inventions made during the term of their employment or term of service. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.
Government Regulation 
 The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting of biologics such as those we are developing. 
 Biological products are subject to regulation under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates. 
 43
 
U.S. Biologics Regulation 
 The process required by the FDA before biologic product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
  
• | completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA’s GLP regulations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is commenced;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended purpose;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation of and submission to the FDA of a biologics license application, or BLA, after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with cGMPs, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s continued safety, purity and potency, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with the FDA’s good clinical practices, or GCPs; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval, or licensure, of a BLA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical and Clinical Development 
 Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol or protocols for preclinical studies and clinical trials. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product, chemistry, manufacturing and controls information, and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site, and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain 
 44
 
data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing preclinical studies and clinical trials and clinical study results to public registries. 
 For purposes of BLA approval of a product candidate, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
  
• | Phase 1. The investigational gene therapy product is initially introduced into patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 When these phases overlap or are combined, the trials may be referred to as Phase 1/2 or Phase 2/3. A Phase 1/2 clinical trial is a first-in-human trial that investigates both safety and preliminary efficacy of an investigational therapy. A Phase 2/3 clinical trial is a human trial that investigates both preliminary and confirmatory efficacy and safety to potentially support submission of a marketing application with the applicable regulatory authorities. 
 In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so-called Phase 4 studies may be made a condition to approval of the BLA. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate, and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product, or for biologics, the safety, purity and potency. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical study investigators. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research patients or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biological product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including biologics, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information, which is publicly available at www.clinicaltrials.gov. 
 BLA Submission and Review 
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to the FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies. The FDA has sixty days from the applicant’s submission 
 45
 
of a BLA to either issue a refusal to file letter or accept the BLA for filing, indicating that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. 
 Once a BLA has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. In both standard and priority reviews, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent for its intended use, and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure and preserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 
 After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be manufactured, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response letter will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the Complete Response letter without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the Complete Response letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification, which may include the potential requirement for additional clinical studies. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product. 
 If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a product and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. 
 In addition to the regulations discussed above, there are a number of additional standards that apply to gene therapy. FDA has issued various guidance documents regarding gene therapies, which outline additional factors that FDA will consider at each of the stages of development and relate to, among other things: the proper preclinical assessment of gene therapies; the CMC information that should be included in an IND application; the proper design of tests to measure product potency in support of an IND or BLA; and measures to observe delayed adverse effects in subjects who have been exposed to investigational gene therapies when the risk of such effects is high. For instance, FDA usually recommends that sponsors observe all surviving subjects who receive treatment using gene therapies that are based on adeno-associated virus vectors in clinical trials for potential gene therapy-related delayed 
 46
 
adverse events for a minimum 5-year period, followed by 10 years of annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire. FDA does not require the long-term tracking to be complete prior to its review of the BLA.
 In addition to FDA oversight and oversight by IRBs, gene therapy clinical trials are also subject to review and oversight by an institutional biosafety committee, or IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees research utilizing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment.
 Expedited Development and Review Programs 
 The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. The fast track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new products are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a fast track product has opportunities for frequent interactions with the review team during product development and, once a BLA is submitted, the product may be eligible for priority review. A fast track product may also be eligible for rolling review, where the FDA may consider for review sections of the BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA. 
 A product intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product can receive breakthrough therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the fast track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product, including involvement of senior managers. 
 Any marketing application for a biologic submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with a fast track designation and/or breakthrough therapy designation, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite the FDA review and approval process, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition. For original BLAs, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date. 
 Additionally, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will generally require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. 
 Fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation and priority review do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. 
 47
 
Orphan Drug Designation 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process. 
 If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusive approval (or exclusivity), which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application fee. 
 A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. 
 Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher Program
 In 2012, Congress authorized the FDA to award priority review vouchers to sponsors of certain rare pediatric disease product applications. This provision is designed to encourage development of new drug and biological products for prevention and treatment of certain rare pediatric diseases. Specifically, under this program, a sponsor who receives an approval for a drug or biologic for a “rare pediatric disease” may qualify for a voucher that can be redeemed to receive a priority review of a subsequent marketing application for a different product. The sponsor of a rare pediatric disease drug product receiving a priority review voucher may transfer (including by sale) the voucher to another sponsor. The voucher may be further transferred any number of times before the voucher is used, as long as the sponsor making the transfer has not yet submitted the application. The FDA may also revoke any priority review voucher if the rare pediatric disease drug for which the voucher was awarded is not marketed in the U.S. within one year following the date of approval.
 For the purposes of this program, a “rare pediatric disease” is a (a) serious or life-threatening disease in which the serious or life-threatening manifestations primarily affect individuals aged from birth to 18 years, including age groups often called neonates, infants, children, and adolescents; and (b) rare disease or conditions within the meaning of the Orphan Drug Act. A sponsor may choose to request Rare Pediatric Disease Designation, but the designation process is entirely voluntary; requesting designation is not a prerequisite to requesting or receiving a priority review voucher. In addition, sponsors who choose not to submit a Rare Pediatric Disease Designation request may nonetheless receive a priority review voucher if they request such a voucher in their original marketing application and meet all of the eligibility criteria. Congress has only authorized the Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher program until September 30, 2020. However, if a drug candidate receives Rare Pediatric Disease Designation before October 1, 2020, it is eligible to receive a voucher if it is approved before October 1, 2022.
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. 
 48
 
After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing user fee requirements, under which the FDA assesses an annual program fee for each product identified in an approved BLA. Biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMPs and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs and other aspects of regulatory compliance. 
 The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning or untitled letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of existing product approvals;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal of the FDA to permit the import or export of products;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. 
 Biosimilars and Reference Product Exclusivity 
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-approved reference biological product. To date, a number of biosimilars have been licensed under the BPCIA, and numerous biosimilars have been approved in Europe. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars. 
 49
 
Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA. 
 Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law. 
 The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation, and impact of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty. 
 Foreign Regulation 
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety, and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in foreign countries and jurisdictions. Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the United States apply similarly in the context of the European Union, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. 
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 
 Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Such laws include, without limitation: the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the civil False Claims Act, HIPAA and similar foreign, federal and state fraud and abuse, transparency and privacy laws. 
 The U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase or recommendation of an item or service for which payment may be made under any federal healthcare program. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value, including stock options. The U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and others on the other hand. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, but they are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration, such as consulting agreements, 
 50
 
that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act. 
 Civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, which can be enforced through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, and civil monetary penalty laws prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to the federal government, including federal healthcare programs, that are false or fraudulent. For example, the civil False Claims Act prohibits any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. 
 HIPAA created additional federal civil and criminal liability for, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, and making false statements relating to healthcare matters. In addition, HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and their implementing regulations, impose certain requirements on HIPAA covered entities, which include certain healthcare providers, healthcare clearing houses and health plans, and individuals and entities that provide services on their behalf that involve individually identifiable health information, known as business associates, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. 
 The U.S. federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to annually report to CMS information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (as defined by such law), teaching hospitals and, in 2021, certain other healthcare professionals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by such health care professionals and their immediate family members. 
 We are also subject to additional similar U.S. state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third party payors, including private insurers, or that apply regardless of payor, state laws which require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, state and local laws which require pharmaceutical companies to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, state laws which require the reporting of information related to drug pricing, state and local laws requiring the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives, and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information which, in some cases, differ from each other in significant ways, and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government-funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid or similar programs in other countries or jurisdictions, integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance, disgorgement, imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.

Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any pharmaceutical or biological product for which we obtain regulatory approval. Sales of any product, if approved, depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state, and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement, if any, for such product by third-party payors. Decisions regarding whether to cover any of our product candidates, if approved, the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. Further, no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement exists in the United States, and coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our product candidates to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. 
 For products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs. Additionally, separate reimbursement for the product itself or the treatment or procedure in which the product is used may not be available, which may impact physician utilization. In addition, companion diagnostic tests require coverage and reimbursement separate and apart from the coverage and reimbursement for their companion pharmaceutical or biological products. Similar challenges to obtaining coverage and reimbursement, applicable to pharmaceutical or biological products, will apply to companion diagnostics. 
 In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical or biological products, medical devices and medical services, in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product that receives approval. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product. No regulatory authority has granted approval for a personalized cancer immunotherapy based on a vaccine approach, and there is no model for reimbursement of this type of product. 
 Healthcare Reform 
 The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of reform proposals to change the healthcare system. There is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by federal and state legislative initiatives, including those designed to limit the pricing, coverage, and reimbursement of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, especially under government-funded healthcare programs, and increased governmental control of drug pricing. 
 The ACA, which was enacted in March 2010, substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States, and significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA contains a number of provisions of particular import to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including, but not limited to, those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal healthcare programs. Since its enactment, there have been judicial, Congressional and executive branch challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will continue to be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. For example, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, it has enacted laws that modify certain provisions of the ACA such as removing penalties, which started on January 1, 2019, for 
 52
 
not complying with ACA’s individual mandate to carry health insurance, eliminating the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, and increasing the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D. The 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminates, effective January 1, 2020, the ACA-mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminates the health insurer tax. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in Texas ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of legislation enacted in 2017, informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. I It is unclear how this decision, future decisions, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA. 
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year and reduced payments to several types of Medicare providers. These reductions went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2029 unless additional action is taken by Congress. 
 Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, the Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2020 contains further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. Further, the Trump administration released a “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. HHS has solicited feedback on certain of these measures and, additionally, has implemented others under its existing authority. For example, in May 2019, CMS issued a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option to use step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020. This final rule codified CMS’ policy change that was effective January 1, 2019. On January 31, 2019, the HHS Office of Inspector General proposed modifications to U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute safe harbors which, among other things, would have affected rebates paid by manufacturers to Medicare Part D plan sponsors, Medicaid managed care organizations and those entities’ pharmacy benefit managers, the purpose of which is to further reduce the cost of drug products to consumers. Although this proposed rule was withdrawn by the Trump administration, in July 2019 a similar provision was included in legislation currently being considered in the United States Senate. Although a number of these and other measures may require additional authorization to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Additionally, the Right to Try Act, which was enacted on May 30, 2018, provides a federal framework for certain patients with life-threatening diseases or conditions to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.
