Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company leveraging our ImmTOR™ immune tolerance platform with the goals of amplifying the efficacy of biologics, including enabling the re-dosing of life-saving gene therapies, and restoring self-tolerance in autoimmune diseases. Our ImmTOR platform encapsulates rapamycin, also known as sirolimus, an immunomodulator, in biodegradable nanoparticles and is designed to induce antigen-specific immune tolerance.
The ImmTOR platform has the potential to mitigate the formation of anti-drug antibodies, or ADAs, against biologic drugs and restore self-tolerance to auto-antigens in autoimmune diseases. ADAs can start developing in the body with the first dose of a biologic therapy and can render subsequent doses ineffective or unsafe, potentially depriving patients of life-saving therapeutic options and limiting the likelihood of success for many otherwise promising novel biologic drugs and technologies. Additionally, we believe, based on preclinical data, that ImmTOR combined with adeno-associated virus, or AAV, gene therapy has the potential to increase transgene expression and to prevent undesired immune responses to the AAV capsid and the transgene product that can occur with the first dose of gene therapy.
We believe ImmTOR has the potential to enhance the efficacy without compromising the safety of biologic therapies, improve product candidates under development, and enable novel therapeutic modalities. We have developed a portfolio of proprietary and collaboration-driven applications of ImmTOR, and we plan to continue to develop proprietary compounds and pursue collaboration-driven development in certain disease areas, which could include strategic collaborations, out-licensing, and in-licensing transactions.
Our ImmTOR Platform
ImmTOR consists of our biodegradable nanoparticles encapsulating the immunomodulator rapamycin. Rapamycin is the active ingredient of Rapamune, an immunosuppressant which has extensive prior use in humans and is currently FDA-approved as a prophylaxis of organ rejection in kidney transplant patients aged 13 or older. Poly(D,L-lactide), or PLA is part of the broader poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid), or PLGA, family of biodegradable polymers that have more than 30 years of commercial use and are formulation components in a number of approved products. Polyethylene glycol, or PEG, has been widely studied in clinical trials and is also a formulation component in many approved biologic products.
Our nanoparticles are designed to remain intact after injection into the body and accumulate predominantly in lymph nodes, the spleen, and the liver, where the immune response is coordinated. The nanoparticles are designed to be processed by specialized immune cells, such as dendritic cells and other antigen-presenting cells that initiate and regulate immune responses. ImmTOR is intended to induce a tolerogenic phenotype in these antigen-presenting cells, which then process and present co-administered antigen in a manner that results in the induction of antigen-specific regulatory T cells. To mitigate the formation of ADAs and induce immune tolerance in the body, we administer our ImmTOR with an antigen, such as a therapeutic enzyme, a viral vector in the case of our gene therapy program, or an auto-antigen, which is depicted in the figure below.
Co-administration of ImmTOR with an auto-antigen, viral vector, or therapeutic enzyme.
In the case of a biologic drug, ImmTOR is designed to be administered in conjunction with such biologic drug to mitigate the formation of ADAs without requiring the alteration of the drug or its dose regimen. As a result, we believe ImmTOR may provide us with significant opportunities in the areas of immune tolerance and ADA prevention because ImmTOR is designed 
so that it can be co-administered at the beginning of therapy with many different biologic drugs, including enzymes and viral vectors. Importantly, we believe each pairing of ImmTOR with a biologic drug also offers us the opportunity to pursue a distinct proprietary product candidate, which we believe has the potential to be separately patented, approved and marketed. ImmTOR is manufactured in facilities subject to current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements using well-defined commercial operations, which, we believe, further enhances the scalability of our tolerance programs.
During preclinical studies, we observed that delivering an antigen together with ImmTOR provided the appropriate signals in vivo to induce regulatory T cells, which, in turn, inhibited effector immune responses, such as the formation of ADAs. In our preclinical studies, we observed that ImmTOR labeled with a fluorescent dye selectively accumulated in lymphoid organs where it was processed by antigen-presenting cells. The figure below depicts a model of how ImmTOR would be taken up by a dendritic cell in the spleen. We believe that both the biologic drug and ImmTOR are taken up and processed by dendritic cells and other antigen presenting cells in a manner that may induce regulatory T cells, which can potentially block the activation of helper T cells, mitigating the formation of ADAs.
ImmTOR and Antigen/Biologic Drug Presentation and Related Immune Tolerance Induction
ImmTOR leverages nanoparticle technology to target rapamycin, an approved immunomodulatory drug, to antigen presenting cells to generate antigen-specific immune tolerance when combined with the antigen of interest. We believe our ImmTOR platform has a broad range of potential applications.
•Enzyme therapies. Enzyme therapies are a frequently used class of biologic drugs to treat rare diseases. Through our analysis of biologic drugs, including our preclinical studies, we have observed that enzymes are especially prone to undesired immune responses. Our product candidate, SEL-212, which is currently in Phase 3 clinical development includes pegadricase, a pegylated uricase enzyme, which is an example of a highly immunogenic enzyme for which we are applying ImmTOR with the intention of improving the enzyme’s efficacy and safety. We are also combining ImmTOR with an IgA protease for the treatment of IgA nephropathy. We intend to seek, if appropriate, licenses to other enzymes that we would evaluate in combination with ImmTOR.
•Gene therapies. We believe gene therapies have the potential to address key unmet medical needs for many rare genetic diseases, but undesired immune responses to the viral vectors used for gene replacement, augmentation and editing may be restricting their broader use. Through our analysis of genetic diseases, we have identified applications and patient segments that we believe would benefit from our ImmTOR platform. We intend to develop ImmTOR-enabled non-immunogenic gene therapy candidates which are designed to be utilized with AAV, vectors (e.g., AAV8, AAV5). We believe our product candidates have the potential to increase transgene expression and to prevent undesired immune responses to the vector and transgene product that can occur with the first dose of gene therapy by 
using our ImmTOR platform. Our initial area of focus is on genetic metabolic diseases but may also include lysosomal storage diseases and genetic muscular diseases. We believe we are the first company to systematically pursue the development of AAV gene therapy product candidates with the goal of enabling repeat administration. We have engaged third parties with experience in gene therapy and rare diseases to support the development of our proprietary products. We also have licensed our ImmTOR platform to Asklepios BioPharmaceutical, Inc., or AskBio, Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc., or Sarepta, and Spark Therapeutics, Inc., or Spark, for certain pre-specified targets.
•Restoring self-tolerance to auto-antigens: We believe that ImmTOR has the potential to restore self-tolerance to autoimmune diseases. Our first program in autoimmune diseases is in primary biliary cholangitis, or PBC. PBC has a significant unmet medical need and a well-defined target antigen, known as PDC-E2.
•Other products and product candidates affected by undesired immune responses. We have generated preclinical data which we believe suggests a broad potential benefit of ImmTOR for immune tolerance. For many biologic drugs, undesired immune responses limit efficacy and cause safety concerns. We intend to strategically out-license ImmTOR for use with other products that are outside our focus to larger biopharmaceutical companies. We believe our ImmTOR platform may also be of interest to biopharmaceutical companies with novel biologic development concepts or product candidates in clinical development that have demonstrated initial efficacy but are experiencing issues with safety or sustained efficacy due to inhibitory ADAs.

Amplifying the Efficacy of Biologics: Enzyme Therapy – Chronic Refractory Gout
SEL-212 is designed to be a monthly treatment for chronic refractory gout, a debilitating rare disease with an unmet medical need. SEL-212 consists of a combination of our ImmTOR platform co-administered with pegadricase. Pegadricase is an investigational recombinant pegylated uricase (urate oxidase), an enzyme not naturally found in humans, and is therefore highly immunogenic. This enzyme is designed to treat patients with symptomatic gout, refractory to standard uric acid lowering treatment, by breaking down the excess uric acid to the more soluble allantoin. In preclinical studies, we observed that ImmTOR, when co-administered with pegadricase, induced antigen-specific immune tolerance to pegadricase and substantially reduced the formation of associated ADAs. Based on our clinical data, we believe that SEL-212 has the potential to control serum uric acid, or SUA levels and mitigate the formation of ADAs in response to the therapeutic enzyme. Additionally, we believe that SEL-212 serves as proof of concept for the ImmTOR platform in ameliorating the unwanted immune response to an immunogenic biologic. SEL-212 is in two pivotal Phase 3 studies versus placebo, which we refer to as DISSOLVE I and DISSOLVE II, and with topline data expected in the second half of 2022. SEL-212 has been licensed (except as to Greater China) to Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB, or Sobi, pursuant to our license and development agreement dated June 11, 2020 with Sobi, or the Sobi License.
The market for gout therapy
Gout, a painful and potentially disabling form of arthritis resulting from excess accumulation of uric acid and deposition of uric acid crystals in joints and soft tissues, including those of the kidney and heart, causing harmful inflammation, is caused by an overproduction of uric acid and/or an inability of the kidneys to excrete adequate amounts of uric acid from the body. High concentrations of SUA lead to formation of uric acid crystals in joints and tissues, causing pain, inflammation and joint damage, and increase the risk for other conditions, including cardiovascular, cardiometabolic, joint and kidney disease.
Patients who are unable to reduce their SUA levels below 6.0 mg/dL with oral drugs are diagnosed with refractory gout. Chronic refractory gout constitutes a subset of gout patients exhibiting chronic high SUA levels and painful and damaging uric acid deposits. We estimate that there are approximately 160,000 chronic refractory gout patients in the U.S.
We believe SEL-212 may potentially address several key unmet needs in the treatment of chronic refractory gout: the durable control of SUA levels, the elimination of painful and damaging uric acid deposits, reduction in incidence and severity of flares, based on our preclinical studies, clinical studies, and market research. SEL-212 is designed to address these unmet medical needs while improving the dosing regimen to a once-monthly treatment.
We announced the top-line data of our Phase 2 head-to-head clinical trial, which we refer to as the COMPARE trial, against pegloticase, which is marketed as KRYSTEXXA®, in September 2020. SEL-212 showed a numerically higher response rate to pegloticase on the primary endpoint during months 3 and 6 combined, but did not meet the primary endpoint of statistical superiority. SEL-212 did demonstrate a statistically significant higher response rate of SEL-212 during the third month of treatment, as well as a statistically significant greater overall reduction in mean SUA levels in SEL-212 versus pegloticase. SEL-212 demonstrated a numerically higher response rate of SEL-212 during the sixth month of treatment. In patients with tophi at baseline, SEL-212 demonstrated substantially higher responder rates for SEL-212 compared to pegloticase on the primary endpoint, and a statistically significant reduction in mean SUA when compared to pegloticase. Approximately 41% of patients in the Phase 2 COMPARE trial had visible tophi at baseline. SEL-212 showed favorable safety results and was well-tolerated; there were no deaths during the study. There were no notable differences in serious Treatment Emergent Adverse Events, or TEAEs, treatment-related serious TEAEs, or infusion reactions between the two groups. A full analysis of safety signals, including gout flare incidence and severity, requires evaluation of the full data set and will be reported together with the full efficacy analysis in a manuscript in a medical journal.
We and Sobi commenced the Phase 3 DISSOLVE clinical program of SEL-212 in September 2020. The Phase 3 clinical program consists of two double blinded, placebo-controlled trials of SEL-212, DISSOLVE I and DISSOLVE II. Each trial is expected to enroll 105 patients, with 35 patients receiving 0.1 mg/kg of ImmTOR and 0.2 mg/kg of pegadricase, 35 patients receiving 0.15 mg/kg of ImmTOR and 0.2 mg/kg of pegadricase, and 35 patients receiving placebo. DISSOLVE I and DISSOLVE II both have a 6-month primary endpoint with a 6-month safety extension for DISSOLVE I. Topline data from the Phase 3 DISSOLVE clinical program is expected in the second half of 2022. The Phase 3 DISSOLVE clinical program is being conducted by Selecta and funded by Sobi.
SEL-212 Components
SEL-212 consists of ImmTOR co-administered with pegadricase. Our ImmTOR consists of nanoparticles composed of poly(D,L-lactide), or PLA, and poly(D,L-lactide)-block-poly(ethylene-glycol), or PLA-PEG, encapsulating rapamycin. Our pegadricase consists of a uricase modified with poly(ethylene-glycol), or PEG.
Pegadricase is a pegylated version of the therapeutic enzyme uricase, which we have licensed from Shenyang Sunshine Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., or 3SBio, exclusively for all markets, except Japan and Greater China, and exclusively for Japan only in combination with our ImmTOR platform. Uricase is an enzyme endogenous to all mammals, except for humans and certain primates, which converts uric acid to the more soluble metabolite, allantoin. There is a natural limit to the amount of uric acid 
that can be excreted by the kidneys, which decreases with age and can be reduced by some medications. By converting uric acid to allantoin, uricase provides an additional way for the body to reduce uric acid. In our Phase 1/2 program, out of 19 patients dosed with the pegadricase alone, three patients were responders at week 4.
SEL-212 Clinical Development
Phase 1a and Phase 1b clinical trials
We conducted Phase 1a and Phase 1b clinical trials for SEL-212 at multiple sites in the United States.
The Phase 1a trial consisted of a single ascending-dose trial of pegadricase alone in 22 patients with elevated SUA levels greater than 6.0 mg/dL. At the outset of the trial, each of five cohorts received a single intravenous infusion of pegadricase at ascending dose levels. We monitored the patients during a 30-day period post-infusion. We commenced enrollment of the clinical trial in the second quarter of 2015 and completed the treatment portion of the trial in November 2015. We observed that pegadricase showed no serious adverse events, or SAEs, and was well tolerated at the five dose levels tested. Additionally, we observed that pegadricase rapidly reduced and sustained average SUA levels below 6.0 mg/dL for each cohort for 14 to 30 days, depending on the dose level. Consistent with our preclinical studies in animals, pegadricase induced uricase-specific ADAs in all patients with varying levels in this Phase 1a trial.
The Phase 1b clinical trial enrolled 63 patients with SUA levels greater than 6.0 mg/dL. One group of five patients received a single 0.4 mg/kg dose of pegadricase alone. Four groups of patients, each containing two placebo-control patients and five test article patients, received a placebo or a single intravenous infusion of ImmTOR alone at the following ascending dose levels: 0.03 mg/kg, 0.1 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg. Four groups of patients received a single intravenous infusion of ImmTOR at ascending dose levels of 0.03 mg/kg (5 patients), 0.1 mg/kg (10 patients), 0.15 mg/kg (5 patients) or 0.3 mg/kg (5 patients) with a fixed dose of pegadricase of 0.4 mg/kg, which we collectively call the SEL-212 cohorts. All patients were followed for at least 30 days after their initial dose.
At the completion of our Phase 1b program for SEL-212 we had dosed a total of 64 patients in the trial with either SEL-212 (ImmTOR and pegadricase), ImmTOR alone, pegadricase alone or placebo. The median serum acid level of patients enrolled was 7.3 mg/dL, with a mean of 7.4 mg/dL at baseline. Patients presented with an average of 5.3 co-morbidities, such as hypertension and diabetes.
We have generally observed that SEL‑212 and its components, ImmTOR and pegadricase, have been well tolerated in this patient population. There were a total of six SAEs in the Phase 1b trial. Of the six SAEs, three were determined to not to be related to study drug by investigators. Of the remaining three SAEs that were determined to possibly or likely be related to study drug, two were cases of stomatitis that occurred at the highest dose of ImmTOR tested (0.5 mg/kg), leading us to define 0.3 mg/kg as the maximum tolerated dose of ImmTOR in this patient population. The remaining SAE was a case of drug hypersensitivity that occurred at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg of ImmTOR in combination with 0.4 mg/kg of pegadricase. In all cases, the patient fully recovered from the SAE without residual effects.
Phase 2 dose-finding clinical trial
We enrolled patients with symptomatic gout and elevated SUA levels in an open-label, multiple ascending-dose Phase 2 clinical trial of SEL-212 at 15 active U.S. clinical sites. The primary and secondary endpoints for this trial included safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and reduction of SUA and ADA levels, in addition to data regarding flares and other patient-related observations. 
The following are the results from the 152 patients dosed in the Phase 2 trial with the primary clinical endpoint of SUA levels below 6 mg/dL:
•Control and 0.05 mg/kg ImmTOR Dose Cohorts (cohorts receiving five monthly doses of pegadricase alone or three monthly doses of 0.2 mg/kg or 0.4 mg/kg of pegadricase + 0.05 mg/kg of ImmTOR followed by two monthly doses of pegadricase alone): Dosing of patients in the control cohorts receiving pegadricase alone was stopped early due to a loss of clinical activity caused by the immunogenicity of the enzyme. Clinical activity was lost by week 12 in the majority of patients receiving pegadricase in combination with the 0.05 mg/kg dose of ImmTOR.
•0.08 and 0.1 mg/kg ImmTOR Dose Cohorts (cohorts receiving three monthly doses of 0.2 mg/kg or 0.4 mg/kg of pegadricase + 0.08 or 0.10 mg/kg of ImmTOR followed by two monthly doses of pegadricase alone): A majority of patients in these cohorts maintained clinical activity while receiving the combination therapy through week 12. These results were consistent with the level of clinical activity observed through day 30 at a similar SEL-212 dose level in our Phase 1b trial. At the 0.1 mg/kg dose level, half of the patients that maintained clinical activity through week 12 also maintained clinical activity through week 20.
•0.125 and 0.15 mg/kg ImmTOR Dose Cohorts (cohorts receiving three monthly doses of pegadricase +0.125 or 0.15 mg/kg of ImmTOR followed by two monthly doses of pegadricase alone): A majority of patients in these cohorts maintained clinical activity while receiving the combination therapy through week 12. These results were consistent 
with the level of clinical activity observed through day 30 at a similar SEL-212 dose level in our Phase 1b trial. Approximately 81% of evaluable patients (N=27) receiving up to 0.15 mg/kg ImmTOR in combination with 0.2 or 0.4 mg/kg of pegadricase followed by 2 monthly doses of pegadricase alone had SUA control below 6 mg/dL at week 12.
•0.10 and 0.15 mg/kg ImmTOR 5 Combination Dose Cohorts (cohorts receiving five monthly doses of pegadricase +0.10 or 0.15 mg/kg of ImmTOR ): Five monthly doses of SEL-212 resulted in sustained SUA control and was well tolerated over the entire treatment period. 100% of the patients that had SUA levels below 6 mg/dL at 12 weeks maintained control through 20 weeks. Approximately 66% of evaluable patients (21/32) completed week 20 with SUA levels below 6 mg/dL.
SEL-212 was generally well-tolerated at clinically active doses following repeated administrations in the trial. Twenty patients reported a total of 23 SAEs in the Phase 2 clinical trial. Nine SAEs were reported in the five dose combination cohorts, seven of which were reported to be not related or unlikely related to study drug, and two of which were infusion reactions. All SAEs were successfully treated without further issues.
Phase 2 head-to-head clinical trial (COMPARE)
In March 2019, we initiated a non-registrational Phase 2 head-to-head clinical trial of SEL-212 (COMPARE), in which SEL-212 was compared against the current FDA-approved therapy for chronic refractory gout, pegloticase, in multiple clinical sites in the United States. The two-armed, open label trial enrolled 170 patients with 87 patients receiving pegloticase (as set forth in the prescribing information) and the other 83 patients receiving six monthly doses of SEL-212 (0.15 mg/kg of ImmTOR and 0.2 mg/kg of pegadricase).
On September 30, 2020, we announced the topline results from the COMPARE trial. SEL-212 showed a numerically higher response rate to pegloticase on the primary endpoint during months 3 and 6 combined, but did not meet the primary endpoint of statistical superiority. SEL-212 did demonstrate a statistically significant higher response rate of SEL-212 during the third month of treatment, as well as a statistically significant greater overall reduction in mean SUA levels in SEL-212 versus pegloticase in months 3 and 6 combined. SEL-212 demonstrated a numerically higher response rate of SEL-212 during the sixth month of treatment. In patients with tophi at baseline, SEL-212 demonstrated substantially higher responder rates for SEL-212 compared to pegloticase on the primary endpoint, and a statistically significant reduction in mean SUA when compared to pegloticase. Approximately 41% of patients in the Phase 2 COMPARE trial had visible tophi at baseline, which is lower than expected for the general refractory gout population. SEL-212 showed a favorable safety profile and was well-tolerated. There were no deaths during the study. There were no notable differences in serious TEAEs, treatment-related serious TEAEs, or infusion reactions between the two groups. A full analysis of safety signals, including gout flare incidence and severity, requires evaluation of the full data set and will be reported together with the full efficacy analysis in a manuscript in a medical journal.
Phase 3 DISSOLVE clinical program
In September 2020, we commenced the Phase 3 clinical program of SEL-212, which we refer to as DISSOLVE. We are responsible for the execution of the DISSOLVE program and are being reimbursed by Sobi on a quarterly basis for expenses incurred in connection with these activities. The Phase 3 clinical program consists of two double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials of SEL-212. We refer to these trials as DISSOLVE I and DISSOLVE II. Each trial is expected to enroll 105 patients, with 35 patients receiving 0.1 mg/kg of ImmTOR and 0.2 mg/kg of pegadricase, 35 patients receiving 0.15 mg/kg of ImmTOR and 0.2 mg/kg of pegadricase, and 35 patients receiving placebo. We commenced enrollment of DISSOLVE I in September 2020 and DISSOLVE II in December 2020. DISSOLVE I is enrolling patients in the United States only and will have a 6-month primary endpoint followed by a 6-month safety extension. DISSOLVE II will have a 6-month primary endpoint with no extension. The primary endpoint of the DISSOLVE program is the maintenance of SUA levels below 6 mg/dL at 6 months. Topline data from the Phase 3 DISSOLVE clinical program is expected in the second half of 2022.
Amplifying the Efficacy of Biologics: Enzyme Therapy – IgA Nephropathy
The second indication in our enzyme therapy program is IgA nephropathy, an autoimmune kidney disease that occurs when immune complexes of a subclass of antibodies called immunoglobulin A1 (IgA1) accumulates in the kidneys.
On October 8, 2020, we entered into an Option and License Agreement, or the IGAN Agreement, with IGAN Biosciences, Inc., or IGAN. Pursuant to the IGAN Agreement, IGAN has granted us an exclusive license to research, evaluate, and conduct pre-clinical development activities on IGAN’s proprietary IgA proteases. Previous studies in animal models conducted at independent laboratories demonstrated that IgA protease removed injurious IgA immune complexes from kidneys and reduced inflammation, fibrosis, and hematuria. These results suggest that it is an excellent candidate to potentially decrease the rate of disease progression and possibly even reverse the disease. The barrier to IgA protease commercialization is the bacterial origin of the protease, which makes it immunogenic. Our ImmTOR platform has shown in clinical studies the ability to mitigate the formation of ADAs to immunogenic enzymes, which has been demonstrated with our Phase 3 lead product candidate, SEL-212. We intend to combine IgA protease with our ImmTOR platform to develop a novel combination product candidate for the treatment of IgA nephropathy and IgA-mediated diseases. We will have an option term of 24 months, during which we can 
elect to obtain an exclusive license to further develop and commercialize the product candidate to treat all IgA-mediated diseases, including IgA nephropathy, Linear IgA bullous dermatitis, IgA pemphigus, and Henoch-Schonlein purpura (also known as IgA vasculitis).
We plan to file an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application, for this program by the fourth quarter of 2021. 
Amplifying the Efficacy of Biologics: Gene Therapies 
When used in combination with AAV gene therapy vectors, ImmTOR has been observed to inhibit the immune response to the vector and enable successful redosing in mice and nonhuman primates. Currently, the ability to re-administer systemic AAV gene therapy is limited by the development of neutralizing antibodies. The ability to safely re-dose AAV may help achieve therapeutic benefit in patients who are under-dosed; it may also help restore transgene expression in patients, particularly pediatric patients, who may lose expression over time as they grow. In addition, a study conducted in nonhuman primates showed that co-administration of AAV vector and ImmTOR in non-human primates, or NHPs, enabled higher and more durable transgene expression after the first dose of gene therapy as well as robust inhibition of anti-AAV8 immunoglobulin G, or IgG and neutralizing antibodies. The observation that co-administration of AAV vector and ImmTOR leads to higher transgene expression demonstrates the potential for dosing lower levels of AAV gene therapies when combined with ImmTOR. Thus integrating ImmTOR into a gene therapy protocol has the potential to provide a first dose benefit by enhancing liver-directed transgene expression and durability, as well as the potential for enabling re-dosing.
Our lead gene therapy program is in collaboration with AskBio in methylmalonic acidemia, or MMA, an inherited disorder in which the body is unable to process certain proteins and fats (lipids) properly. We and AskBio plan to file an IND for this product candidate, MMA-101, in MMA and commence a Phase 1 clinical trial in the first half of 2021 under this collaboration. We expect to report initial data from this trial by the end of 2021. In October and November 2020, we and AskBio received rare pediatric disease designation and orphan drug designation, respectively, from the FDA for MMA-101, for the treatment of MMA due to methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, or MMUT gene mutations. See “⸻Licenses and Collaborations⸻AskBio” for more information.
Our proprietary gene therapy product candidate, SEL-313, is being developed to treat ornithine transcarbamylase, or OTC deficiency, and is currently in preclinical development. OTC deficiency is a rare genetic disorder that causes ammonia to accumulate in the blood due to mutations in the OTC gene, which is critical for proper function of the urea cycle. The most severe form of the disorder presents within the first few days of life. Severe symptoms include inability to control body temperature and breathing rate, seizures, coma, developmental delays and intellectual disability. Less severe forms of the disorder are characterized by delirium, erratic behavior, aversion to high protein foods, vomiting and seizures.
The SEL-399 program combines an empty AAV capsid (EMC-101), which is an AAV capsid containing no transgene, with ImmTOR and is being conducted in partnership with AskBio. Building on the preclinical data we have generated showing ImmTOR’s effect on mitigating or reducing the formation of neutralizing antibodies to AAV gene therapies, we have commenced a clinical trial of SEL-399 in healthy adult volunteers in Belgium. The goal of the SEL-399 clinical trial is to demonstrate the appropriate dose of ImmTOR in humans to mitigate the formation of antibodies to AAV capsids used in gene therapies. An initial control cohort of healthy volunteers received a single dose of EMC-101 in December 2020 and dose escalating cohorts of EMC-101 plus ImmTOR were initiated in February 2021. Topline results from the clinical trial are expected in the fourth quarter of 2021.
We have several additional programs in development with our collaborators.
Restoring Self-tolerance in Autoimmune Diseases
Our lead autoimmune diseases indication is PBC, a T-cell driven autoimmune disease that causes progressive destruction of the bile ducts. Patients with PBC are in need of a highly-targeted, liver-directed approach to treating the root cause of the disorder. We believe PBC has a well-defined target antigen, significant unmet medical need, and is well suited to the application of our ImmTOR immune tolerance platform, as preclinical data suggest that ImmTOR has the potential to enhance the tolerogenic environment in the liver and provide a hepatoprotective benefit.
Licenses and Collaborations
Swedish Orphan Biovitrum
In June 2020, we announced that we had entered into the Sobi License, pursuant to which we agreed to grant Sobi an exclusive, worldwide (except as to Greater China) license to develop, manufacture and commercialize SEL-212, which is currently in development for the treatment of chronic refractory gout. In September 2020, pursuant to the Sobi License, Sobi paid us a one-time, up-front payment of $75 million. Sobi has also agreed to make milestone payments totaling up to $630 million to us upon the achievement of various development and regulatory milestones and sales thresholds for annual net sales of SEL-212, and tiered royalty payments ranging from the low double digits on the lowest sales tier to the high teens on the highest sales tier.
Additionally, Sobi purchased an aggregate of 5,416,390 shares of our common stock at $4.6156 for aggregate gross proceeds of $25 million, which we refer to as the Sobi Private Placement. The closing of the Sobi Private Placement occurred on July 31, 2020.
Under the Sobi License, we will have operational oversight of the Phase 3 DISSOLVE clinical program of SEL-212 (DISSOLVE I and DISSOLVE II) that commenced in September 2020, at Sobi’s expense.
IGAN Biosciences
In October 2020, we entered into the IGAN Agreement. Pursuant to the IGAN Agreement, IGAN granted us an exclusive license to research, evaluate, and conduct pre-clinical development activities on IGAN’s proprietary IgA proteases. We have an option term of 24 months, or the Option Term, during which we can elect to obtain an exclusive license to further develop and commercialize the product to treat all IgA-mediated diseases, including IgA nephropathy, Linear IgA bullous dermatitis, IgA pemphigus, and Henoch-Schonlein purpura (also known as IgA vasculitis).
Upon execution of the IGAN Agreement, we paid IGAN a one-time up-front payment of $500,000 and we would owe additional payments to IGAN if we were to opt-in to an exclusive license agreement, as well as upon the achievement of certain development and sales milestones.
During the Option Term, we may terminate the IGAN Agreement immediately for any reason upon written notice to IGAN. If we opt-in to an exclusive license agreement, we may terminate the IGAN Agreement upon 120 days’ written notice.

In June 2020, we entered into a research license and option agreement with Sarepta, or the Sarepta Agreement. Pursuant to the agreement, we granted Sarepta a license to research and evaluate ImmTOR in combination with Sarepta’s AAV gene therapy or gene editing technology, using viral or non-viral delivery, or the Sarepta Product, to treat Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and certain Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy subtypes, or the Sarepta Indications. Sarepta will have an option term of 24 months during which it can opt-in to obtain an exclusive license to further develop and commercialize the Sarepta Product to treat at least one Sarepta Indication, with a potential to extend the option term if Sarepta pays an additional fee to us. Sarepta made an up-front payment to us upon signing of the agreement, and we are eligible to receive additional payments under the option term. If Sarepta opts-in to an exclusive license agreement, we could receive option exercise payments per indication, we would be entitled to significant development and commercial milestone payments and tiered royalties ranging from the mid-to-high single digits based on net sales.
AskBio
Feasibility Study and License Agreement
In August 2019, we entered into a feasibility study and license agreement with AskBio, or the AskBio Collaboration Agreement. The initial product candidate being developed under this collaboration is gene therapy for MMA which can cause severe developmental defects and premature death as a result of an accumulation of toxic metabolites. We previously conducted preclinical studies for this product candidate and will leverage that previous work within the collaboration. We expect to commence a Phase 1 clinical trial in MMA-101 in the first half of 2021, with initial proof of concept data expected by the end of 2021. The initial proof-of-concept data will potentially validate the use of our ImmTOR platform to mitigate the formation of neutralizing anti-AAV capsid antibodies, which currently precludes re-dosing. If the proof-of-concept studies are successful, we will proceed with a collaboration to pursue the development and commercialization of AAV gene therapy product candidates utilizing ImmTOR for the treatment of certain agreed serious rare and orphan genetic diseases.
Additionally, the SEL-399 program in collaboration with AskBio, combines an empty AAV capsid (EMC-101), which is an AAV capsid containing no transgene, with ImmTOR. We commenced the trial in healthy adult volunteers in December 2020, with the goal to demonstrate the appropriate dose of ImmTOR in humans to mitigate the formation of antibodies to AAV capsids used in gene therapies. Topline results are expected in the fourth quarter of 2021.
We and AskBio will share responsibility for the research, development and commercialization of products developed under this collaboration. The parties will also share research, development and commercialization costs equally for all collaboration products, but with a right of either party to opt out of certain products, and thereby no longer be required to share costs for such products. Each party will receive a percentage of net profits for each product sold under the collaboration equal to the percentage of shared costs borne by such party in the development of such product. Pursuant to the AskBio Collaboration Agreement, AskBio is responsible for manufacturing the AAV capsids and AAV vectors and we are responsible for manufacturing ImmTOR.
License Agreement for Pompe Disease
In December 2019, we entered into the AskBio License Agreement which provides AskBio with exclusive worldwide rights to our ImmTOR platform to research, develop and commercialize certain AAV-gene therapy products targeting the GAA gene, or derivatives thereof, to treat Pompe Disease. Pursuant to the AskBio License Agreement, AskBio paid us upfront fees of 
an aggregate of $7.0 million. Also pursuant to the AskBio License Agreement, AskBio agreed to make additional payments to us based on the achievement of certain development and commercial milestones of up to an aggregate of $237.0 million. AskBio will also be obligated to make tiered royalty payments, at percentages in the mid-to-high single digits, to us based on achievement of certain sales milestones.
We will supply AskBio with our ImmTOR platform and AskBio will be responsible for all preclinical, clinical and commercial manufacture and supply of products licensed under the AskBio License Agreement (other than ImmTOR) and carry out all other activities related to the research, development, and commercialization of such products at its sole expense, including all regulatory activities related thereto. The AskBio License Agreement contains other customary terms and conditions, including representations and warranties, covenants, termination, and indemnification obligations in favor of each party.
Spark Therapeutics
In 2016, we entered into a license and option agreement with Spark, or the Spark License Agreement, which provides Spark with exclusive worldwide rights to our ImmTOR platform to research, develop and commercialize gene therapies for Factor VIII, an essential blood clotting protein relevant to the treatment of hemophilia A.
Pursuant to the Spark License Agreement, Spark paid us an upfront payment of $15.0 million. We will be eligible to receive up to an aggregate of $430.0 million in milestone payments, with up to $65.0 million being based on Spark’s achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones and up to $365.0 million for commercial milestones, as well as tiered royalties on global net sales at percentages ranging from mid-single to low-double digits.
Each party is responsible for its own costs and expenses incurred in connection with its respective activities under the Spark License, except that Spark has agreed to reimburse us for the full-time equivalent and out-of-pocket costs incurred in performing certain tasks or assistance specifically requested by Spark. We retain the responsibility to manufacture Spark’s preclinical, clinical and commercial requirements for the ImmTOR platform, subject to the terms of the Spark License Agreement.
The Spark License Agreement will continue on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis until the expiration of Spark’s royalty payment obligations with respect to such product in such country unless earlier terminated by the parties. The Spark License Agreement may be terminated by Spark for convenience upon ninety days’ notice. Either party may terminate the Spark License Agreement on a target-by-target basis for the material breach of the other party with respect to such target.
In connection with the Spark License Agreement, we also entered into a stock purchase agreement with Spark, pursuant to which Spark purchased in the aggregate $15.0 million of shares of our common stock.
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
In 2008, we entered into a license agreement with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or MIT, which we refer to in its amended form as the MIT License. We amended the MIT License in January 2010, August 2013, November 2016, December 2019 and June 2020. Under the MIT License, we acquired an exclusive worldwide license, with the right to grant sublicenses, to develop, make, sell, use and import certain licensed products that are therapeutic or prophylactic vaccines and use certain licensed processes in the exercise of rights to the licensed products, the manufacture, sale and practice of which are covered by patent rights owned or controlled by MIT, including patents jointly owned with Brigham and Women’s Hospital, or Brigham, the President and Fellows of Harvard College, the Immune Disease Institute and the Children’s Medical Center Corporation. Our exclusivity is subject to certain retained rights of these institutions and other third parties.
Upon our entry into the MIT License, we paid MIT a non-refundable license issue fee, reimbursed certain of MIT’s costs and issued shares of our common stock to MIT and the other institutional patent owners which were subject to certain anti-dilution, registration and other protective rights. We are obligated to pay MIT creditable annual maintenance fees, low-single-digit running royalty on annual net sales, developmental milestones up to an aggregate of $1.5 million, a mid-single digit percentage of certain payments we receive from corporate partners and a specified percentage of certain income received from sublicensees after 2009 between 10% and 30%. We may terminate the MIT License at any time upon six months’ written notice. MIT has the right to terminate the MIT License immediately upon written notice to us if we cease to carry on our business related to the MIT License, fail to maintain insurance as required under the MIT License, file for bankruptcy, fail to pay amounts due under the MIT License, challenge or assist others in bringing a challenge to MIT’s patents or fail to cure material breach within 60 days’ written notice thereof. Absent early termination, the MIT License will continue until the expiration or abandonment of the last to expire patent right subject to the MIT License.
In June 2020, we entered into a Fifth Amendment to the MIT License, or the MIT Amendment, which was effective as of May 15, 2020. Pursuant to the MIT Amendment, certain of our diligence obligations were extended to the second quarter of 2021, including a diligence obligation to commence a Phase 3 trial for a licensed product by a specific date in the second quarter of 2021. Additionally, certain of our development and regulatory milestones and payments upon achievement of such milestones were adjusted.
Shenyang Sunshine Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.
In 2014, we entered into a license agreement with 3SBio, as amended in 2017, which we refer to as the 3SBio License. Pursuant to the 3SBio License, we were granted an exclusive license to certain pegadricase-related patents and related know-how owned or in-licensed by 3SBio for the worldwide (except for Greater China and Japan) development and commercialization of products based thereupon for human therapeutic, diagnostic and prophylactic use. We are also granted a worldwide (except for Greater China) exclusive license to develop, commercialize and manufacture or have manufactured products combining our proprietary ImmTOR platform with pegadricase or related compounds supplied by 3SBio (or otherwise supplied if our rights to manufacture are in effect) for human therapeutic, diagnostic and prophylactic use. We were also granted a co-exclusive license to manufacture and have manufactured pegadricase and related compounds for our preclinical and clinical use or, if the 3SBio License is terminated for 3SBio’s material breach, for any use under the 3SBio License. In addition, the 3SBio License, as amended, permits us to utilize one or more third parties to provide up to 20% of our commercial supply of pegadricase. Otherwise, except in the case of a supply shortage on the part of 3SBio, we are obligated to obtain at least 80% of our supply of such compounds for Phase 3 clinical trials and commercial use from 3SBio under the terms of our separate Commercial Supply Agreement with 3SBio dated August 1, 2019.
Under the 3SBio License we have paid to 3SBio an aggregate of $7.0 million in upfront and milestone-based payments. We are required to make future payments to 3SBio contingent upon the occurrence of events related to the achievement of clinical and regulatory approval milestones of up to an aggregate of $15.0 million for products containing our ImmTOR platform. We are also required to pay 3SBio tiered royalties on annual worldwide net sales related to the pegadricase component of products at percentages ranging from the low-to-mid single digits for products containing our ImmTOR platform, subject to specified reductions. These royalties are payable, on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis until the later of (i) the date that all of the patent rights for that product have expired in that country or (ii) a specified number of years from the first commercial sale of such product in such country.
The 3SBio License expires on the date of expiration of all of our royalty payment obligations unless earlier terminated by either party for an uncured material default of the other party or for the other party’s bankruptcy. We may also terminate the 3SBio License on a country-by-country or product-by-product basis for any reason effective upon 60 days’ prior written notice to 3SBio or, with respect to a given product, immediately upon written notice to 3SBio if we identify a safety or efficacy concern related to such product.
Manufacturing
We manufacture ImmTOR using a scalable, self-assembly nanoemulsion process with well-defined, pharmaceutical unit operations. This proprietary, highly specialized and precisely controlled manufacturing process enables us to reproducibly manufacture ImmTOR across many production scales, from milligram-scale at the laboratory bench to hundreds of grams to multi-kilogram scale for commercial production. We have also developed and executed the required detailed analytic characterization of our products.
For our most advanced product candidate, SEL-212, we are producing ImmTOR at an approximately 400-gram scale process, which, at the doses being tested in the Phase 3 DISSOLVE program, we believe will be suitable for commercialization. The process is designed such that this same equipment is capable of potentially producing up to a one kilogram batch size scale. As our nanoparticle manufacturing process is compact, and therefore also portable, our strategy is to transfer our custom designed process skids to a contract manufacturing organization, or CMO, and have the CMO produce the nanoparticles, under our direction. This is the strategy we use for production of clinical supplies for clinical trials and would be the expected strategy for commercial production.
The pegadricase enzyme for SEL-212 is produced by fermentation in E. coli and is sourced from 3SBio in China. Through a licensing arrangement, we own exclusive worldwide rights to pegadricase outside of China, with co-ownership of rights in Japan and with 3SBio owning all rights in China. Under this arrangement, 3SBio has agreed to supply us with pegadricase. We also have a second supplier for pegadricase in the United States.
Intellectual Property
Our ImmTOR platform is designed to deliver precise instructions to the immune system as a result of the natural predisposition of the immune system to interrogate nanoparticles such as viruses. In connection with our founding, we licensed multiple patent families, including a patent family based in part on the pioneering research performed by our co-founders at Harvard University, MIT and Brigham. We have also conducted extensive research in-house to further research this area, leading to key discoveries regarding and uses for our ImmTOR technology. We have aggressively sought to extend and protect the proprietary intellectual property underlying the composition and use of ImmTOR for antigen-specific immunotolerance.
We endeavor to protect our nanoparticle technology, which we consider fundamental to our business, by seeking, maintaining and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties, relating to our program, product candidates, their methods of use and the processes for their manufacture. Our practice is to strive to protect our intellectual property by, among other methods, pursuing and obtaining patent protection in the United States and in jurisdictions 
outside of the United States related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, programs and product candidates that are commercially important to the operation and growth of our business. We also rely on trade secrets and know-how relating to our proprietary technology, programs and product candidates, continuing innovation and in-licensing opportunities to maintain, advance and fortify our proprietary position in our nanoparticle-based immunotherapy program and product candidates. Our commercial success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our program technology, inventions and improvements; to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; to maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned or controlled by third parties; to defend and enforce our proprietary rights, including our patents; and to operate without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties.
We have developed and in-licensed numerous patents and patent applications and possess substantial know-how and trade secrets relating to our nanoparticle-based immunotherapy technology, program and product candidates. Our patent portfolio contains a number of issued patents in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions. We also own a number of pending patent applications in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions. These patents and patent applications include claims related to:
•tolerance immunotherapy programs;
•methods and compositions related to our proprietary nanoparticles in a variety of applications, including tolerance applications, such as:
◦mitigating anti-drug antibodies and/or their effects associated with protein drugs, such as for chronic refractory gout, including coverage for ImmTOR co-administered with pegadricase, which related patents are expected to expire between 2032 and 2040, and
◦genetic therapies (such as viral vector gene therapy), including coverage for ImmTOR co-administered with a viral vector, which related patents are expected to expire between 2032 and 2040; and
•development and commercialization of SEL-212, including both composition of matter and method of treatment claims (there are multiple patent families with claims that cover the SEL-212 product, one of which is a licensed, issued U.S. patent that expires in August 2021).
In addition, we have exclusively or non-exclusively licensed intellectual property, including U.S. issued patents, foreign issued patents, and pending applications in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. The licensed patents and patent applications cover various aspects of the technology being developed by us, including claims directed to compositions of matter and methods of use, and have been filed in various countries worldwide including in North America, Europe and Asia, with material expiration dates varying from 2021 to, if claims are issued, 2029. In addition to filing and prosecuting patent applications in the United States, we often file analogous patent applications in the European Union and in additional foreign countries where we believe such filing is likely to be beneficial, including but not limited to, Australia, Brazil, China, Europe, South Korea, Mexico, India, Israel and/or Japan.
Each patent’s term depends upon the laws of the countries in which they are obtained. The patent term in most countries in which we file is 20 years from the earliest date of filing of a non-provisional patent application. Notably, the term of U.S. patents may be extended due to delays incurred due to compliance with FDA or by delays encountered during prosecution that are caused by the USPTO. For example, the Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension for FDA-approved drugs of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent, depending upon the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. There is a limit to the amount of time a patent may be extended in the United States; no patent extension can extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar patent term extensions are available in Europe and other jurisdictions for patents that cover regulatory-approved drugs. Currently, we own or license patents and patent applications with expected material expiration dates ranging from 2021 to 2040. However, the actual patent protection period varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We face potential competition from many different sources, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize may compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
Our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources, established presence in the market, expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical and clinical testing, obtaining regulatory approvals and reimbursement and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, sales, marketing and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, 
as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
The key competitive factors affecting the success of any other tolerance or immune stimulation product candidates that we develop, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic or biosimilar products.
SEL-212 may compete with others in the gout market, including KRYSTEXXA, which contains a pegylated uricase similar to the pegadricase component of SEL-212 and is indicated for the treatment of refractory gout. Horizon Pharma plc, whose affiliates own KRYSTEXXA, may find other approaches to eliminate undesired immunogenicity to KRYSTEXXA. Long-term treatment with global immunosuppressive products may increase the susceptibility to contract infections, tumors and may lead to organ failure.
Large companies with active research to prevent the formation of ADAs and treat allergies or autoimmune diseases include Sanofi S.A., Pfizer Inc., and Merck & Co., Inc. Small, early-stage biopharmaceutical companies active in the research for new technologies to induce antigen-specific immune tolerance include Anokion SA, Apitope International NV, Caladrius Biosciences, Cour Pharmaceutical Development Company, Inc., Dendright International, Inc., Parvus Therapeutics, REGiMMUNE Corporation, Rubius Therapeutics, Inc., Tolerion, Inc., Topas Therapeutics GmbH, SQZ Biotechnologies and Txcell SA. Biopharmaceutical companies active in the research for ornithine transcarbamylase include Ultragenyx, Poseida, TranslateBio, Arcturus, and Kaleido. Biopharmaceutical companies active in the research for MMA include LogicBio, Poseida, and Moderna. Biopharmaceutical companies active in the research for IgA nephropathy include Calliditas, Omeros, Travere, EMD Serono, Novartis, Ionis, Visterra, Reata, and Alnylam. Biopharmaceutical companies active in the research for PBC include Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Genfit, GenKyoTex, GSK, Eli Lily, and CymaBay.
Government Regulation
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing.
SEL-212 is subject to regulation in the United States as a combination product. If marketed individually, each component would be subject to different regulatory pathways and would require approval of independent marketing applications by the FDA. A combination product, however, is assigned to a Center that will have primary jurisdiction over its regulation based on a determination of the combination product’s primary mode of action, which is the single mode of action that provides the most important therapeutic action. In the case of SEL-212, we believe that the primary mode of action is attributable to the biologic component of the product. In the case of SEL-212, which we believe will be regulated as a therapeutic biologic, the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, or CDER, will have primary jurisdiction over premarket development. We expect to seek approval of SEL-212 through a single BLA reviewed by CDER, and we do not expect that the FDA will require a separate marketing authorization for each constituent of SEL-212.
Biological products are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&C Act, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHS Act, and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. SEL-212 and any other product candidates that we develop must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the United States and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agency before they may be legally marketed in foreign countries.
U.S. biological products development process
The process required by the FDA before a biologic, including a gene therapy, may be marketed in the United States is summarized below.
Before testing any biological product candidate in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs.
The clinical study sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical study on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND 
sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical study can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. In addition to the submission of an IND to the FDA, supervision of certain human gene transfer trials may also require evaluation and assessment by an institutional biosafety committee, or IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees research utilizing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules at that institution. 
Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical study, dosing procedures, patient selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor patient safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical study will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research patients provide informed consent. Further, each clinical study must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical study will be conducted. Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
•Phase 1. The biological product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human patients and tested for safety.
•Phase 2. The biological product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
•Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up.
The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research patients or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biological product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including biologics, are also required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information, which is publicly available at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies must also finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with GMP requirements.
After the completion of clinical trials of a biological product candidate, FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the biological product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal trials, human trials, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug or biological product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within sixty days after a Type C meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and FDA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, pure and potent for its intended use and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP requirements to assure and preserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and 
under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product candidate. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured to determine that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications.
Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than the applicant interprets the same data. If the FDA decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.
One of the performance goals agreed to by the FDA under the PDUFA is to review 90% of standard BLAs in 10 months from the filing date and 90% of priority BLAs in six months from the filing date, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs.
Orphan Designation
The FDA may grant orphan designation to drugs or biologics intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and marketing the product for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
In the United States, orphan designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to orphan exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same product for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity or where the manufacturer with orphan exclusivity is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the approved orphan designated product. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same biological product as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity.
Rare Pediatric Disease Designation
The Rare Pediatric Disease designation program allows for a sponsor who receives an approval for a product to potentially qualify for a voucher that can be redeemed to receive a priority review of a subsequent marketing application for a different product.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new biological products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new biologic may request that the FDA designate the biologic as a Fast Track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. The FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application for a Fast Track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application.
Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is 
eligible for priority review if it treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to marketed products. Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may be eligible for accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical studies establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a biological product subject to accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. Fast Track designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
In addition, under the provisions of FDASIA, the FDA established a Breakthrough Therapy Designation which is intended to expedite the development and review of products that treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the features of Fast Track designation, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance.
Post-approval Requirements
Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biological products continues after approval, particularly with respect to cGMP requirements. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable requirements in the cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological products include record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects and reporting updated safety and efficacy information.
We also must comply with the FDA’s advertising and promotion requirements, such as those related to direct-to-consumer advertising, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties.
Biosimilars and Exclusivity
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ACA, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product.
Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. However, complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA.
Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for 
certain biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
A biological product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.
The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation and meaning of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty.
Government Regulation outside of the United States
Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical studies or marketing of the product in those countries.
The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical studies are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
In the European Economic Area, or EEA, which is composed of the 27 member states of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA.
There are two types of MAs.
•The Community MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy medicinal products (such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy and tissue engineered products), and medicinal products that contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. Under the Centralized Procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP). Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when the authorization of a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. Under the accelerated procedure the standard 210 days review period is reduced to 150 days.
•National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure.
To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational biological product under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application, which is similar to the U.S. BLA. The European Union also provides opportunities for market exclusivity. For example, in the European Union, upon receiving marketing authorization, new chemical entities generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic or biosimilar application. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the European Union’s regulatory authorities to be a new chemical entity, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity. Products receiving orphan designation in the European Union can receive ten years of market exclusivity, during which time no marketing authorization application shall be accepted and no marketing authorization shall be granted for a similar medicinal product for the same indication. An orphan product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity in the European Union for pediatric studies. No extension to any supplementary protection certificate can be granted on the basis of pediatric studies for orphan indications.
The criteria for designating an “orphan medicinal product” in the European Union are similar in principle to those in the United States. Under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) 141/2000, a medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such 
condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the European Union to justify investment; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the European Union, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition, as defined in Regulation (EC) 847/2000. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a marketing authorization, entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. The application for orphan drug designation must be submitted before the application for marketing authorization. The applicant will receive a fee reduction for the marketing authorization application if the orphan drug designation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the time the marketing authorization is submitted. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
The 10-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time if the:
•second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior;
•applicant consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or
•applicant cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product. 
For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical studies are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
When conducting clinical trials in the EU, we must adhere to the provisions of the European Union Clinical Trials Directive (Directive 2001/20/EC) and the laws and regulations of the EU Member States implementing them. These provisions require, among other things, that the prior authorization of an Ethics Committee and the competent Member State authority is obtained before commencing the clinical trial. In 2014, the EU passed the Clinical Trials Regulation (Regulation 536/2014), which will replace the current Clinical Trials Directive. To ensure that the rules for clinical trials are identical throughout the European Union, the EU Clinical Trials Regulation was passed as a regulation that is directly applicable in all EU member states. All clinical trials performed in the European Union are required to be conducted in accordance with the Clinical Trials Directive until the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable. According to the current plans of the EMA, the Clinical Trials Regulation is expected to become applicable in 2020.
We are also subject to data privacy and security laws in the jurisdictions outside of the U.S. in which we are established, run clinical trials or in which we sell or market our products once approved. For example, in Europe we are subject to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR) in relation to our collection, control, processing and other use of personal data (i.e. data relating to an identifiable living individual). We process personal data in relation to participants in our clinical trials in the EEA., including the health and medical information of these participants. The GDPR is directly applicable in each E.U. Member State, however, it provides that E.U. Member States may introduce further conditions, including limitations which could limit our ability to collect, use and share personal data (including health and medical information), or could cause our compliance costs to increase, ultimately having an adverse impact on our business. The GDPR imposes onerous accountability obligations requiring data controllers and processors to maintain a record of their data processing and implement policies as part of its mandated privacy governance framework. It also requires data controllers to be transparent and disclose to data subjects (in a concise, intelligible and easily accessible form) how their personal information is to be used, imposes limitations on retention of personal data; defines for the first time pseudonymized (i.e., key-coded) data; introduces mandatory data breach notification requirements; and sets higher standards for data controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent for certain data processing activities. We are also subject to E.U. rules with respect to cross-border transfers of personal data out of the E.U. and EEA. We are subject to the supervision of local data protection authorities in those E.U. jurisdictions where we are established or otherwise subject to the GDPR. Fines for certain breaches of the GDPR are significant: up to the greater of EUR 20 million or 4% of total global annual turnover. In addition to the foregoing, a breach of the GDPR could result in regulatory investigations, reputational damage, orders to cease/ change our use of data, enforcement notices, as well potential civil claims including class action type litigation where individuals suffer harm. Moreover, the United Kingdom leaving the E.U. could also lead to further legislative and regulatory changes. It remains unclear how the United Kingdom data protection laws or regulations will develop in the medium to longer term and how data transfer to the United Kingdom from the E.U. will be regulated. However, the United Kingdom has transposed the GDPR into domestic law with the Data Protection Act 2018, which remains in force following the United Kingdom's departure from the EU.
Other Healthcare Laws
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving or providing any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws, which establish similar prohibitions and in some cases may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.
The federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the civil False Claims Act, prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or from knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may also constitute a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Actions under the civil False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the civil False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. In addition, the civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. Many states also have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, prohibits, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and certain other healthcare providers. The ACA imposed, among other things, new annual reporting requirements through the Physician Payments Sunshine Act for covered manufacturers for certain payments and “transfers of value” provided to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain other health care professionals beginning in 2022, and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, impose specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information held by covered entities and their business associates. Among other things, HITECH made HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to, as well as imposed certain other privacy obligations on, “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. Even when HIPAA does not apply, according to the Federal Trade Commission or the FTC, failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure constitutes unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, or the FTCA, 15 U.S.C § 45(a). The FTC expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Individually identifiable health information is considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards. The FTC’s guidance for appropriately securing consumers’ personal information is similar to what is required by the HIPAA Security Rule.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any pharmaceutical or biological products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed 
treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Moreover, for drugs and biologics administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such products. Sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will therefore depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care plans, private health insurers and other organizations.
The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a pharmaceutical or biological product typically is separate from the process for setting the price of such product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover our product candidates could reduce physician utilization of our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a pharmaceutical or biological product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate.
Healthcare Reform
A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products. For example, the ACA, among other things, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; introduced a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans; subjected drug manufacturers to new annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal healthcare programs; and created a new Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.
Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. By way of example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts of 2017, or the TCJA, was enacted, which, among other things, removes penalties for not complying with the individual mandate to carry health insurance. Further, in 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the TCJA, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. In December 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. It is unclear how these decisions, subsequent appeals, if any, and other efforts to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA will impact the law.
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. This included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will stay in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and imaging centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Recently there has also been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, we had 43 full-time employees and one part-time employee, 30 of whom are primarily engaged in research and development activities and five of whom are officers of Selecta Biosciences, Inc. As of December 31, 2020, we also had one full-time consultant. Twenty-three of our employees have either one or both of an M.S. or Ph.D. degree. We consider the intellectual capital of our employees to be an essential driver of our business and key to future prospects. To attract and retain a high-quality, experienced workforce, we offer a competitive mix of compensation and insurance benefits for our employees, as well as participation in our equity programs. Employees working 30 hours or more a week are eligible to participate in our medical, prescription, dental, vision, Flexible Spending Account and life insurance and disability plans. To 
assist employees with costs associated with rising healthcare costs, we pay 100% of an employee’s deductible and co-insurance payments. We also offer employees an annual bonus plan and a 401(k)-retirement plan with a company match. All employees are awarded new hire equity and annual equity as well as the opportunity to participate in our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Our 2020 annualized voluntary turnover rate was 4.93%. None of our employees are represented by a labor union and we consider our employee relations to be good.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented changes in our business in March 2020 in an effort to protect our employees, and to support appropriate health and safety protocols. In particular, we closed our principal executive office with our administrative employees continuing their work remotely and limited the number of staff in any given research and development laboratory.

RISK FACTORS SUMMARY
Investing in our common stock involves various risks. You should carefully read and consider the matters discussed in this Annual Report under the heading “Risk Factors,” which include the following risks: 
•We are a development-stage company and have incurred significant losses since our inception. We expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or maintain profitability.
•We will need substantial additional funding in order to complete development of our product candidates and commercialize our products, if approved.
•The terms of our credit facility place restrictions on our operating and financial flexibility.
•Our product candidates are based on our ImmTOR platform, which is an unproven approach designed to induce antigen-specific immune tolerance to biologic drugs.
•Regulatory authorities in the United States and European Union have limited experience in reviewing and approving gene therapy products.
•Clinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process, with an uncertain outcome.
•The outbreak of COVID-19 may continue to adversely impact our business, including sourcing raw materials and supplies to produce our product candidates, our preclinical studies and clinical trials.
•We rely on 3SBio in China as our primary supplier of pegadricase and on other third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, and expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future.
•We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to conduct our clinical trials, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including by failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such trials.
•If we or our licensors are unable to adequately protect our proprietary technology, or obtain and maintain issued patents that are sufficient to protect our product candidates, others could compete against us more directly, which would negatively impact our business.
•We may not have the funds necessary to fulfill our obligation to repurchase certain warrants.
•We are involved in two securities class action lawsuits.
