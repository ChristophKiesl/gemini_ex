Item 1.    BUSINESS
Description of Business
Tredegar Corporation (“Tredegar”) is engaged, through its subsidiaries, in the manufacture of aluminum extrusions, polyethylene (“PE”) plastic films and polyester (“PET”) films. Unless the context requires otherwise, all references herein to “Tredegar,” “the Company,” “we,” “us” or “our” are to Tredegar Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
The Company's reportable business segments are Aluminum Extrusions, PE Films and Flexible Packaging Films.
On October 30, 2020, the Company completed the sale of its personal care films business (“Personal Care Films”). The transaction excluded the packaging film lines and related operations located at the Pottsville, Pennsylvania manufacturing site (“Pottsville Packaging”), which are now being reported within the Surface Protection component of PE Films. Commencing in the third quarter of 2020, all historical results for Personal Care Films have been presented as discontinued operations. 
In December 2020, the Company entered into a definitive agreement and completed the sale of Bright View Technologies (“Bright View”). The sale does not represent a strategic shift nor does it have a major effect on the Company’s historical and ongoing operations, thus all financial information for Bright View has been presented as continuing operations. Bright View historically has been reported in the PE Films segment.
For more information on these transactions, see Note 2 “Discontinued Operations” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15. “Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules” of this Form 10-K (“Item 15”).

Flexible Packaging Films produces PET-based films for use in packaging applications that have specialized properties, such as heat resistance, strength, barrier protection and the ability to accept high-quality print graphics. These differentiated, high-value films are primarily manufactured in Brazil and sold in Latin America and the U.S. under the Terphane® and Sealphane® brand names. Major end uses include food packaging and industrial applications. Flexible Packaging Films competes in all of its markets on the basis of product quality, service and price.

Flexible Packaging Films also purchases additional polyester resins directly from suppliers. These raw materials are obtained from Brazilian and foreign suppliers at competitive prices. Flexible Packaging Films believes that there will be an adequate supply of polyester resins, PTA and MEG in the foreseeable future. 
General
Intellectual Property. Tredegar considers patents, licenses and trademarks to be material to PE Films. On December 31, 2020, PE Films held 54 patents (including 4 U.S. patents), and 82 registered trademarks (including 4 U.S. registered trademarks). Flexible Packaging Films held 1 U.S. patent and 15 registered trademarks (including 2 U.S. registered trademarks). Aluminum Extrusions held no U.S. patents and 4 U.S. registered trademarks. As of December 31, 2020, these patents had remaining terms of 3.5 to 15.5 years. 
Research and Development. Tredegar’s spending for research and development (“R&D”) activities in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was primarily related to PE Films. R&D spending by the Company was approximately $8.4 million, $7.9 million and $6.7 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 
Backlog. Overall backlog in Aluminum Extrusions was approximately $74.2 million at December 31, 2020 compared to approximately $52.8 million at December 31, 2019, an increase of $21.4 million, or approximately 41%. Backlogs are not material to the operations in PE Films or Flexible Packaging Films. Net sales for Aluminum Extrusions, which the Company believes are cyclical in nature, were $455.7 million in 2020, $529.6 million in 2019 and $573.1 million in 2018. 
Government Regulation. The Company’s operations are subject to various local, state, federal and foreign government regulations, including environmental, privacy and anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and regulations.
U.S. laws concerning the environment to which the Company’s domestic operations are or may be subject to include the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), regulations promulgated under these acts, and other federal, state or local laws or regulations governing environmental matters. Compliance with these laws is an important consideration because Tredegar uses hazardous materials in some of its operations, is a generator of hazardous waste, and wastewater from the Company’s operations is discharged to various types of wastewater management systems. Under CERCLA and other laws, Tredegar may be subject to financial exposure for costs associated with waste management and disposal, even if the Company fully complies with applicable environmental laws.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has adopted regulations under the Clean Air Act relating to emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (“GHG”), including mandatory reporting and permitting requirements. Several of the Company’s manufacturing operations result in emissions of carbon dioxide or GHG and are subject to the current GHG regulations. The Company’s compliance with these regulations has yet to require significant capital expenditures; however, environmental standards tend to become more stringent over time. Therefore, in order to comply with current or future environmental legislation or regulations, the Company may be subject to additional capital expenditures, operating expenses or other compliance costs, the amounts and timing of which are not presently determinable but which could be significant, including constructing new facilities or modifying existing facilities.
For further discussion regarding certain privacy and anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and regulations to which the Company is subject, see Item 1A. Risk Factors below. Like environmental regulations, current or future privacy and anti-corruption and anti-bribery legislation or regulations may subject the Company to additional capital expenditures, operating expenses or other compliance costs, the amounts and timing of which are not presently determinable but could be significant. Finally, any failure to comply with current or future laws and regulations could subject Tredegar to substantial penalties, fines, costs and expenses.
Human Capital Management.  Tredegar employed approximately 2,400 people at December 31, 2020 located in the U.S., Brazil, and Asia. Approximately 34% of the Company’s employees are represented by labor unions located in the U.S. and Brazil under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates. Generally, the total number of employees of Tredegar does not significantly fluctuate throughout the year. However, acquisition or divestiture activity, or changes in the level of business activity may impact employee levels. 
The Company believes its employees are its most valuable asset and are critical to the success of the Company. Tredegar strictly complies with all applicable state, local and international laws governing nondiscrimination in employment in every location where Tredegar and its businesses have facilities to ensure healthy and positive working conditions. This applies to all terms and conditions of employment, including recruiting, hiring, job assignments, promotion, termination, layoff, recall, transfer, leaves of absence, compensation and training. All applicants and employees are treated with the same high level of respect regardless of their race, creed, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, pregnancy, national origin, ethnicity, political affiliation, union membership, marital status, citizenship status, veteran status, disability or other protected category. Employees who experience or witness discriminatory behavior are encouraged to report such behavior to their supervisor, Human Resources or Tredegar’s toll-free anonymous reporting hotline. Additionally, the Company spends significant resources in developing its employees. Among the five core principles of the “The Tredegar Way” that the Company uses to guide its organization, the “Leadership” principle is focused on building a team of motivated and engaged leaders at every level of the Company. Each business unit has identified specific action plans to promote the Leadership 
principle among its employees. Action plans include talent development, skills training, reinforcement of strong cultural values, and robust systems to ensure a safe working environment.
The Company seeks to retain employees by offering competitive wages, benefits and training opportunities. To assess and monitor employee retention and engagement, the Company surveys employees and takes actions to address areas of employee concern. The annual employee engagement survey results are presented to Tredegar’s Board of Directors (“Board”). Additionally, the objectives of our executive compensation programs are to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified executive officers. To accomplish these objectives, we rely on a pay strategy that emphasizes performance-based compensation through annual and long-term incentives. We believe that this pay strategy creates a strong link between pay and performance and aligns with our business strategy of generating strong operating results and shareholder value creation while controlling fixed costs. 
We are committed to holistically supporting our employees both at work and in their communities by:
•Strictly following all applicable health, safety and non-discrimination laws in each country;
•Promoting the highest standards for employee health and safety through innovative programs; and 
•Providing opportunities for community outreach and supporting programs that enhance the lives of children and families.
The Company uses various forms of employee safety metrics to assess the health and safety performance of its Aluminum Extrusions, PE Films and Flexible Packaging operations, including employee safety data which is available on its website at https://tredegar.com/about-tredegar/committed-to-our-employees. Tredegar has also instituted additional safety precautions during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic as described in "The Impact of COVID-19" included in Item 7. "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this Form 10-K (“Item 7”).
