ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview

Weyland Techs CreateApp platform enables small-medium-sized businesses ("SMBs") to create a mobile application ("app") without the need of technical knowledge, high investment or background in IT.

We believe that SMB's can increase sales, reach more customers and promote their products and services via a simple easy to build mobile app at an affordable price and in a cost-effective manner.

The Company is currently in application stage with the NASDAQ Market for approval to have its shares traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market. It is anticipated, though not certain, that this process should be completed within the calendar year 2017.

Our corporate headquarters are located at 198 Wellington Street, 8/F The Wellington, Central, Hong Kong HKSAR. Although we maintain a website at www.weyland-tech.com, we do not intend that information available on our website be incorporated into this filing.

Our Strategy

Although Weyland Tech's CreateApp platform originally focused on the Pan-Asia marketsthe platform is provided in twelve, predominantly Asian, languageswe have partners that work with us to develop the EU and North American markets. 

The CreateApp platform enables SMBs to create a mobile application ("app") without the need of technical knowledge, high investment or background in IT.

We believe that through our app, SMBs can increase sales, reach more customers and promote their products and services via a simple easy to build mobile app at an affordable and cost-effective manner.

Weyland Tech currently offers the CreateApp platform directly, in the following key markets:

Singapore: www.createappsingapore.com

India (Jaipur): www.aapkiapp.in

Weyland Tech currently offers a DIY App builder through a 'white label' platform, in the following markets, primarily via strategic Cooperation agreements that were structured in late 2015 and early 2016:




 Malaysia, via a Strategic Cooperation agreement with Silver Ridge Tangerine Sdn Bhd (www.silverridge.com.my)


 Hong Kong and South China via a Strategic Cooperation agreement with Info Zone Ltd.



SMBs

The Company believes that these agreements will create a large enough addressable market opportunity to generate sales and profits in a scalable manner, grow the Company's business and enhance shareholder value.

Given the nature of DIY mobile apps ("apps"), and the primary target market of SMBs, a typical go-to-market strategy would have direct sales force or resellers approach SMBs directly to drive license sales.

Over the past year, the Company has evolved this model with two distinct market paths to drive recurring revenue sales:

A) Strategic Cooperation agreements in countries/regions where our partners are responsible for targeting SMBs either through an installed base of customers or groups of Direct Sellers with a sales force encompassing SMBs as end customers.

B) Enterprise Solutions where large retailers (hypermarket chains, mall owners, brand owners with company-owned and franchise stores) adopt a 'Master App' on a white-label basis, hosted at a 3rd party regional Hosting or Data Center facility.

With the above strategy, we believe that the Company has been able to maintain a lower capital expenditure base due to the 'level-two' customer support vs. 'level-one' customer support, smaller sales and marketing teams, and the need to provide hosting services.

In addition to the previously announced cooperation agreements this year, the Company is currently in late stage discussions and negotiations with a number of strategic business partners and enterprise-sized customers, including major regional and country telecommunications providers, Fortune 500 retailers and 'affiliate' groups.

Specific terms of the relationships and agreements will remain confidential for competitive reasons. However, agreements are expected to continue to support a transition from a licensing model to a multi-year model with subscriptions, m-commerce revenue sharing and advertising revenues.

Growth of the Mobile Apps Industry

We believe that there are a number of factors that are contributing to the continued growth of the mobile apps industry: (i) smartphone adoption continues to increase globally; (ii) lower purchase prices of smartphones for consumers; (iii) smartphone users are becoming increasingly comfortable with the process of searching for and conducting business on their phones; (iv) SMBs are placing more emphasis on implementing a mobile app versus a mobile website to enable customers to gain a higher level of interaction and functionality; and (v) internet users in emerging markets use smartphones as their primary internet access device, having bypassed the desktop PC entirely. We believe that the Company will be able to participate in the growth of the mobile apps industry by offering an affordable, easy to build and use platform.
Competition

Our business is rapidly evolving and highly competitive. Our current and potential competitors include: (1) Advertising companies, Web design firms and more recently, mobile app makers; (2) other DIY mobile app companies; (3) a number of indirect competitors, including media companies, web portals, comparison shopping websites, and web search engines, either directly or in collaboration with SMBs; (4) companies that provide e-commerce services, including website/app development.; (5) companies that provide infrastructure web and mobile services. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our mobile apps business include ease of use, affordability and broad range of functionality. Many of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, slightly longer histories, more customers, and greater brand recognition. They may adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to technology, functionality and ease of use and marketing. Other companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions.
Employees

The Company currently has twelve full-time employees in Singapore, Hong Kong and Jaipur, India. Our software development partner in Jaipur has 200 developers on staff to assist with technical, customer support, integration and engineering tasks.
Transfer Agent

We have engaged Nevada Agency and Trust Company as our stock transfer agent. Nevada Agency and Trust Company is located at 50 West Liberty Street, Reno, Nevada 89501. Phone: (775) 332-0626.
