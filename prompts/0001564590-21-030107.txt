ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview
 NextGen Healthcare is a leading provider of software and services that empower ambulatory healthcare practices to manage the risk and complexity of delivering care in the rapidly evolving U.S. healthcare system. Our combination of technological breadth, depth and domain expertise makes us a preferred solution provider and trusted advisor for our clients. In addition to highly configurable core clinical and financial capabilities, our portfolio includes tightly integrated solutions that deliver on ambulatory healthcare imperatives including: population health, care management, patient outreach, telemedicine, and nationwide clinical information exchange. 
 We serve clients across all 50 states. Over 100,000 providers use NextGen Healthcare solutions to deliver care in nearly every medical specialty in a wide variety of practice models including accountable care organizations (“ACOs”), independent physician associations (“IPAs”), managed service organizations (“MSOs”), Veterans Service Organizations (“VSOs”), and Dental Service Organizations (“DSOs”). Our clients include some of the largest and most progressive multi-specialty groups in the country. With the addition of behavioral health to our medical and oral health capabilities, we continue to extend our share not only in Federally Qualified Health Centers (“FQHCs”), but also in the growing integrated care market. 
 NextGen Healthcare has historically enhanced our offering through both organic and inorganic activities. In October 2015, we divested our former Hospital Solutions division to focus exclusively on the ambulatory marketplace. In January 2016, we acquired HealthFusion Holdings, Inc. and its cloud-based electronic health record and practice management solution. In April 2017, we acquired Entrada, Inc. and its cloud-based, mobile platform for clinical documentation and collaboration. In August 2017, we acquired EagleDream Health, Inc. and its cloud-based population health analytics solution. In January 2018, we acquired Inforth Technologies for its specialty-focused clinical content. In October 2019, we acquired Topaz Information Systems, LLC for its behavioral health solutions. In December 2019, we acquired Medfusion, Inc. for its Patient Experience Platform (i.e., patient portal, self-scheduling, and patient pay) capabilities and OTTO Health, LLC for its integrated virtual care solutions, notably telemedicine. The integration of these acquired technologies has made NextGen Healthcare’s solutions among the most comprehensive in the market. 
 Our company was incorporated in California in 1974. Previously named Quality Systems, Inc., we changed our corporate name to NextGen Healthcare, Inc. in September 2018. Our principal executive offices are located at 3525 Piedmont Rd., NE, Building 6, Suite 700, Atlanta, Georgia, and our principal website is www.nextgen.com. We operate on a fiscal year ending on March 31.
 Industry and Regulatory Background, Market Opportunity, and Trends
 Over the last decade, the ambulatory healthcare market has experienced significant regulatory change, which has driven the need for improved technology to enable practice transformation. Recognizing it was imperative to digitize the U.S. health system to stem the escalating cost of healthcare and improve the quality of care being delivered, Congress enacted the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act in 2009 (“HITECH Act”). The legislation stimulated healthcare organizations to not only adopt electronic health records, but to use them to collect discrete data that could be used to drive quality care. This standardization supported early pay-for-reporting and pay-for-performance programs. 
 In 2010, the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) established the roadmap for shifting American healthcare from volume (fee-for-service) to a value-based care (“VBC”) system that rewards improved outcomes at lower costs (fee-for-value). This was followed by the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (“MACRA”), bipartisan legislation that further changed the way Medicare rewards clinicians for value vs. volume. Initially focused on government-funded care, the domain of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), these programs are now firmly established on the commercial insurance side of the industry as well.
 Importantly, the introduction of VBC programs was only an element of the broader approach to reducing healthcare expenditure. The drive to reduce costs initially led to consolidation in the healthcare system that was followed by a significant shift of care from the inpatient to lower cost outpatient setting. Among other factors, consumerism is set to play a major role in driving volume increases outside of the hospital. In addition, providers continue to seek new tools and means to connect with patients in new ways. Patients are expecting care to be personalized and tailored to their preferences and are seeking much greater transparency about the costs for visits, medications, and procedures as well as improved convenience and access to care. Along with the continued expansion of telehealth, there will be growth in technologies which facilitate the digital connection between patient and provider.
 The need to sustain revenue has made it extremely important for practices to secure their patient market share, elevating patient loyalty to a significant determinant of provider success. In addition to being loyal, groups participating in value-based contracts realized that patients also needed to be engaged in their care and interested in improving their own health. The need to attract, retain and engage patients has made patient experience one of the most important aspects of evolving care delivery in the United States. Capturing patient market share and thriving in a market driven by VBC requires both an integrated platform and a full view of the patient population’s clinical and cost data, neither of which could be accomplished without new technologies to collect and analyze multi-sourced patient data. Effectively implemented, these new technologies allow

organizations to enhance financial viability while exercising the freedom to join, affiliate, integrate or interoperate in ways that maximize strategic control.
 Although the HITECH Act led to the meaningful adoption of electronic health records, many in the healthcare industry were dissatisfied with the level of exchange of health information between different providers and across different software platforms. With the passing of the MACRA law in 2015, the U.S. Congress declared it a national objective to achieve widespread exchange of health information through interoperable certified electronic health records (“EHR") technology. Then, in December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act (“Cures Act”) was passed and signed into law. Among many other policies, the law includes numerous provisions intended to encourage nationwide interoperability. 
 In January 2020, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) officially declared that a public health emergency (“PHE”) existed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Then, in March and April 2020, HHS issued a series of rules and orders to offer healthcare providers flexibility or waivers from certain regulatory requirements during the PHE.   
 Among other changes, HHS and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) eliminated the patient geographic and originating site restrictions for Medicare telehealth services that outside of the PHE restrict the services to patients in rural geographic areas who are physically present at a healthcare facility at the time of service.  Other flexibilities authorized CMS to reimburse telehealth visits at the same payment rates as in-person office visits during the PHE.  State Medicaid programs and commercial insurers instituted similar policies to promote virtual visits as an alternative to in-person care during the pandemic.  
 Now, looking beyond the eventual end of the PHE, Congress is considering legislation that would make some of these temporary telehealth policies permanent. In April 2021, bipartisan legislation was introduced in both the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate that would permanently expand Medicare’s telehealth services program to all geographies and allow patients to receive services from their homes.
 In March 2020, the HHS Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (“ONC”) released a final regulation which implements the key interoperability provisions included in the Cures Act. The rule calls on developers of certified EHRs to adopt standardized application programming interfaces (“APIs”) and to meet a list of other new certification and maintenance of certification requirements in order to retain approved federal government certification status.
 The ONC rule also implements the information blocking provisions of the Cures Act, including identifying reasonable and necessary activities that do not constitute information blocking. Under the Cures Act, HHS has the regulatory authority to investigate and assess civil monetary penalties of up to $1,000,000 against certified HIT developers found to be in violation of “information blocking.”
 The $2.2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act ("CARES Act”) was signed into law in late March 2020.  While this law created the “Paycheck Protection Program” for small businesses, which would include many physician groups, the CARES Act also increased funding for the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund by $127 billion, with $100 billion of that earmarked to reimburse eligible hospitals and healthcare providers for healthcare-related expenses or lost revenues not otherwise reimbursed that are directly attributable to COVID-19. The law also provided $1.32 billion in supplemental funding to community health centers.
 The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 was passed by Congress and signed into law in December 2020. This $2.3 trillion legislative package combines the $1.4 trillion fiscal year 2021 appropriations bills with a $900 billion coronavirus aid package. The law adds $3 billion in additional funding for HHS’s Provider Relief Fund, which was established by the CARES Act (March 2020) and previously funded with $175 billion to reimburse providers for healthcare related expenses and lost revenue attributable to the pandemic. The law also provides a three-year extension (federal fiscal years 2021, 2022, 2023) of federal grant funding for community health centers and provides $4.25 billion in supplemental grant funding for substance abuse disorder, mental health, and behavioral health programs run by HHS’s Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (“SAMHSA”).  Support for telehealth services was included through provisions that permanently remove Medicare’s patient geographic and site limitations and an appropriation of $250 million for the Federal Communications Commission’s (“FCC’s”) COVID-19 Telehealth Program, which grants non-profit healthcare providers financial support to implement telehealth solutions.
 In March 2021, President Joe Biden signed into law the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act. This legislation includes additional coronavirus-related relief measures and is the latest in a series of pandemic-related aid legislation enacted since March 2020. Among other provisions, this law provides $7.6 billion in supplemental federal grant funding for FQHCs. As a comparison, the CARES Act provided $1.3 billion in supplemental federal grant funding for FQHCs. In addition, this law provides $3.5 billion in funding for block grant programs that address mental health and substance use disorders and are administered by HHS’s SAMHSA.  
 The new regulations will require significant compliance efforts for not only HIT companies, networks, and exchanges, but also for healthcare providers. However, the Cures Act also creates opportunities for improving care delivery and outcomes through increased data exchange between providers and easier patient access to their own health information. Key to unlocking these benefits is the introduction of new Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (“FHIR”) standards, which ONC requires certified HIT companies to adopt through APIs. Meanwhile, CMS is requiring hospitals to provide electronic admission, discharge and transfer notification to other healthcare facilities, providers and designated care team members. All healthcare providers are required to comply with the information blocking rules as of the initial April 5, 2021 compliance date.  As of December 31, 2022, providers participating in federal programs that require the use of certified HIT will need to use the new “2015 Edition 
 5


Cures Update” certified version of EHR software to comply with the Cures Act certification requirements. Through enhanced interoperability functionality and standardized APIs, the Spring ‘21 release of NextGen® Enterprise will help healthcare providers meet these dual mandates included in the Cures Act.
 Refer also to the discussion of regulatory risks within “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for governmental regulations and policies that may affect our business.
 Through the expansion of our NextGen® Share interoperability services platform and API partner marketplace, we will address the increased demand for moving and sharing patient data from the EHR easily, quickly and securely. Interoperability improves patient experience and care coordination, enhances patient safety, and reduces costs. We are also expanding resources such as educational webinars, blogs and videos on interoperability to help educate and support healthcare providers.
 In recent years, there has been incremental investment to improve the delivery of behavioral healthcare. One of the central drivers of this investment has been the opioid epidemic which claims more than 80,000 lives a year in the United States. The integrated care model prevalent in FQHCs, a model which calls for integration of behavioral health and primary care in single care settings, has also gained momentum. Both behavioral health and the integrated care workflows require broad, purpose built, tailored HIT capabilities, many of which are supported by the NextGen Healthcare platform. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, ambulatory practices have come to appreciate the importance of business continuity, particularly in administrative business functions which are non-core to medical care and may turn to NextGen Healthcare more often for managed services. 
 COVID-19 Pandemic
 In late 2019, the emergence of a novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, was reported and in January 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”), declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. In March 2020, the WHO escalated COVID-19 as a pandemic. We proactively responded to the pandemic by creating an executive task force to monitor the COVID-19 situation daily and immediately restricted non-essential travel and migrated to a fully remote workforce while maintaining complete operational effectiveness. 
 The need to access care while still social distancing was addressed early on with the limited use of telemedicine (also known as virtual visits) and was energized when the federal government reduced regulatory barriers and addressed payment parity between virtual and in-person visits. With these tailwinds, telemedicine quickly became regarded as a safer way for patients and providers to engage each other while also relieving economic pressure on the medical practice. We believe that the uptake of telemedicine will transcend COVID-19 and that virtual visits will become a permanent and important change in the way care is delivered. Keeping patients out of the transit system, out of the waiting room and away from other sick patients is simply good medicine.
 Since the mid-March 2020 timing of government orders to shelter in place and restrict non-essential medical services, the COVID-19 pandemic caused declines in patient volume. This negatively impacted our revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, most notably for purchases of software and hardware. The impact of the disruption also impacted the first half of fiscal 2021, primarily in managed services and EDI, which are volume driven. During this challenging and uncertain period, we made some important decisions, including cost reduction activities with a primary goal of preserving cash and protecting the employee base. Most of these cost reductions were temporary as we believed that preserving our employee base, organizational momentum, and robust capabilities was the right decision for the Company and our shareholders. As the impact of the pandemic and related restrictive measures began to subside in the second half of fiscal 2021, patient volume has returned to close to pre-pandemic levels, and thus revenue returned to more normal levels. At present, we are conducting business as usual with certain modifications to employee travel, employee work locations, and marketing events, among other modifications. We continue to monitor the broader implications of the global COVID-19 pandemic and may take further actions that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers, and shareholders. 
 Our Strategy
 We empower the transformation of ambulatory care by delivering solutions that enable groups to be successful under all models of care, including emerging value-based care models that include down-side risk.

Client Service and Support – Our technical services staff provides support for the dependable and timely resolution of technical inquiries from clients. Such inquiries are made via telephone, email and the internet. We offer several levels of support, with the most comprehensive service covering 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
Proprietary Rights 
 We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets, and contractual restrictions to establish and protect proprietary rights in our products and services. To protect our proprietary rights, we enter into confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees with whom such controls are relevant. In addition, we include intellectual property protective provisions in our client and other third-party contracts and control access to software, documentation and other proprietary information. However, because the software industry is characterized by rapid technological change, we believe such factors as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, new product developments, frequent product enhancements, name recognition, and reliable product maintenance are more important to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position than the various legal protections of our technology.
 We rely on intellectual property obtained from third parties for certain components of our products and services. These components enhance our products and services and help meet evolving client needs. The failure to license any necessary technology, or to maintain our existing licenses, could result in reduced functionality of or reduced demand for our products.
 Although we believe our products and services, and other proprietary rights, do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties, third parties may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us in the future. Any such claims may result in costly, time-consuming litigation and may require us to enter into royalty or cross-license arrangements.
 Competition
 The markets for healthcare information systems and services are intensely competitive and highly fragmented. Our traditional full-suite competitors in the healthcare information systems and services market include: Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc., athenahealth, Inc., Cerner Corporation, eClinicalWorks, Epic Systems Corporation, and Greenway Health, LLC. Emerging smaller competitors also bring competition in specific sectors of the market. Additionally, we face competition from services-only competitors like business process outsourcers, hosting providers and transcription companies. 
 The EHR, PM, interoperability, and connectivity markets, in particular, are subject to rapid changes in technology. We expect that competition in these market segments could increase as new competitors enter the market. We believe our principal competitive advantages are our ambulatory-only focus, our comprehensive and fully-integrated solution, and our deep domain expertise, which enables our subject matter experts to serve as trusted advisors to our clients.
 Privacy and Security
 Our business operations involve hosting, storing, processing and transmitting confidential information including patient health information and payment card information. In addition to single-tenant environments, we operate unified, multi-tenant platforms that offer reliability, scalability, performance, security and privacy for our clients. Our infrastructure resides in several geographically diverse regions across the United States. We maintain a comprehensive security program designed to help safeguard the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our clients’ data, which includes both organizational and technical control measures and the security and privacy of our service offerings. We also have systems in place to monitor the safety of patient information as well as procedures designed to take immediate action in the event of a security incident.
 We have the industry’s most well-respected certifications starting with Health Information Trust Alliance (“HITRUST”) Common Security Framework (“CSF”), which provides a process to standardize Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) compliance and coordinate it with other national and international data security frameworks and many state laws. We also maintain Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI-DSS”) Level 1 Service Provider, which allows us to minimize our clients’ PCI scope. In addition, we are a DirectTrust Health Information Service Provider (“HISP”) while maintaining compliance with Security Organization Control 2, or SOC 2 Type II, across the domains of Privacy, Security, Confidentiality, and Availability. These audits and certifications help with our client’s third-party assurance programs to ensure we are meeting or exceeding HIPAA and other regulatory guidelines.
 While we have implemented physical, technical, and administrative safeguards designed to help protect our systems, in the event of a system interruption, security incident, or breach, these safeguards may not prevent future cybersecurity incidents or breaches. We have a comprehensive and documented Information Security Management Program designed to secure the data within our infrastructure and provide appropriate reporting disclosure, and response which also includes testing for assurance. In addition, all of our associates are required to complete annual cybersecurity training, HIPAA training, and PCI DSS training. These training modules are reviewed annually to ensure compliance with the latest regulatory guidelines, laws, and industry best practices. All policies and procedures are made available to all employees through a Company intranet, and acknowledgement of these is required at time of hire. Our Privacy Policy is made available for our customers on a public facing website.

Managing Cybersecurity Risks
 Our business operations involve hosting, storing, processing and transmitting confidential information including patient health information. We have implemented physical, technical, and administrative safeguards designed to help protect our systems, in the event of a system interruption, security incident, or breach. However, these safeguards may not prevent future cybersecurity incidents or breaches. We have a comprehensive and documented Information Security Management Program designed to secure the data within our infrastructure and provide appropriate reporting disclosure, and response. Some incidents require us to notify our clients, executive team, and our Board of Directors. This notification process is documented and tested.
 We have a comprehensive training and awareness program which includes on-going awareness simulations, required training, supplemental training and cross-functional incident response testing. In addition, all of our associates are required to complete annual cybersecurity training, HIPAA training, and PCI DSS training. These training modules are reviewed annually to ensure compliance with the latest regulatory guidelines, laws, and industry best practices. Training modules include information on how our associates can ensure they are meeting our security requirements while working in a remote environment.
 Risk assessment is the component of our internal control environment that involves identifying and analyzing risks (both internal and external) relevant to achieving business objectives. We have implemented operational processes to identify and manage risks that could affect our availability to provide reliable services. These processes require management to identify significant risks inherent in providing services for clients and to implement appropriate measures to monitor and manage these risks. Annually, we re-evaluate and determine appropriate amounts of cybersecurity insurance required based on business and privacy impact assessments. A bona fide annual risk assessment, per HIPAA guidelines, is performed and validated by a third‐party company. The third‐party assessor conducts interviews with key stakeholders and performs penetration testing, evidence collection and on‐site analysis. Formal rating systems determine if remediation strategies are warranted, and if so, a remediation plan is enacted. This report is reviewed and approved by the Chief Information Security Office (“CISO”) and reported to the appropriate upper management and Board of Directors. Meetings are conducted by the information systems team weekly to review and identify risks through the change management process. Meetings are held to ensure that projects, risks, compliance, federal regulations and personnel are in line with Company goals regarding security and compliance. Continuity and resiliency planning are based on National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) cybersecurity best practices and tested no less than annually.
 A comprehensive assurance program is maintained with oversight by our CISO, which is included with the company procurement gating process.  Administrative and technical assessments are conducted prior to contract signing with any third-party.  On-going risk-based reviews are conducted and reported to executive leadership. The Company’s control consciousness is influenced significantly by its Board of Directors and Audit Committee. While the management of our business is delegated to the management team, the Board of Directors oversees management’s execution of the Company’s business activities. 
 Research and Development
 The healthcare information systems and services industry is characterized by rapid technological change, requiring us to engage in continuing investments in our research and development to update, enhance and improve our systems. This includes expansion of our software and service offerings that support pay-for-performance and value-based contracting initiatives around accountable care organizations, bringing greater ease of use and intuitiveness to our software products, enhancing our managed cloud and hosting services to lower our clients' total cost of ownership, expanding our interoperability and enterprise analytics capabilities, and furthering development and enhancements of our portfolio of specialty-focused templates within our electronic health records software. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 We sell and market our products primarily through a direct sales force and to a significantly lesser extent, through a reseller channel. NextGen Healthcare also provides solutions to networks of practices such as MSOs, IPAs, ACOs, ambulatory care centers (“ACCs”), and community health centers (“CHCs”). Our direct sales force is comprised of sales executives and account executives, who seek to understand the client strategy and identify the opportunities in their practice and build both a multistage roadmap to reach the desired end state. For large clients, we use both inside and outside sales where efforts are a mix of on-site as well as web based. For smaller clients, efforts are all inside sales via web and phone, all of whom deliver presentations to potential clients by demonstrating our systems and capabilities either on prospective client’s premises or through video meeting and web-based presentations. System demonstrations for mobile workflow and analytics solutions are more web-based as these offerings tend to be targeted to larger practices. Both the direct and reseller channel salesforces concentrate on multi-product/solution sales opportunities. Our sales and marketing employees identify prospective clients through a variety of means, including: a healthcare data and analytics platform, search engine optimization and value exchange content on nextgen.com; digital advertising; direct mail and email campaigns; referrals from existing clients and industry consultants; contacts at professional society meetings and trade shows (online and in person); webinars; public relations and social media campaigns; and telemarketing. Resources have shifted more heavily to digital marketing as we meet potential clients where they are and how they shop for services. Additionally, we focus on thought leadership and content marketing to highlight our industry knowledge, expertise and the successes of our diverse client base. On the larger end of the range, our sales cycle can vary significantly and typically ranges from six to 18 months from initial contact to contract

execution. Smaller practices on NextGen Office tend to have significantly shorter sales cycles ranging in weeks. Historically, software licenses were delivered to clients upon receipt of an order and we received up-front licensing fees. Implementation and training services are typically rendered based on a mutually agreed upon timetable. Moving forward, we expect more of our transactions to move to subscriptions. Clients have the option to purchase hosting and maintenance services, which are invoiced on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis. Subscriptions are delivered electronically after the agreement is signed. They generally include implementation and are typically billed monthly after implementation or based on volume or throughput. We continue to concentrate our direct sales and marketing efforts on the ambulatory market from large multi-specialty organizations to small-single specialty practices in high-opportunity specialty segments. 
 We have numerous clients and do not believe that the loss of any single client would adversely affect us. No client accounted for 10% or more of our net revenue during each of the years ended March 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. In addition, software license sales to resellers represented less than 10% of total revenue for each of the years ended March 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Substantially all of our clients are located in the United States.
 Human Capital
 Workforce Statistics

None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement or are represented by a labor union.
Talent Recruitment 
 We recognize and value our employees as unique contributors through their entire journey at NextGen Healthcare. As such, we have a thoughtful and tailored approach to attracting, developing and retaining talent. We seek highly qualified applicants from a variety of sources with an increased focus on recruiting diverse talent. To ensure transparency and with a desire to mitigate bias, we conduct panel and round robin interviews for hiring and promotion. Discover NextGen, our adventure-based onboarding experience, provides a deep and broad picture of the organization with recognition that employees’ first few weeks on the job potentially cement their commitment to the company and culture.
Talent Retention and Development 
 We provide a career framework for our employees enabling their career development either within a single career track or through the ability to traverse multiple career ladders as they refine or optimize their development. Our Talent Community connects interested employees with internal functional subject matter experts to share job information including knowledge and skills required for advancement. We are committed to developing our employees through a culture of learning. We maintain an organizational development group focused on all aspects of employee development, including management and leadership through our LEAD framework and skill building. We also sponsor 24/7 on-demand training for employee certifications and relevant career-based skillsets and provide education reimbursement for continued education. 
Diversity 
 We recognize our responsibility and strategic opportunity to champion varied viewpoints, culture and expertise. Our Diversity, Equity & Inclusion strategy includes goals around recruiting, retaining and developing diverse employees and leaders in the Company. Our Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”) focus their efforts on career, culture, market and community. These ERGs include: AAPI (Asian American Pacific Islander), ABLED (Awareness Benefiting Leadership & Employees About Disabilities), beiNG (Black Equity and Inclusion at NextGen), Cultural Diversity, Generational and Allies, LatinX. LGBTQ+, Military/Veterans and Allies, Remote Engagement, Working Parents, and Women-In-Tech. Our ERGs communicate directly with senior leadership through Listening Sessions with our CEO and other C-level executives. We also provide and promote employee training on harassment prevention, cultivating a respectful workplace and elimination of unconscious bias. We regularly engage with our Board of Directors on strategies, participation, and impact of these initiatives. 
Employee Compensation 
 In recognition of the competitive talent landscape, we have a standing subcommittee on Total Rewards. Our comprehensive approach to compensation includes performance-based merit and bonus rewards. Additionally, long term incentives, 401(k) plan and match, and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan round out our reward strategy. To ensure we support pay equity, we conduct compensation analyses semi-annually in alignment with pay equity training for managers.
Culture and Engagement 
 NextGen Healthcare understands the vital importance of engaged employees to create a high potential community. We closely track our engagement and culture scores through an annual VOTE (Voice of The Employee) survey and on a monthly basis through our Employee Experience Monitor. We provide our team members with safe and confidential channels to voice concerns and receive a response and ensure they have access to members of our executive leadership team. Employees receive training on ethics and our code of conduct, including how to make reports on our ethics hotline. Our regularly

scheduled Town Halls with all employees have become a vital part of our culture of community building. Our Board of Directors receive regular updates on employee engagement and satisfaction issues. 
 We believe that supporting community and volunteer service among our employees builds a strong culture and caring leaders. Each year, we sponsor NextGen Days of Caring during which our employees can volunteer for external charitable organizations. Our NextGen Cares program also allows employees to donate vacation time to help colleagues who have experienced natural disaster or tragedy. We also encourage our employees to participate in volunteer activities by providing the benefit of paid time off to volunteer through our Volunteer Time Off program.
 Our Bangalore development center in India, under the leadership of its Corporate Social Responsibility Committee, conducts community relations activities every quarter to advance and support women’s empowerment, improve health, support education and help fight poverty.
 Health & Safety 
 Our health and welfare plans reflect our desire to support our employees in a holistic way. Our healthcare plans are the cornerstone of the program, supplemented with additional insurance, an Employee Assistance Program, and time off plans including PTO, sick leave and parental leave. We also support our employees’ well-being through an integrated online platform that offers a variety of ‘campuses’ such as Family Care, Financial, New Hire, Wellness and Life Events. The campuses provide resources and access to certain programs/benefits relating to childcare, children of aging parents, gym membership, health coaching and more.
 COVID-19 
 Our immediate and most pressing concern regarding the COVID-19 pandemic was and continues to be the safety and well-being of our employees and their families. Commencing in March 2020, we implemented immediate safety measures to protect our employees, including transitioning the vast majority of our employees to remote work and implementing policies and procedures to protect the health and safety of our employees who have continued on-site work. Our virtual business productivity team keeps our employees engaged with resources to help adapt to working remotely, remain productive and avoid burnout. Our business continuity health and safety team regularly share information and guidance on all pandemic updates through our internal health and safety communication channel.
