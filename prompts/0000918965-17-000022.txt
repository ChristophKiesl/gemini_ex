Business Segments
Worldwide Barcode, Networking & Security Segment
The Worldwide Barcode, Networking & Security segment focuses on automatic identification and data capture ("AIDC"), point-of-sale ("POS"), networking, electronic physical security, 3D printing technologies and other specialty technologies. We have business units within this segment in North America, Latin America and Europe. We see adjacencies among these technologies in helping our customers develop solutions, such as with networking products. AIDC and POS products interface with computer systems used to automate the collection, processing and communication of information for commercial and industrial applications, including retail sales, distribution, shipping, inventory control, materials handling, warehouse management and health care applications. Electronic physical security products include identification, access control, video surveillance, intrusion-related and wireless and networking infrastructure products. 3D printing solutions replace and complement traditional methods and reduce the time and cost of designing new products by printing real parts directly from digital input.

See Item 7, "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" below for a discussion of the amount of our net sales contributed by business segment.
Vendors
We provide the products of approximately 500 vendors, including Aruba/HPE, Axis, AudioCodes, Avaya, Barco, Bematech, Brocade/Ruckus Wireless, CenturyLink, Cisco, Comcast Business, Datalogic, Dell, Dialogic, Elo, Epson, Hanwha, Honeywell, HID, Ingenico, Jabra, Level 3, March Networks, Mitel, NCR, Oracle, Panasonic, Plantronics, Polycom, Samsung, ShoreTel, Sony, Spectralink, Toshiba Global Commerce Solutions, Ubiquiti, Unify, Verifone, Verizon, Windstream, XO and Zebra Technologies.

We provide products for many of our key vendors in all of our geographic markets; however, certain vendors only allow distribution to specific geographies. We typically purchase products directly from the vendor on a non-exclusive basis. Our agreements with our vendors generally do not restrict us from selling similar or comparable products manufactured by competitors. We have the flexibility to terminate or curtail sales of one product line in favor of another due to technological change, pricing considerations, product availability, customer demand or vendor distribution policies.
Three vendors, Avaya, Cisco, and Zebra, each constituted more than 10% of our net sales for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017.

• | We have two non-exclusive agreements with Avaya. One agreement covers the distribution of Avaya products in the United States and Latin America, and the other agreement covers distribution of Avaya products in the United Kingdom and portions of continental Europe. Our Avaya agreements each have a one year term that automatically renews for additional one year terms. Either party may terminate upon 180 days' notice for the United States and Latin America agreement and upon 90 days' for the European agreement. 


• | We have three non-exclusive agreements with Cisco. One agreement covers the distribution of Cisco products in the United States for our KBZ business and has a three year term; one agreement covers distribution of Cisco products in the Unites States for the ScanSource business and has a two year term; and one agreement covers distribution of products in Brazil and has a two year term. Each of these agreements must be renewed by written agreement. Either party may terminate the agreement upon 30 days' notice to the other party.

• | We have two non-exclusive agreements with Zebra. One agreement covers sales of Zebra hardware and software products in North and South America, and another agreement covers sales of Zebra hardware and software products in Europe, the Middle East and Africa ("EMEA"). The Zebra agreements each have a one year term that automatically renews for additional one year terms, and either party may terminate the agreement upon 30 days' notice to the other party. 

In addition to the agreements mentioned above, we have written agreements with almost all of our vendors. These agreements generally provide us with non-exclusive distribution rights and often include territorial restrictions that limit the countries in which we can distribute our products. Our agreements are generally short-term, subject to periodic renewal, and provide for termination by either party without cause upon 30 to 120 days' notice. These agreements typically provide us with stock rotation and price protection provisions. Stock rotation rights give us the ability, subject to limitations, to return, for credit, or exchange a portion of the items purchased. Price protection rights enable us to take a credit for declines in inventory value resulting from the vendor's price reductions. Along with our inventory management policies and practices, these provisions are designed to reduce our risk of loss due to slow-moving inventory, vendor price reductions, product updates and obsolescence.
We participate in various rebate, cash discount and cooperative marketing programs offered by our vendors to support expenses associated with selling and marketing the vendors' products. These rebates and purchase discounts are generally influenced by sales volumes and are subject to change.
Our vendors generally warrant the products we sell and allow returns of defective products, including those returned to us by our customers. In three of our product lines, we offer a self-branded warranty program. We purchase contracts from unrelated third parties, generally the original equipment manufacturers, to fulfill any obligation to service or replace defective product claimed on these warranty programs. To maintain customer relations, we also facilitate returns of defective products from our customers by accepting for exchange, with our prior approval, most defective products within 30 days of invoicing. In addition, local laws may in some cases impose warranty obligations on the Company.
Customers
We currently have approximately 34,000 active customers located in the United States, Canada, Latin America and Europe. No single customer accounted for more than 5% of our total net sales for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017. We generally target resellers, including specialty technology VARs, direct marketers, Information Technology ("IT") system integrators and service providers.
Specialty Technology VARs
These customers focus on selling specialty technology products as tailored software or integrated hardware solutions for their end-users’ existing applications. They also incorporate specialty technology products into customized technology solutions for their end-users. Primary industries served by these customers include manufacturing, distribution, health care, pharmaceutical, hospitality, government, convenience, grocery, financial and other retail markets.
Direct Marketers
These customers provide a very broad range of technology brands to business, government, education and healthcare markets. They have strong relationships with end users, and are seeking additional revenue and profit opportunities in specialty technology markets such as AIDC, POS, physical security, or communications.
IT System Integrators
These customers develop computer and networking solutions for their end users’ IT needs. They typically have well-established relationships with end user decision makers and are seeking additional revenue and profit opportunities in technology markets, such as AIDC, POS, physical security or communications.
Service Providers
Service providers focus on providing advanced services that offer customized solutions that bundle data, collaboration, cloud, network and digital telecommunication services for their end-users' needs. They specialize in multi-vendor and multi-discipline

services within various geographies. Sales agents focus on selling telecommunications and cloud services to end-users, ensuring end-users are making informed choices about various services, technologies and cost savings. 
Competition
The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. Competition is based primarily on factors such as price, product availability, speed and accuracy of delivery, effectiveness of sales and marketing programs, credit availability, ability to tailor specific solutions to customer needs, quality and breadth of product lines and services, and availability of technical and product information. Because of price competition, sales margins are constantly under pressure.
Our competitors include local, regional, national and international distributors, as well as hardware vendors that sell directly to resellers and to end users. In addition, our competitors include master resellers that sell to franchisees, third party dealers and end users. Certain current and potential competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we have and may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. Certain smaller, regional competitors, who are specialty two tier or mixed model master resellers, may also be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. Competition has increased for our sales units over the last several years as broad line and other value added distributors have entered into the specialty technology markets. Such competition could also result in price reductions, reduced margins and loss of market share.
In our Worldwide Barcode, Networking & Security segment, we compete with broad-line distributors, such as Ingram Micro, Synnex and Tech Data in most geographic areas, and more specialized security distributors, such as ADI and Anixter. Additionally, we also compete against other smaller, more specialized AIDC and POS distributors, such as Azerty, BlueStar, Jarltech and Nimax. In our Worldwide Communications & Services segment, we compete against broad-line distributors, such as Ingram Micro, Synnex and Tech Data, and more specialized distributors, such as Jenne and Westcon. As we seek to expand our business into other areas closely related to our offerings, we may encounter increased competition from current competitors and/or from new competitors, some of which may be our current customers.
Sales and Electronic Commerce
Our sales department consists primarily of inside sales representatives located in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Belgium, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Poland and Spain. In order to build strong customer relationships, most active customers are assigned to a sales representative. Each sales representative negotiates pricing directly with his or her assigned customers. We also employ business development representatives who are responsible for developing technical expertise within broad product markets, recruiting customers, creating demand, and reviewing overall product and service requirements of our customers. Each sales representative and business development representative receives comprehensive training with respect to the technical characteristics of each vendor’s products. This training is supplemented by frequent product seminars conducted by vendors’ representatives and bi-weekly meetings among product, marketing and sales managers.
Increasingly, customers are relying upon our electronic ordering and information systems as sources for product information, including availability and price. Through our websites, most customers can gain remote access to our information systems to check real-time product availability, see their customized pricing and place orders. Customers can also follow the status of their orders and obtain package tracking details.
Marketing
We market our products and services through a range of channels, including digital campaigns, such as search engine optimization, search engine marketing, content marketing, content automation, e-commerce, social media optimization, email direct marketing, and online product catalogs for each of the North American, European, and Latin American markets. Additional marketing activities include periodic newsletters, management of sales leads, trade shows with hardware/software companies and vendors, and sales promotions. We also organize and operate our own training and certification courses - working closely with top vendors to recruit prospective customers and introduce new applications for the specialty technology products we distribute. We frequently customize our marketing for vendors and customers.
Value-Added Services

Index to Financial Statements

We differentiate the Company by providing our customers and our vendors an array of pre-sale business tools and value-added services, including logistics, financial services, product configuration tools, sales expertise, and technical support. These services allow our customers to gain knowledge on marketing, to gain expertise in selling and negotiation, to improve customer service, to grow their business profitably and to be more cost effective in their business. Our business is enhanced by our ability and our willingness to provide the extra service that keeps both our vendors and our customers satisfied.
Operations
Information Systems
We are in the process of continuing to roll-out a new, global SAP information system designed to replace the current existing systems. This new system is currently operating in North America, most of Europe and Latin America, excluding Brazil. Our information systems (including the new SAP system) are scalable and capable of supporting numerous operational functions including purchasing, receiving, order processing, shipping, inventory management and accounting. Sales representatives rely on the information systems for on-line, real-time information on product pricing, inventory availability and reservation, and order status. Our warehouse operations use bar code technology for receiving and shipping, and automated systems for freight processing and shipment tracking, each of which is integrated with our multiple information systems. The customer service and technical support departments employ the systems for documentation and faster processing of customer inquiries. To ensure that adequate inventory levels are maintained, our buyers depend on the system’s purchasing and receiving functions to track inventory on a continual basis. 
Warehouse and Shipping Strategy
We operate a 741,000 square foot distribution center in Southaven, Mississippi, which is located near the FedEx hub facility in Memphis, Tennessee, and serves primarily all of North America. Our European operations utilize a limited number of distribution centers located in Belgium, France, Germany and the United Kingdom. Warehouses for our Latin American operations are located in Florida, Mexico, Brazil, Colombia and Chile. Our objective is to ship all orders on the same day, using technology to expedite shipments and minimize shipping errors. We offer reduced freight rates and flexible delivery options to minimize a customers’s need for inventory.
Financial Services
Our sales terms are competitive within our specific geographic areas for qualified customers and facilitate various third-party financing options, which include leasing, flooring and other secured financing. We believe this policy reduces the customer’s need to establish multiple credit relationships with a large number of manufacturers.
Employees
As of June 30, 2017, we had over 2,000 employees located in the United States, Canada, Latin America and Europe. We have no organized labor or trade unions in the United States. We consider our employee relations to be good.
Service Marks
We conduct our business under the trade names "ScanSource POS and Barcode," "ScanSource Catalyst," "ScanSource Communications," "ScanSource Services," "ScanSource Networking and Security," "ScanSource KBZ," "ScanSource Europe," "ScanSource Europe Communications," "ScanSource Latin America," "ScanSource de Mexico," "ScanSource Brasil," "ScanSource Imago," "Network1, a ScanSource company," "Intelisys" and "POS Portal."
Certain of our trademarks and service marks are registered, or are in the process of being registered, in the United States and various other countries. We have been issued registrations for the marks including, among others, "ScanSource," "Catalyst Telecom," and "Network1" in countries in our principal markets.   Even though our marks are not registered in every country where we conduct business, in many cases we have acquired rights in those marks because of our continued use of them. These marks do not have value assigned to them and have a designated indefinite life. We do not believe that our operations are dependent upon any of our marks. We also sell products and provide services under various trademarks and service marks to which reference is made in this report that are the property of owners other than the Company.
