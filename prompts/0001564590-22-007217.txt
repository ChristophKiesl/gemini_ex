ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 Zynga Inc. (“Zynga” or “we” or the “Company”) is a global leader in interactive entertainment. We develop, market and operate social games as live services played on mobile platforms (such as Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android), social networking platforms (such as Facebook and Snapchat), Personal Computers (“PCs”), consoles (such as Nintendo Switch) and other platforms. Generally, all of our games are free to play, and we generate substantially all of our revenue through the sale of in-game virtual items (“online game revenue”) and advertising services (“advertising revenue”). We also operate a mobile programmatic advertising and monetization platform.
 We have been a pioneer in social gaming and in making “play” a core activity on mobile devices and social networking platforms. We believe our leadership position in social games is the result of our significant investment in our people, content, brand, technology and infrastructure. Our leadership position in social games is defined by the following:
  
• | Established Portfolio of Social Games. We operate a number of popular social games including CSR Racing 2, Empires & Puzzles, FarmVille, Golf Rival, Merge Dragons!, Merge Magic!, Toon Blast, Toy Blast, Words With Friends and Zynga Poker, as well as our Social Slots, Casual Cards and hyper-casual game portfolios.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Engaged and Global Community of Players. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we had an average of 37 million Mobile DAUs and 184 million Mobile MAUs.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Scalable Technology and Data. We leverage our technology to increase player engagement, including by continually enhancing existing games, and launching and acquiring new games to grow the Zynga portfolio. We believe our scale results in network effects that deliver compelling value to our players, and we are committed to making significant investments to grow our community of players and their engagement and monetization over time. We believe that combining data analytics with creative game design enables us to create a superior player experience.

 Proposed Merger with Take-Two
 On January 9, 2022, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. and two of its wholly-owned subsidiaries (“Take-Two”), pursuant to which, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth therein, Zynga would become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Take-Two (the “Combination”). The Combination is intended to qualify as a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
 The closing of the Combination is subject to certain customary closing conditions, including the approval of both parties' stockholders and required regulatory approvals. For more information, see Note 16 – “Subsequent Events” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein.
 Our Mission & Strengths
 Our mission is to connect the world through games. We pursue that mission in the following ways:
  
• | A galvanizing company vision. We believe that our vision for social gaming distinguishes us from others in the market. Zynga was founded with the simple premise that it is more fun to play games with other people and that social gaming is the best path to the mass market. Our approach is to build games around social features and systems to deliver a higher quality player experience with increased levels of engagement, organic acquisition and long-term retention.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Proven brands in popular genres on a growing platform. We have a highly-diversified portfolio of established brands such as CSR Racing, Empires & Puzzles, FarmVille, Golf Rival, Hit it Rich! Slots, Merge Dragons!, Merge Magic!, Toon Blast, Toy Blast, Words With Friends and Zynga Poker in the categories of Action Strategy, Casual, Invest Express and Social Casino. Mobile gaming is the largest and fastest growing gaming platform, and we are committed to leveraging our experience in live services to grow our existing portfolio of games and introduce new titles based on owned and licensed intellectual properties.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Talented teams and strong analytics. We have passionate teams of people focused on developing new games and increasing the effectiveness and predictability of our live games through our strategy of releasing innovative bold beats – new content and game play modes that engage and attract current, lapsed and new audiences. Our teams balance the art and science of game making by combining creative innovation with a player-centric, data driven approach to surprise and delight players. Our talented teams combined with our proprietary tools and technologies comprise our highly scalable live services platform, which includes product management, data science, user acquisition and advertising capabilities.

• | Engage with our players where they prefer to play. We have designed our organization and initiatives with a ‘mobile-first’ perspective because we believe in the power and proliferation of mobile devices to offer engaging experiences to our players. Recent years have seen many advances in mobile computing power, mobile device storage and 4G and 5G wireless broadband availability, and we believe that these and future advances will enable us to expand our cross-platform play and engage with our players on whichever device they prefer to play our games – including PCs and video game consoles. We intend to offer our game development teams the ability to build the games that they love for all of the world’s players. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Network
 At the core of Zynga’s live services platform is our first-party data network, which captures key insights about how our players are interacting with our games. We use this data to deliver highly engaging interactive experiences for our players, optimize our user acquisition, monetize our games, and provide advertising services. In 2021, we acquired Chartboost, Inc. (“Chartboost”), a leading mobile programmatic advertising and monetization platform. By leveraging the global scale of our premium audience base, and the data generated from in-game actions, combined with Chartboost’s demand side platform (DSP), supply side platform (SSP) and mediation capabilities, we have the ability to further optimize advertising yields and user acquisition. 
 Within our live services, we are also focused on creating and supporting social networks within our games. We believe it is more fun for players to engage in our games with their friends and family. Players also progress faster in our games by connecting 
 3

with their friends and other players in our network to get what they need to complete quests, obtain virtual items and enhance their experience. We aspire to leverage our existing and new games to bring the best social playing experiences to our audience. Our network enables users to discover new games, find and connect with new friends and challenge, cooperate and compete with their friends, all of which drive higher user engagement.
 Our Revenues
 We primarily generate revenue from the following:
 Virtual Items.  Our primary revenue source is through the sale of in-game virtual currency that players use to buy virtual goods or through the sale of virtual goods directly (together, defined as “virtual items”). Virtual items can also be earned for free by the player through game play or by accepting promotional offers from our advertising partners.
 Consistent with our free-to-play business model, a small portion of our players have historically been payers. For example, in 2021, our average Mobile MUPs represented approximately 3.8% of our average Mobile MUUs – for more information about the uses, estimates and limitations of these and other operating metrics, please see the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Metrics.” Because the opportunity for social interactions increases as the number of players increase, we believe that maintaining and growing our overall number of players, including the number of players who may not purchase virtual items, is important to the success of our business. As a result, we believe that the number of players who choose to purchase virtual items will continue to constitute a small portion of our overall players.
 Our top three online game revenue-generating games historically have contributed to a significant portion of our revenue, though the games that represent our top three online game revenue-generating games vary over time. Our top three online game revenue-generating games accounted for 47%, 49% and 48% of our online game revenue in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In 2021, our top three online game revenue-generating games were Empires & Puzzles, Toon Blast and Merge Dragons!.
 Advertising.  Our advertising services offer creative ways for marketers and advertisers to reach and engage with our players while allowing continued operation of a free-to-play business model. Our advertising offerings include:

• | Mobile Advertisements in our mobile games that include banner and interstitial advertisements;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Engagement Advertisements and Offers in which players can participate in watch-to-earn engagements or other offer engagements;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Branded Virtual Items and Sponsorships that integrate relevant advertising and messaging within game play; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Advertising Network through which we offer a unified advertising platform that includes a demand side platform and supply side platform, as well as mediation capabilities delivered through an SDK solution.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our hyper-casual games and Words With Friends games accounted for 79% and 69% of our collective advertising and other revenue in 2021 and 2020, respectively, while our Words With Friends games generated a substantial portion of our advertising and other revenue in 2019.
 Marketing and Distribution
 Agreements with Marketing Partners
 We have been able to build a large community of players through the discovery of our apps in mobile platform app stores, the viral and social features built into the network effects of our games, as well as the cross-promotion of our games to our existing audience. However, we also acquire our players through paid advertising channels. We advertise our games primarily within other mobile applications and on social networks, often through in-app and other advertising partners such as Facebook and Google. In 2021, 2020 and 2019 we incurred $831.7 million, $583.1 million and $377.2 million, respectively, of these player acquisition costs.
 Agreements with Apple and Google
 Our revenue depends on our continued ability to publish our games on mobile platforms, primarily Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android. In 2021, we derived 50% of our revenue and bookings through Apple and 46% of our revenue and 45% of our bookings through Google. Our use of mobile platforms and data derived from mobile platforms is governed by the standard terms of service of the mobile platforms. Any of these operators could unilaterally alter their terms of service in a manner that could harm our business.

Research and Development
 We believe continued investment in enhancing existing games and developing new games, including investment in software development tools and code modification, is important to attaining our strategic objectives. Our research and development expenses were $545.9 million, $713.7 million and $505.9 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our total research and development expenses included stock-based compensation expense of $110.7 million, $73.4 million and $47.0 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and contingent consideration expense associated with our various acquisitions of $80.0 million, $359.3 million and $201.6 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Technology and Tools
 We have invested extensively in developing our proprietary technology stack, which is designed to handle sudden bursts of activity for millions of players over a short period of time with high levels of performance and reliability. Our proprietary technology stack includes cloud computing management, a shared code base, network and cross-promotional features and proprietary data analytics. Our technology stack also supports the growth of our 2D and 3D game engines across our mobile games, in addition to supporting high-level security and anti-fraud infrastructure. We are also investing in machine learning. We believe that investing in technology and tools can create competitive advantages and further our technology leadership. We will continue to innovate and optimize across our technology and tools to deliver cost-effective, high performance and highly available social games.
Intellectual Property
 Our business is significantly based on the creation, acquisition, use and protection of intellectual property. Some of this intellectual property is in the form of software code, patented technology and trade secrets that we use to develop our games and to enable them to run properly on multiple platforms. Other intellectual property we create or acquire includes product and feature names and audio-visual elements, including characters, graphics, music, story lines and interface designs.
 While most of the intellectual property we use is owned by us, we also acquire and license other proprietary intellectual property from third parties. These licenses typically limit our use of intellectual property to specific uses and for specific time periods.
 We protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state and common law protections, as well as contractual restrictions. We actively seek patent protection covering our inventions and we acquire patents we believe may be useful or relevant to our business. We control access to our proprietary technology by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, as well as confidentiality agreements with third parties. We also actively engage in monitoring and enforcement activities with respect to infringing uses of our trademarks, copyrights and domain names by third parties.
 In addition to these contractual arrangements, we also rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, trade dress, domain names and patents to protect our games and other intellectual property. We typically own the copyrights to the software code to our content, as well as the trademarks for the brands or titles under which our games are marketed. We pursue the registration of our domain names, copyrights, trademarks, patents and service marks in the U.S. and, for some, in locations outside the U.S. Our registered trademarks in the U.S. include “Zynga” and the names of our games, among others.
 Competition
 We face significant competition in all aspects of our business. Specifically, we compete for the leisure time, attention and discretionary spending of our players with other social game developers on the basis of a number of factors, including quality of player experience, brand awareness, reputation and access to distribution channels.
 We believe we compete favorably on these factors. However, our industry remains highly competitive and is evolving rapidly. Other developers of social games could develop more compelling content that competes with our social games and adversely affects our ability to attract and retain players and their entertainment time. These competitors, including companies of which we may not be currently aware, may take advantage of social networks, access to large user bases and their network effects to grow rapidly and virally.
 5

Our primary competitors include:
  
• | Developers for Mobile Games: We face competition from a number of competitors who develop mobile games. These competitors, some of which have significant financial, technical and other resources, greater brand recognition and longer operating histories, may create games that appeal to our players. The mobile game sector specifically is characterized by frequent product introductions, rapidly emerging mobile platforms, new technologies and new mobile application storefronts. Some of these competitors include Activision Blizzard, AppLovin, Aristocrat, DoubleU, Electronic Arts, Epic Games, ironSource, Moon Active, NetEase, Netmarble, Niantic, Nintendo, Playrix, Playtika, SciPlay, Scopely, Take-Two Interactive Software, Tencent, Ubisoft, Voodoo SAS and others. Because our games are free to play, we compete primarily on the basis of player experience rather than price. We also expect new competitors to enter the market and existing competitors to allocate more resources to develop and market competing games and applications.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Other Game Developers and Platforms: Our players may also play other games on PCs, consoles and online streaming services, some of which include social features that compete with our social games and have community functions where game developers can engage with their players. Some of these competitors include Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts, Epic Games, Microsoft, Nintendo, Riot Games, Roblox, SEGA, Sony, Take-Two Interactive and Ubisoft.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Other Forms of Media and Entertainment: We compete more broadly for the leisure time and attention of our players with providers of other forms of entertainment, such as social networking, casual entertainment and music. To the extent existing or potential players choose to read, watch or listen to online content, stream video or radio, play interactive video games at home or on their computer or mobile devices rather than play social games, these content services also pose a competitive threat.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Government Regulation
 We are subject to various federal, state and international laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet and mobile platforms, including those relating to privacy, use and protection of player and employee personal information and data (including the collection of data from minors), the Internet, behavioral tracking, mobile applications, content, advertising and marketing activities (including sweepstakes, contests and giveaways) and anti-corruption. Additional laws in all of these areas are likely to be passed in the future, which could result in significant limitations on or changes to the ways in which we can collect, use, host, store or transmit the personal information and data of our customers or employees, communicate with our players and deliver products and services, which may significantly increase our compliance costs. As our business expands to include new uses or collection of data that are subject to privacy or security regulations and our operations continue to expand across the globe, our compliance requirements and costs will increase and we may be subject to increased regulatory scrutiny.
 Some of our games and features are based upon traditional casino games, such as slots and poker. We have structured and operate these games and features with gambling laws in mind and believe that these games and features do not constitute gambling. Our social casino games are offered for entertainment purposes only and do not offer an opportunity to win real money.
 Seasonality
 Approximately 20% of our revenue was derived from the “advertising and other” category in 2021. Advertising budgets are generally highest during the fourth quarter and decline significantly in the first quarter of the following year, which affects the revenue we derive from advertisements in our games. Additionally, we generally experience increases in game downloads and online game revenue in the fourth quarter and first quarter corresponding to increases in smartphone and tablet purchases during the holiday shopping season. However, these factors may be offset by the dynamic nature of our hyper-casual audience and related advertising revenue, which may be subject to variability depending on our game launch cadence. 
Employees & Talent Retention
 As a global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment, we have office locations in the United States of America, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, India, Turkey and Finland. Our future success depends upon the continued service of our key employee talent across all functions and upon our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees, particularly senior leadership, game designers, product managers and engineers. We offer attractive compensation packages, including salaries, benefits and other incentives that are regularly reviewed against market practices to ensure our offerings are competitive in each of our office locations. While we believe Zynga is a destination for top talent in our industry, demand for talent is highly competitive, and the loss of key employees or the inability to hire such employees when needed could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition. As of December 31, 2021, we had 2,952 full-time employees across our global locations, and approximately 34% of our employees had been with us for less than one year and approximately 51% for less than two years.
 We are committed to the attraction, development and retention of our employees, and offer our employees the opportunities to excel and do the best work of their careers with us. Our management team is responsible for implementing our human capital 
 6

management policies and procedures, with oversight from our board of directors, and considers our employees to be our most valuable resource.
 We focus on the well-being of our employees and recruit new talent to Zynga by valuing the personal viewpoints and contributions of each of our employees. As we maintain a global team, we believe that each employee’s diverse background, life experiences, perspectives and insights make us stronger. To help focus our initiatives and further support our employees across the world, we have established several employee resource groups (ERGs) – each with a mission of bringing our employees together, sharing meaningful experiences, addressing challenges and building inclusive communities within Zynga.  
 Throughout 2021, our board of directors and management teams have met frequently to ensure that we understand the experiences of our employees during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, how they are managing working remotely and how we can best support our teams. To help our employees and their families adapt to the changes brought upon our society, we have offered services including counseling and employee assistance programs, updated leave of absence policies, and other measures to help address additional costs and burdens borne by our employees while working remotely.
