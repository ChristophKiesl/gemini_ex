ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Introduction
We are the largest regional theme park operator in the world based on the number of parks we operate. Of our 18 regional theme and water parks, 16 are located in the United States, one is located in Mexico City and one is located in Montreal, Canada. Our U.S. theme parks serve each of the top 10 designated market areas, as determined by a survey of television households within designated market areas published by A.C. Nielsen Media Research in September 2016. Our diversified portfolio of North American theme parks serves an aggregate population of approximately 100 million people and 175 million people within a radius of 50 miles and 100 miles, respectively, with some of the highest per capita gross domestic product in the U.S.
Our parks occupy approximately 4,500 acres of land, and we own approximately 800 acres of other potentially developable land. Our parks are located in geographically diverse markets across North America. Our parks generally offer a broad selection of state-of-the-art and traditional thrill rides, water attractions, themed areas, concerts and shows, restaurants, game venues and retail outlets, and thereby provide a complete family-oriented entertainment experience. In the aggregate, during 2016, our parks offered approximately 830 rides, including over 135 roller coasters, making us the leading provider of "thrill rides" in the industry.
In 1998, we acquired the former Six Flags Entertainment Corporation ("Former SFEC", a corporation that has been merged out of existence and that has always been a separate corporation from Holdings), which had operated regional theme parks under the Six Flags name for nearly forty years and established an internationally recognized brand name. We own the "Six Flags" brand name in the U.S. and foreign countries throughout the world. To capitalize on this name recognition, 16 of our parks are branded as "Six Flags" parks and beginning in 2014 we also began the development, with third-party partners, of Six Flags-branded theme parks outside of North America.
We hold exclusive long-term licenses for theme park usage of certain Warner Bros. and DC Comics characters throughout the U.S. (except the Las Vegas metropolitan area), Canada, Mexico and other countries. These characters include Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Tweety Bird, Yosemite Sam, Batman, Superman, The Joker and others. In addition, we have certain rights to use the Hanna-Barbera and Cartoon Network characters, including Yogi Bear, Scooby-Doo, The Flintstones and others. We use these characters to market our parks and to provide an enhanced family entertainment experience. Our licenses include the right to sell merchandise featuring the characters at the parks, and to use the characters in our advertising, as walk-around characters and in theming for rides, attractions and retail outlets. We believe using these characters promotes increased attendance, supports higher ticket prices, increases lengths-of-stay and enhances in-park sales.
We believe that our parks benefit from limited direct theme park competition. A limited supply of real estate appropriate for theme park development, substantial initial capital investment requirements, long development lead-time and zoning restrictions provides each of our parks with a significant degree of protection from competitive new theme park openings. Based on our knowledge of the development of our own and other regional theme parks, we estimate it would cost $400 million to $600 million and would take a minimum of three years to construct a new regional theme park comparable to one of our major Six Flags-branded theme parks.

Partnership Park Arrangements
In 1998, we acquired the former Six Flags Entertainment Corporation (a corporation that has been merged out of existence and that has always been a separate corporation from Holdings, "Former SFEC"). In connection with our 1998 acquisition of Former SFEC, we guaranteed certain obligations relating to the Partnership Parks. These obligations continue until 2027, in the case of SFOG, and 2028, in the case of SFOT. Such obligations include (i) minimum annual distributions (including rent) of approximately $69.7 million in 2017 (subject to cost of living adjustments in subsequent years) to the limited partners in the Partnerships Parks (based on our ownership of units as of December 31, 2016, our share of the distribution will be approximately $30.4 million) and (ii) minimum capital expenditures at each park during rolling five-year periods based generally on 6% of Partnership Park revenues. Cash flow from operations at the Partnership Parks is used to satisfy these requirements first, before any funds are required from us. We also guaranteed the obligation of our subsidiaries to annually purchase all outstanding limited partnership units to the extent tendered by the unit holders (the "Partnership Park Put"). 
After payment of the minimum distribution, we are entitled to a management fee equal to 3% of prior year gross revenues and, thereafter, any additional cash will be distributed first to management fee in arrears, repayment of any interest and principal on intercompany loans with any additional cash being distributed 95% to us, in the case of SFOG, and 92.5% to us, in the case of SFOT.
The agreed price for units tendered in the Partnership Park Put is based on a valuation of each of the respective Partnership Parks (the "Specified Price") that is the greater of (i) a valuation for each of the respective Partnership Parks derived by multiplying such park's weighted average four year EBITDA (as defined in the agreements that govern the partnerships) by a specified multiple (8.0 in the case of SFOG and 8.5 in the case of SFOT) and (ii) a valuation derived from the highest prices previously paid for the units of the Partnership Parks by certain entities.  Pursuant to the valuation methodologies described in the preceding sentence, the Specified Price for the Partnership Parks, if determined as of December 31, 2016, is $374.6 million in the case of SFOG and $433.8 million in the case of SFOT. As of December 31, 2016, we owned approximately 31.0% and 53.1% of the Georgia limited partner interests and Texas limited partner interests, respectively. The remaining redeemable units of approximately 69.0% and 46.9% of the Georgia limited partner and Texas limited partner, respectively, represent a current redemption value for the limited partnership units of approximately $461.8 million. Our obligations with respect to SFOG and SFOT will continue until 2027 and 2028, respectively.
Pursuant to the 2016 annual offer, we did not purchase any units from the Texas partnership and we purchased 0.065 units from the Georgia partnership for approximately $0.2 million in May 2016. With respect to the 2016 "put" obligations, no borrowing occurred. The $350 million accordion feature on the Amended and Restated Term Loan B under the Amended and Restated Credit Facility (as defined in "Management's Discussion and Analysis - Liquidity and Capital Resources of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Item 7 of this Annual Report) is available for borrowing for future "put" obligations if necessary.
In connection with our acquisition of the Former SFEC, we entered into the Subordinated Indemnity Agreement with certain of the Company's entities, Time Warner and an affiliate of Time Warner, pursuant to which, among other things, we transferred to Time Warner (which has guaranteed all of our obligations under the Partnership Park arrangements) record title to the corporations which own the entities that have purchased and will purchase limited partnership units of the Partnership Parks, and we received an assignment from Time Warner of all cash flow received on such limited partnership units, and we otherwise control such entities. In addition, we issued preferred stock of the managing partner of the partnerships to Time Warner. In the event of a default by us under the Subordinated Indemnity Agreement or of our obligations to our partners in the Partnership Parks, these arrangements would permit Time Warner to take full control of both the entities that own limited partnership units and the managing partner. If we satisfy all such obligations, Time Warner is required to transfer to us the entire equity interests of these entities. 
We incurred $27.8 million of capital expenditures at these parks during the 2016 season and intend to incur approximately $17.0 million of capital expenditures at these parks for the 2017 season, an amount in excess of the minimum required expenditure. Cash flows from operations at the Partnership Parks will be used to satisfy the annual distribution and capital expenditure requirements, before any funds are required from us. The two partnerships generated approximately $79.5 million of cash in 2016 from operating activities after deduction of capital expenditures and excluding the impact of short-term intercompany advances from or payments to SFI or Holdings, as the case may be. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had total loans receivable outstanding of $239.3 million from the partnerships that own the Partnership Parks. The proceeds from these loans were primarily used to fund the acquisition of Six Flags White Water Atlanta and to make capital improvements and distributions to the limited partners in prior years.

Marketing and Promotion
We attract visitors through multi-media marketing and promotional programs for each of our parks. The programs are designed to attract guests and enhance the Six Flags brand name, and are tailored to address the different characteristics of our various markets and to maximize the impact of specific park attractions and product introductions. All marketing and promotional programs are updated or completely changed each year to address new developments. These initiatives are supervised by our Senior Vice President, Marketing and Sales, with the assistance of our senior management and advertising and promotion agencies.
We also develop alliance, sponsorship and co-marketing relationships with well-known national, regional and local consumer goods companies and retailers to supplement our advertising efforts and to provide attendance incentives in the form of discounts. We also arrange for popular local radio and television programs to be filmed or broadcast live from our parks.
During 2013 we launched a monthly membership program. Season pass and membership sales establish an attendance base in advance of the season, reducing exposure to inclement weather and providing other benefits. In general, a season pass holder or member contributes higher aggregate revenue and profitability to the Company over the course of a year compared to a single day ticket guest because a season pass holder or member pays a higher ticket price and contributes to in-park guest spending over multiple visits. Additionally, guests enrolled in our membership program and season pass holders often bring paying guests and generate "word-of-mouth" advertising for the parks. During the 2016, 2015 and 2014 seasons, season pass and membership attendance constituted approximately 60%, 56% and 50%, respectively, of the total attendance at our parks.
At times we offer discounts on season passes, multi-visit tickets, tickets for specific dates and tickets to affiliated groups such as businesses, schools and religious, fraternal and similar organizations.
We also implement promotional programs as a means of targeting specific market segments and locations not generally reached through group or retail sales efforts. The promotional programs utilize coupons, sweepstakes, reward incentives and rebates to attract additional visitors. These programs are implemented through online promotions, direct mail, telemarketing, direct-response media, sponsorship marketing and targeted multi-media programs. The special promotional offers are usually for a limited time and offer a reduced admission price or provide some additional incentive to purchase a ticket.
Licenses
We have the exclusive right on a long-term basis to theme park usage of the Warner Bros. and DC Comics animated characters throughout the U.S. (except for the Las Vegas metropolitan area), Canada, Mexico and certain other countries. In particular, our license agreements entitle us to use, subject to customary approval rights of Warner Bros. and, in limited circumstances, approval rights of certain third parties, all animated, cartoon and comic book characters that Warner Bros. and DC Comics have the right to license, including Batman, The Joker, Superman, Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Tweety Bird and Yosemite Sam, and include the right to sell merchandise using the characters. In addition, certain Hanna-Barbera characters including Yogi Bear, Scooby-Doo and The Flintstones are available for our use at certain of our theme parks. In addition to annual license fees, we are required to pay a royalty fee on merchandise manufactured by or for us and sold that uses the licensed characters. Warner Bros. and Hanna-Barbera have the right to terminate their license agreements under certain circumstances, including if any persons involved in the movie or television industries obtain control of us or, in the case of Warner Bros., upon a default under the Subordinated Indemnity Agreement.
Park Operations
We currently operate in geographically diverse markets in North America. Each park is managed by a park president who reports to a senior vice president of the Company. The park presidents are responsible for all operations and management of the individual parks. Local advertising, ticket sales, community relations and hiring and training of personnel are the responsibility of individual park management in coordination with corporate support teams.
Each park president directs a full-time, on-site management team. Each management team includes senior personnel responsible for operations and maintenance, in-park food, beverage, merchandising and games, marketing and promotion, sponsorships, human resources and finance. Finance directors at our parks report to a corporate senior vice president of the Company, and with their support staff provide financial services to their respective parks and park management teams. Park management compensation structures are designed to provide financial incentives for individual park managers to execute our strategy and to maximize revenue and free cash flow.
Our parks are generally open daily from Memorial Day through Labor Day. In addition, most of our parks are open weekends prior to and following their daily seasons, often in conjunction with themed events, such as Fright Fest® and Holiday in the Park®. Due to their location, certain parks have longer operating seasons. Typically, the parks charge a basic daily admission price that allows unlimited use of all rides and attractions, although in certain cases special rides and attractions require the payment of an additional fee.

See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for information concerning revenues and long-lived assets by domestic and international categories.
Capital Improvements and Other Initiatives
We regularly make capital investments, primarily for new rides and attractions in our parks that total approximately 9 percent of revenues annually. We purchase both new and used rides and attractions. On occasion we also relocate rides among parks to provide fresh attractions. We believe that the selective introduction of new rides and attractions, including family entertainment attractions, is an important factor in promoting each of the parks to draw higher attendance and encourage longer visits, which can lead to higher in-park sales.
During 2016, we (i) added a new hybrid roller coaster at Six Flags Discovery Kingdom (Vallejo, CA); (ii) introduced 3D interactive dark ride attractions at Six Flags Great America (Gurnee, IL) and Six Flags Mexico (Mexico City, Mexico); (iii) added a 4D free fly coaster at Six Flags Great Adventure (Jackson, NJ); (iv) introduced a new look and virtual reality experience for the world's first 360 degree coaster during its 40th Anniversary at Six Flags Magic Mountain (Valencia, CA) and Superman the Ride at Six Flags New England (Agawam, MA); (v) debuted looping coasters at Six Flags Fiesta Texas (San Antonio, TX), Six Flags St. Louis (Eureka, MO), Six Flags New England (Agawam, MA) and The Great Escape (Queensbury, NY); (vi) added new themed kids areas at Six Flags Over Georgia (Austell, GA); (vii) added three new thrilling family rides to the Gotham City area at Six Flags Over Texas (Arlington, TX); (viii) added an interactive water play structure at Six Flags America (outside Washington, D.C.); (ix) added two new thrilling rides and ran the Vampire coaster backwards at La Ronde (Montreal, Canada); (x) debuted Holiday in the Park® at Six Flags America (outside Washington, D.C.) and Six Flags St. Louis (Eureka, MO); (xi) introduced virtual reality experiences at all of our U.S. theme parks plus our park in Montreal; and (xii) added a variety of rides, shows and attractions at several of our water parks.
Planned initiatives for 2017 include (i) adding a 3D interactive dark ride at Six Flags Magic Mountain (Valencia, CA), Six Flags Great Adventure (Jackson, NJ), and Six Flags Over Georgia (Austell, GA); (ii) adding a 4D free fly coaster at Six Flags Over Texas (Arlington, TX), Six Flags Great America (Gurnee, IL) and Six Flags New England (Agawam, MA); (iii) adding a twenty-four story extreme swing ride at Six Flags America (outside Washington, D.C.); (iv) adding a massive pendulum-shaped thrill ride at La Ronde (Montreal, Canada) and Six Flags Discovery Kingdom (Vallejo, CA); (v) introducing North America’s first rocket blast water coaster and a new Mardi Gras® Festival special event at Six Flags Fiesta Texas (San Antonio, TX); (vi) introducing a five story spinning flat ride at Six Flags St. Louis (Eureka, MO); (vii) adding dueling water body slides at The Great Escape and Splashwater Kingdom (Queensbury, NY); (viii) adding a multi-dimensional virtual reality roller coaster as well as a new Mardi Gras® Festival special event to Six Flags Mexico (Mexico City, Mexico); and (iv) introducing our nineteenth park, Six Flags Hurricane Harbor Oaxtepec (Oaxtepec, Mexico).
In addition to new rides and attractions, we make other capital improvements. We generally make capital investments in the food, retail, games and other in-park areas to increase per capita guest spending. We also make annual enhancements in the theming and landscaping of our parks in order to provide a more complete family-oriented entertainment experience. Each year we invest in our information technology infrastructure, which helps enhance our operational efficiencies. Maintenance capital expenditures are planned on an annual basis with most expenditures made during the off-season. Repairs and maintenance costs for materials and services associated with maintaining assets, such as painting and inspecting existing rides, are expensed as incurred and are not included in capital expenditures.
Also during 2017, we plan to continue (i) our targeted marketing strategies to attract guests, including focusing on our breadth of product and value offerings; (ii) improving and expanding upon our branded product offerings and guest-focused initiatives to continue driving guest spending growth, including our all season dining pass program, which enables season pass holders and members to eat meals and snacks any day they visit the park for one upfront payment; and (iii) growing sponsorship and international revenue opportunities.
International Licensing
We have signed agreements to assist third parties in the development and management of Six Flags-branded theme parks outside of North America. As compensation for exclusivity and brand licensing rights, and design, development and management services, we receive fees over the design and development period as well as an ongoing remuneration once the parks open to the public. The agreements do not require us to make any capital investments in the parks.
Maintenance and Inspection
Rides are inspected at various levels and frequencies in accordance with manufacturer specifications. Our rides are inspected daily during the operating season by our maintenance personnel. These inspections include safety checks, as well as regular maintenance, and are made through both visual inspection and test operations of the rides. Our senior management and the individual park personnel evaluate the risk aspects of each park's operations. Potential risks to employees and staff as well 
6

as to the public are evaluated. In addition, contingency response plans for potential emergency situations have been developed for each facility. During the off-season, maintenance personnel examine the rides and repair, refurbish and rebuild them where necessary. This process includes x-raying and magnafluxing (a further examination for minute cracks and defects) steel portions of certain rides at high-stress points. A large portion of our full-time workforce devote substantially all of their time to maintaining the parks and our rides and attractions. We use a computerized maintenance-management system across all of our domestic parks to assist us in executing our maintenance programs.
In addition to the performance of our internal maintenance and inspection procedures, third-party consultants are retained by us or our insurance carriers to perform an annual inspection of each park and all attractions and related maintenance procedures. The results of these inspections are reported in written evaluation and inspection reports, and include suggestions on various aspects of park operations. In certain states, state inspectors conduct additional annual ride inspections before the beginning of each season. Other portions of each park are subject to inspections by local fire marshals and health and building department officials. Furthermore, we use Ellis & Associates as water safety consultants at all of our water parks to train lifeguards and audit safety procedures.
Insurance
We maintain insurance of the types and in amounts that we believe are commercially reasonable and that are available to businesses in our industry. We maintain multi-layered general liability policies that provide for excess liability coverage of up to $100.0 million per occurrence. For incidents arising after November 15, 2003 but prior to December 31, 2008, our self-insured retention is $2.5 million per occurrence ($2.0 million per occurrence for the twelve months ended November 15, 2003 and $1.0 million per occurrence for the twelve months ended November 15, 2002) for our domestic parks and a nominal amount per occurrence for our international parks. For incidents arising after November 1, 2004 but prior to December 31, 2008, we have a one-time additional $0.5 million self-insured retention, in the aggregate, applicable to all claims in the policy year. For incidents arising on or after December 31, 2008, our self-insured retention is $2.0 million, followed by a $0.5 million deductible per occurrence applicable to all claims in the policy year for our domestic parks and our park in Canada and a nominal amount per occurrence for our parks in Mexico. Defense costs are in addition to these retentions. Our general liability policies cover the cost of punitive damages only in certain jurisdictions. Based upon reported claims and an estimate for incurred, but not reported claims, we accrue a liability for our self-insured contingencies. For workers' compensation claims arising after November 15, 2003, our deductible is $0.75 million ($0.5 million deductible for the period from November 15, 2001 to November 15, 2003). We also maintain fire and extended coverage, business interruption, terrorism and other forms of insurance typical to businesses in this industry. The "All Risks" property coverage policies insure our real and personal properties (other than land) against physical damage resulting from a variety of hazards. Additionally, we maintain information security and privacy liability insurance in the amount of $10.0 million with a $0.25 million self-insured retention per event.
We generally renegotiate our insurance policies on an annual basis. The majority of our current insurance policies expire on December 31, 2017. We cannot predict the level of the premiums that we may be required to pay for subsequent insurance coverage, the level of any self-insurance retention applicable thereto, the level of aggregate coverage available or the availability of coverage for specific risks.
Competition
Our parks compete directly with other theme parks, water and amusement parks and indirectly with all other types of recreational facilities and forms of entertainment within their market areas, including movies, sporting events, home entertainment options, restaurants and vacation travel. Accordingly, our business is and will continue to be subject to factors affecting the recreation and leisure time industries generally, such as general economic conditions and changes in discretionary consumer spending habits. See "Item 1A. Risk Factors." Within each park's regional market area, the principal factors affecting direct theme park competition include location, price, the uniqueness and perceived safety and quality of the rides and attractions in a particular park, the atmosphere and cleanliness of a park and the quality of its food and entertainment.
Seasonality
Our operations are highly seasonal, with approximately 70% to 75% of park attendance and revenues occurring in the second and third calendar quarters of each year, with the most significant period falling between Memorial Day and Labor Day.
Environmental and Other Regulations
Our operations are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations including laws and regulations governing water and sewer discharges, air emissions, soil and groundwater contamination, the maintenance of underground and aboveground storage tanks and the disposal of waste and hazardous materials. In addition, our operations are subject to other local, state and federal governmental regulations including, without limitation, labor, health, safety, zoning and land use and minimum wage regulations applicable to theme park operations, and local and state regulations applicable to restaurant 
7

operations at each park. Finally, certain of our facilities are subject to laws and regulations relating to the care of animals. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental and other laws and regulations and, although no assurance can be given, we do not foresee the need for any significant expenditures in this area in the near future.
Portions of the undeveloped areas at certain of our parks are classified as wetlands. Accordingly, we may need to obtain governmental permits and other approvals prior to conducting development activities that affect these areas and future development may be prohibited in some or all of these areas. Additionally, the presence of wetlands in portions of our undeveloped land could adversely affect our ability to dispose of such land and/or the price we receive in any such disposition.
Philanthropy and Community Relations
We believe it is important to support the communities in which our parks are located. We partner with charitable organizations throughout North America whose mission aligns with our goal of bringing joy and thrills to families and children. Through our Read to Succeed program, we support academic achievement and seek to improve literacy by encouraging students to engage in recreational reading, and award free admission to eligible participants in the program. Most of our full-time employees spend at least an entire day each year volunteering on projects in their local communities to help others including distributing food to those in need, improving community centers and building or repairing homes. In addition, we sponsor toy drives, book drives, food drives and blood donation drives at our parks, and are committed to honoring the service of the U.S. military personnel and their families by offering complimentary and/or reduced admission to our parks. We also maintain a program in which we make a concerted effort to interview and hire U.S. military veterans. We also host special events to support various philanthropies whose mission focuses on improving health or supporting those affected by natural disasters.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 2,000 full-time employees, and over the course of the 2016 operating season we employed approximately 45,000 seasonal employees. In this regard, we compete with other local employers for qualified students and other candidates on a season-by-season basis. As part of the seasonal employment program, we employ a significant number of teenagers, which subjects us to child labor laws.
Approximately 18% of our full-time and approximately 10% of our seasonal employees are subject to labor agreements with local chapters of national unions. These labor agreements expire in December 2017 (Six Flags Magic Mountain and one union at Six Flags Great Adventure), January 2018 (Six Flags Over Texas and the other union at Six Flags Great Adventure), December 2019 (Six Flags Over Georgia), and January 2020 (Six Flags St. Louis). The labor agreements for La Ronde expire in various years ranging from December 2017 (currently under negotiation) through December 2022. The labor agreement for Six Flags Discovery Kingdom was terminated effective January 1, 2016 following an NLRB supervised election in which employees voted to cease their relationship with the union. We consider our employee relations to be good.
Executive Officers and Certain Significant Employees
The following table sets forth the name of the members of the Company's senior leadership team, the position held by such officer and the age of such officer as of the date of this report. The officers of the Company are generally elected each year at the organizational meeting of Holdings' Board of Directors, which follows the annual meeting of stockholders, and at other Board of Directors meetings, as appropriate.
