ITEM 1. Business
GENERAL
 
Hemispherx Biopharma, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Hemispherx”, “Company”, “we” or “us”) are a specialty pharmaceutical company headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and engaged in the clinical development of new drug therapies based on natural immune system enhancing technologies for the treatment of viral and immune based disorders. We were first formed in 1966 and in the early 1970s were doing contract research for the National Institutes of Health. Since that time, we have established a strong foundation of laboratory, pre-clinical and clinical data with respect to the development of natural interferon and nucleic acids to enhance the natural antiviral defense system of the human body and to aid the development of therapeutic products for the treatment of certain chronic diseases. We have two domestic subsidiaries BioPro Corp., and BioAegean Corp., all of which are incorporated in Delaware and are dormant. Our foreign subsidiary is Hemispherx Biopharma Europe N.V./S.A. which was established in Belgium in 1998.
 
On February 17, 2016, our Board, by majority vote, terminated the employment of Dr. William Carter, our Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Scientific Officer. As a result, Dr. Carter is also no longer a director. Dr. William Mitchell, one of our independent directors, was appointed Chairman of the Board.
 
On February 19, 2016, our Board also made several changes to our executive management team in light of the termination of Dr. Carter, to provide effective and competent leadership that will properly position us to achieve our commercial goals and increase stockholder value. In this regard, Adam Pascale was named Chief Financial Officer in addition to his current responsibilities as Chief Accounting Officer. Mr. Pascale has been employed with us for 21 years, with more than two decades of public accounting experience and prior public company experience. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Accounting and Finance from Rutgers University. Mr. Pascale served for several years as a CPA prior to joining the Company, and is a member of both the American and the Pennsylvania Institutes of Certified Public Accountants. Mr. Thomas Equels, our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and President, resigned as Chief Financial Officer to make way for Mr. Pascale.
 
On February 25, 2016, our Board appointed Thomas Equels, our current President, as our CEO. In that capacity, he is our principal executive officer. On June 16, 2016, Iraj Kiani resigned as a member of our Board. On September 30, 2016, Mr. Peter Rodino resigned as a member of our Board to permit him to serve us in a new capacity. In this regard, effective October 1, 2016, we retained Mr. Rodino as our Executive Director for Governmental Relations and as our General Counsel. In these capacities, Mr. Rodino will handle all government affairs and litigation matters on a going forward basis. Mr. Rodino was also appointed Secretary of the Company in November 2016.

On April 20, 2016, we executed a consulting agreement with Huron Consulting Group, a global consultancy with decades of experience in the life sciences market, and have continued to work with Huron to advance our strategic plan to capitalize on business opportunities in the United States and in target countries around the world.
 
Our flagship products include Alferon N Injection® and the experimental therapeutic Ampligen®. Alferon N Injection® is approved for a category of STD infection, and Ampligen® represents an experimental RNA being developed for globally important viral diseases and disorders of the immune system. Hemispherx’ platform technology includes components for potential treatment of various severely debilitating and life threatening diseases. Alferon® LDO (Low Dose Oral) is a formulation under development targeting influenza.
 
The chart below provides an overview of clinical indications for both Ampligen® and Alferon® currently under development.
 



We own and operate a 30,000 sq. ft. facility in New Brunswick, NJ with the ability to produce Alferon® and Ampligen®, and completed the construction of our $8 million facility enhancement project in 2015 which, upon FDA approval, should provide for a higher capacity, more cost effective manufacturing process for the production of Alferon N Injection®. As part of our objectives to achieve our commercial goals and increase stockholder value, we are in the process of selling an underutilized building adjacent to our New Jersey manufacturing facility site. We do not believe that the sale of this building will have an impact on the production of our products. We also are exploring the possibility of mortgaging our facility or selling it if we can obtain a long term lease back on the facility on acceptable terms. Please see “Manufacturing” section below.
 
On February 1, 2013, we received a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”) from the FDA declining to approve our NDA for Ampligen® for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (“CFS”). Please see the discussion in “Our Products - Ampligen®” below for more detail.

OUR PRODUCTS
 
Our primary pharmaceutical product platform consists of our experimental compound, Ampligen®, our FDA approved natural interferon product, Alferon N Injection®, and our experimental liquid natural interferon for oral administration, Alferon® LDO (Low Dose Oral).
Ampligen®
 
Ampligen® is approved for sale in Argentina and is an experimental drug currently undergoing clinical development for the treatment of CFS in the United States of America. As noted above and discussed below, the FDA in its Complete Response Letter (“CRL”) declined to approve our NDA for the treatment of CFS with Ampligen®. Over its developmental history, Ampligen® has received various designations, including Orphan Drug Product Designation (FDA), Treatment protocol (e.g., “Expanded Access” or “Compassionate” use authorization) with Cost Recovery Authorization (FDA) and “promising” clinical outcome recognition based on the evaluation of certain summary clinical reports (“AHRQ” or Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality). Ampligen® represents the first drug in the class of large (macromolecular) RNA (nucleic acid) molecules to apply for NDA review. Based on the results of published, peer reviewed pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, we believe that Ampligen® may have broad-spectrum anti-viral and anti-cancer properties.

We believe that nucleic acid compounds represent a potential new class of pharmaceutical products as they are designed to act at the molecular level for treatment of human diseases. There are two forms of nucleic acids, DNA and RNA. DNA is a group of naturally occurring molecules found in chromosomes, the cell’s genetic machinery. RNA is a group of naturally occurring informational molecules which orchestrate a cell’s behavior which, in turn, regulates the action of groups of cells, including the cells which compromise the body’s immune system. RNA directs the production of proteins and regulates certain cell activities including the activation of an otherwise dormant cellular defense against viruses and tumors. Our drug technology utilizes specifically-configured RNA. Our double-stranded RNA drug product, trademarked Ampligen®, is an experimental, unapproved drug, that would be administered intravenously. Ampligen® has been assigned the generic name rintatolimod by the United States Adopted Names Council (USANC) and has the chemical designation poly(I):poly(C12U).
 
Clinical trials of Ampligen® already conducted by us include studies of the potential treatment of CFS, Hepatitis B, HIV and cancer patients with renal cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma. All of these potential uses will require additional clinical trials to generate the safety and effectiveness data necessary to support regulatory approval.
 
On February 1, 2013, we received a CRL from the FDA declining to approve our New Drug Application (“NDA”) for Ampligen® for CFS. In its CRL, the FDA communicated that Hemispherx should conduct at least one additional clinical trial, complete various nonclinical studies and perform a number of data analyses. The additional clinical study should address, among other things, Ampligen®’s efficacy in treating CFS patients, be of sufficient size and duration to assess the safety of Ampligen® and be sufficient to determine appropriate dosing. The FDA set forth the reasons for this action and provided recommendations to address certain outstanding issues. The FDA stated that the submitted data does not provide substantial evidence of efficacy of Ampligen® for the treatment of CFS and that the data does not provide sufficient information to determine whether the product is safe for use in CFS due to the limited size of the safety database and multiple discrepancies within the submitted data. In addition to the safety and effectiveness issues recommended to be addressed in at least one additional clinical trial, the CRL states that Hemispherx should conduct complete rodent carcinogenicity studies in two species prior to approval and also conduct additional animal toxicology studies providing more comprehensive evaluation of Ampligen® fragments and degradation products. The CRL also requests evaluation of variation between lots of Ampligen® tested in the development process and recommends tighter control of the Ampligen® manufacturing process.
 
In response to the CRL, we continue to plan to avail ourselves of the opportunity for an “end-of-review” meeting with representatives of the Office of Drug Evaluation II which issued the CRL, in order to clarify and seek to narrow the outstanding issues regarding the further development of Ampligen® for the treatment of CFS.

FDA regulations provide a formal dispute resolution process to obtain review of any FDA decision, including a decision not to approve an NDA, by raising the matter with the supervisor of the FDA office that made the decision. The formal dispute resolution process exists to encourage open, prompt discussion of scientific (including medical) disputes and procedural (including administrative) disputes that arise during the drug development, new drug review, and post-marketing oversight processes of the FDA. Depending on the outcome of a number of initiatives in the CFS community, including the FDA’s Patient Focused Drug Development Initiatives, forthcoming drug guidance and other scientific initiatives by the Institute of Medicine, Center for Disease Control and National Institute of Health, we will continue to examine the opportunity for an “end-of-review” meeting. Depending on the results of these initiatives, we may request an “end-of-review” conference with the FDA as a precursor to a possible submission of a formal appeal to the Office of New Drugs within the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research regarding the FDA’s decision. Please see “Risks Associated with Our Business” in Part I; Item 1A. Risk Factors below.
 
Until we undertake the end-of-review conference(s), or otherwise reach an agreement with the FDA regarding the design of a confirmatory study, we are unable to reasonably estimate the nature, costs, necessary efforts to obtain FDA clearance or anticipated completion dates of any additional clinical study or studies. Utilizing the industry norms for undertaking a Phase III clinical study, we estimate upon acceptance of the study’s design that it would take approximately 18 months to three years to complete a new well-controlled Ampligen® clinical study for resubmission to the FDA. Industry norms suggest that it will require three to six months to initiate the study, one to two years to accrue and test patients, three to six months to close-out the study and file the necessary documents with the FDA. The actual duration to complete the clinical study may be different based on the length of time it takes to design the study and obtain FDA’s acceptance of the design, the final design of an acceptable Phase III clinical study, availability of suitable participants and clinical sites along with other factors that could impact the implementation of the study, analysis of results or requirements of the FDA and/or other governmental organizations. We anticipate that the time and cost to undertake clinical trial(s), studies and data analysis are beyond our current financial resources without gaining access to additional funding. Please see “Part I; Item 1A, Risk Factors: “We may require additional financing which may not be available.”
 
In May 1997, the FDA authorized an open-label treatment protocol, (“AMP-511”), allowing patient access to Ampligen® for treatment in an open-label safety study under which severely debilitated CFS patients have the opportunity to be on Ampligen® to treat this very serious and chronic condition. The data collected from the AMP-511 protocol through a consortium group of clinical sites provide safety information regarding the use of Ampligen® in patients with CFS. As of December 31, 2016, there were 27 patients participating in this open-label treatment protocol taking treatment. We are establishing an enlarged data base of clinical safety information which we believe will provide further documentation regarding the absence of autoimmune disease associated with Ampligen® treatment. We believe that continued efforts to understand existing data, and to advance the development of new data and information, will ultimately support our future filings for Ampligen® and/or the design of future clinical studies. In 1997, we calculated the cost per dose (400mg) of Ampligen® to be $150 per dose consistent with the regulatory guidelines; however, we recently engaged an independent certified public accountant to recalculate the cost per dose consistent with the current guidelines, utilizing the costs to produce a vial in 2015. The independent analysis disclosed a cost per 200 mg dose of Ampligen® of $200 per vial. In October 2016, the FDA granted our request to implement the new cost.

On July 12, 2012, we filed a new drug application for Ampligen® with the ANMAT (Administracion Nacional de Medicamentos, Alimentos y Tecnologia Medica), the agency responsible for the national regulation of drugs, foods and medical technology in Argentina, under the ANMAT’s Orphan Drug regulations. We believe that the approval of Ampligen® as an Orphan Drug may allow reimbursement by the Health Services Authority (SSS), the central health authority in Argentina for patients seeking treatment for CFS. On August 18, 2016, we received approval of our New Drug Application (“NDA”) from ANMAT for commercial sale of rintatolimod (U.S. tradename: Ampligen®) in the Argentine Republic for the treatment of severe myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (“ME/CFS”). The product will be marketed by GP Pharm, our commercial partner in Latin America.
 
On January 11, 2017, we announced that the rintatolimod European Early Access Program (“EAP”) through our agreement with Impatients designed to enable access of Ampligen® to ME/CFS patients has been extended to pancreatic cancer patients beginning in the Netherlands. Impatients, doing business as MyTomorrows, is our exclusive service provider in Europe and Turkey and will manage all EAP activities relating to the pancreatic cancer extension of the program. A competent authority in the Netherlands has recently approved 50 patients for treatment in the EAP for pancreatic cancer including a funding mechanism to remunerate us for the use of Ampligen® in the program.
 
Alferon N Injection®
 
Alferon N Injection® is the registered trademark for our injectable formulation of natural alpha interferon, which was approved by the FDA in 1989 for the treatment of certain categories of genital warts. Alferon® is the only natural-source, multi-species alpha interferon currently approved for sale in the U.S. for the intralesional (within lesions) treatment of refractory (resistant to other treatment) or recurring external genital warts in patients 18 years of age or older. Certain types of human papilloma viruses (“HPV”) cause genital warts, a sexually transmitted disease (“STD”). The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) estimates that “approximately twenty million Americans are currently infected with HPV with another six million becoming newly infected each year. HPV is so common that at least 50% of sexually active men and women get it at some point in their lives.” Although they do not usually result in death, genital warts commonly recur, causing significant morbidity and entail substantial health care costs.

Interferons are a group of proteins produced and secreted by cells to combat diseases. Researchers have identified four major classes of human interferon: alpha, beta, gamma and omega. Alferon® N Injection® contains a multi-species form of alpha interferon. The world-wide market for injectable alpha interferon-based products has experienced rapid growth and various alpha interferon injectable products are approved for many major medical uses worldwide. Alpha interferons are manufactured commercially in three ways: by genetic engineering, by cell culture, and from human white blood cells. All three of these types of alpha interferon are or were approved for commercial sale in the U.S. Our natural alpha interferon is produced from human white blood cells.
 
The potential advantages of natural alpha interferon over recombinant (synthetic) interferon produced and marketed by other pharmaceutical firms may be based upon their respective molecular compositions. Natural alpha interferon is composed of a family of proteins containing many molecular species of interferon. In contrast, commercial recombinant alpha interferon products each contain only a single species. Researchers have reported that the various species of interferons may have differing antiviral activity depending upon the type of virus. Natural alpha interferon presents a broad complement of species, which we believe may account for its higher activity in laboratory studies. Natural alpha interferon is also glycosylated (partially covered with sugar molecules). Such glycosylation is not present on the currently U.S. marketed recombinant alpha interferons. We believe that the absence of glycosylation may be, in part, responsible for the production of interferon-neutralizing antibodies seen in patients treated with recombinant alpha interferon. Although cell culture-derived interferon is also composed of multiple glycosylated alpha interferon species, the types and relative quantity of these species are different from our natural alpha interferon.
 
Alferon N Injection® [Interferon alfa-n3 (human leukocyte derived)] is a highly purified, natural-source, glycosylated, multi-species alpha interferon product. There are essentially no neutralizing antibodies observed against Alferon N Injection® to date and the product has a relatively low side-effect profile. The recombinant DNA derived alpha interferon formulations have been reported to have decreased effectiveness after one year, probably due to neutralizing antibody formation.
 
See “Manufacturing” and “Marketing/Distribution” sections below for more details on the manufacture and marketing/distribution of Alferon N Injection®.

Alferon® LDO (Low Dose Oral) 
 
Alferon® LDO [Low Dose Oral Interferon Alfa-n3 (Human Leukocyte Derived)] is an experimental low-dose, oral liquid formulation of natural alpha interferon and like Alferon® N Injection®, should not cause antibody formation, which is a problem with recombinant interferon. It is an experimental immunotherapeutic believed to work by stimulating an immune cascade response in the cells of the mouth and throat, enabling it to bolster systemic immune response through the body by absorption through the oral mucosa. Oral interferon could be economically feasible for patients and logistically manageable globally for development programs for prevention and, or treatment of pandemic influenza, seasonal influenza and other emerging viruses. Oral administration of Alferon® LDO, with its anticipated affordability, low toxicity, no production of antibodies, and broad range of potential bioactivity, could be a breakthrough treatment or preventative for viral diseases.
 
Hemispherx currently has an FDA authorized protocol to conduct a Phase II, double-blind, adaptive-design, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study of Alferon® LDO for the prophylaxis and treatment of seasonal influenza of more than 200 subjects. Our Phase II study has continued to be delayed.
 
HISTORICAL COSTS RELATED TO OUR PRODUCTS
 
The following table sets forth the costs related to our major products for each of the prior three years. Our aggregate expenses from the time that we first started developing nucleic acid pharmaceutical technology in the mid 1980’s through March 2003 were substantially related to the development of Ampligen®, and from that date through the current period were substantially related to Ampligen® and Alferon®.

PATENTS AND NON-PATENT EXCLUSIVITY RIGHTS
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had 50 patents worldwide with 8 additional pending patent applications comprising our intellectual property. Please see “Note 5: Patents, Trademark Rights and Other Intangibles (FASB ASC 350 General Intangibles Other than Goodwill)” under Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on these patents.
 
We continually review our patents’ rights to determine whether they have continuing value. Such review includes an analysis of the patent’s ultimate revenue and profitability potential. In addition, Management’s review addresses whether each patent continues to fit into our strategic business plans for Ampligen®, Alferon N Injection® and Alferon® LDO. One U.S. patent relating to our Alferon® product expired on April 2, 2013 (#5,503,828) and another on October 14, 2014 (#5,676,942) (see discussion below on patent #5,503,828 and #5,676,942).
 
In 2016, we received a new Ampligen® composition of matter patent in the US (9,315,528 B2) and we received twenty-eight new patents in various EU countries. In 2015, we were granted a new composition of matter patent (#2340307) by the European Patent Office. In 2014, we were granted a new composition of matter patent in the United States (#8,722,874) covering Ampligen® formulations.
 
Alferon® composition patent #5,503,828 which expired in April 2013, related to the manufacturing process for Alferon® Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (“API”), a complex mixture of natural interferon species that is manufactured from human leukocytes obtained from human blood donors. In addition, while it is the current standard by the FDA to treat biological drug products like interferon as “Well Characterized” biologics, a process for which chemical entities can have their identity, purity, impurities, potency, and quality controlled by chemical testing, Alferon®, as a natural interferon, does not lend itself well to such testing. Moreover, FDA continues to require that each lot of Alferon® we produce be tested and released by the FDA before it can be distributed for commercial sales. Because of the complexity of the Alferon® manufacturing process and these additional regulatory requirements, we believe that potential manufacturers of generic, or so-called “bio-similar,” drug products are focused on developing recombinant interferon products, rather than natural interferon products. For these reasons, we believe the expiration of this Alferon® composition patent in April 2013 should have no or little impact on the Company. Additionally, at the receipt of the FDA certification for the revised Alferon® manufacturing process and techniques in New Brunswick, NJ, it is our intention to file for additional patent protection.

Alferon® patent #5,676,942 which expired on October 14, 2014 and Alferon® patent #5,989,441 which was set to expire on December 22, 2017, but was allowed to lapse beforehand, related to a manufacturing methodology which is no longer in use. For this reason, we believe the expiration of these Alferon® patents should have no impact on the Company.
 
With respect to Ampligen®, the main U.S. CFS treatment patent (#6,130,206) expires October 10, 2017 (we believe that the expiration of this patent will have minimal impact on us; see detail on U.S. 8,722,874 below). Our main patents covering HIV treatment (#4,820,696, #5,063,209, and #5,091,374) expired on April 11, 2006, November 5, 2008, and February 25, 2009, respectively. Our U.S. Ampligen® Trademark (#73/617,687) has been renewed through December 6, 2018. New therapeutic use patent applications are pending. On May 13, 2014, the United States Patent Office issued patent U.S. 8,722,874 titled “Double-Stranded Ribonucleic Acids with Rugged Physiochemical Structure and Highly Specific Biologic Activity” to inventors Carter, et al. and assignee Hemispherx. The patent claims a novel form of rugged dsRNA. Rugged dsRNA are nucleic acids with a unique composition and physical characteristic identified with high specificity of binding to Toll-Like Receptor 3 (TLR3), thereby conveying an important range of therapeutic opportunities. The newly discovered form of dsRNA has increased bioactivity and binding affinity to the TLR 3 receptor because of its reduced tendency to form branched dsRNA which can inhibit receptor binding. Pharmaceutical formulations containing the newly discovered nucleic acid as active ingredients, and methods of treatment with those formulations are also described in the issued patent. Hemispherx believes that the issuance of U.S. Patent 8,722,874 will help ensure that Hemispherx retains patent protection for novel formulations of Ampligen® products until at least 2029.
 
In September 2015, the European Patent Office granted the European version of U.S. Patent 8,722,874 with the same title as shown above to inventors Carter, et al. and assignee Hemispherx.
 
In addition to our patent rights relating to Ampligen®, the FDA has granted “orphan drug status” to the drug for CFS, HIV/AIDS, renal cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma. Orphan drug status grants us protection against the potential subsequent approval of other sponsors’ versions of the drug for these uses for a period of seven years following FDA approval of Ampligen® for each of these designated uses. The first NDA approval for Ampligen® as a new chemical entity will also qualify for four or five years of non-patent exclusivity during which abbreviated new drug applications seeking approval to market generic versions of the drug cannot be submitted to the FDA. (See “Government Regulation” below.)
 
In May 2011, a new United States Patent was granted for the use of Ampligen® as a vaccine adjuvant for use with seasonal influenza vaccine to induce an enhanced immune response against H5N1 avian influenza.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (“R&D”)
 
Our general focus during the past three fiscal years has been on the clinical development of new drug therapies based on natural immune system enhancing technologies for the treatment of viral and immune based disorders.
 
The following table summarizes our research and development costs for the years 2016, 2015 and 2014 by project (in thousands):

Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in the design and conduct of clinical trials and the applicable regulatory requirements, including the factors discussed above in “OUR PRODUCTS”, we cannot predict what additional studies and/or additional testing or information may be required by the FDA. Accordingly, we are unable to estimate the nature, timing, costs and necessary efforts to complete these projects nor the anticipated completion dates. In addition, we have no basis for estimating when material net cash inflows may commence. We have yet to generate significant revenues from the sale of these developmental products. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $5,868,000 in Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities, (inclusive of approximately $3,460,000 in Marketable Securities). Please see ITEM 1A. Risk Factors; “We may require additional financing which may not be available” below.
 
In its CRL, the FDA communicated that Hemispherx should conduct at least one additional clinical trial, complete various nonclinical studies and perform a number of data analysis. Until we undertake the end-of-review conference(s) with the FDA, we are unable to reasonably estimate the nature, costs, necessary efforts to obtain FDA clearance or anticipated completion dates of any additional clinical study or studies. Utilizing the industry norms for undertaking a Phase III clinical study, we estimate upon acceptance of the study’s design that it would take approximately 18 months to three years to complete a new well-controlled Ampligen® clinical study for resubmission to the FDA. It can be reasonably anticipated that the time and cost to undertake clinical trial(s), studies and data analysis are beyond our current financial resources without gaining access to additional funding. The actual duration to complete the clinical study may be different based on the length of time it takes to design the study and obtain FDA’s acceptance of the design, the final design of an acceptable Phase III clinical study design, availability of suitable participants and clinical sites along with other factors that could impact the implementation of the study, analysis of results or requirements of the FDA and/or other governmental organizations. Please see “We most likely will require additional financing which may not be available.” in Item 1A. Risk Factors below.

Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (“CFS”)
 
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (“CFS”), also known as Chronic Fatigue Immune Dysfunction Syndrome (“CFIDS”) and Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (“ME”), is a serious and debilitating chronic illness and a major public health problem. CFS is recognized by both the government and private sector as a significant unmet medical need, including the U.S. National Institutes of Health (“NIH”), FDA and the CDC. The CDC states on its website at http://www.cdc.gov/cfs/index.html that “Chronic fatigue syndrome, or CFS, is a devastating and complex disorder characterized by overwhelming fatigue that is not improved by bed rest and that may be worsened by physical or mental activity. People with CFS most often function at a significantly lower level of activity than they were capable of before the onset of illness.”
 
Many severe CFS patients become completely disabled or totally bedridden and are afflicted with severe pain and mental confusion even at rest. CFS is characterized by incapacitating fatigue with profound exhaustion and extremely poor stamina, sleep difficulties and problems with concentration and short-term memory. It is also accompanied by flu-like symptoms, pain in the joints and muscles, tender lymph nodes, sore throat and new headaches. A distinctive characteristic of the illness is a worsening of symptoms following physical or mental exertion, which do not subside with rest.
 
For their Case Definition, the CDC states that the cause or causes of CFS have not been identified and no specific diagnostic tests are available. Therefore, in order to be diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome, a patient must satisfy three criteria:
 

1. | The individual has had severe chronic fatigue for six or more consecutive months that is not due to ongoing exertion or other medical conditions associated with fatigue (these other conditions need to be ruled out by a doctor after diagnostic tests have been conducted);
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | The fatigue significantly interferes with daily activities and work; and 
3. | The individual concurrently has four or more of the following eight symptoms: 


● | post-exertion malaise lasting more than twenty-four hour; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------
● | unrefreshing sleep; 
● | significant impairment of short-term memory or concentration;
● | muscle pain; 
● | pain in the joints without swelling or redness; 
● | headaches of a new type, pattern, or severity; 
● | tender lymph nodes in the neck or armpit; or 
● | a sore throat that is frequent or recurring. 

 
These symptoms should have persisted or recurred during six or more consecutive months of illness and they cannot have first appeared before the fatigue. CFS is a diagnosis of exclusion. Because no cause for CFS has been identified, current treatment programs are directed at relieving symptoms, with the goal of the patient regaining some level of function and well-being.

While CFS strikes people in all age, racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups, it is most prevalent amongst women. Research has shown that CFS is about three times as common in women as men, a rate similar to that of many autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and lupus.
 
In June 2012, U.S. Senators Robert P. Casey, Richard Blumenthal and Kay R. Hagan sent a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius requesting the FDA hold a stakeholders meeting on CFS. Senators Casey and Hagan serve on the Committee on Health, Education, Labor & Pensions, which has Congressional oversight responsibility for FDA. The letter stated, “CFS/ME represents a significant unmet medical need, one that confers on patients a lifetime of illness. A stakeholder meeting would be of great benefit, as it would offer an opportunity to examine existing treatment protocols known to FDA, address how risk/benefit determinations should be made in relation to CFS/ME treatments and identify a path forward for regulatory science in this area.”
 
In April 2013, the FDA selected CFS to be the first disease in a series of meetings called Patient Focused Drug Development meetings. The two-day meeting with key stakeholders resulted in a report called The Voice of the Patient, published in September of 2013. In March 2014, FDA published the first ever Guidance for Industry Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis: Developing Drug Products for Treatment.
 
In February 2015, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) published a report, Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome; Redefining an Illness. The committee was charged by HHS with evaluating the current criteria for the diagnosis of ME/CFS and recommend clinical diagnostic criteria that would address the needs of health care providers, patients, and their caregivers. The primary message of the committee is “ME/CFS is a serious, chronic, complex, systemic disease that can profoundly affect the lives of patients.” The IOM since published a Report Guide for Clinicians. In October 2015, NIH Director Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D. announced that NIH is strengthening its efforts to advance research on ME/CFS. In an interview with ME Action, December 2015, Collins described the range of possibilities – “everything from basic science to clinical trials for promising approaches, including Ampligen® and Rituximab”.
 
Other Diseases 
 
In July 2011, we received FDA authorization to proceed with the initiation of a new clinical trial of intranasal Ampligen® to be used in conjunction with commercially approved seasonal influenza vaccine. On April 16, 2012, a clinical trial was initiated in which Ampligen® was nasally administered in conjunction with FluMist® to healthy human volunteers at the University of Alabama at Birmingham under the auspices of Dr. Paul Goepfert, Associate Professor of Medicine in the Division of Infectious Diseases and Director of the Alabama Vaccine Research Clinic. This study was the first use of Ampligen® with a seasonal vaccine in humans to assess the safety of Ampligen® when nasally delivered as a vaccine adjuvant. Another objective of this study was to determine the extent to which Ampligen® mobilizes potential protections against pandemic influenza by utilization of a seasonal flu vaccine. The study would have evaluated the potential immunologic enhancement of Ampligen® by comparing immune parameters in the group receiving Ampligen® plus FluMist® with another group receiving FluMist® plus placebo. Twenty-five subjects were enrolled; twelve in Stage 1 and thirteen subjects in Stage 2. However, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has indicated the nasal spray flu vaccine (live attenuated influenza vaccine or LAIV) should not be used during 2016-2017 (source: https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/vaccination/); therefore, the study has been closed.

In December 2013, we announced that we are supporting the University of Pittsburgh’s National Institutes of Health funded study (grant 1PO1CA132714) currently underway as part of the University’s Chemokine Modulation Research initiative which includes Ampligen® as an adjuvant. As part of this collaboration, Hemispherx has supplied clinical grade Ampligen® (rintatolimod) to the University. The study, under the leadership of Professor of Surgery Pawel Kalinski, M.D., Ph.D., involves the Chemokine Modulatory regimen developed by Dr. Kalinski’s group and has successfully completed dose escalation in patients with resectable colorectal cancer under the clinical leadership of Dr. Amer Zureikat, Assistant Professor of Surgery. To date, 15 patients have been treated in this study. In addition, the University has initiated enrollment in an additional cancer study of peritoneal surface malignancies which includes Ampligen® as an immune enhancer. To date, 46 patients have been treated. The University has initiated enrollment into another cancer study of recurrent ovarian cancer patients which includes Ampligen® as a component of the treatment regimen. To date, 6 patients have been treated in the study (1 patient did not receive Ampligen). The University has received Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval for another cancer study of subjects with chemo-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer which also includes Ampligen® as an immune enhancer. Enrollment into this study has not yet been initiated.
 
In May 2014, we announced that one of our advanced stage biological products, Alferon® N, significantly inhibited the replication of the MERS virus in vitro. MERS-CoV is a human coronavirus responsible for the lethal pulmonary syndrome known as MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome). Testing in laboratories of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, has revealed that Alferon® N was inhibitory to MERS-CoV both when used before test cells were exposed to MERS-CoV, as well as after the cells were exposed to the deadly virus. NIAID researchers led the Alferon® N MERS-CoV experiments. They treated monkey kidney cells with Alferon® N either 18 hours prior to infection with MERS-CoV (“pre-treatment”) or 1 hour following infection with MERS-CoV (“post-treatment”). At Day 1 and Day 3, supernatants were collected from cells and virus titers were thereafter measured. In both cases, Alferon® N showed significant dose-dependent inhibitory effects, thus suggesting the potential of Alferon® N both as a preventive and a potential treatment. Laboratory (in vitro) studies of potential antiviral agents are not necessarily predictive of clinical benefits. The Company was not involved in conducting the experiments.
 
In June 2014, we announced that we have confirmed that Alferon® N inhibits replication of the MERS virus in vitro. Chien-Te (Kent) Tseng, Ph.D., Associate Professor, Microbiology & Immunology at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, led the Alferon® N MERS-CoV experiments. Calu-3 cells were treated with Alferon® N 24 hours prior to infection with MERS-CoV. At 36 hours, supernatants were collected from cells and the virus titers were thereafter measured. Alferon® N showed significant dose-dependent inhibitory effects, thus suggesting the potential of Alferon® N as a preventative. Laboratory (in vitro) studies of potential antiviral agents are not necessarily predictive of clinical benefits. The Company supplied the Alferon® N, but was not directly involved in conducting the experiments.

In July 2015, we submitted an application for orphan drug designation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Alferon® N to treat MERS and on January 6, 2016, the EMA forwarded to us both its Public Summary of Opinion and its record designation approving the Orphan Medicinal Products Designation for Alferon® N Injection, also known as interferon alfa-n3, as a potential treatment of MERS.
 
On January 11, 2017, we announced that the rintatolimod European Early Access Program (“EAP”) through our agreement with Impatients designed to enable access of Ampligen® to ME/CFS patients has been extended to pancreatic cancer patients beginning in the Netherlands. Impatients, doing business as MyTomorrows, is our exclusive service provider in Europe and Turkey and will manage all EAP activities relating to the pancreatic cancer extension of the program. A competent authority in the Netherlands has recently approved 50 patients for treatment in the EAP for pancreatic cancer including a funding mechanism to remunerate us for the use of Ampligen® in the program.
 
Ebola
 
We announced, in September 2014, a series of collaborations designed to determine the potential effectiveness of Alferon® N and Ampligen® as potential preventative and/or therapeutic treatments for Ebola related disorders. Our two platform drugs Alferon® N and Ampligen®, have certain unique structural attributes and developmental histories which suggest potential incremental value with respect to inclusion in various Ebola therapeutic cocktails under development. These collaborations have resulted in the following reports being issued:

● | November 2014 - We received a report from the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (“USAMRIID”) scientists stating that they had in vitro data indicating that Alferon®, the only multi-species, natural alpha interferon commercially approved in the U.S., successfully protected human cells against the Ebola virus (EBOV). 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | November 2014 - We announced that we had received a new research report from Professor Tramontano in the Department of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Cagliari, Italy. This biochemical study demonstrated that Ampligen® successfully binded to the lethal Ebola Virus protein designated VP35. VP35 protein normally inactivates a patient’s immune/antiviral system by binding to viral dsRNA thereby sequestering a critical antiviral/immune activator of the body, which leads to high morbidity and death rates. Ampligen® competes with viral dsRNA for VP35 binding and this finding is consistent with studies at USAMRIID demonstrating that Ampligen® inhibits Ebola virus infectivity in vitro.
● | December 2014 - We announced that we received a new research report from researchers at Howard University, Washington DC. The report described a study in which Ampligen® strongly inhibited the Ebola mini-genome in the human embryonic kidney cell system.

● | February 2015 - We announced results of an efficacy study of Ampligen® in a mouse model of EBOV infection performed by scientists at the USAMRIID. Ampligen® was utilized with a mouse adapted Ebola virus using multiple groups of mice with varying dosage schedules of Ampligen® given every other day. The most effective dose, resulting in 100% percent survival at Day 21, corresponded to a human dose of approximately 400 mg, which has been used clinically approximately 50,000 times and has been generally well-tolerated when administered twice weekly. When higher doses of Ampligen® were used in the Ebola-infected mice, the survival rate dropped to 90%. The Ebola-infected mice treated with placebo had a 100% death rate by Day 7 post-infection. The EBOV data obtained from the in vitro and mouse infection studies using Ampligen® suggest a potential prophylactic and/or early onset therapeutic role in EVD. Previously published experimental results of animal studies using models of other lethal viral infections indicate possible similar applications to other lethal viral diseases. However, in vitro and animal testing is no assurance of human safety or efficacy for viral diseases. Clinical studies would be necessary to establish human efficacy and safety of Ampligen® for any treatment and/or prevention indication.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Positive results from a non-human primate (“NHP”) study in all probability may be required before initiation of human clinical testing of Ampligen® in patients with Ebola Virus Disease (“EVD”). Clinical studies would also be necessary to establish human safety and efficacy of Ampligen® for either treatment and/or prevention of EVD. Clinical safety and tolerability data obtained for one indication, for example, CFS, may be different for another disorder like EVD. Currently, because of the limited number of facilities that can conduct EBOV studies in NHP, the scheduling of a NHP study has been delayed.
 
Our European subsidiary, Hemispherx Biopharma Europe N.V./S.A., has been formally notified of a positive opinion from the COMP (Committee on Medical Products) regarding its Orphan Medicinal Product Application for Ampligen®, an experimental therapeutic, to treat Ebola Virus Disease (EVD). The European Medicines Agency (EMA) published on May 22, 2015 both its Public Opinion Summary and its record designation approving the Orphan Medicinal Product Designation for Ampligen®, also known as rintatolimod experimental therapeutic, to treat Ebola Virus Disease (EVD).
 
Our overall objectives include plans to continue seeking approval for commercialization of Ampligen® in the United States and abroad as well as to widen existing commercial therapeutic indications of Alferon® N Injection presently approved in the United States and Argentina. Laboratory experiments do not necessarily indicate clinical benefit. Some of the research both past and present has been, and may in the future be, sponsored in part by contracts or grants from us to various independent research entities.
 
MANUFACTURING
 
We had a Supply Agreement with Jubilant Hollister-Stier Laboratories LLC of Spokane, Washington (“Jubilant”), pursuant to which Jubilant would formulate and package Ampligen® from the key raw materials that Hemispherx would supply to them. This Supply Agreement expired March 11, 2014. In October 2014, we entered into a purchase commitment with Jubilant for approximately $700,000 for the manufacture of clinical batches of Ampligen®. On January 3, 2017, we entered into a purchase order to replace the previous purchase commitment with Jubilant pursuant to which Jubilant will manufacture a commercial batch of Ampligen® for us. Pursuant to the new order, Jubilant will perform tooling and validation activities as well as final fill and finish services.

On July 27, 2016, we reached an agreement with Avrio Biopharmaceuticals, now Nitto Denko Avecia Inc. (“Avecia”) to serve as an additional contract manufacturer of Hemispherx’s experimental drug, Ampligen®. The new cGMP lot was completed in December and was released in January 2017 for use in the Early Access Program (“EAP”) in Europe. Please see “Risks Associated with Our Business” in Item 1A. Risk Factors below - There are no long-term agreements with suppliers of required materials and services for Ampligen® and there are a limited number of raw material suppliers. If we are unable to obtain the required raw materials and/or services, we may not be able to manufacture Ampligen®.
 
The construction of the $8 million facility enhancement project was completed in 2015 which, upon FDA approval, should provide for a higher capacity and more cost effective manufacturing process for the production of Alferon N Injection®. Commercial sales of Alferon® and Alferon® API internationally are projected to begin as soon as the necessary regulatory approvals are obtained. However, commercial sales of Alferon® in the USA will not resume until new batches of commercial filled and finished product are produced and released by the FDA. We are continuing the validation of Alferon® production and production of new Alferon® API inventory commenced in February 2015. While the facility is approved by the FDA under the Biological License Application (“BLA”) for Alferon®, this status will need to be reaffirmed by an FDA pre-approval inspection. We will also need the FDA’s approval to release commercial product once we have submitted satisfactory stability and quality release data. We had anticipated that it would take until at least the 2nd half of 2015 before we would have Alferon® approved for commercial sales; however, during the final stage of the manufacturing process we encountered issues regarding a change in both the contract supplier of leukocytes and the long term supply availability related to a reagent used in the formulation of Alferon®. We have resolved these issues through engaging in multiple agreements with suppliers of leukocytes as well as entering into a licensing agreement with a foreign multinational chemicals and biotechnology company that has been in business for over a century for the sourcing of the primary reagent allowing us to manufacture Alferon®. However, due to the interruption of the required flow of leukocytes, production ceased, causing parts to malfunction in the upstream process when the system was restarted for testing. We were working diligently to make the necessary repairs to be able to restart the validation process; however, in the process of obtaining time estimates for the repairs we experienced a flood within portions of our manufacturing facility. As a result, we are constrained in our ability to manufacture product in the near future due to this flood in the upstream processing cleanroom that contains the bioreactor. The flood occurred on the afternoon of January 5, 2016, caused by a malfunctioning water supply pipe for the sprinkler system covering a large amount of the cleanroom in stagnant water and silt from the sprinkler system. Our facility insurer has been proactive in addressing and covering the loss. While repairs have required preapproval by our insurer, activity moved forward quickly. The repairs noted below required special action because of the need to keep this critical manufacturing room within International Organization for Standardization (ISO) classifications and the need to certify that all the equipment that was exposed, or submerged, is in proper condition and operating effectively following the corrective actions. All HEPA filters affected by the flood were tested by an outside contractor and passed all required tests. The flooring that was damaged was repaired using a special epoxy that is used in cleanrooms. A large portion of the walls in the ISO classified area were damaged. We had a damage mitigation company come in to stop any moisture from seeping further into the ISO classified areas. Subsequently, all damaged walls and ceilings were replaced with cleanroom grade materials and require no further repair. Six pumps that were affected by the flood were sent back to the manufacturer for inspection and repair. Repairs that were required were completed on the pumps and they were reinstalled in the Alferon® manufacturing facility after the floor repair work was completed. All pumps will need to be qualified for use in the manufacturing process prior to the validation process for a Pre-Approval Inspection. All air ducts supplying the Alferon® manufacturing area were cleaned and the insulation replaced along with ceiling tiles. All smaller pieces of machinery and equipment that could not be salvaged have been replaced. We also completed the HVAC air balancing and qualification. At this time, we believe that all repairs to the manufacturing facility have been completed.

We also are exploring the possibility of mortgaging our facility or selling it if we can obtain a long term lease back on the facility on acceptable terms.
 
Currently, the manufacturing process is on hold and there is no definitive timetable to have the facility back online. Due to the Company extending the timeline of Alferon® production to an excess of one year, we reclassified Alferon® work-process-inventory to other assets within our balance sheet as of December 31, 2016. In addition, due to the high cost estimates to bring the facility back online, we most likely will need additional funds to finance the revalidation process in our facility to initiate commercial manufacturing, thereby readying ourselves for an FDA Pre-Approval Inspection. If we are unable to gain the necessary FDA approvals related to the manufacturing process and/or final product of new Alferon® inventory, our operations most likely will be materially and/or adversely affected. In light of these contingencies, there can be no assurances that the approved Alferon N Injection® product will be returned to production on a timely basis, if at all, or that if and when it is again made commercially available, it will return to prior sales levels.
 
To formulate, fill, finish and package (“fill and finish”) Alferon N Injection® drug product, we require a FDA approved third party Contract Manufacturing Organization (“CMO”). In January 2012, we agreed to a Technology, Transfer, Validation and Commercial Supply Agreement with Ajinomoto Althea, Inc., formerly Althea Technologies, Inc. (“Althea”) of San Diego, CA, regarding the fill and finish process for Alferon® N Injection®. In November 2014, we entered into a purchase commitment with Althea for approximately $622,000 for the production of validation batches of Alferon® N Injection for emergency use and/or commercial sale. We have paid approximately $210,000 to Althea with regard to this open purchase commitment as of December 31, 2016 and has recorded this amount within Work-In-Process inventory.

MARKETING/DISTRIBUTION
 
Our marketing strategy for Ampligen® reflects the differing health care systems around the world along with the different marketing and distribution systems that are used to supply pharmaceutical products to those systems. We expect that, subject to receipt of FDA, ANMAT and/or other regulatory approval, Ampligen® may be utilized in four medical arenas: physicians’ offices, clinics, hospitals, and the home treatment setting. In preparation for the FDA’s consideration of our Ampligen® NDA, we undertook early stage development of pre-launch and launch driven marketing plans focusing on audience development, medical support and payer reimbursement initiatives which could facilitate product acceptance and utilization at the time of regulatory approval, if obtained. Similarly, we continued to consider distribution scenarios for the Specialty Pharmacy/Infusion channel which could provide market access, offer 3PL (third party logistics) capabilities and provide the requisite risk management control mechanisms. It is our intent to utilize third party service providers to execute elements of both the marketing/sales and distribution plans. As a possible option, we considered a plan to utilize a small group of Managed Market account managers to introduce the product to payor, employer and government account audiences. We believe that this approach could establish a market presence and facilitate the generation of revenue without incurring the substantial costs associated with a traditional sales force. Furthermore, Management believes that any approach considered should enable us to retain multiple options for future marketing strategies.
 
In January 2010, we engaged an Argentinean regulatory and business design entity to explore the possibility of initiating clinical trials of Alferon N Injection®, Ampligen® and Alferon® LDO during the influenza season in Argentina. On June 14, 2010, we executed a five year exclusive Sales, Marketing, Distribution and Supply Agreement for Argentina with GP Pharm Latinoamerica (“GP Pharm”), an affiliate company of Spanish GP Pharm SA. Under this Agreement, GP Pharm is responsible for gaining regulatory approval in Argentina for Ampligen® to treat CFS in Argentina and for commercializing Ampligen® for this indication in Argentina. We granted GP Pharm the right to expand rights to sell this experimental therapeutic into other Latin America countries based upon GP Pharm achieving certain performance milestones. We also granted GP Pharm an option to market Alferon N Injection® in Argentina and other Latin America countries. Under these agreements, we will manufacture and supply Ampligen® and Alferon N Injection® to GP Pharm. On November 15, 2010, we amended our June 15, 2010 agreement with GP Pharm to include Mexico in the Territory under the Sales, Marketing, Distribution and Supply Agreement. Under this Agreement, GP Pharm Mexico will be responsible for seeking regulatory approval in Mexico for Ampligen®, an experimental therapeutic, to treat CFS in Mexico and, if approval is obtained, for commercializing Ampligen® for this indication in Mexico. On May 24, 2016, we entered into a five year exclusive Renewed Sales, Marketing, Distribution and Supply Agreement (the “Agreement”) with GP Pharma whereby all material provisions within the Agreement remained consistent with the original agreement.

In January 2012, the ANMAT approved the sale and distribution of Alferon N Injection® (under the brand name “Naturaferon”) in Argentina. The receipt of the ANMAT approval for HPV is the first step of a regulatory process towards the commercial sales of Naturaferon®. On September 20, 2012, we filed with ANMAT an amended NDA for the use of Alferon N Injection® in patients with chronic hepatitis C who have become refractory to recombinant interferon as a result of the appearance of neutralizing antibodies against recombinant interferon. On February 6, 2013, we received the ANMAT approval for the treatment of refractory patients, that failed or were intolerant to treatment with recombinant interferon, with Naturaferon® in Argentina.
 
On September 6, 2011, we executed an amended agreement with Asembia, formerly Armada Healthcare, LLC, to undertake the marketing, education and sales of Alferon N Injection® throughout the United States. This agreement also provides start-up along with ongoing sales and marketing support to the Company. On July 31, 2015, it was mutually agreed upon to extend this agreement through August 14, 2017 subject to the same terms and conditions. We previously extended this agreement for the previous three years also under the same terms and conditions. Due to our manufacturing process for Alferon® being on hold and there being no definitive timetable to have the facility back online, we will review our expiring agreement on August 14, 2017 with Asembia.
 
On September 6, 2011, we executed a new agreement with specialty distributor, BioRidge Pharma, LLC (“BioRidge”) to warehouse, ship, and distribute Alferon N Injection® on an exclusive basis in support of U.S. sales. On July 31, 2015, it was mutually agreed upon to extend this agreement through August 14, 2017 subject to the same terms and conditions. We previously extended this agreement for the previous three years also under the same terms and conditions. Due to our manufacturing process for Alferon® being on hold and there being no definitive timetable to have the facility back online, we will review our expiring agreement on August 14, 2017 with Asembia.
 
On March 9, 2015, we executed an agreement with Emerge Health Pty Ltd. (“Emerge”) to seek approval of Ampligen® for CFS in Australia and New Zealand and to commence distribution of Ampligen® in both countries on a named-patient basis, where deemed appropriate. The parties intend to collaborate on seeking regulatory approval from Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Administration (“TGA”) and New Zealand’s Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Authority (“Medsafe”). Under this five-year exclusive license to sell, market, and distribute Ampligen in Australia and New Zealand to treat CFS, Emerge will implement regulatory-compliant programs to educate physicians about Ampligen® for CFS and seek orphan drug designation and approval of Ampligen® to treat CFS. Hemispherx will support these efforts and will supply Ampligen® at a predetermined transfer price. We have the right to buy out of the agreement at a price equal to three times Ampligen® sales for the preceding 12 months if exercised within the first two years or two times such sales if exercised after year three. We have determined to maintain local expertise in handling the regulatory aspects of treating patients with an unapproved product and have elected not to pursue individual patient use in these territories and have subsequently terminated the agreement in 2017.

On May 24, 2016, we entered into an amended and restated five year agreement (the “Impatients Agreement”) with Impatients, N.V. (“Impatients”), a Netherlands based company doing business as myTomorrows, for the commencement and management of an Early Access Program (“EAP”) in Europe and Turkey (the “Territory”) related to CFS. Pursuant to the agreement, Impatients, as our exclusive service provider and distributor in the Territory, is performing EAP activities. These activities will be directed to (a) the education of physicians and patients regarding the possibility of early access to innovative medical treatments not yet the subject of a Marketing Authorization (regulatory approval) through named-patient use, compassionate use, expanded access and hospital exemption, (b) patient and physician outreach related to a patient-physician platform, (c) the securing of Early Access Approvals (exemptions and/or waivers required by regulatory authorities for medical treatments prior to Marketing Authorization) for the use of such treatments, (d) the distribution and sale of such treatments pursuant to such Early Access Approvals, (e) pharmacovigilance (drug safety) activities and/or (f) the collection of data such as patient-reported outcomes, doctor-reported experiences and registry data. We are supporting these efforts and supplying Ampligen® to Impatients at a predetermined transfer price. In the event that we receive Marketing Authorization in any country in the Territory, we will pay Impatients a royalty on products sold. Pursuant to the Impatients Agreement, the royalty would be a percentage of Net Sales (as defined in the Impatients Agreement) of Ampligen® sold in the Territory where Marketing Authorization was obtained, and the maximum royalty would be a percentage of Net Sales. The formula to determine the percentage of Net Sales will be based on the number of patients that are entered into the EAP. The parties established a Joint Steering Committee comprised of representatives of both parties to oversee the EAP. No assurance can be given that activities under the EAP will result in Marketing Authorization or the sale of substantial amounts of Ampligen® in the Territory. In 2017, the Company commenced sales of recently manufactured Ampligen® in international programs.
 
On January 11, 2017, we announced that the rintatolimod European Early Access Program (“EAP”) through our agreement with Impatients designed to enable access of Ampligen® to ME/CFS patients has been extended to pancreatic cancer patients beginning in the Netherlands. Impatients, doing business as MyTomorrows, is our exclusive service provider in Europe and Turkey and will manage all EAP activities relating to the pancreatic cancer extension of the program. A competent authority in the Netherlands has recently approved 50 patients for treatment in the EAP for pancreatic cancer including a funding mechanism to remunerate us for the use of Ampligen® in the program.
 
On August 6, 2015, we executed an agreement with Emerge to seek approval of Alferon N Injection® in Australia and New Zealand and to commence distribution of Alferon® in both countries on a named-patient basis, for treating genital warts and other infections and diseases to which patients in Australia and New Zealand have become refractory to recombinant interferon. Hemispherx and Emerge will collaborate on seeking regulatory approval from Australia’s TGA and New Zealand’s Medsafe. Under a five-year exclusive license to sell, market, and distribute Alferon N Injection® in Australia and New Zealand, Emerge will implement regulatory-compliant programs to educate physicians about Alferon®. Hemispherx will support these efforts and will supply Alferon® at a predetermined transfer price. We have the right to buy out of the agreement at a price equal to three times Alferon® sales for the preceding 12 months if exercised within the first two years or two times such sales if exercised after year three.

COMPETITION
 
RNA based products and toll-like receptors (“TLRs”) have demonstrated great promise in pre-clinical and limited clinical applications resulting in active research and development by large pharmaceutical companies and emerging biotech firms. As such, our potential competitors are among the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world, are well known to the public and the medical community, and have substantially greater financial resources, product development, and manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we have.
 
These companies and their competing products may be more effective and less costly than our products. In addition, conventional drug therapy, surgery and other more familiar treatments will offer competition to our products. Furthermore, our competitors have significantly greater experience than we do in pre-clinical testing and human clinical trials of pharmaceutical products and in obtaining FDA (in the US), European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) and Health Protection Branch (“HPB”) (in Canada), and other regulatory approvals of products. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining FDA, EMEA and HPB product approvals before we do. If any of our products receive regulatory approvals and we commence commercial sales of our products, we will also be competing with respect to manufacturing efficiency and marketing capabilities, areas in which we have no experience. Our competitors may possess or obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that prevent, limit or otherwise adversely affect our ability to develop or exploit our products.
 
The major pharmaceutical competitors with biotech capabilities/vaccine franchises include Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck & Co., Novartis and AstraZeneca. Biotech competitors include Baxter International, Fletcher/CSI, AVANT Immunotherapeutics, AVI BioPharma and Genta. When we recommence sales of Alferon N Injection®, it will compete with Intron® A, an injectable from Merck & Co., that attempts to kill the virus and prevent reproduction along with topical treatments that are normally applied by a doctor that have a risk of damaging the skin around the wart, such as:
 

● | Aldara®, also known as Imiquimod®, is a cream which is marketed to boost the immune systems in an attempt to rid itself of genital warts;

● | Veregen® is a herbal product made from green tea leaves which is self-administered as an ointment and is used to treat external genital warts in adult patients; 
● | Condylox® Solution (podofilox) and Podofin® (podophyllin resin) are liquids applied externally using a cotton applicator or finger which attempts to destroy genital warts by halting cell growth; and
● | Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) or Bichloroacetic acid (BCA) are chemical treatments which attempt to externally “burn off” genital warts. 

GOVERNMENT REGULATION
 
Regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S. and foreign countries is and will be a significant factor in the manufacture and marketing of Alferon® products and our ongoing research and product development activities. Ampligen® and other products developed from the ongoing research and product development activities will require regulatory clearances prior to commercialization. In particular, new drug products for humans are subject to rigorous pre-clinical and clinical testing as a condition for clearance by the FDA and by similar authorities in foreign countries. The lengthy process of seeking these approvals, and the ongoing process of compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, has and will continue to require the expenditure of substantial resources. Any failure by us or our collaborators or licensees to obtain, or any delay in obtaining, regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect the marketing of any products developed by us and our ability to receive product or royalty revenue. We have received Orphan Drug designation for certain therapeutic indications, which we believe might under certain conditions, help to accelerate the process of drug development and commercialization. Alferon N Injection® is only approved for use in intralesional treatment of refractory or recurring external genital warts in patients 18 years of age or older. Use of Alferon N Injection® for other applications requires regulatory approval.

We are subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and recommendations relating to such matters as safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices, the experimental use of animals and the use of and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents, used in connection with our research work. Prior to our construction phase, our laboratory and production facility in New Brunswick, New Jersey was approved for the manufacture of Alferon N Injection®. While our facility had been granted approval of its BLA by the FDA for the manufacture of Alferon®, this status will need to be reaffirmed as we have completed the facility’s enhancements and believe it will again be able to obtain FDA approval. However, there can be no assurance that this facility, or facilities owned and operated by third parties that are utilized in the manufacture of our products, will obtain and/or continue to maintain FDA approval. For information about the current status of our Ampligen® NDA please see “Our Products; Ampligen®” above.
 
HUMAN RESOURCES
 
As of March 1, 2017, we had personnel consisting of 32 full-time employees and 2 part-time employees. Twenty-three (23) of the combined personnel are engaged in our research, development, clinical, and manufacturing effort with 11 performing regulatory, general administration, data processing, including bio-statistics, financial and investor relations functions. We have no union employees.
 
While we have been successful in attracting skilled and experienced scientific personnel, there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain the necessary qualified employees and/or consultants in the future.
 
DATA MONITORING COMMITTEE
 
We meet with experts from time to time in areas of clinical and scientific interest.
 
In May 2010, we formed a Data Monitoring Committee (“DMC”) that consists of two independent regulatory and medical experts along with a biostatistics expert. The function of the DMC is to perform independent safety and efficacy analyses on our clinical trials. During 2014, 2015 and 2016, the DMC focused its attention on the clinical trial (AMP-600) in which Ampligen® is being nasally administered in conjunction with FluMist® to healthy human volunteers at the University of Alabama at Birmingham under the auspices of Dr. Paul Goepfert. As required by the study’s protocol, the DMC has held three meetings and has reviewed the safety data on the first 12 subjects enrolled in Stage 1 and approved the study to proceed to Stage 2 which began in March 2014. As of December 31, 2016, the study is closed after enrolling 25 subjects in Stage 2. Closure of the study was due to the recommendation of CDC of not using a live attenuated influenza vaccine during 2016-2017.
