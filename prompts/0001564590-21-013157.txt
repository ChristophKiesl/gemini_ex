 We are pioneering a new class of oligonucleotide-based therapies called Antibody Oligonucleotide Conjugates, or AOCs, designed to overcome the current limitations of oligonucleotide therapies in order to treat a wide range of serious diseases. We utilize our proprietary AOC platform to design, engineer and develop therapeutics that combine the tissue selectivity of monoclonal antibodies, or mAbs, and the 
 1

precision of oligonucleotide therapies in order to access previously undruggable tissue and cell types and more effectively target underlying genetic drivers of diseases. We are initially focused on muscle diseases to demonstrate the capabilities of our AOCs, and our muscle franchise consists of five programs. Our lead product candidate, AOC 1001, is designed to treat myotonic dystrophy type 1, or DM1, a rare monogenic muscle disease. Following regulatory clearance, we plan to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of AOC 1001 in the second half of 2021. We also intend to advance AOC product candidates in our four other muscle programs focused on the treatment of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, or FSHD, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or DMD, muscle atrophy and Pompe disease. In addition to our muscle franchise, we have development efforts focused on immune, cardiac and other cell types. 
 Our AOC Platform 
 Oligonucleotide therapeutics are designed based on genomic information to specifically inhibit or modify the expression of disease-related proteins and RNAs. Considerable progress has been made toward harnessing the potential of oligonucleotides, and multiple oligonucleotide therapies have been approved for the treatment of several diseases. However, in light of their physical properties, effective systemic delivery of oligonucleotides to a broad range of cells and organs has been one of the most significant factors limiting their utility. Our deep experience with oligonucleotide therapeutics, modulation of RNA processes, antibody engineering and conjugation, and drug delivery techniques provide the foundation for our efforts to address some of the key limitations of oligonucleotide therapies. We collectively refer to the know-how and proprietary technology born out of this experience, and their systematic application in the design and development of our product candidates, as our AOC platform. 
 Using our AOC platform, we have established a framework for screening potential cell surface protein-mAb pairs to determine which pairs are well-suited to deliver oligonucleotides to specific cell types to induce pharmacologic changes. In addition to engineering optimized mAbs, we are able to engineer and deploy various types of oligonucleotides whose specific mechanisms of action are designed to modify RNA function in different ways. This flexibility allows us to use oligonucleotides tailored to have the potential to modulate a given disease process, and we further engineer our oligonucleotides to maximize their specificity, potency and stability. Beyond the specific mAb and oligonucleotide components of our engineered AOCs, we also optimize the antibody conjugate design, including the linker, for stability and durability. 
 We believe that the product candidates derived from our AOC platform will have the potential to offer the following distinct advantages: 
  
● | Expand scope of diseases addressable with oligonucleotides: (i) utilize identified cell surface protein-antibody pairs to design oligonucleotides in order to address various previously undruggable tissue and cell types to induce pharmacologic changes in those tissues and cells; (ii) flexibility to deploy an appropriate oligonucleotide type for different diseases; and (iii) optimize all structural components of our AOCs for effective delivery—the oligonucleotide, the mAb and the antibody conjugate design.

● | Potential to mitigate toxicity by limiting drug exposure: (i) selection of the most potent oligonucleotide type; (ii) targeted delivery to tissues and cells; and (iii) infrequent administration.

● | Readily reproducible and scalable: (i) AOCs synthesized using well-established and scalable methods for manufacturing mAbs and oligonucleotides; and (ii) ability to use a single mAb across multiple programs provides significant leverage around development costs and timelines associated with each incremental muscle program. For example, we use the same mAb targeting TfR1 across all our muscle programs.

 We are initially focused on muscle diseases for which we believe our AOC approach can overcome the limitations of current oligonucleotide therapies. For example, a single dose of an AOC administered to 
 2

mice demonstrated a 95% reduction of target gene expression in mouse skeletal muscle, which in part led us to focus on developing a pipeline of AOCs in muscle diseases. 
 The first program in our muscle franchise is for the treatment of DM1 and we are developing our lead product candidate, AOC 1001, as a potentially disease-modifying therapeutic. DM1 is a monogenic, autosomal dominant, progressive disease that primarily affects skeletal and cardiac muscle and is caused by a mutation in the dystrophy myotonic protein kinase, or DMPK, gene product or DMPK RNA. DM1 is estimated to affect over 40,000 people in the United States and there are similar prevalence estimates for Europe. However, we believe that, consistent with other rare diseases, the patient population is currently underdiagnosed due to the lack of available therapies. AOC 1001 consists of a proprietary mAb that binds to a transporter protein, transferrin receptor 1, or TfR1, conjugated with a small interfering RNA, or siRNA, that is designed to address the underlying cause of DM1 by reducing the levels of DMPK RNA. In preclinical studies, we observed the ability of our AOC to deliver siRNAs to muscle cells, and reduce levels of messenger RNA, or mRNA, for the DMPK gene, the molecular driver of the disease, in a durable, dose-dependent manner, meaning a long-lasting effect that is proportional to the amount of the AOC administered. Following regulatory clearance, we plan to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of AOC 1001 in patients in the second half of 2021 to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and exploratory clinical measures associated with AOC 1001. Due to the lack of available therapies in this rare disease, should our trial be successful, we plan to explore the potential to advance AOC 1001 into registrational trials in order to expedite making AOC 1001 available for a patient population in severe need. 
 We also are developing AOCs to treat the underlying causes of FSHD, DMD, muscle atrophy and Pompe disease. FSHD is one of the most common forms of muscular dystrophy, with onset typically in teens and young adults. FSHD occurs in approximately one in every 20,000 individuals in the United States and we estimate that FSHD affects 16,000 to 38,000 people in the United States. However, we believe that, consistent with other rare diseases, the patient population is currently underdiagnosed due to the lack of available therapies. FSHD is caused by aberrant expression of a gene, double homeobox 4, or DUX4, in adult skeletal muscle and is characterized by progressive skeletal muscle loss. Our therapeutic strategy in FSHD is to use an AOC based on our proprietary mAb targeting TfR1, to deliver an siRNA targeted to the DUX4 mRNA. We are currently in the process of advancing our AOC FSHD program into investigational new drug application, or IND, enabling studies. Following additional preparatory preclinical studies and regulatory clearance, we plan to initiate clinical studies in 2022 to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and exploratory clinical measures associated with the AOC FSHD program. Due to the lack of available therapies in this rare disease, should our trial be successful, we plan to explore the potential to advance our AOC FSHD program into registrational trials in order to expedite making it available for a patient population in severe need. 
 
Another program in our muscle franchise is for the treatment of DMD, which is the most common and severe form of muscular dystrophy and is progressive, irreversible and ultimately fatal. DMD occurs in approximately one in every 3,500 to 5,000 live male births and is estimated to affect 10,000 to 15,000 people in the United States. DMD is caused by mutations in the DMD gene that encodes for the gene product dystrophin, a protein critical for the normal function of muscle cells. These mutations lead to certain exons being misread resulting in the loss of function of the dystrophin protein. Our oligonucleotides are designed to promote the skipping of those exons to restore a functional version of the dystrophin protein. We are focusing our initial efforts on the development of AOCs for mutations amenable to skipping Exon 44, Exon 51 and Exon 45. We intend to conjugate the oligonucleotides to our proprietary mAb targeting TfR1. In a preclinical model of DMD, the mdx mouse model, we observed that treatment of mdx mice with an AOC caused a greater than 50-fold increase in exon skipping compared to an equimolar dose of the unconjugated oligonucleotide. We have three programs in development for DMD targeting Exon 44, Exon 51 and Exon 45. We are currently in the process of advancing our first program targeting Exon 44 into IND-enabling studies. Following additional preparatory preclinical studies and regulatory clearance, we plan to commence a clinical trial for our program targeting Exon 44 in 2022. 
 An additional program in our muscle franchise is for muscle atrophy. Muscle atrophy is the loss of skeletal muscle mass that leads to muscle weakness and physical disability and can be caused by malnutrition, medications, injury or diseases such as cachexia and many rare genetic muscle disorders. 
 3

Our product candidate will consist of our proprietary mAb targeting TfR1 conjugated with an siRNA designed to downregulate the levels of muscle RING-finger protein-1, or MuRF1, mRNA, a muscle-specific ubiquitin ligase, or E3 ligase, that has been shown to be upregulated upon induction of muscle atrophy. By targeting MuRF1, we have focused on an approach employing common effectors of both the catabolic and anabolic pathways associated with the degradation of protein in muscle cells, unlike prior attempts to find therapeutics that primarily addressed either catabolic or anabolic pathways. In preclinical studies, we observed that a single 3 mg/kg dose of the siRNA in our AOC resulted in a greater than 50% reduction in MuRF1 mRNA for over 20 weeks.  We are in the process of evaluating multiple disease models of muscle atrophy to identify an optimal development path in rare disease indications and/or in diseases that impact large patient populations. Our continued research activities will inform our view on the indications and development path to pursue. 
 We are also pursuing a program in Pompe disease, a rare muscle disease. Pompe disease is a autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease caused by a mutation in the gene that encodes for acid alpha-glucosidase, or GAA, that results in the buildup of glycogen in the body’s cells, causing impairment of normal tissue and organ function. Pompe disease is currently treated with enzyme replacement therapy, or ERT, which does not adequately address the breakdown of muscle tissue associated with the disease. Our program in Pompe disease also utilizes an AOC based on our proprietary mAb targeting TfR1 to deliver an siRNA targeting the glycogen synthetase 1, or GYS1, mRNA to diminish the toxic accumulation of glycogen in muscle. We are in the process of developing a lead candidate for Pompe disease. 
 We also intend to pursue the development of AOCs in cell types in addition to muscle. In preclinical models, we observed the ability of AOCs not only to deliver to the liver, skeletal and cardiac muscle, but also to other tissue and cell types, including immune cells. For example, we have identified multiple receptor-antibody pairs that could be used in our AOCs in order to deliver siRNAs into different immune cells, including those related to immuno-oncology. In preclinical studies, we observed significant AOC-mediated mRNA knockdown in CD8+ and CD4+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and T-regs in vivo, while also observing no effect on mRNA levels in T or B cells in the spleen. These observations around the specificity and selectivity of our AOCs are the basis for our interest in exploring the utility of our AOCs in immunology. We plan to continue to invest in our AOC platform in order to explore the potential of our AOCs in previously inaccessible tissue and cell types in order to develop next generation oligonucleotide therapies. 
 We hold worldwide development and commercialization rights to all our muscle programs. We have a disciplined strategy to maximize the value of our pipeline whereby we plan to retain development and commercialization rights to those product candidates, indications and geographies that we believe we can ultimately commercialize successfully on our own. We plan to collaborate on product candidates that we believe have promising utility in disease areas or patient populations that are better served by the resources or specific expertise of other biopharmaceutical companies. In April 2019, we entered into a Research Collaboration and License Agreement, or the Lilly Agreement, with Eli Lilly and Company, or Lilly, for the discovery, development and commercialization of AOCs directed to up to six mRNA targets initially in immunology and other select indications on a worldwide basis. In December 2020, we entered into a research collaboration with MyoKardia, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bristol Myers Squibb, to evaluate the potential utility of AOCs in cardiac tissue by leveraging MyoKardia's genetic cardiomyopathy platform including, among other aspects, its novel target discovery engine and proprietary cardiac disease models.
 
We have assembled a management team with deep experience in the discovery, development and commercialization of RNA therapeutics, including an extensive knowledge of oligonucleotide therapeutics, modulation of RNA processes, antibody engineering and conjugation, and drug delivery techniques. Our management team also has broad experience in the discovery, development and commercialization of products for rare diseases, including building clinical and commercial organizations that support the unique needs of the rare disease community.

Our Strategy 
 Our goal is to discover, develop and commercialize novel AOC therapeutics that overcome current barriers to the delivery of oligonucleotides and unlock their potential to treat a wide range of serious diseases currently lacking adequate treatment options. Key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal are to: 

● | Advance our lead product candidate AOC 1001 through clinical proof-of-concept to approval. We are developing AOC 1001 for the treatment of DM1, a serious rare monogenic disease for which there are no available therapies. Therefore, we are highly focused on a development path that could enable us to deliver a therapy to patients in need as soon as possible. AOC 1001 is specifically designed to reduce levels of DMPK mRNA, the gene product that when mutated causes DM1. In preclinical studies, we observed the ability of our AOC to deliver siRNAs to muscle cells, and reduce levels of mRNA for the DMPK gene, the molecular driver of the disease, in a durable, dose-dependent manner. Following regulatory clearance, we plan to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in the second half of 2021. Assuming that the results of our Phase 1/2 clinical trial are positive, we plan to explore the potential to advance AOC 1001 into registrational trials in order to expedite making AOC 1001 available for a patient population in severe need.

● | Progress our FSHD and DMD programs into clinical development. We are developing AOCs to treat the underlying causes of FSHD and DMD. Our therapeutic strategy in FSHD is to use an AOC based on our proprietary mAb targeting TfR1 to deliver an siRNA targeted to the DUX4 mRNA. For DMD, we employ oligonucleotides to promote the skipping of specific exons in order to address a number of specific mutations in the dystrophin gene. We have three AOC programs in preclinical development for DMD with the lead targeting Exon 44. In 2022, following regulatory clearance, we plan to commence clinical trials for both FSHD and the first program in DMD.

● | Advance our muscle atrophy program and an additional muscle disease program in preclinical development. We are evaluating AOCs in multiple disease models in muscle atrophy to identify an optimal development path in rare disease indications and/or in diseases that impact large patient populations. By targeting MuRF1, a muscle-specific E3 ligase that has been shown to be upregulated upon induction of muscle atrophy, we are developing a solution employing common effectors of both the catabolic and anabolic pathways associated with the degradation of protein in muscle cells, unlike prior attempts to find a solution by addressing only one of these pathways. Our continued development activities will inform our view on the indications and development path to pursue. We have an additional muscle program in Pompe disease where we are continuing to explore the utility of AOCs on the premise that our AOCs are well-suited to address muscle diseases caused by aberrant expression of a single gene.

● | Expand our pipeline into additional tissue and cell types. In preclinical models, we have observed the ability to deliver AOCs not only to the liver, skeletal and cardiac muscle, but also to immune cells and other tissue and cell types. In regards to potential in immuno-oncology, in preclinical studies we observed significant AOC-mediated mRNA reduction in CD8+ and CD4+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and T-regs in vivo. These observations with respect to the specificity and selectivity of our AOCs are the basis for our interest in exploring the utility of our AOCs in immunology and also serve as the basis for our collaboration with Lilly. We have recently entered into a collaboration with MyoKardia that will help us expand our therapeutic activities to include cardiac-specific indications. We plan to continue to invest in our AOC platform to explore the full potential of our AOCs in additional previously inaccessible tissue and cell types.

● | Independently commercialize any approved products in indications and geographies where we believe we can maximize value and pursue other options to realize the full potential of our platform. We have a disciplined strategy to maximize the value of our pipeline by retaining development and commercialization rights to those product candidates, indications and geographies that we believe we can ultimately commercialize successfully on our own if they are approved. We plan to collaborate on product candidates that we believe have promising utility in disease areas or patient populations that are better served by the resources or specific

Our AOC Product Platform 
 Overview 
 We are pioneering a new class of oligonucleotide-based therapies called AOCs designed to overcome the current limitations of oligonucleotide therapies in order to treat a wide range of serious diseases. We utilize our proprietary AOC platform to design, engineer and develop therapeutics that combine the tissue selectivity of mAbs and the precision of oligonucleotide therapies in order to access previously undruggable tissue and cell types and more effectively target underlying genetic drivers of diseases. All of our oligonucleotides target disease-related RNA. RNA is a polymeric molecule essential in the coding, decoding, regulation and expression of genes. We have accumulated deep experience regarding oligonucleotide therapeutics, modulation of RNA processes, antibody engineering and conjugation, and drug delivery techniques. We collectively refer to the know-how and proprietary technology born out of this experience, and their systematic application in the design and development of our product candidates, as our AOC Platform. 
Evolution of Oligonucleotide Therapeutics 
 Oligonucleotide therapeutics are typically short strands of modified RNA or DNA that are manufactured by chemical synthesis. They are designed, based on genomic information using Watson and Crick base pairing rules, to inhibit or modify the expression of specific disease-related proteins and RNAs. Because mRNA serves as the template for synthesis of all proteins, modulating the levels or function of a disease-related RNA alters the production of disease-associated proteins in a highly specific fashion which, in turn, alters disease processes. When delivered to the cells where the functional change is needed, oligonucleotides have been shown to be effective at modifying the molecular basis of the disease. 
 Considerable progress has been made toward harnessing the potential of oligonucleotides, and multiple oligonucleotide therapies have been approved for the treatment of several diseases. However, in light of their physical properties, such as their size and water solubility, effective systemic delivery of oligonucleotides to a broad range of cells and organs has been one of the most significant factors limiting their utility. 
 Single-stranded phosphorothioate oligonucleotides (often referred to as antisense oligonucleotides, or ASOs) bind nonspecifically to plasma and cell surface proteins. As a result, ASOs accumulate in the liver and the kidney as part of the natural filtering function of those organs. However, even when the liver is the target organ for delivery, the ASO’s non-specific binding and uptake results in most of the drug being delivered to non-parenchymal cells rather than the true target for therapeutic activity, hepatic parenchymal cells. As a result, many early ASO-based therapeutics were limited to organs where site-specific delivery to cells was an effective therapeutic approach, for example by intrathecal administration to the central nervous system or by intravitreal administration to the retina. 
 Unlike ASOs, the physical properties of siRNA and phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers, or PMOs, render them so they can only weakly bind to either plasma or cell surface proteins. Thus, they are ultimately cleared rapidly from plasma by renal filtration, with fractional reabsorption in the kidney. If unconjugated, or unformulated, these oligonucleotides have minimal uptake into target organs. Therefore, they require high doses to be administered frequently that increase the potential for toxicity, while yielding limited activity. 
 Despite the limitations of these early unconjugated oligonucleotide technologies, companies have employed these approaches to commercialize oligonucleotide drugs that generated an aggregate of over two billion dollars of sales in 2019. 
 6

Following these early approaches, the field turned towards finding appropriate conjugates to aid in delivery of oligonucleotides in order to increase uptake. Third parties have conjugated PMO-based oligonucleotides to charged peptides in order to penetrate cells. These peptide PMOs, or PPMOs, help increase uptake into cells such as muscle, but clearance remains relatively rapid and the accumulation of these highly-charged, cell penetrating peptides has been associated with renal functional changes. In clinical trials, these compounds have not yet demonstrated an improvement in efficacy over unconjugated PMOs or established a long-term safety profile. 
 More recently, researchers have begun to engage proteins on cell surfaces to enhance the delivery of oligonucleotides using a process called receptor-mediated uptake. Conjugating sugar molecules, or GalNAc, to oligonucleotides in order to engage asiaglycoprotein, or ASGPR, a transporter protein expressed primarily on the surface of hepatic parenchymal cells, facilitates intracellular delivery of oligonucleotide therapeutics, resulting in increased efficiency as compared to unconjugated oligonucleotides. The emerging preclinical and clinical data around the GalNAc-ASGPR approach and recent FDA approval of givosiran, which uses this approach, supports the thesis that receptor-mediated uptake is a viable delivery strategy for oligonucleotides therapies. 
 In order to increase the uptake of oligonucleotides, efforts have also been made to use antibody conjugates as a means of delivering oligonucleotides into cells. Antibodies are naturally occurring proteins produced by the immune system that first identify and then neutralize or clear antigens, such as bacteria, viruses and other substances, by selectively binding to these foreign substances. A mAb is a single, homogeneous entity that recognizes a specific molecular entity, for example a cell surface protein. Today, mAbs are frequently engineered for desired characteristics, such as high selectivity and high affinity for their target cell surface proteins and, therefore, theoretically could facilitate the trafficking of oligonucleotide therapeutics into those cells. However, we believe that others have tried and failed to make viable antibody conjugated oligonucleotides because of the failure to optimize each of the mAb, the oligonucleotide and the antibody conjugate design. Finding the right transport protein and the right mAb requires an understanding of whether there is sufficient density of the targeted cell surface receptor to move the required number of therapeutic molecules into the cell and how to traffic the therapeutic molecules appropriately. 
 Overall, we believe the advancements in the oligonucleotide field support the hypothesis that delivery of oligonucleotides can be greatly enhanced by using appropriate conjugates that are recognized by specific proteins on the surface of cells. 
 Our Approach 
 Our AOC platform was developed out of our deep experience with oligonucleotide therapeutics, modulation of RNA processes, antibody engineering and conjugation, and drug delivery techniques. Based on the data-driven hypothesis that the delivery of oligonucleotides can be greatly enhanced by using antibodies as conjugates, our scientists have established a framework for screening potential cell surface protein-mAb pairs to determine which pairs we believe are well suited to deliver active oligonucleotides to specific cell types. We have identified multiple cell surface protein-mAb pairs that can deliver oligonucleotides into various tissue and cell types to induce pharmacologic changes. For example, we have employed AOCs built on a scaffold of a mAb or mAb fragment that binds with high selectivity and affinity to TfR1 to deliver oligonucleotides to cell types outside of the liver, in particular to muscle. 
 Our AOC platform also affords us the option to deploy various types of oligonucleotides, including siRNAs and PMOs, whose specific mechanisms of action modify RNA function in different ways. This flexibility allows us to use oligonucleotides that are tailored to modulate a given disease process. Mechanisms of these oligonucleotides can range from reducing the expression of a disease-related RNA with siRNAs, to correction of aberrant processing of RNAs with splice modifying oligonucleotides. 
 In preclinical studies, our AOCs have demonstrated pharmacologic responses as measured by mRNA reduction in liver, skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, B- and T-cells and lymphocyte subsets, as well as macrophages (see Figure 1 below).

Figure 1: Percent Reduction of Target Gene Expression


Different AOCs and controls were used in each cell type, which were studied independently. The mAb/siRNA for each tissue are as follows: Liver: ASGPR/Factor VII; Muscle/Heart: TfR1/myostatin; B Cells: TfR1/HPRT; Tregs: mAbx/HPRT; CD8+TILs: TfR1/SHP2; and Macrophages: Aby/HPRT. 
Our AOC Platform Proprietary Chemistry 
 Successfully engineering an active AOC requires a sophisticated understanding of the precise characteristics of each of the components of the AOC, as well as their behavior when acting in concert. We have deployed significant know-how towards optimizing our AOCs, beginning with their individual oligonucleotide and mAb components. 
 
Optimization of the oligonucleotide. We have engineered our oligonucleotides to maximize their stability, potency and specificity. For many of our applications, the oligonucleotide we employ is a double-stranded siRNA, comprised of a passenger and guide strand. Modifications to the passenger strand are designed to reduce loading into the RNA Induced Silencing Complex, or RISC, decreasing inadvertent RNA interference activity. In comparison, modifications to the guide strand, also known as the active strand, are designed to enhance RISC loading, increasing the potential for matching sequences in newly transcribed RNA. Following a match, enzymes in the RISC will cleave the targeted mRNA, thereby effectively destroying it and reducing disease-related RNA levels (see Figure 2 below). Our siRNAs have been stabilized to withstand the nucleases in lysosomes, enhancing their ability to escape the lysosome after AOC internalization and antibody degradation. 
 Figure 2: Mechanisms of Action of Oligonucleotides Used in our AOCs
 
In preclinical studies, we observed that AOCs in circulation were stable for at least seven days. The biologic activity of the AOC was independent of plasma circulation times because the AOCs were cleared from plasma more rapidly than tissues. Once delivered into cells, our oligonucleotide therapeutics were stabilized and, particularly when loaded into the RISC, had prolonged activity. In mice treated with our AOC, 
 8

the half-life of siRNA in muscle tissue was approximately 12 days (see left panel of Figure 3 below). In comparison, the half-life of siRNA in RISC had a projected half-life of approximately 80 days, suggesting that, once in tissues, the siRNA is stabilized in RISC, prolonging the duration of action (see right panel of Figure 3 below). 
 Figure 3: Half-life of siRNA in Mice Muscle Tissue and RISC
 
Ln represents the logarithm of tissue concentration. 
 
We believe that chemical modifications to the siRNA drive their long-lived pharmacologic activity. We observed that a single dose of 3 mg/kg of an siRNA in an AOC administered to mice reduced the level of muscle RING-finger protein-1, or MuRF1, the targeted mRNA in muscle, for more than five months (see Figure 4 below). We believe that these results suggest that AOCs for muscle diseases may be given as infrequent intravenous doses similar to those that are being used with other siRNA therapeutics in the liver. 
 Figure 4: Duration of Response to Single 3 mg/kg Dose
 
Data are expressed as mean (SE) compared to saline controls.
 Optimization of the mAb. Because the mAb is the key delivery agent for our oligonucleotides, we are focused on identifying and tailoring mAbs to enhance their selectivity and minimize toxicity. For example, all our muscle programs employ our proprietary, effector function null, fully humanized IgG1 mAb targeting human TfR1. This antibody was selected to minimize interference with transferrin binding, minimizing alterations of iron uptake by the targeted cells. Further, our antibody is selective to TfR1 and does not cross-react with TfR2, which is widely expressed in the liver. Selectivity of our anti-transferrin receptor antibody for human and cynomolgus monkey TfR1 can be attributed to our antibody binding domain, to an epitope that is conserved between human TfR1 and cynomolgus monkey TfR1. To minimize antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, or ADCC, and complement fixation, we introduced mutations to eliminate effector 
 9

functions. Reduction of ADCC has been shown for the lead clones. The final clone-expressing cell was selected based on high production yields and optimized physical and chemical properties. The selected mAb demonstrated good delivery into human skeletal muscle cells in vitro and favorable bioconjugation with an siRNA, and polyclonal versions of the mAb showed favorable delivery and pharmacodynamics in studies in cynomolgus monkeys. 
 
Optimization of the antibody conjugate design. In addition to the oligonucleotide and the mAb, we have also optimized the conjugation of the two, including the linker. Our linkers are optimized for stability and durability, as evidenced by preclinical studies in which we observed enhanced stability of some linkers over others (see Figure 5 below). 
 Figure 5: AOCs with Different Linkers at 0.5 mg/kg
 
In addition to optimizing our linker, we optimize several other key aspects including sites of conjugation and the ratio of oligonucleotides to antibodies. 
 Advantages of our AOC Product Platform 
 We believe that the product candidates derived from our AOC platform will have the potential to offer the following distinct advantages: 
  
● | Expand scope of diseases addressable with oligonucleotides: (i) utilize identified cell surface protein-antibody pairs to design oligonucleotides in order to address various previously undruggable tissue and cell types to induce pharmacologic changes in those tissues and cells; (ii) flexibility to deploy an appropriate oligonucleotide type for different diseases; and (iii) optimize all structural components of our AOCs for effective delivery—the oligonucleotide, the mAb and the antibody conjugate design.

Our Development Programs 
 We have leveraged our deep experience with oligonucleotide therapeutics, modulation of RNA processes, antibody engineering and conjugation, and drug delivery techniques to build a pipeline of AOC development programs. Leveraging our access to extensive mAb libraries and our framework for screening potential cell surface protein-mAb pairs, we have studied over 100 different mAbs and dozens of siRNA sequences to form the basis of our growing pipeline. The chart below represents a summary of our wholly owned development programs, which are focused on muscle disease: 
 
In addition to our wholly owned programs in muscle disease, we also have development efforts focused on immune and other cell types. Under the Lilly Agreement, we are collaborating with Lilly for the discovery, development and commercialization of AOCs directed to up to six selected mRNA targets, in immunology and other select indications outside of muscle. Through our research collaboration with Myokardia, we are expanding our development activities to include cardiac-specific indications.
 Our Muscle Disease Franchise 
 We have selected muscle as the first tissue type in which to explore the potential of our AOCs. In our early screening efforts, we observed a 95% reduction of target gene expression in mouse skeletal muscle with the AOC we tested, which in part led us to focus on developing a deep pipeline of AOCs that are designed to address five muscle diseases—DM1, FSHD, DMD, muscle atrophy and Pompe disease. We use the same proprietary mAb targeting TfR1 across our muscle programs, which we believe gives us significant leverage of development costs and timelines associated with each incremental muscle program. 
 AOC 1001 for the Treatment of Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1 (DM1) 
 Our lead product candidate, AOC 1001, is a potentially disease-modifying treatment for DM1. AOC 1001 consists of a proprietary mAb targeting TfR1 conjugated with an siRNA that is designed to reduce levels of DMPK RNA, the gene product that when mutated causes DM1. In preclinical studies in mice and cynomolgus monkeys, we observed the ability of AOC 1001 to deliver siRNAs to muscle cells and reduce the levels of DMPK RNA. Following regulatory clearance, we plan to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of AOC 1001 in the second half of 2021. Due to the lack of available therapies for this rare disease, should our trial be successful, we plan to explore the potential to advance AOC 1001 into registrational trials in order to expedite availability of AOC 1001 to patients.

Disease Overview
DM1 is a monogenic, autosomal dominant, progressive disease that primarily affects skeletal and cardiac muscle. People with DM1 can suffer from various manifestations of the disease including myotonia and muscle weakness, respiratory problems, fatigue, hypersomnia, cardiac abnormalities, severe gastrointestinal, or GI, complications, and cognitive and behavioral impairment. 
 DM1 is caused by an increase in the number of CUG triplet repeats found in the 3’ non-coding region of the DMPK gene product. The number of repeats ranges from up to approximately 35 in healthy individuals to many thousands in people with DM1. The higher-than-normal number of CUG repeats form large hairpin loops that entrap the DMPK pre-mRNA in the nucleus and impart toxic activity, referred to as a toxic gain-of-function. Specifically, mutant DMPK pre-mRNA sequesters a critical CUG-binding protein, muscle blind-like protein, or MBNL, forming nuclear foci and inhibiting its ability to perform its normal function of guiding pre-mRNA processing of gene transcripts from many other genes. As a result, multiple pre-mRNAs that encode key proteins are mis-processed. The resulting atypical proteins that are translated ultimately cause DM1. When DMPK and CUG levels are reduced as result of DPMK mRNA level reductions, nuclear foci are diminished and MBNL can perform its normal function. This disease process is illustrated in Figure 6 below. 
 Figure 6: DM1 Disease Process

DM1 is estimated to affect over 40,000 people in the United States and there are similar prevalence estimates for Europe. However, we believe that, consistent with other rare diseases, the patient population is currently underdiagnosed due to lack of available therapies. DM1 is highly variable with respect to disease severity, presentation, and age of onset. As we advance our own efforts to better characterize the actual DM1 patient population and as the diagnoses rate improves with the advent of new therapies, we believe that the overall prevalence estimates will increase. Based on age of onset and severity of symptoms, DM1 is typically categorized into four overlapping phenotypes: late-onset; classical (adult-onset); childhood; and congenital, or cDM1.
 All forms of DM1, except the late-onset form, are associated with high levels of disease burden and premature mortality. Excluding neonatal cDM1 deaths, life expectancy ranges from 45 years to 60 years. Seventy percent of early mortality is caused by cardiorespiratory complications. Respiratory failure due to muscle weakness (especially diaphragmatic weakness), causes at least 40% of early mortality, and cardiac abnormalities, including sudden death, account for approximately 30%. The clinical course of DM1 is usually slowly progressive, but may become extremely disabling, especially when more generalized limb weakness and respiratory muscle involvement develops. Systemic manifestations such as fatigue, GI complications, incontinence and excessive daytime sleepiness greatly impact a patient’s quality of life. As a result, DM1 leads to physical impairment, activity limitations and decreased participation in social activities and work.

Phenotype | Principal Clinical Signs | Estimated % ofPeople with DM1 (Approx.) | Age of Onset 
Late-onset | Myotonia Mild muscle weakness Cataracts | <10% | 20-70 years

Childhood | Psychosocial problems Low IQ Incontinence | <10% | 1 to 10 years
Congenital (cDM1) | Infantile hypotonia Severe generalized weakness Respiratory deficits Intellectual disability Classic signs present in adults | 15% | Birth 

Current Treatment Landscape and Limitations 
 There are currently no approved therapies to treat DM1, and treatment is focused largely on symptom management. Due to the well-known challenges of delivery, a previous attempt at treating DM1 with an unconjugated antisense oligonucleotide was discontinued. Therefore, there remains a high unmet medical need for new disease modifying therapies. 
 Tideglusib, an inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase 3, or GSK3-ß, is in late-stage clinical development for the cDM1. This product candidate does not address the underlying genetic cause of the DM1. We are also aware of multiple preclinical efforts for the treatment of DM1.
 Our Solution
AOC 1001 consists of a proprietary mAb that binds to TfR1 conjugated with an siRNA, siDMPK.19, targeted to DMPK RNA, and is designed to be administered to the patient as an intravenous infusion. We believe that the following specific characteristics of AOC 1001 position it to have advantages over historical and current efforts to develop an effective therapy for people with DM1: 

∎ | Addresses the underlying cause of the disease—DM1 is caused by an increase in the number of CUG triplet repeats occurring in the DMPK gene product. AOC 1001 is designed to inhibit the level of toxic DMPK RNA, thereby reducing the CUG burden in the nucleus and thereby releasing MBNL to allow for normal mRNA processing (see Figures 7 and 8 below).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


∎ | Efficient delivery of drug substance to diseased cells—In an effort to solve for challenges identified in prior unsuccessful efforts to deliver an unconjugated oligonucleotide into muscle cells, the TfR1 antibody component of AOC 1001 facilitates efficient delivery of AOC 1001 to skeletal and cardiac muscle cells. Once inside the muscle cells, the siRNA component of AOC 1001, siDMPK.19, acts to reduce levels of DMPK mRNA in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. In preclinical studies in cynomolgus monkeys, we observed that treatment with an AOC containing siDMPK.19 produced a
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 13

 
greater than 50% reduction of DMPK mRNA across a wide range of skeletal muscles at a concentration of 1 nM or less, approximately 1,000 fold more potent than has been reported for an unconjugated antisense oligonucleotide. We also observed reductions in DMPK mRNA in the GI tract.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


∎ | Reproducible and scalable therapeutic—As with all our AOCs, AOC 1001 is readily synthesized using well-established and scalable methods for manufacturing mAbs and oligonucleotides.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our preclinical studies to date support our hypotheses on the potential advantages of AOC 1001. In in vitro experiments in cells from patients with DM1, after treatment with siDMPK.19, we observed reductions in nuclear foci, and a return to more normal splicing patterns for key genes. Additionally, marked and prolonged reduction in DMPK mRNA levels was observed in cynomolgus monkeys after administration of a single intravenous dose of an AOC consisting of the lead TfR1-Ab conjugated to siDMPK.19. Treatment in these monkeys was well-tolerated and no clinically meaningful changes in hematology, serum biochemistry or histology were observed at a dose of 6 mg/kg. Taken together, we believe these data suggest that AOC 1001 has potential to be a disease modifying therapy for the treatment of DM1, and has the potential advantage of infrequent administration. 
 Preclinical Data and Next Steps
We have observed dose-dependent and long-lasting reductions in the levels of DMPK in cynomolgus monkeys. We observed that a single dose of 2 mg/kg of siDMPK.19 included in AOC 1001 produced an approximately 75% reduction of DMPK mRNA in skeletal muscles from cynomolgus monkeys (see Figure 7 below). Similar effects were observed in cardiac muscle and the diaphragm, where we observed between a 50% to greater than 75% reduction in DMPK levels with single doses of 1 to 5 mg/kg of siDMPK.19 measured six weeks after administration (see left panel of Figure 8 below). Durability of response in the heart and diaphragm was observed in monkeys administered a single dose of 2 mg/kg where there were approximately 50% and 65% reductions in DMPK mRNA levels in cardiac muscle and diaphragm, respectively, 12 weeks after administration (see right panel of Figure 8 below).

Figure 8: DMPK mRNA Levels in Heart and Diaphragm
 
In preclinical studies in cynomolgus monkeys, we observed that treatment with an AOC containing siDMPK.19 produced a greater than 50% reduction of DMPK mRNA across a wide range of skeletal muscles at a concentration of 1 nM or less and we also observed reductions in DMPK mRNA in the jejunum and ileum (see Figure 9 below). 
 Figure 9: DMPK mRNA Expression in Skeletal Muscle and GI Tissue

There is substantial evidence that siRNA is active in the nucleus of cells and we believe that our RISC-based mechanism is preferable over other strategies. In preclinical studies, we observed that DM1 patient cells have approximately 30-times more metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1, or MALAT1, a long non-coding RNA in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm. In incubation of DM1 patient cells with an siRNA targeting two different concentrations of MALAT1, we observed reductions in the levels of MALAT1, consistent with the literature. We also observed that incubating DM1 patient cells with siDMPK.19 for seven hours reduced levels of the DMPK mRNA in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm as compared to a control (see Figure 10 below). 
 Figure 10: Nuclear and Cytoplasmic DMPK mRNA Levels in Muscle Cells from Patients with DM1
 
Because siRNA is active in the nucleus, we observed in preclinical studies that it is possible to reduce the number of MBNL-associated nuclear foci after incubation with siDMPK.19. Using fluorescence microscopy, we observed that incubation of DM1 patient cells with siDMPK.19 resulted in a release of the MBNL and quantifiable reductions in nuclear foci. In addition, we observed substantial improvements in disease-related biomarkers as measured by the splice score in the cells of patients with DM1following treatment with siDMPK.19. We used RNA-sequence, or RNA-seq, analysis of the myotubes from patients with DM1 to create a splice score for control human subjects’ cells treated with siDMPK.19 or the inactive siRNA, siDMPK.29. When patient myotubes were analyzed, there was a marked improvement in the splice score of the myotubes treated with the siDMPK.19 compared to the inactive siDMPK.29 (see Figure 11 below). The splice signature approached that of control myotubes.

Figure 11: Correction of Treatment Signature in DM1 Myotubes as Determined by RNA-seq
 
Splice score of treated DM1 myotubes was observed to be improved towards normal by incubation with siDMPK.19 (blue open circles). Mock treated DM1 myotubes (open black diamonds) show the full splice derangement. The filled circles represent the splice scores in myotubes from normal subjects treated with siDMPK. The filled black diamonds represent mock transfected myotubes from healthy individuals. 
 These data above demonstrating marked and prolonged reductions in levels of DMPK mRNA expression, nM potency, along with reductions in nuclear foci and a return to more normal splicing patterns for key genes, suggest that AOC 1001 has potential to be a potent, infrequently dosed, disease modifying therapy in DM1. The mAb targeting TfR1 conjugated with siDMPK.19 dosed in monkeys has been well tolerated and no clinically meaningful changes in hematology, serum biochemistry or histology have been observed after administration of a dose of 6 mg/kg. 
 Following regulatory clearance, we plan to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of AOC 1001 in the second half of 2021. We plan to evaluate AOC 1001 in adult-onset patients with genetically confirmed DM1 who have measurable muscle strength deficits. We will assess several measures including safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and exploratory clinical measures associated with AOC 1001. We also plan to explore the potential of AOC 1001 in the cDM1 and childhood onset patient populations. Because AOC 1001 targets the underlying cause of DM1 by reducing the level of mutant DMPK mRNA in muscle and heart tissue regardless of the number of CUG repeats, we believe it has the potential to clinically benefit all phenotypes of people with DM1. In addition, we have entered into a collaboration supporting END-DM1, a natural history study to advance the understanding of disease progression in people with DM1. We believe the results of END-DM1 will help inform the clinical development of AOC 1001.
 
Our Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHD) program
 We are pursuing our AOC FSHD program to treat the underlying cause of FSHD, one of the most common forms of muscular dystrophy.  Our therapeutic strategy in FSHD is to use an AOC based on our proprietary mAb that targets TfR1 to deliver an siRNA targeted to DUX4 mRNA. In preclinical models, we observed siRNA-mediated DUX4 silencing in muscle cells from patients with FSHD.  Following regulatory clearance, we plan to advance our AOC FSHD program into a clinical trial in 2022. Due to the lack of available therapies in this rare disease, should our trial be successful, we plan to explore the potential to 
 17

advance this program into registrational trials in order to expedite making an AOC available for a patient population in severe need.
 
Disease Overview 
FSHD is characterized by progressive and asymmetric skeletal muscle loss that initially causes weakness in muscles in the face, shoulders, arms and trunk and progresses to weakness in muscles in lower body. Skeletal muscle weakness results in physical limitations throughout the whole body, including an inability to lift arms for more than a few seconds, loss of ability to show facial expressions and serious speech impediments. These symptoms cause many people affected by FSHD to become dependent on the use of a wheelchair for mobility. FSHD affects both sexes equally, with onset typically in teenage and young adult years. 
 
FSHD is an autosomal dominant disease with a high frequency of de novo mutations. FSHD is a complex disease caused by the aberrant expression of the DUX4 gene in the skeletal muscle. Expression of DUX4 and its downstream genes is the major molecular signature that distinguishes muscle tissue affected by FSHD from healthy muscle.  
 
The DUX4 gene is located in a region of the DNA that prevents expression of this toxic gene in healthy individuals. However, the inability to silence these genes in people with FSHD causes the expression of DUX4.
 
The aberrant expression of the toxic DUX4 protein leads to a series of downstream events that result in skeletal muscle wasting and compromised muscle function (see Figure 12 below). Our goal is to develop AOCs containing siRNAs targeting the disease driving DUX4 mRNA, thus preventing the downstream effects in the muscle of people with FSHD.
 
Figure 12. FSHD is Caused by Aberrant Expression of the DUX4 Gene After Birth


The FSHD Society estimated FSHD affects approximately one in 20,000 people in the United States. A recent study conducted in the Netherlands reported a more frequent prevalence of one in 8,333 people. We believe that the patient population is between 16,000 to 38,000 in the United States. As is typical in diseases with no approved therapies, we believe that these patient population estimates are conservative.
 Current Treatment Landscape and Limitations
 Currently there is no cure for FSHD, and there are no therapies to treat the underlying cause of FSHD. Current treatment approaches are focused on support for activities of daily living and mobility, 
 18

improved functioning and lowering the risk of complications. They include physical therapy, exercise, pain management and orthopedic interventions. 
 
Products currently in development to treat FSHD include losmapimod, a p38 MAPK inhibitor, which may modulate DUX4 expression, and is being evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical trial. Creatine monohydrate, a supplement that enhances muscle performance, is also being evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical trial. Neither of these two approaches directly target the driver of the disease, DUX4.  
 
Our Solution
 Our AOC FSHD program consists of our proprietary mAb that is designed to bind to TfR1 conjugated with an siRNA targeted to DUX4 mRNA and is designed to be administered to the patient as an intravenous infusion. We believe that the following specific characteristics of our AOC FSHD program position it to have advantages over historical and current efforts to develop an effective therapy for people with FSHD:  

▪ | Addresses the underlying cause of the disease—Our AOC FSHD program is designed to reduce the expression of the DUX4 mRNA, thereby reducing the expression of the DUX4 protein that in turn results in the reduced expression of the downstream genes that are believed to cause the disease. We believe these downstream genes can be used as biomarkers to assess the disease state and therapeutic activity.

Our preclinical studies to date support our hypotheses on the potential advantages of our AOC FSHD program. We believe these data suggest that our AOC FSHD program has potential to be a disease modifying therapy for the treatment of FSHD, and may have the potential advantage of infrequent administration.  
 
Preclinical Data and Next Steps
 DUX4 expression is extremely low, or even sporadic, in the muscles of people with FSHD. This makes DUX4 mRNA detection challenging and unreliable. Thus, in order to evaluate the activity of our DUX4 siRNAs, we took advantage of well-established DUX4 downstream-target genes and used them as surrogate biomarkers. 
 
In vitro studies of these biomarkers in muscle cells isolated from patients with FSHD demonstrated that the expression levels of five DUX4-target genes (KHDC1L, LEUTX, MBD3L2, TRIM43, ZSCAN4) were strongly reduced following treatment with DUX4 siRNA in a concentration-dependent manner. FSHD muscle cells derived from patient samples were transfected with increasing concentrations of siRNA targeting the DUX4 mRNA. All five DUX4-target genes, as well as the FSHD composite, showed a robust reduction in their expression levels that is dependent on the DUX4 siRNA concentration. We identified several active DUX4 siRNAs that strongly decreased the expression of DUX4-target gene biomarkers in multiple muscle cells from patients with FSHD (see Figure 13 below).

We then selected the most highly active siRNAs for further screening. The full concentration response for the two selected lead DUX4 siRNAs in FSHD muscle cells demonstrated a high potency of these siRNAs. We treated cells with increasing concentrations of the two lead DUX4 siRNAs and saw a reduction in gene expression of the FSHD composite of four known biomarkers - KHDC1L, LEUTX, MBD3L2, ZSCAN4 (see Figure 14 below).

 Lead siRNA candidates showed high potency with an IC50 less than one nanomolar.

Because DUX4 is not expressed in the muscles of healthy animals, we are moving forward to in vivo studies to assess target engagement and efficacy of our lead DUX4 siRNAs conjugated to anti-TfR1

mAb. We are doing this in the MCM-FLExDUX4 mouse model of FSHD that was engineered to express human DUX4 gene in skeletal muscle.
 We are currently in the process of advancing our AOC FSHD program into IND-enabling studies. Following additional preparatory preclinical studies and regulatory clearance, we plan to advance AOC 100X into a clinical trial in 2022.
 Our Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) Program 
 We are developing AOCs to treat the underlying cause of DMD. DMD is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes for dystrophin, a protein critical for the normal function of muscle cells. The oligonucleotides in our AOCs are designed to promote the skipping of specific exons to allow the production of the dystrophin gene product. We are focusing our initial efforts on the development of AOCs for mutations amenable to skipping Exon 44, Exon 51 and Exon 45 and we intend to conjugate these individual oligonucleotides to our proprietary mAb targeting TfR1. In preclinical studies, we observed that treatment of an mdx mouse with an AOC caused a greater than 50-fold increase in exon skipping compared to an equimolar dose of the unconjugated oligonucleotide. We have three programs in development for DMD which target Exon 44, Exon 51 and Exon 45. We are currently in the process of advancing our first program targeting Exon 44 into IND-enabling studies. Following additional preparatory preclinical studies and regulatory clearance, we plan to commence a clinical trial for our program targeting Exon 44 in 2022. 
 Disease Overview
DMD is a monogenic, X-linked, recessive disease caused by mutations in the gene that encodes for dystrophin. DMD almost exclusively occurs in males and is progressive, irreversible and ultimately fatal. In people with DMD, mutations in the affected gene hinder the production of normal levels of dystrophin protein, which is needed to maintain the integrity of muscle fibers. Dystrophin protein acts as a shock absorber through its role as the foundation of the dystrophin associated glycoprotein complex, or DAPC, a group of proteins that connects the inner and outer elements of muscle cells to ensure proper muscle function. The absence of functional dystrophin leads to stresses and tears of muscle cell membranes, resulting in muscle cell death and the progressive loss of muscle function. 
 For people suffering from DMD, symptoms usually begin to manifest between three and five years of age. Affected people fail to reach developmental milestones or experience motor function challenges, such as difficulty walking or climbing stairs. Muscle wasting initially presents in the legs and pelvic area and later affects the muscles of the shoulders, neck and arms. As the disease progresses, people with DMD fall frequently, can no longer run, play sports or perform most daily functions, and are further weakened by physical activity. By their early teens, people with DMD typically lose their ability to walk and become dependent on a wheelchair for mobility. By their twenties, people with DMD essentially become paralyzed from the neck down and require a ventilator to breathe. Though disease severity and life expectancy vary, a patient’s quality of life dramatically decreases over time, and death typically occurs by early adulthood from either cardiac or respiratory complications. 
 DMD occurs in approximately one in every 3,500 to 5,000 live male births and is estimated to affect 10,000 to 15,000 people in the United States. The estimated prevalence of DMD in the European Union is similar to or higher than that in the United States. A global database analysis characterized over 7,000 genetic mutations that cause DMD. Exons 44, 51 and 45 represent approximately 30% of the total mutations observed in DMD that are amenable to skipping (see Figure 15 below). 
 
21

Figure 15: Overview of DMD Exons Amenable to Skipping
 
Current Treatment Landscape and Limitations 
 Currently people with DMD are treated with corticosteroids to manage the inflammatory component of the disease. There are three approved unconjugated PMO-based oligonucleotide therapies, each addressing a specific mutation—eteplirsen approved for people with DMD amenable to Exon 51 skipping and golodirsen and viltolarsen for the treatment of people with DMD amenable to Exon 53 skipping. However, these drugs, in addition to requiring weekly intravenous infusions, have demonstrated a less than 6% mean increase in dystrophin in clinical trials. The FDA-approved labels for these drugs state that a clinical benefit has not yet been established and continued approval may be contingent upon the verification of such clinical benefit in confirmatory clinical trials. Ataluren is a small molecule drug, conditionally approved in the European Union, Iceland and South Korea for non-sense mutations in DMD in ambulatory people aged five years and older. However, in multiple clinical trials, ataluren failed to meet the both the primary endpoint of improvements in the six-minute walk test, as well as additional secondary outcome measures. The FDA issued a complete response letter for ataluren in October 2017, requesting additional evidence of effectiveness. Additional approaches currently in clinical development include PPMOs and gene therapy. 
 Our Solution
Our initial development efforts in DMD are focused on AOCs based on PMOs that can induce exon skipping specifically for Exons 44, 51 and 45 conjugated to our proprietary mAb targeting TfR1. Our lead AOC program in development for DMD targets Exon 44. We believe that our AOCs have the potential to increase the production of dystrophin in people with DMD for two reasons. First, because of recent advances in the understanding of the splicing process and placement of skipping agents on pre-mRNA described in published literature and based on these advances, we have screened for and identified PMOs with optimized skipping activity. Second, the mAb targeting TfR1 allows for more efficient delivery to muscle cells, therefore allowing for better uptake of the PMO. In preclinical studies, we also observed that our TfR1-based AOCs induced exon skipping in cardiac muscle, which we believe may address some of the cardiomyopathies in people with DMD, a key complication of the disease. Based on their mechanism of action, we believe that our AOCs could have utility in several additional DMD mutations beyond these first three. 
Preclinical Data and Next Steps 
 In an mdx mouse model of DMD, a widely accepted mouse model in DMD, we observed that conjugating an oligonucleotide designed to bind to a specific exon can induce exon skipping and production of dystrophin protein more efficiently than unconjugated oligonucleotides. Fourteen days following treatment with a single 8mg/kg dose of a mouse Exon 23-targeting PMO conjugated to a mouse-specific-
 22

mAb targeting TfR1, we observed an approximately 50-fold increase in the degree of splice switching as compared to an equimolar dose of the unconjugated PMO (see Figure 16 below). 
 Figure 16: AOC Treatment Exon Skipping
 Compared to an Unconjugated Oligonucleotide in Mouse DMD Model
 
In the gastrocnemius of mdx mice treated with varying doses of the AOC, we observed near-maximum benefit at concentrations of approximately 50-100 nM, providing us with a framework for establishing target concentration in clinical trials (see Figure 17 below). We further observed that administering the PMO conjugated to a control non-binding mAb failed to increase splice skipping to the same degree as conjugating the same oligonucleotide to the mAb targeting TfR1 (see Figure 17 below), despite achieving concentrations of PMO in the muscle in the active range of 50-100 nM. The absence of meaningful skipping with a non-targeting mAb demonstrated that non-specific uptake is inefficient compared to receptor-mediated uptake associated with the mAb targeting TfR1. We have also observed that TfR1-based AOCs induce exon skipping in cardiac muscle, which we believe may address some of the cardiomyopathies in people with DMD.

 with a TfR1 mAb AOC or Control mAb AOC
 
The PMO conjugated to a non-targeting mAb (black square) allowed for uptake into muscle, but skipping was substantially less compared to the TfR1 targeted AOC. 
 
23

In a preclinical study of human primary myocytes incubated with two different unconjugated PMOs (44 Seq 5 and 44 Seq 7), we observed substantial skipping of Exon 44 of dystrophin (see Figure 18 below). 
Figure 18: Dystrophin Skipping with Lead Candidates for Exon 44
 
We are currently in the process of advancing our lead AOC DMD program targeting Exon 44 into IND-enabling studies. Following additional preparatory preclinical studies and regulatory clearance, we plan to advance our program targeting Exon 44 into a clinical trial in 2022. 
Our Muscle Atrophy Program 
 We are in the process of evaluating multiple disease models of muscle atrophy to identify an optimal development path in rare disease indications and/or in diseases that impact large patient populations. Our AOC targeting muscle atrophy will consist of our proprietary mAb targeting TfR1 conjugated with an siRNA designed to downregulate the expression of MuRF1 RNA. By targeting MuRF1, a muscle-specific ubiquitin ligase, or E3 ligase, that has been shown by third parties to be upregulated upon induction of muscle atrophy, we are developing a solution employing common effectors of both the catabolic and anabolic pathways associated with the degradation of protein in muscle cells. While several historical attempts at developing a therapy to treat muscle atrophy have failed, those attempts followed a different approach than we are taking. In preclinical studies, we observed that a single 3 mg/kg dose of the siRNA in our AOC resulted in a greater than 50% reduction of MuRF1 in gastrocnemius skeletal muscle for over 20 weeks. The strength and scope of emerging data over this period will inform our view on ideal indications to pursue for advanced development and therefore, also our decision on the most appropriate future development path for our muscle atrophy product candidate. 
 Disease Overview
Muscle atrophy is the loss of skeletal muscle mass that leads to muscle weakness and physical disability. Muscle atrophy can be caused by immobility, aging, malnutrition, medications, or a wide range of injuries or diseases that impact the musculoskeletal or nervous system. Examples of diseases that cause muscle atrophy include those characterized by large patient populations such as cachexia, as well as many rare genetic muscle diseases. 
 Muscle atrophy is caused by a change in the balance between catabolic (protein breakdown) and anabolic (protein synthesis) signals that activate pro-inflammatory cytokine pathways that induce protein degradation or inhibit growth factor pathways that promote protein synthesis, respectively (see Figure 19 below). Genetic profiling of atrophic muscles has identified a group of E3 ligases that are upregulated upon induction of muscle atrophy. Of these, the muscle-specific E3 ligase MuRF1 has been shown to be upregulated in most in vivo models, as well as in clinical trials. Inhibiting MuRF1 expression diminishes the impact from the pro inflammatory factor side of the pathway and diminishes the growth-inhibiting effects of 
 24

the growth factor pathway (see Figure 19 below). Furthermore, genetic ablation of MuRF1 in mice has been shown by third parties to render muscles partially resistant to muscle atrophy. 
 Figure 19: Pathways for the Induction of Muscle Atrophy
 
The prevalence of muscle atrophy is widespread, spanning multiple diseases and conditions. Cachexia, a muscle wasting syndrome caused by an underlying disease such as cancer, is estimated to affect 50% to 80% of all cancer patients, and contributes to a significant portion of all cancer deaths. 
Current Treatment Landscape and Limitations 
 Current treatments for muscle atrophy primarily focus on nutritional intake and physical exercise. Historically, attempts to develop a therapy addressing the underlying disease have included anti-inflammatory agents and drugs that either activate protein synthesis (including myostatin inhibitors) or inhibit protein degradation. None of these approaches have been successful in clinical trials. We believe that these approaches failed in clinical trials because they focused on single pathways and on the regulation of either catabolic or anabolic mechanisms. Muscle atrophy involves multiple pathways and the simultaneous activation and inhibition of catabolic and anabolic mechanisms, respectively. Contrary to previous attempts, by targeting E3 ligases such as MuRF1, we are regulating common effectors of both the catabolic and anabolic pathways involved in the induction of muscle atrophy. 
Preclinical Data and Next Steps 
 In a commonly used model of muscle atrophy (denervation), pre-treatment of mice with an AOC comprised of the mouse mAb targeting TfR1 conjugated with an siRNA targeted against MuRF1 (at 6 mg/kg) showed a 54% sparing of muscle cross sectional area, or CSA, on Day 28 after dosing (see left panel of Figure 20 below) and 35% sparing of weight (see right panel of Figure 20 below) on Day 17 compared to mice treated with an AOC with a control siRNA. The results of this study replicate data from the same model in mice with MuRF1 genetically ablated. 
 25

We are in the process of evaluating multiple disease models of muscle atrophy to identify an optimal development path in rare disease indications and/or in diseases that impact large patient populations. Following additional preparatory preclinical studies and regulatory clearance, we plan to advance our product candidate into a clinical trial for muscle atrophy. 
  The strength and scope of emerging data over this period will inform our view on ideal indications to pursue and the most appropriate future development path for our muscle atrophy product candidate. Should we determine that we are pursuing muscle atrophy associated with certain rare diseases, we will likely retain rights for later stage development and potential commercialization. Should we find that we are pursuing diseases underpinned by large patient populations, we may elect to leverage the resources or specific expertise of another biopharmaceutical company via a strategic collaboration.
 Our Pompe Disease Program 
 Pompe disease is a rare, autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease caused by a mutation in the gene that encodes for GAA that results in the buildup of glycogen in the body’s cells. The accumulation of glycogen in certain organs and tissues, especially muscles, impairs normal tissue and organ function. People with Pompe disease experience serious muscle-related problems, including progressive muscle weakness, especially in the legs, trunk and diaphragm. As the disorder progresses, breathing problems can lead to respiratory failure. To date, more than 300 mutations have been identified in GAA that are pathogenic in nature. In general, GAA enzyme activity correlates with the age of onset and rate of progression. Pompe disease affects an estimated one in 40,000 people in the United States, ranging from one in 14,000 in African Americans to one in 100,000 in individuals of European decent. Pompe disease is estimated to affect between 5,000 and 10,000 people worldwide. 
 The only approved therapy for Pompe disease is Lumizyme, a form of enzyme replacement therapy, or ERT, known as Myozyme outside of the United States, which is delivered by bi-weekly intravenous infusion. However, ERT does not adequately address the breakdown of muscle tissue associated with the disease. We are also aware of gene therapies in clinical development designed to increase GAA levels in patients. 
 Our program in Pompe disease utilizes an AOC based on our mAb that targets TfR1 to deliver an siRNA targeting the mRNA encoding GYS1, a protein required for the synthesis of glycogen in muscle. Reducing glycogen synthesis in muscle will reduce the toxic accumulation of glycogen in the disease. We believe that an siRNA-based approach is well suited to the treatment of Pompe disease because we have identified a specific GYS1 inhibitor that does not inhibit glycogen synthetase 2, the closely related liver form of the enzyme, the latter being critical to glucose regulation in the body. We believe that our approach to address the breakdown of muscle tissue associated with Pompe disease may be complementary to ERT, as well as future gene therapies.

Opportunities in Immunology and Other Areas 
 We intend to pursue the development of AOCs in other tissue and cell types, including immune cells. In the field of immunology, we believe AOCs have the potential to target a broader set of cell types and diseases than traditional oligonucleotide therapies. We believe oligonucleotide therapies have the potential to address the challenges of immune responses at the RNA level; however, the ability to modulate immune responses has been hampered by the inappropriate delivery of these agents to immune cells. By identifying and optimizing antibodies for specific immune cells, our goal is to leverage our AOC platform to develop product candidates that can deliver siRNAs to disease-driving subsets of immune cells. 
 In studies designed to explore AOCs in immuno-oncology, we observed significant AOC-mediated mRNA reduction in CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, or TILs, in vivo in the syngeneic CT-26 tumor model with an intravenous dose of 6 mg/kg siRNA. However, we observed that the AOCs had no effect on the mRNA levels in T or B cells in the spleen (see Figure 21 below), suggesting that activity can be limited to only the cell populations involved in immune-responses to tumors without affecting lymphocytes outside the tumor. We believe this specificity was driven by the fact that the AOC employed our mAb targeting TfR1, and TfR1 is over expressed only on activated lymphocytes. We also observed significant AOC-mediated mRNA reduction in CD4+ TILs and T-regs from mice treated with an AOC comprised of a mAb targeting TfR1 and an siRNA targeting SHP2. 
 Figure 21: Target mRNA Levels in CD8+ TILs, Splenic T Cells and Splenic B Cells from Mice Treated in vivo with an AOC
 
We have also identified a mAb that binds to macrophages specifically, and when conjugated with an siRNA, produces reduction in levels of the target mRNA in that cell both in vitro and in vivo. We believe this finding supports the development of AOCs for diseases where macrophages play a significant role, like autoimmune disorders. We are in the process of generating data to demonstrate the pharmacologic effects of siRNA reduction in animal models of immune disorders, which will help inform our future development plans. Our internal efforts are focused on finding additional surface protein-mAb pairs and demonstrating reduction in the expression of key targets in subsets of immune cells. As we identify appropriate product candidates in immunology, we may choose to advance these on our own or seek a strategic collaborator based on the nature of potential indications. Our findings in immunology served as one of the key bases of our collaboration with Lilly who has access to a defined set of up to six mRNA targets initially in immunology and other select indications on a worldwide basis. 
 Beyond immune cells, we plan to continue to invest in our AOC platform to explore the full potential of our AOCs in cardiomyopathies, as well as in additional previously inaccessible tissue and cell types. We have recently entered into a collaboration with MyoKardia that will help us expand our therapeutic activities to include cardiac-specific indications. Our goal is to discover, develop and commercialize novel AOC therapeutics that overcome current barriers to the delivery of oligonucleotides and unlock their potential to treat a wide range of serious diseases currently lacking adequate treatment options. 
 27

Manufacturing 
 We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities. We currently rely on third-party manufacturers and suppliers for the antibodies, oligonucleotides and linkers used to make our AOCs, and we expect to continue to do so to meet our preclinical, clinical and commercial activities. Our third-party manufacturers are required to manufacture our product candidates under current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, requirements and other applicable laws and regulations. We believe there are multiple sources for all of the materials required for the manufacture of our product candidates. 
Competition 
 The biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapid technological advancement, significant competition and an emphasis on intellectual property. We face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with current therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
 With respect to AOC 1001, there are currently no approved therapies to treat the underlying cause of DM1. Products currently in development to treat DM1 include: tideglusib, a GSK3-ß inhibitor in late-stage clinical development by AMO Pharma for the congenital phenotype of DM1; AT466, which is an AAV-antisense candidate in preclinical development by Audentes Therapeutics, Inc.; an antibody linked oligonucleotide in preclinical development by Dyne Therapeutics Inc.; gene editing treatments in preclinical development by Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; an RNA-targeting gene therapy in preclinical development by Locana, Inc.; and small molecules interacting with RNA in preclinical development by Expansion Therapeutics. There are a growing number of companies pursuing different paths to treat DM1 and we expect that the space will continue to evolve as additional candidates advance. 
 There are currently no therapies to treat the underlying cause of FSHD. Products currently in development to treat FSHD include: creatine monohydrate, a supplement that enhances muscle performance, which is being evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical trial by Murdoch Children’s Research Institute, and losmapimod, a p38 MAPK inhibitor that may modulate DUX4 expression, which is being evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical trial by Fulcrum Therapeutics Inc. 
 Currently people with DMD are treated with corticosteroids to manage the inflammatory component of the disease. Deflazacort is an FDA approved corticosteroid marketed by PTC Therapeutics, Inc. In addition, there are three FDA approved exon skipping drugs marketed by Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc.: Eteplirsen, an unconjugated PMO approved for people with DMD amenable to skipping Exon 51; golodirsen for the treatment of people with DMD amenable to skipping Exon 53; and casimersen for the treatment of DMD in patients with a confirmed mutation amenable to exon 45 skipping.  There is an FDA-approved exon skipping drug marketed by Nippon Shinyaku Co., Inc.: viltolarsen, an unconjugated PMO approved for people with DMD amenable to skipping Exon 53. Companies focused on developing treatments for DMD that target dystrophin mechanisms, as does our DMD program, include Sarepta Therapeutics with SRP-5051, a PPMO currently being evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical trial for patients amenable to Exon 51 skipping 51, and PTC Therapeutics with ataluren, a small molecule targeting nonsense mutations in a Phase 3 clinical trial. In addition, several companies are developing gene therapies, including Milo Biotechnology (AAV1-FS344), Pfizer (PF-06939926), Sarepta Therapeutics (SRP-9001 and Galgt2 gene therapy program), and Solid Biosciences Inc. (SGT-001). We are also aware of several companies targeting non-dystrophin mechanisms for the treatment of DMD. 
 Current treatments for muscle atrophy are primarily focused on nutritional intake and physical exercise. Other products in developments for muscle atrophy in cachexia include: adlumiz and AEZS-130, which are ghrelin agonists in a Phase 3 clinical trial by Helsinn Healthcare SA and a Phase 2 trial by Aeterna Zentaris Inc., respectively; GSK2881078, an androgen receptor modulator in Phase 2 clinical in development by GlaxoSmithKline plc; NGM120, a GSF15 inhibitor by NGM Biopharmaceuticals Inc.; and PF-06946860 in Phase 1 clinical development by Pfizer Inc. 
 28

The only approved therapy for Pompe disease is Lumizyme (known as Myozyme outside of the United States), an ERT delivered by bi-weekly intravenous infusion, and marketed by Sanofi Genzyme. We are aware of multiple ERT therapies in clinical development, including AT-GAA, which uses a pharmacological chaperone, in a Phase 3 clinical trial by Amicus Therapeutics, Inc., and neoGAA in a Phase 3 clinical trial by Sanofi Genzyme. In addition, several companies are developing gene therapies, including Actus Therapeutics, Inc. (ACTUS101), Asklepios BioPharmaceutical, Inc. (AAV2/8-LSPhGAA), Audentes Therapeutics (AT845) and Spark Therapeutics, Inc. (SPK-3006). 
 We will also compete more generally with other companies developing alternative scientific and technological approaches, including other companies working to develop conjugates with oligonucleotides for extra-hepatic delivery, including Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Aro Biotherapeutics, Arrowhead Therapeutics, Dyne Therapeutics, Ionis Pharmaceuticals and Sarepta Therapeutics, as well as gene therapy and CRISPR approaches. 
 Many of our competitors, either alone or with strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance, rendering our treatments obsolete or non-competitive. Merger and acquisition activity in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These companies also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials and acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Our commercial opportunity could be substantially limited if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, safer, less toxic, more convenient or less expensive than our comparable products. In geographies that are critical to our commercial success, competitors may also obtain regulatory approvals before us, resulting in our competitors building a strong market position in advance of the entry of our products. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of other drugs. The key competitive factors affecting the success of our programs are likely to be their efficacy, safety profile, convenience, level of promotional activity, intellectual property protection and availability of reimbursement. 
 
Intellectual Property
 We strive to protect our product candidates and our AOC product platform through a variety of methods, including seeking and maintaining patents intended to cover our AOC product platform, our products and compositions, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, and any other inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. We also rely on trade secrets and know-how that may be important to the development of our business. We seek to obtain domestic and international patent protection and endeavor to promptly file patent applications for new commercially valuable inventions to expand our intellectual property portfolio. 
 We believe that we have a significant global intellectual property position and substantial know-how relating to our AOC product candidates and our technology platform. As of December 31, 2020, our intellectual property portfolio consisted of two issued U.S. patents and over 20 pending U.S. patent applications that we own. Collectively, these patent rights relate to various aspects of our AOC product candidates and technology platform. In addition, we have an exclusive option to an exclusive license to certain patent rights from the University of Alberta. In addition to filing and prosecuting patent applications in the United States, we often file counterpart patent applications in additional countries where we believe such foreign filing is likely to be beneficial, including Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Singapore, and South Korea. We also file patent applications pursuant to the Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT. Our PCT patent applications are in the first phase of the PCT process, which is the international phase, in which patent protection is pending under a single patent application filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, as a contracting state of the PCT. These PCT 
 29

patent applications have not yet entered the second phase of the PCT process, which is the national and regional phase, in which rights are continued by filing necessary documents with the patent offices of separate contracting states of the PCT. The national phase of the PCT patent application process occurs 30 months after the earliest priority date of the PCT patent application. 
 We continually assess and refine our intellectual property strategy as we develop new product candidates and platform technologies. To that end, we are prepared to file additional patent applications in any appropriate fields if our intellectual property strategy requires such filings, or where we seek to adapt to competition or seize business opportunities. Further, we are prepared to file patent applications, as we consider appropriate under the circumstances, relating to the new technologies that we develop. 
 We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may own or license in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents we may own or license in the future will be useful in protecting our technology. Please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” for additional information on the risks associated with our intellectual property strategy and portfolio. 
 Intellectual Property Relating to AOC 1001
 With regard to AOC 1001, as of December 31, 2020, we owned one pending U.S. patent application and one pending patent application filed pursuant to the PCT. An additional patent was issued in January 2021. These patent rights relate to AOC 1001 composition of matter, formulations containing AOC 1001, methods of manufacturing, and methods of treating diseases, using AOC 1001. Any patents issued from these applications are expected to expire in 2038-2041; however, a patent term extension may be available.
 Intellectual Property Relating to Our FSHD AOC Product Candidate 
 With regard to our FSHD AOC product candidate, as of December 31, 2020 we owned one pending U.S. patent application. These patent rights relate to the FSHD AOC composition of matter, formulations containing the FSHD AOC, methods of manufacturing, and methods of treating diseases, using our FSHD AOC. Any patents issued from these applications are expected to expire in 2041; however, a patent term extension may be available. 
Intellectual Property Relating to Our DMD AOC Product Candidates 
 With regard to our DMD AOC product candidates, as of December 31, 2020, we owned three pending U.S. patent applications and 19 pending patent applications in various countries and regions including Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Singapore, and South Korea. These patent rights relate to the DMD AOCs composition of matter, formulations containing the DMD AOCs, methods of manufacturing, and methods of treating diseases, using our DMD AOCs. Any patents issued from these applications are expected to expire in 2038; however, a patent term extension may be available. 
Intellectual Property Relating to Our Muscle Atrophy AOC Product Candidate 
 With regard to our muscle atrophy AOC product candidate, as of December 31, 2020 we owned one pending U.S. patent application and one pending PCT patent application. These patent rights relate to the muscle atrophy AOC composition of matter, formulations containing the muscle atrophy AOC, methods of manufacturing, and methods of treating diseases, using our muscle atrophy AOC. Any patents issued from these applications are expected to expire in 2038; however, a patent term extension may be available. 
Intellectual Property Relating to Our Pompe AOC Product Candidate 
 With regard to our Pompe AOC product candidate, as of December 31, 2020, we owned one pending U.S. patent application. This application relates to the Pompe disease AOC composition of matter, formulations containing the Pompe disease AOC, methods of manufacturing, and method of treating diseases, using our Pompe disease AOC. Any patents issued from this application are expected to expire in 2041; however, a patent term extension may be available. 
 30

Intellectual Property Relating to Our AOC Product Platform 
 As of December 31, 2020, we owned 14 families of U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications generally covering our AOC product platform. These families include two issued U.S. patents, 14 pending U.S. patent applications, three PCT patent applications and 24 foreign patent applications in the European Patent Office, Australia, Canada, China, Israel, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Singapore, and Taiwan, relating to key aspects and components of our AOC product platform systems. Our patent applications contain claims covering (i) proprietary antibodies; (ii) proprietary oligonucleotide chemical structures; (iii) proprietary oligonucleotide sequences; (iv) proprietary AOC structures; and (v) methods for manufacturing and using our AOC technologies. Some of these AOC platform cases generically cover our various product candidates. The issued U.S. patents and any U.S. patents issuing from our pending U.S. patent applications are expected to expire between 2037 and 2040. 
 The term of individual patents depends upon the laws of the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing of a non-provisional patent application. However, the term of United States patents may be extended for delays incurred due to compliance with the FDA requirements or by delays encountered during prosecution that are caused by the USPTO. For example, for drugs that are regulated by the FDA under the Hatch-Waxman Act, it is permitted to extend the term of a patent that covers such drug for up to five years beyond the normal expiration date of the patent. In the future, if and when our biopharmaceutical product candidates receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those product candidates. We intend to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available; however, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the USPTO and FDA, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions. If patents are issued on our pending patent applications, the resulting patents are projected to expire on dates ranging from 2038 to 2041, unless we receive patent term extension or patent term adjustment, or both. 
 However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. 
 The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the scope of claims allowable in patents in the field of oligonucleotide therapy has emerged in the United States. The patent situation outside of the United States is even more uncertain. Changes in the patent laws and rules, either by legislation, judicial decisions, or regulatory interpretation in the United States and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our inventions and enforce our intellectual property rights, and more generally could affect the value of our intellectual property. In particular, our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell, importing or otherwise commercializing any of our patented inventions, either directly or indirectly, will depend in part on our success in obtaining, defending and enforcing patent claims that cover our technology, inventions, and improvements. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our platform and product candidates and the methods used to manufacture them. Moreover, our issued patents and those that may issue in the future may not guarantee us the right to practice our technology in relation to the commercialization of our platform’s product candidates. The area of patent and other intellectual property rights in biotechnology is an evolving one with many risks and uncertainties, and third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our AOC product platform and product candidates and practicing our proprietary technology. Our issued patents and those that may issue in the future may be challenged, narrowed, circumvented or invalidated, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related platforms or product candidates or limit the length of the term of patent protection that we may have for our AOC product platform and product candidates. In addition, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with protection or competitive 
 31

advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies. For these reasons, we may have competition for our AOC product platform and product candidates. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that before any product candidate can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the patent. For this and other risks related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, platforms and product candidates, please see the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.” 
 We intend to file applications for trademark registrations in connection with our product candidates in various jurisdictions, including the United States. We have filed for trademark protection of the Avidity Biosciences mark with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and foreign patent and trademark organizations. 
 We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. Although we take steps to protect our confidential and proprietary information as trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements under the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual, and which are related to our current or planned business or research and development or made during normal working hours, on our premises or using our equipment or proprietary information, are our exclusive property. In many cases our confidentiality and other agreements with consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors require them to assign or grant us licenses to inventions they invent as a result of the work or services they render under such agreements or grant us an option to negotiate a license to use such inventions. Despite these efforts, we cannot provide any assurances that all such agreements have been duly executed, and any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. 
 We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our proprietary technology and processes by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. Although we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. To the extent that our employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators and advisors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in relation to the resulting know-how or inventions. For more information, please see the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.” 
 Research Collaboration and License Agreement with Lilly 
 In April 2019, we entered into the Lilly Agreement with Lilly for the discovery, development and commercialization of antibody-oligonucleotide conjugate products, or Products, in immunology and other select indications on a worldwide basis. Under the Lilly Agreement, the parties will collaborate on preclinical research and discovery activities for Products and Lilly will be responsible for funding the cost of preclinical research and discovery activities of both parties for all Products. Lilly will lead the clinical development, regulatory approval and commercialization of all Products, at Lilly’s sole cost. 
 Under the Lilly Agreement, we granted Lilly an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license under our technology to research, develop, manufacture, and sell Products directed to up to six mRNA targets. Lilly has the right to sublicense its rights under the Lilly Agreement subject to certain conditions. Lilly granted 
 32

us a non-exclusive license under certain Lilly technology solely to conduct research under the Lilly Agreement. We retain the right to use our technology to perform our obligations under the Lilly Agreement and for all purposes not granted to Lilly. We agreed that we will not, ourselves or with a third party, research, develop, manufacture or commercialize or otherwise exploit any compound or product directed against targets subject to the collaboration. 
 Lilly paid us an upfront license fee of $20.0 million, and we are eligible to receive up to $60.0 million in development milestone payments, up to $140.0 million in regulatory milestone payments and up to $205.0 million in commercialization milestone payments per target. In addition, Lilly is obligated to pay us a tiered royalty ranging from the mid-single to low-double digits on worldwide annual net sales of licensed Products, subject to specified and capped reductions for the market entry of biosimilar products, loss of patent coverage of licensed Products and for payments owed to third parties for additional rights necessary to commercialize licensed Products in the territory. Lilly’s royalty obligations and the Lilly Agreement will expire on a licensed Product-by-licensed Product and country-by-country basis on the later of ten years from the date of the first commercial sale or when there is no longer a valid patent claim covering such licensed Product in such country. 
 The Lilly Agreement may be terminated either by us or Lilly in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party. Lilly may terminate the Lilly Agreement on a target-by-target basis or in its entirety without cause, subject to certain limitations, including that Lilly may not terminate the Lilly Agreement on a target-by-target basis within the first three years of the effective date of the Lilly Agreement if doing so would reduce the number of Products subject to the collaboration to fewer than a certain number. In the event either party commences a legal action challenging the validity or enforceability of any licensed patents, the other party will have the right to terminate the Lilly Agreement with respect to the challenged patents. 
 The Lilly Agreement includes various representations, warranties, covenants, dispute resolution mechanisms, indemnities and other provisions customary for transactions of this nature. 
 Concurrently with the Lilly Agreement, we issued a convertible promissory note to Lilly, or the Lilly Note, and received cash proceeds of $15.0 million. The Lilly Note accrued simple interest of 8.0% per annum and converted into shares of our Series C convertible preferred stock in November 2019. 
 Research Collaboration with Myokardia, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bristol Myers Squibb 
 In December 2020, we entered into a research collaboration with MyoKardia, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bristol Myers Squibb, to demonstrate the potential utility of AOCs in cardiac tissue by leveraging MyoKardia’s genetic cardiomyopathy platform including, among other aspects, its novel target discovery engine and proprietary cardiac disease models.
 Government Regulation 
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. A new drug must be approved by the FDA through the new drug application, or NDA, process before it may be legally marketed in the United States. 
 We believe our AOC product candidates may be subject to regulation in the United States as combination products. If marketed individually, each component of our product candidates would be subject to different regulatory pathways and would require approval of independent marketing applications by the FDA. A combination product, however, is assigned to an FDA center that will have primary jurisdiction over its regulation based on a determination of the combination product’s primary mode of action, which is the single mode of action that provides the most important therapeutic effect. In the case of our AOC product candidates, we believe that the primary mode of action is attributable to the drug component of the product. Accordingly, we believe the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, or CDER, will have primary jurisdiction over premarket development of our product candidates. We expect to seek approval of AOC 
 33

1001 and each of our other AOC product candidates through submission of a single NDA reviewed by CDER, and we do not expect that the FDA will require a separate marketing authorization for each constituent of AOC 1001 or our other AOC product candidates. 
 U.S. Drug Development Process 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
  
● | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations and other applicable regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with current GMP, or cGMP, requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with GCP; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of the NDA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The sponsor will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the first phase of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, if the first phase lends itself to an efficacy evaluation. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns about ongoing or proposed clinical trials or non-compliance with specific FDA requirements, and the trials may not begin or continue until the FDA notifies the sponsor that the hold 
 34

has been lifted. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCP regulations, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. They must be conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND as well as any subsequent protocol amendments, and timely safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events. An IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve each protocol before a clinical trial commences at that institution and must also approve the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each trial subject or his or her legal representative, monitor the study until completed and otherwise comply with IRB regulations. 
 
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
  
● | Phase 1: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human volunteers and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2: The product candidate is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage. Multiple Phase 2 trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 trials. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3: The product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy, and to further test for safety in an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide, if appropriate, an adequate basis for product approval and labeling. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA. 
 The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. In addition, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. Depending on its charter, this group may determine whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. 
 During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use 
 35

the meetings at the end of the Phase 2 trial to discuss Phase 2 clinical results and present plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials that they believe will support approval of the new drug. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 
While the IND is active and before approval, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the last progress report must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same or similar drugs, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important increased incidence of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. 
 There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed trial results to public registries. Sponsors of certain clinical trials of FDA-regulated products are required to register and disclose specified clinical trial information, which is publicly available at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. 
 NDA Review and Approval Process 
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, preclinical and other non-clinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. 
 The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision after it the application is submitted. The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. 
 The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the 
 36

facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 
 After the FDA evaluates an NDA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA and may require additional clinical data, such as an additional pivotal Phase 3 trial or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the sponsor must resubmit the NDA or, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. 
 If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. In addition, the FDA may require a sponsor to conduct Phase 4 testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug’s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval, and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products which have been commercialized. The FDA may also place other conditions on approval including the requirement for a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Marketing approval may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory requirements or if problems occur following initial marketing. 
 In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric clinical trials for most drugs, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs and supplements must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric clinical trials for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric clinical trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric clinical trials begin. The FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation. 
 Expedited Development and Review Programs 
 A sponsor may seek approval of its product candidate under programs designed to expedite FDA’s review and approval of new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria. The FDA has a fast track designation program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drug products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. With regard to a fast track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor 
 37

provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA. 
 Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with a fast track designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. The FDA endeavors to review applications with priority review designations within six months of the filing date as compared to ten months for review of new molecular entity NDAs under its current PDUFA review goals. 
 In addition, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug products intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may be eligible for accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. FDA may withdraw approval of a drug or indication approved under accelerated approval on an expedited basis if, for example, the sponsor fails to conduct the required confirmatory trial or if such confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product. 
 The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act established a category of drugs referred to as “breakthrough therapies” that may be eligible to receive breakthrough therapy designation. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy” if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. If the FDA designates a product as breakthrough therapy, it may take actions appropriate to expedite the development and review of the application, which may include holding meetings with the sponsor and the review team throughout the development of the therapy; providing timely advice to, and interactive communication with, the sponsor regarding the development of the drug to ensure that the development program to gather the nonclinical and clinical data necessary for approval is as efficient as practicable; involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor; and considering alternative clinical trial designs when scientifically appropriate, which may result in smaller trials or more efficient trials that require less time to complete and may minimize the number of patients exposed to a potentially less efficacious treatment. The breakthrough therapy designation also includes all of the fast track program features, which means that the sponsor may file sections of the NDA for review on a rolling basis if certain conditions are satisfied, including an agreement with FDA on the proposed schedule for submission of portions of the application and the payment of applicable user fees before the FDA may initiate a review. The breakthrough therapy designation is a distinct status from both accelerated approval and priority review, which can also be granted to the same drug if relevant criteria are met. 
 Fast track designation, priority review and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. We may explore some of these opportunities for our product candidates as appropriate. 
 38

Post-Approval Requirements 
 Any products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program fees for any marketed products. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. 
 The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
  
● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | fines, warning letters, or untitled letters;
--+---------------------------------------------


● | clinical holds on clinical studies;
--+------------------------------------


● | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, the FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drug products. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by the manufacturer and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. 
 39

Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or, if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
 If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity or inability to manufacture the product in sufficient quantities. The designation of such drug also entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. However, competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our product candidates for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. In addition, if an orphan designated product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan exclusivity. 
 Marketing Exclusivity 
 Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve or even accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2), or 505(b)(2) NDA, submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovative drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. 
 The FDCA alternatively provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of marketing exclusivity available in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity provides for an additional six months of marketing exclusivity attached to another period of exclusivity if a sponsor conducts clinical trials in children in response to a written request from the FDA. The issuance of a written request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described clinical trials. In 
 40

addition, orphan drug exclusivity, as described above, may offer a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, except in certain circumstances. 
 U.S. Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws and Compliance Requirements 
 In addition to FDA regulation of pharmaceutical products, U.S. federal and state healthcare laws and regulations restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our current and future business operations, including our clinical research activities, and constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships with healthcare providers and other parties. These laws include anti-kickback and false claims laws, civil monetary penalties laws, and physician and other healthcare provider payment transparency laws. In addition to the federal laws summarized below, we may also be subject to similar state and local laws and regulations that may apply to business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, or by patients themselves. 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
 The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws prohibit, among other things, any individual or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or from knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act. 
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the healthcare fraud statute implemented under HIPAA or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
 The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made during the previous year to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain other health care providers beginning in 2022, and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held during the previous year by such physicians as defined under statute and their immediate family members. 
 Similar state and local laws and regulations may also restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, or by patients themselves; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical 
 41

industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws and regulations that require drug manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information or which require tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of value provided to physicians, other healthcare providers and entities; and state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. 
 Violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply may result in significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties including damages, fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. 
 U.S. Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidate for which we may seek regulatory approval. Sales in the United States will depend, in part, on the availability of sufficient coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, which include government health programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and the Veterans Administration, as well as managed care organizations and private health insurers. Prices at which we or our customers seek reimbursement for our product candidates can be subject to challenge, reduction or denial by third-party payors. For products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs. 
 The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product is typically separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. In the United States, there is no uniform policy among payors for coverage or reimbursement. Decisions regarding whether to cover any of a product, the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies, but also have their own methods and approval processes. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that can require manufacturers to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of a product to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. 
 
Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product that receives approval. Third-party payors may not consider our product candidates to be medically necessary or cost-effective compared to other available therapies, or the rebate percentages required to secure favorable coverage may not yield an adequate margin over cost or may not enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in drug development. Additionally, decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product. 
 U.S. Healthcare Reform 
 In the United States, there has been, and continues to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect the profitable sale of product candidates. 
 Among policy makers and payors in the United States, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality 
 42

and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the ACA, was passed, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1%; required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; required manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell certain “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs, implemented a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected; expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; creates a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established a Center for Medicare Innovation at the CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. 
 There remain judicial and political challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Act, includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, or the Texas District Court Judge, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. On December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit affirmed the District Court’s decision that the individual mandate was unconstitutional but remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing the case, although it is unclear how the Supreme Court will rule. It is also unclear how such other efforts, if any, to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA will impact the ACA. 
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
 Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. The likelihood of success for these and other proposals to control drug costs is uncertain, particularly in light of the new Biden administration. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine which drugs and suppliers will be included in their healthcare programs Furthermore, there has been increased interest by third party payors and governmental authorities in reference pricing systems and publication of discounts and list prices.

Foreign Regulation 
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in foreign countries and jurisdictions. Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the United States apply similarly in the context of the European Union, or EU, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. 
 To market a medicinal product in the European Economic Area, or EEA (which is comprised of the 28 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), we must obtain a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are two types of marketing authorizations: 
  
● | the Community MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the EMA and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy products, and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment certain diseases, such as AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU; and

● | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member State through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. 
 Data and marketing exclusivity 
 In the EEA, new products authorized for marketing, or reference products, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity period prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from relying on the pre-clinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic or biosimilar applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until 10 years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EU. The 10-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those 10 years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.

Pediatric investigation plan 
 In the EEA, marketing authorization applications for new medicinal products not authorized have to include the results of studies conducted in the pediatric population, in compliance with a pediatric investigation plan, or PIP, agreed with the EMA’s Pediatric Committee, or PDCO. The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the drug for which marketing authorization is being sought. The PDCO can grant a deferral of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults. Further, the obligation to provide pediatric clinical trial data can be waived by the PDCO when these data is not needed or appropriate because the product is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in children, the disease or condition for which the product is intended occurs only in adult populations, or when the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients. Once the marketing authorization is obtained in all Member States of the EU and study results are included in the product information, even when negative, the product is eligible for six months’ supplementary protection certificate extension. 
 Clinical trials 
 Clinical trials of medicinal products in the European Union must be conducted in accordance with European Union and national regulations and the International Conference on Harmonization, or ICH, guidelines on GCPs. Additional GCP guidelines from the European Commission, focusing in particular on traceability, apply to clinical trials of advanced therapy medicinal products. If the sponsor of the clinical trial is not established within the European Union, it must appoint an entity within the European Union to act as its legal representative. The sponsor must take out a clinical trial insurance policy, and in most EU countries, the sponsor is liable to provide ‘no fault’ compensation to any study subject injured in the clinical trial. 
 Prior to commencing a clinical trial, the sponsor must obtain a clinical trial authorization from the competent authority, and a positive opinion from an independent ethics committee. The application for a clinical trial authorization must include, among other things, a copy of the trial protocol and an investigational medicinal product dossier containing information about the manufacture and quality of the medicinal product under investigation. Currently, clinical trial authorization applications must be submitted to the competent authority in each EU Member State in which the trial will be conducted. Under the new Regulation on Clinical Trials, which is currently expected to take effect in 2019, there will be a centralized application procedure where one national authority takes the lead in reviewing the application and the other national authorities have only a limited involvement. Any substantial changes to the trial protocol or other information submitted with the clinical trial applications must be notified to or approved by the relevant competent authorities and ethics committees. Medicines used in clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with cGMP. Other national and European Union-wide regulatory requirements also apply. 
 Data Privacy and Security Laws 
 We are subject to laws and regulations governing data privacy and the protection of health-related and other personal information. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws, including HIPAA, and federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations (e.g., Section 5 of the FTC Act), that govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our partners. In addition, certain state and non-U.S. laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, or the CCPA, the California Privacy Rights Act, or the CPRA, and the General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, govern the privacy and security of personal information, including health-related information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation.  Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.
