Item 1. Business
General
Deckers Outdoor Corporation was incorporated in 1975 under the laws of the State of California and, in 1993, reincorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware. We are a global leader in designing, marketing and distributing innovative footwear, apparel and accessories developed for both everyday casual lifestyle use and high performance activities. We market our products primarily under five proprietary brands: UGG, Koolaburra, Hoka, Teva and Sanuk. We believe that our footwear is distinctive and appeals broadly to women, men and children. We sell our products through quality domestic and international retailers, international distributors, and directly to our end-user consumers both domestically and internationally through our Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) business, which is comprised of our retail stores and E-Commerce websites. We seek to differentiate our brands and products by offering diverse lines that emphasize authenticity, functionality, quality, and comfort, and products tailored to a variety of activities, seasons, and demographic groups. All of our products are currently manufactured by independent manufacturers primarily in Asia. Our growth will depend on our ability to diversify our product offerings, increase the appeal of our products to consumers, optimize domestic and international distribution, drive sales to consumers, and develop or acquire new brands.
Recent Developments
Restructuring. In February 2016, we announced the implementation of a restructuring plan, which included a retail store fleet optimization and office consolidations, including the closure of facilities and relocation of employees to realign our brands across our Fashion Lifestyle and Performance Lifestyle groups. This restructuring plan is intended to streamline brand operations, reduce overhead costs, create operating efficiencies and improve collaboration.
In connection with these restructuring efforts, we incurred total restructuring charges of approximately $29,100 and $24,800 during fiscal year 2017 and 2016, respectively, with a total of $29,100 and $22,800 recognized in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses and approximately $0 and $2,000 in cost of sales, respectively. Related to these charges, we closed 25 retail stores, including five retail stores during fiscal year 2016 and 20 retail stores during fiscal year 2017, and consolidated several offices as of March 31, 2017. In fiscal year 2016, we relocated our Sanuk brand operations in Irvine, California to our corporate headquarters in Goleta, California and closed our Ahnu brand operations in Richmond, California, as well as consolidated our European offices. 
As part of our continuing evaluation of our retail store fleet, we identified additional stores for closure during the year ended March 31, 2017. During fiscal year 2017, we recognized approximately $3,600 in restructuring charges in SG&A expenses related to non-cash impairment charges for retail store assets for 12 of these stores. In May 2017, we announced that we expect to further reduce our global brick and mortar footprint by 30 to 40 stores compared to our store count at March 31, 2017, discussed below, which includes a combination of store closures and conversion of owned stores to partner retail stores. We are targeting a worldwide store count of approximately 125 stores by the end of fiscal year 2020. 
Refer to Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations", and Note 2, "Restructuring", to our consolidated financial statements in Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our restructuring efforts, and the impact to our results of operations and our reportable operating segments.

Savings Plan. In February 2017, we announced a plan to implement significant cost savings, excluding reinvestment (Savings Plan). The Savings Plan includes a combination of both cost of sales improvements and SG&A expense savings. Cost of sales improvements are expected to come from reducing product development cycle times, optimizing material yields, consolidating our factory base and continuing to move production outside of China. SG&A expense savings are expected to come from further retail store consolidations, process improvement efficiencies and lower unallocated indirect spend. In May 2017, we provided an update that the goal of the Savings Plan is to drive approximately $100,000 in operating profit improvement by the end of fiscal year 2020. 
Review of Strategic Alternatives. In April 2017, we announced that our Board of Directors has initiated a process to review a broad range of strategic alternatives. This review process includes an exploration and evaluation of strategic alternatives to enhance stockholder value, which may include a sale or other transaction.
Products and Brands
We currently market our products primarily under five propriety brands, composed of our three primary brands and our other brands. Collectively, our brands compete across the fashion and casual lifestyle, outdoor, and running markets.
UGG. The UGG brand is one of the most iconic and recognized brands in footwear and highlights our successful track record of building niche brands into lifestyle market leaders. With loyal consumers around the world, the UGG brand has proven to be a highly resilient line of premium footwear, with expanded product offerings and a growing global audience that attracts women, men and children. We intend to continue diversifying the UGG brand by developing more year-round product that includes spring and summer footwear, as well as growing men's products and non-footwear. The UGG brand is sold both domestically and internationally in key markets including the US, UK, Germany, China, Japan, and Canada, among others. 
Teva. Teva is a modern outdoor active lifestyle brand, born from the outdoors and rooted in adventure. As the originator of the sport sandal, the Teva brand's product line now includes sandals, shoes, and boots built for ultimate versatility. 
Sanuk. Sanuk is a surf lifestyle footwear brand rooted in Southern California culture. The Sanuk brand is best known for its SIDEWALK SURFERS shoe, Yoga Mat and Beer Cozy sandal collections. The brand has a history of product invention, comfort, unexpected materials and clever branding.
Other Brands. Other brands consist of: Hoka, a line of running footwear that offers maximal cushioning with minimal weight and is designed for runners of all capacities; Koolaburra, a line of fashion casual footwear using sheepskin and other plush materials; and Ahnu, a line of performance outdoor footwear, which we have discontinued operating and have begun to leverage under the Teva brand umbrella. 
Sales and Distribution
US Distribution. At the wholesale level, we distribute our products in the US through sales representatives, who are organized geographically and by brand. In addition to our wholesale business, we also sell products directly to end-user consumers through our DTC business. 
Currently, our sales force is generally separated by brand, as each brand generally has certain specialty consumers. However, there is some overlap between the sales teams and customers, and we are aligning our brands' sales forces to position them for the future of the brands. 
We distribute products sold in the US through our distribution centers in Camarillo and Moreno Valley, California. Our distribution centers feature a warehouse management system that enables us to efficiently pick and pack products for direct shipment to customers.
International Distribution. Internationally, we distribute our products through independent distributors and wholly-owned subsidiaries in many countries, including Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Canada, among others. In addition, in certain countries we sell products through DTC. We also sell products internationally, particularly in China, through partner retail stores, which are branded stores that are wholly owned and operated by third parties. Sales through partner retail stores are primarily attributed to the UGG and Sanuk brand wholesale reportable operating segments.

For our wholesale and DTC businesses, we distribute our products through a number of distribution centers managed by third-party logistics providers (3PLs) in certain international locations. 
UGG Wholesale. We sell the UGG brand primarily through domestic higher-end department stores such as Nordstrom and Dillard's, as well as lifestyle retailers such as Journeys, and online retailers such as Amazon and Zappos.com. As the retail marketplace continues to evolve and change to reflect changing consumer habits, we continually review and evaluate our UGG wholesale distribution approach and segmentation.
Teva Wholesale. We sell our Teva brand footwear primarily through specialty outdoor, sporting goods, department stores and family footwear, including retailers such as REI, Famous Footwear, DSW and online retailers such as Amazon and Zappos.com. 
Sanuk Wholesale. We sell our Sanuk brand footwear primarily through domestic independent action sports retailers, outdoor retailers, specialty footwear retailers and larger national retail chains, including Journeys, Dillard's, DSW, REI and online retailers such as Amazon and Zappos.com. 
Other Brands Wholesale. Our other brands are sold primarily at domestic specialty running stores, department stores, outdoor and independent specialty retailers, and with online retailers. Key accounts of the Hoka brand include Running Warehouse, Road Runner Sports, Running Specialty Group, REI and Zappos.com. Key accounts of the Koolaburra brand include Kohl's and Rack Room Shoes.
 Direct-to-Consumer. Our DTC business is comprised of our retail stores and E-Commerce websites. As a result of our evolving Omni-Channel strategy, we believe that our retail stores and websites are largely intertwined and dependent on one another. We believe that in many cases consumers interact with both our brick and mortar stores and our websites before making purchase decisions. For example, consumers may feel or try on products in our retail stores and then place an order online later. Conversely, they may initially research products online, and then view inventory availability by store location and make a purchase in store. Some examples that demonstrate the extent to which the sales channels are combined and help improve our inventory productivity include the following:

• | “UGG Rewards”: We have implemented a consumer loyalty program under which points and awards are earned across the DTC business.


• | “Infinite UGG”: We provide online shopping access inside retail stores for all SKUs available on our E-Commerce websites.


• | "Ship from Store": Inventory that is available in our stores, but is out of stock online can be shipped from our stores. Future advancements in the capability will use algorithms to select the optimal fulfillment source.


• | "UGG Closet": an online portal that functions similar to an outlet store in that it provides a way to closeout inventory directly to consumers.


• | “Buy online / return in-store”: Our consumers can buy online and return products to the store.


• | “Click and collect”: Our consumers can buy online and have products delivered to certain of our retail stores for pick-up.


• | “Retail inventory online”: Our consumers can view specific store location inventory online before visiting the store.

Our retail stores enable us to expose consumers to a greater breadth of product, directly impact our consumers' experiences, sell the products at retail prices and generate greater gross margins. Our retail stores are predominantly UGG brand concept and outlet stores. Through our outlet stores, depending on the location, we sell some of our discontinued styles from prior seasons, full price in-line products, as well as products made specifically for the outlet stores. At March 31, 2017, we had a total of 160 retail stores worldwide, which includes 96 concept stores and 64 outlet stores. During fiscal year 2017, we opened 17 new retail stores, reclassified 12 European concession stores as owned stores, converted two owned stores to partner retail stores, and closed 20 retail stores. Concession stores are considered concept stores that are operated by us within a department or other store, which we lease from the store

owner by paying a percentage of concession store sales. Refer to Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, for further disclosure and discussion.
Product Design and Development
The design and development functions for all of our brands are performed by a combination of internal design and development staff and outside freelance designers. Refer to Note 1, "The Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies", to our consolidated financial statements in Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the research and development costs we have incurred for the last three fiscal years.
In order to ensure quality, consistency, and efficiency in our design and product development process, we continually evaluate the availability and cost of raw materials, the capabilities and capacity of our independent manufacturers and the target retail price of new models and lines. The design and development staff works closely with brand management to develop new styles of footwear and accessories for our various product lines. Throughout the development process, we have multiple design and development reviews, which we then coordinate with our independent manufacturers. 
Manufacturing and Supply Chain
We do not manufacture our products. We outsource the production of our brand footwear to independent manufacturers, primarily in Asia. We require our independent manufacturers and designated suppliers to adopt our Supplier Code of Conduct, which specifies that they comply with all local laws and regulations governing human rights, working conditions, and environmental compliance before we are willing to conduct business with them. We also require our manufacturing partners and licensees to comply with our Restricted Substances Policy, Anti-Corruption Policy and other compliance policies and procedures as a condition of doing business with us.
The production of footwear by our independent manufacturers is performed in accordance with our detailed specifications and is subject to our quality control standards. We maintain a buying office in Hong Kong and on-site supervisory offices in Pan Yu City, China and Hai Phong City, Vietnam, which together serve as a link to our independent manufacturers. We believe this regional presence provides predictability of material availability, product flow and adherence to final design specifications. The majority of the materials and components used in production of our products by these independent manufacturers are purchased from independent suppliers that we designate. 
At our direction, our manufacturers currently purchase the majority of the sheepskin used in our products from two tanneries in China, which source their sheepskin for our products primarily from Australia and the UK. We maintain communication with the tanneries to monitor the available supply of sufficient high-quality sheepskin for our projected UGG brand production. To ensure adequate supplies for our manufacturers, we forecast our usage of sheepskin in advance at a forward price. We have also entered into purchase commitments with certain sheepskin suppliers. Refer to Note 7, "Commitments and Contingencies", to our consolidated financial statements in Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our minimum purchase commitments. We believe current supplies are sufficient to meet our current and anticipated demand, but we continue to investigate our options to accommodate our expected growth or unexpected supply chain issues.
Beginning in 2013, in an effort to partially reduce our dependency on sheepskin, we began using a proprietary new raw material, UGGpure™, which is a wool woven into a durable backing, in some of our UGG brand products. Excluding sheepskin and UGGpure™, we believe that substantially all the various raw materials and components used to manufacture our footwear, including wool, rubber, leather, and nylon webbing are generally available from multiple sources at competitive prices. We generally outsource our manufacturing requirements on the basis of individual purchase orders or short-term purchase commitments rather than maintaining long-term purchase commitments with our independent manufacturers.
We have instituted pre-production, in-line, and post-production inspections to meet or exceed the high quality demanded by us and consumers of our products. Our quality assurance program includes our own employee on-site inspectors at our independent manufacturers, who oversee the production process and perform quality assurance inspections. We also routinely inspect our products upon arrival at our distribution centers.

Patents and Trademarks
We utilize trademarks with virtually all of our products and believe that having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our products, promoting our brands, and distinguishing our products from the products of others. We currently hold trademark registrations for "UGG", "Teva", "Sanuk", "Hoka One One", "Koolaburra", "Ahnu", "UGGpure", and other marks in the US and for certain of the marks in many other countries, including Canada, China, the UK, various countries in the European Union, Japan, and Korea. As of March 31, 2017, we hold 176 designs and inventions with corresponding design or utility patent registrations, plus 14 designs and inventions which are currently pending registration. These patents expire at various times. We regard our proprietary rights as valuable assets and vigorously protect such rights against infringement by third parties.
Seasonality
Our business is seasonal, with the highest percentage of UGG brand net sales occurring in the quarters ending September 30th and December 31st and the highest percentage of Teva and Sanuk brand net sales occurring in the quarters ending March 31st and June 30th. Due to the size of the UGG brand relative to our other brands, our aggregate net sales in the quarters ending September 30th and December 31st have significantly exceeded net sales in the quarters ending March 31st and June 30th. For further discussion, including regarding the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, refer to Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors", and Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations".
Inventory Management
 We manage our inventory levels based on existing orders, anticipated sales and the rapid-delivery requirements of our customers. We have put in place systems and processes designed to improve our forecasting and supply planning capabilities. In addition, we believe that added discipline around the purchasing of product, production lead time reduction, and better planning and execution in selling of excess inventory through our outlet stores and other liquidation channels are key areas of focus that will enhance inventory performance. 
Our practice, and the general practice in the footwear and accessory industries, is to offer retail customers the right to return defective or improperly shipped merchandise. As it relates to new product introductions, which can often require large initial launch shipments, we commence production before receiving orders for those products from time to time. This can affect our inventory levels as we build pre-launch quantities. 
Backlog
Historically, we have encouraged our wholesale and distributor customers to place, and we have received, a significant portion of orders as pre-season orders, generally four to eight months prior to the anticipated shipment date. We work with our wholesale customers through pre-season programs to enable us to better plan our production schedule, and inventory and shipping needs. We refer to backlog as unfilled customer orders from our wholesale customers and distributors as of any date, which represent orders scheduled to be shipped at a future date, some of which can be cancelled prior to shipment. As such, these orders may not be indicative of actual future shipments. Therefore, we believe backlog is an imprecise indicator and is not material for understanding the business in its entirety, especially since backlog excludes sales in our DTC business. 
As of March 31, 2017, our backlog was approximately $649,000. The backlog as of a particular date is affected by a number of factors, including seasonality, manufacturing schedule, and the timing of product shipments, as well as variations in when wholesale customers and distributors place orders. As a result, comparisons of the backlog from period-to-period may not provide an accurate indication of future results.
Competition
The footwear markets that we operate in are highly competitive. Our competitors include athletic and footwear companies, branded apparel companies and retailers with their own private labels. Although the footwear industry is fragmented to a certain degree, many of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater resources than us, including athletic shoe companies, several of which compete directly with some of our products. In addition, access to offshore manufacturing and the growth of E-Commerce has made it easier for new companies to enter the markets in which we compete, further increasing competition in the footwear and accessory industries. In particular, and in part due to the popularity of our UGG brand products, we face increasing competition from a significant number of domestic 
8

and international competitors selling products designed to compete directly or indirectly with our UGG brand products. We believe that our ability to successfully compete depends on numerous factors, including responding to consumer preferences, producing appealing product, and pricing products competitively, among others. For a discussion on how we compete, refer to Part 1, Item 1A, "Risk Factors".
Employees
At March 31, 2017, we employed approximately 3,300 employees in the US, Europe, and Asia, none of whom were represented by a union. This figure includes approximately 1,800 employees in our retail stores worldwide, which includes part-time and seasonal employees. 
Financial Information about Reportable Operating Segments and Geographic Areas
Our five reportable operating segments include the strategic business units responsible for the worldwide operations of our brands' (UGG, Teva, Sanuk and other brands) wholesale divisions, as well as our DTC business. The majority of our sales and long-lived assets are in the US. Refer to Note 12, "Reportable Operating Segments", to our consolidated financial statements in Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of our reportable operating segments. Refer to Note 13, "Concentration of Business, Significant Customers and Credit Risk", to our consolidated financial statements in Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for financial information about geographic areas and concentration of related business risks. 
Government Regulation
Compliance with federal, state, and local environmental regulations has not had, and it is not expected to have, any material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position based on information and circumstances known to us at this time.
