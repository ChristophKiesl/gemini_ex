ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Overview
Infrastructure and Energy Alternatives, Inc., a Delaware corporation (‘‘IEA’’, the ‘‘Company’’, ‘‘we’’, ‘‘us’’, or ‘‘our’’) is a holding company that, through various subsidiaries, is a leading diversified infrastructure construction company with specialized energy and heavy civil expertise throughout the United States (“U.S.”). The Company specializes in providing complete engineering, procurement and construction (“EPC”) services throughout the U.S. for the renewable energy, traditional power and civil infrastructure industries. These services include the design, site development, construction, installation and restoration of infrastructure. Although the Company has historically focused on the wind industry, its recent acquisitions have expanded its construction capabilities and geographic footprint in the areas of environmental remediation, industrial maintenance, specialty paving, heavy civil and rail infrastructure construction, creating a diverse national platform of specialty construction capabilities. We believe we have the ability to continue to expand these services because we are well-positioned to leverage our expertise and relationships in the wind energy business to provide complete infrastructure solutions in all areas.
Our Common Stock trades on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol ‘‘IEA’’. We were founded in 1947 as White Construction and we became a public company as Infrastructure and Energy Alternatives, Inc. in March 2018 when we merged with a special purpose acquisition company (a non-operating shell company).
Merger and Acquisitions
Public Company - On March 26, 2018, we consummated a merger (the “Merger”) pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated November 3, 2017, by and among M III Acquisition Corporation (“M III”), IEA Energy Services, LLC (“IEA Services”), a Delaware limited liability company, Infrastructure and Energy Alternatives, LLC (the “Seller”), a Delaware limited liability company and the parent of IEA Services immediately prior to such time, and the other parties thereto, which provided for, among other things, the merger of IEA Services with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of M III. See Note 2. Merger and Acquisitions in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements for more information on the Merger and the continuing ownership of the Company by M III and Seller.
Acquisition of CCS, including Saiia and the ACC Companies - On September 25, 2018, we acquired CCS, a leading provider of environmental and industrial engineering services. The wholly-owned subsidiaries of CCS, Saiia and ACC Companies generally enter into contracts with both government and non-government customers to provide EPC services for environmental, heavy-civil and mining projects. We believe our acquisition of Saiia and the ACC Companies provides IEA with a strong and established presence in the environmental and industrial engineering markets, enhanced civil construction capabilities and an expanded domestic footprint in less-seasonal Southeast, West and Southwest markets.
Acquisition of William Charles Construction Group, including Ragnar Benson - On November 2, 2018, we acquired William Charles, a leader in engineering and construction solutions for the rail infrastructure and heavy civil construction industries. We believe our acquisition of William Charles provides IEA with a market leading position in the attractive rail infrastructure market and continue to bolster our further growth in the heavy civil and construction footprint across the Midwest and Southwest.
Reportable Segments
The Company operated as one reportable segment for 2018 and evaluated the business as a renewable construction company. In late 2018, the Company completed two significant acquisitions that construct projects outside of the renewable market. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2019, we operate our business as two reportable segments: the Renewables segment and the Specialty Civil segment. The 2018 segment presentation has been recast to be consistent to the 2019 segmentation.
Each of our reportable segments is comprised of similar business units that specialize in services unique to the respective markets that each segment serves. Driving the end-user focused segments are differences in the economic characteristics of each segment; the nature of the services provided by each segment; the production processes of each segment; and the type or class of customer using the segment’s services. 
4

The classification of revenue and gross profit for segment reporting purposes can at times require judgment on the part of management. Our segments may perform services across industries or perform joint services for customers in multiple industries. To determine reportable segment gross profit, certain allocations, including allocations of shared and indirect costs, such as facility costs, equipment expenses and indirect operating expenses, were made based on segment revenue.
The following is a brief description of the Company's reportable segments:
Renewables Segment
The Renewables segment operates throughout the United States and specializes in a range of services that include full EPC project delivery, design, site development, construction, installation and restoration of infrastructure services for the wind and solar industries.
Specialty Civil Segment
The Specialty Civil segment operates throughout the United States and specializes in a range of services that include:

• | Heavy civil construction services such as high-altitude road and bridge construction, specialty paving, industrial maintenance and other local, state and government projects.


• | Environmental remediation services such as site development, environmental site closure and outsourced contract mining and coal ash management services.


• | Rail Infrastructure services such as planning, creation and maintenance of infrastructure projects for major railway and intermodal facilities construction.

Industry Trends
Our industry is composed of national, regional and local companies in a range of industries, including renewable power generation, traditional power generation and the civil infrastructure industries. We believe the following industry trends will help to drive our growth and success over the coming years:
Renewable Power Generation
In recent years, we have maintained a heavy focus on construction of renewable power production capacity as renewable energy, particularly from wind and solar, has become widely accepted within the electric utility industry and has become a cost-effective solution for the creation of new generating capacity. We believe that this shift has occurred because renewable energy power generation has reached a level of scale and maturity that permits these technologies to now be cost-effective competitors to more traditional power generation technologies, including on an unsubsidized basis. Under many circumstances, wind and solar power production offer the lowest levelized cost of energy (i.e., the all-in cost of generating power, including construction and operating costs) of any technology. As a result, wind and solar power are among the leading sources of new power generation capacity in the U.S., and wind and utility-scale solar energy generation is projected to become even more cost-effective in coming years as technological improvements make wind turbines and photovoltaic cells (and other solar generating technologies) even more efficient.
Governmental policies focused on a clean environment and the desire to decrease U.S. dependence on foreign oil imports have created incentives historically for the development of renewable energy production capacity and have created demand for more domestic, environmentally sensitive electrical power production facilities, such as wind and solar collection farms. The federal government has offered tax credits for investments in renewable energy infrastructure and production of power from renewable sources. Other tax incentives available to the renewable energy industry include accelerated tax depreciation provisions, including bonus depreciation, for certain renewable energy generation assets, such as equipment using solar or wind energy. These incentives specify a five-year depreciable life for qualifying assets rather than the longer depreciable lives of many non-renewable energy assets. In addition to shorter depreciable lives, those assets qualifying for bonus depreciation benefit from significant allowable first-year depreciation.
In addition to federal policies that historically have favored power production from renewable sources, a number of states also have supported the expansion of renewable energy generating capacity. Currently, nearly 40 states, as well as the 
5

District of Columbia and four territories, have adopted renewable portfolio standards or goals. Similarly, we believe that many corporations and retail consumers are increasingly focused on obtaining energy from renewable sources and have become a significant driver of incremental demand for wind and solar energy production capacity.
The market for the development of utility-scale wind and solar power generation is expected to remain robust. The Annual Energy Outlook 2020 published by the U.S. Department of Energy (“DOE”) in January 2020 projected the addition of approximately 117 gigawatts of new utility-scale wind and solar capacity from 2020 to 2023. We estimate that EPC services will account for approximately 30% of the estimated $28.4 billion of construction over that time period. Although this demand is driven, in part, by accelerated, incremental investment in renewable power generation sources during the phase-out period for existing tax incentives, fundamental demand for renewable power construction-and particularly for utility-scale solar farms-is projected to remain strong thereafter. See Regulation and Environmental Matters below for further discussion of phase-out period. 
Specialty Civil
Heavy Civil Construction
During 2018, heavy civil construction was only a small part of our business and accounted for less than 10% of our revenue. Heavy civil construction has become a more significant part of our business in 2019 due to the contributions of the companies we acquired during 2018, which are in this sector. State and federal funding for this industry has been neglected for decades, but the near-term outlook on both state and federal levels is that spending for infrastructure may experience significant growth over the next few years. Not only do we believe that state and federal funding is likely to increase, but alternative methods of construction, such as public and private partnerships, have gained significant traction in the United States in recent years. The FMI 2020 Overview Report published in the fourth quarter of 2019 project that nonresidential construction put in place for the United States will be over $850 million per year from 2020 to 2023. 
We believe that our business relationships with customers in these sectors are excellent and the strong reputation that our acquired companies have built has provided us with the right foundation to continue to grow our revenue base. Additionally, there is significant overlap in labor, skills and equipment needs between our renewable energy construction business and our heavy civil infrastructure business, which we expect will continue to provide us with operating efficiencies as we continue to expand this sector. Our renewable energy experience provides us with expertise in working in difficult conditions and environments, which we believe will provide us with a competitive advantage when bidding for more complicated and often higher margin civil and infrastructure projects. 
Rail

For more than 150 years, the U.S. rail network has been a critical component of the U.S. transportation system and economy. Today it carries approximately one-third of U.S. exports and delivers five million tons of freight and approximately 85,000 passengers each day. According to the 2017 Infrastructure Report Card, the private freight rail industry owns the vast majority of the nation’s rail infrastructure, and continues to make significant capital investment — $27.1 billion in 2015 — to ensure the network’s good condition. Despite this investment, U.S. rail still faces clear challenges, most notably in passenger rail, which faces the dual problems of aging infrastructure and insufficient funding.

Federal forecasts predict an approximate 40% increase in U.S. freight shipments, including by rail, by 2040. To prepare for the future, the U.S. Department of Transportation has worked with the transportation industry to draft the first National Freight Strategic Plan, which addresses impediments to the efficient flow of goods in support of the nation’s economy. The Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act complete the strategic plan by 2017 and be updated every five years. Through the FAST Act, Congress created a new federally-funded, freight-focused competitive grant program. Fostering Advancements in Shipping And Transportation For The Long-Term Achievement of National Efficiencies (FASTLANE) grants are expected to provide $4.5 billion through 2020 to freight and highway projects of national or regional significance.
We believe that the acquisition of William Charles including Ragnar Benson, provides the Company with the ability to capitalize on the new rail infrastructure construction that will be required to support the increase in U.S. freight shipments.

Environmental Remediation

Coal-fired power plants have significant and recurring environmental management needs, because they consistently generate various waste byproducts throughout the power generation process. The primary type of these waste byproducts are CCRs, commonly known as coal ash. According to the American Coal Ash Association, more than 102.3 million tons of coal ash were generated in 2018, and according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), coal ash is one of the largest types of waste in the U.S. Coal ash management is mission-critical to the daily operations of power plants, as they generally only have on-site storage capacity for three to four days of CCR waste accumulation. 
According to the American Coal Ash Association, as of 2018, approximately 42% of coal ash generated was disposed of. According to the EPA, approximately 80% of coal ash that was disposed of in 2012 was disposed of on-site in ash ponds or landfills. These sites are typically large and will require significant capital from their owners, as well as specialized environmental expertise, to monitor on an ongoing basis, remediate, relocate the waste or completely close in an environmentally sustainable way. 
As a result of our recent acquisition of Saiia and their ability to build strong relationships in the environmental remediation business, the Company intends to continue to increase its growth of this area as a part of our business. We believe that with Saiia's reputation and our cross-selling capabilities, we will be able to capture further market share and facilitate more self-performing environmental remediation opportunities in other projects that we undertake. 
Electrical Power and High Voltage Opportunities
The U.S. electrical transmission and distribution infrastructure requires significant ongoing maintenance, upgrade and expansion to manage power line congestion and avoid delivery failures. Regional shifts in population and industry may also create pockets of demand for increased transmission and distribution construction and upgrades. According to the DOE’s Annual Energy Outlook 2020 published in January 2020, significant new electricity generating capacity is expected to be added through 2050, all of which must be connected to the existing electric grid. 
Renewable energy generation projects, which are typically located in remote areas, often require investment in new transmission lines to interconnect with the electrical grid. Although we have outsourced our high-voltage electrical needs historically, we implemented a program during 2018 to upgrade our in-house capability to complete this work and continually strive to increase the portion of our high-voltage electrical work that we self-perform. In 2019, we self-performed electrical work on 10 projects that afforded us the opportunity to capture incremental margin on our projects and to provide enhanced service to our customers.
We believe that the same capabilities that we are building in order to self-perform high-voltage electrical work will enable us to capture incremental revenue by providing these services to third parties. With investment by utilities and transmission companies to modernize, secure and visually improve the existing transmission system expected to be strong over the coming years, we expect that our existing customer relationships and reputation will leave us well-positioned for growth in this sector.
Strategy
The key elements of our business strategy are as follows:

Retention of strong relationships with our customers for further diversification — We believe that we have strong, long-term relationships with each of our customers and have historically worked together with them to meet their needs. By leveraging our established relationships with these customers, we intend to provide expanded products and services that will continue to diversify our revenue streams and assist our customers with their business strategies.
Maintain Operational Excellence — We have a continual focus on maintaining operational excellence, which includes the following:

• | Quality - We believe in satisfying our clients, mitigating risk, and driving improvement by performing work right the first time.


• | Technical Expertise - We have an established reputation for safe, high quality performance, reliable customer service and technical expertise in constructing technically demanding projects.

7


• | Safety - We believe the safety of our employees, the public and the environment is a moral obligation as well as good business. By identifying and concentrating resources to address jobsite hazards, we continually strive to reduce our incident rates and the costs associated with accidents.


• | Productivity - We strive to use our resources efficiently to deliver work on time and on budget.

Ownership of Equipment — Many of our services are equipment intensive and certain key equipment used by us is specialized or customized for our businesses. The cost of construction equipment, and in some cases the availability of construction equipment, provides a significant barrier to entry into several of our businesses. We believe that our ownership and ability to lease a large and varied construction fleet at a reasonable cost, enables us to compete more effectively by ensuring availability and maximizing returns on investment of the equipment.
Customers
We have longstanding customer relationships with many established companies in the renewable energy, thermal power, petrochemical, environmental remediation, civil and industrial power industries, with a recurring base of blue-chip utility customers, as well as original equipment manufacturers that produce the equipment for our business. We have completed wind projects with top U.S. developers or owners, rail infrastructure projects with top railroads and heavy civil construction projects with top government agencies.
Although we are not dependent upon any one customer in any year, a relatively small number of repeat customers constitute a substantial portion of our total revenues. Accordingly, our management is responsible for developing and maintaining existing relationships with customers to secure additional projects and increase revenue from our current customer base. We believe that our strategic relationships with customers will result in future opportunities. Our management is also focused on pursuing growth opportunities with prospective new customers.
The Company had the following approximate revenue and accounts receivable concentrations, net of allowances, for the periods ended:

 | Revenue % | | Accounts Receivable %
 | Year Ended December 31, | | December 31, 
 | 2019 | | 2018 | | 2017 | 2019 | | 2018
Company A (Renewables Segment) | * | | | 21.0 | % | * | | | * | 20.0 | %
Company B (Specialty Civil Segment) | 10.9 | % | | * | | * | | | * | 19.0 | %

Company F (Renewables Segment) | * | | | * | | 14.0 | % | | * | * | 

———
* Amount was not above 10% threshold.
Our work is generally performed pursuant to contracts for specific projects or jobs that require the construction or installation of an entire complex of specified units within an infrastructure system. Customers are billed monthly throughout the completion of work on a project; however, some contracts provide for additional billing upon the achievement of specific completion milestones, which may increase the billing period to more than one month. Such contracts may include retainage provisions under which, generally, from 5% to 10% of the contract price is withheld until the work has been completed and accepted by the customer. Because we may not be able to maintain our current revenue levels or our current level of capacity and resource utilization if we are not able to replace work from completed projects with new project work, we actively review our backlog of project work and take appropriate action to minimize such exposure.
We believe that our industry experience, technical expertise and reputation for customer service, as well as the relationships developed between our customers and our senior management and project management teams are important to our being retained by our customers.

Backlog
Estimated backlog represents the amount of revenue we expect to realize in 2020 and beyond from the uncompleted portions of existing construction contracts, including new contracts under which work has not begun and awarded contracts for which the definitive project documentation is being prepared, as well as revenue from change orders and renewal options. Estimated backlog for work under fixed price contracts and cost-reimbursable contracts is determined based on historical trends, anticipated seasonal impacts, experience from similar projects and estimates of customer demand based on communications with our customers. These contracts are included in backlog based on the estimated total contract price upon completion. 
As of December 31, 2019 our total backlog was approximately $2.2 billion compared to $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2018. We expect to realize approximately 65.0% of our estimated backlog during 2020 and 35.0% during 2021 and beyond.
The following table summarizes our backlog by segment for December 31:

(in millions) | | 
Segments | December 31, 2019 | December 31, 2018
Renewables | 1,582.5 | | 1,246.8 | 
Specialty Civil | 588.7 | | 868.8 | 
Total | $ | 2,171.2 | | $ | 2,115.6

Based on historical trends in the Company’s backlog, we believe awarded contracts to be firm and that the revenue for such contracts will be recognized over the life of the project. Timing of revenue for construction and installation projects included in our backlog can be subject to change as a result of customer delays, regulatory factors, weather and/or other project-related factors. These changes could cause estimated revenue to be realized in periods later than originally expected, or not at all. In the past, we have occasionally experienced postponements, cancellations and reductions on construction projects, due to market volatility and regulatory factors. There can be no assurance as to our customers’ requirements or the accuracy of our estimates. As a result, our backlog as of any particular date is an uncertain indicator of future revenue and earnings and may not result in actual revenue or profits.
Backlog is not a term recognized under U.S. GAAP, although it is a common measurement used in our industry. Backlog also differs from the amount of our remaining performance obligations, which are described in Note 1 - Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2019, total backlog differed from the amount of our remaining performance obligations primarily due to the inclusion of contracts that were awarded but not yet fully executed. Additionally, our methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to the methodologies used by others. See ‘‘Risk Factors’’ for a discussion of the risks associated with our backlog.
Safety and Insurance/Risk Management
We strive to instill and enforce safe work habits in our employees, and we require that our employees participate in training programs relevant to their employment, including all those required by law. We evaluate employees in part based upon their safety performance and the safety performance of the employees they supervise. Our business units have established robust safety programs to encourage, monitor and improve compliance with safety procedures and regulations including, behavioral based safety, jobsite safety analysis, site-specific safety orientation, subcontractor orientation, site safety audits, accident and incident safety investigations, OSHA 30-hour and 10-hour training, drug and alcohol testing and regular trainings in fall protection, confined spaces, crane rigging and flagman, first aid, CPR and AED, among others.
Our business involves the use of heavy equipment and exposure to potentially dangerous workplace conditions. While we are committed to operating safely and prudently, we may be subject to claims by employees, customers and third parties for property damage and personal injuries that occur in connection with our work. We maintain insurance policies for worker’s compensation, employer liability, automobile liability, general liability, inland marine property and equipment, professional and pollution liability, excess liability, and director and officers’ liability. See Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements.
9

Our business may subject us to the risk of adverse site conditions and unfavorable weather. While we mitigate these risks contractually to the extent possible, market conditions prevent us from fully passing these risks to our customers, and there is not a robust insurance market to cover these risks. While we have evaluated the feasibility of insurance products to mitigate weather risk, we do not believe that the current insurance market offers commercially practicable solutions to protect the Company against significant losses caused by adverse weather.
Suppliers, Materials and Working Capital
Under many of our contracts, our customers provide the necessary materials and supplies for projects and we are responsible for the installation, but not the cost or warranty of those materials. Under certain other projects, we purchase the necessary materials and supplies on behalf of our customers from third-party providers. We are not dependent upon any one vendor and have not experienced significant difficulty in obtaining project-related materials or supplies as and when required for the projects we manage.
We utilize independent contractors to assist on projects and to help manage our work flow. Our independent contractors typically provide their own vehicles, tools and insurance coverage. We need working capital to support seasonal variations in our business, such as the impact of weather conditions on external construction and maintenance work and the spending patterns of our customers, both of which influence the timing of associated spending to support related customer demand. See ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.’’
We bear some risk of increases in the price of materials and supplies used in the performance of our work, such as aggregate, reinforcing steel, cable, and fuel. These risks are managed contractually, by entering into contracts with suppliers that fix the price paid by the Company within the budget established for a project, or by passing the risk of commodity cost increases to the customer.
Competition
We compete with a number of companies in the markets in which we operate, ranging from small local independent companies to large national firms, and some of our customers employ their own personnel to perform the type of services we provide.

The primary factors influencing competition in our industry are price, reputation, quality and delivery, relevant expertise, adequate financial resources, geographic presence, high safety ratings and a proven track record of operational success. We believe that our national platform, track record of completion, relationships with vendors, strong safety record and access to skilled labor enables us to compete favorably in all of these factors. We also believe that our ability to provide unionized and non-unionized workforces across a national footprint allows us to compete for a broad range of projects. While we believe our customers consider a number of factors when selecting a service provider, they award most of their work through a bid process. We believe our safety record, experience, quality of service and price are often principal factors in determining which service provider is selected.
Seasonality
Our revenues and results of operations can be subject to seasonal and other variations. These variations are influenced by weather, customer spending patterns, bidding seasons, receipt of required regulatory approvals, permits and rights of way, project timing and schedules and holidays. See ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Impact of Seasonality and Cyclical Nature of Business.’’
Regulation and Environmental Matters
We are subject to state and federal laws that apply to businesses generally, including laws and regulations related to labor relations, wages, worker safety and environmental protection.
We are also subject to numerous environmental laws, including the handling, transportation and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous substances and wastes, as well as emissions and discharges into the environment, including discharges into air, surface water, groundwater and soil. We also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and cleanup responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment.
We believe we have all material licenses and permits needed to conduct operations and that we are in material compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. However, we could incur significant liabilities if we fail to comply 
10

with applicable regulatory requirements. See ‘‘Risk Factors-We could incur substantial costs to comply with environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations and to address violations of liabilities under these requirements.’’
The potential impact of climate change on our operations is highly uncertain. Climate change may result in, among other things, changes in rainfall patterns, storm patterns and intensity and temperature levels. Our operating results are significantly influenced by weather and major changes in historical weather patterns could significantly impact our future operating results. For example, if climate change results in significantly more adverse weather conditions in a given period, we could experience reduced productivity and increases in certain other costs, which could negatively impact revenues and gross margins.
In light of changes in federal government priorities and the cost-competitiveness of wind and solar power production, certain of the tax credits for production of renewable energy are phasing out. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 (‘‘CAA’’), which contains certain federal tax incentives applicable to the renewable energy industry, provided for the gradual elimination of certain of these incentives. Currently, the tax code provides that the production tax credit for wind projects (the ‘‘PTC’’) applies to qualifying projects for which the construction commencement date was prior to January 1, 2021. The PTC was reduced by 20% for 2017, has been reduced by 40% for 2018, and finally will be reduced by 60% for 2019, and by 40% for 2020. Similarly, a phase down rate of the investment tax credit (the ‘‘ITC’’), which is available in lieu of PTC, is available for wind projects: 30% ITC for projects commencing before 2017, 24% for projects commencing in 2017, 18% for projects commencing in 2018 and 12% for projects commencing in 2019, and 18% for projects commencing in 2020. Solar projects, however, will be eligible for an investment tax credit (the ‘‘Solar ITC’’) only. The Solar ITC is 30% for projects commencing prior to 2020 and will be reduced to 26% for projects commencing in 2020 and to 22% for projects commencing in 2021. After 2021, the Solar ITC will remain at 10% for projects that commence prior to 2022, but are placed in service after 2023.
On December 16, 2019, the federal government implemented an agreement that extended lapsed and expiring tax breaks. The extension provides a single year extension of the PTC at a 60% level and the ITC at an 18% level to qualifying projects for which the construction commencement date is now prior to January 1, 2021.
Additionally, although the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act in December 2017 did not modify the existing production tax credit and investment tax credit incentive structures, a base erosion and anti-abuse tax, or ‘‘BEAT’’ provision, contained in the 2017 Tax Act imposes a minimum tax on certain corporations, and only 80% of the value of any such corporation’s production or investment tax credits can be applied as a reduction to such corporation’s BEAT liability. Accordingly, this BEAT provision could reduce the incentive for certain taxable investors to invest in tax equity financing arrangements and could materially reduce the value and availability such tax credits, grants and incentives for certain participants and financing sources in the wind and solar industry. The 2017 Tax Act permits the immediate expensing of certain capital expenditures between September 27, 2017 and January 1, 2023, but this new rule could be less valuable than a dollar-for-dollar investment tax credit or production tax credit, given the reduced corporate income tax rate of 21%. Any of the foregoing changes arising from the 2017 Tax Act, as well as other changes in law not mentioned herein, could adversely impact the demand for development of wind and solar energy generation facilities. See ‘‘Risk Factors-The U.S. wind and solar industries benefit from tax and other economic incentives and political and governmental policies.’’ for a discussion of the risks associated with these federal and state tax incentives. 
Employees
The Company has a workforce of both union and non-union employees that allows us to work anywhere in the U.S. We have a scalable workforce, with approximately 3,250 peak employees. As of December 31, 2019, we had 2,650 employees, 690 of whom were represented by unions or were subject to collective bargaining agreements. See Note 13. Employee Benefit Plans in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements, which are incorporated herein by reference.
We hire employees from a number of sources, including our industry, trade schools, colleges and universities. We attract and retain employees by offering a competitive salary, benefits package, opportunities for advancement and an exemplary safety record. We strive to offer a caring and stable work environment that enables our employees to improve their performance, and enhance their skills and knowledge. We believe that our corporate culture and core value system helps us to attract and retain employees. We provide opportunities for promotion and mobility within our organization, which we also believe helps us to retain our employees. Our employees participate in ongoing educational programs, some of which are internally developed, to enhance their technical and management skills through classroom and field training. We believe we have good relationships with employees and unions.
