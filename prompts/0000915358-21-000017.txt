Overview 

SigmaTron is a Delaware corporation, which was organized on November 16, 1993, and commenced operations when it became the successor to all of the assets and liabilities of SigmaTron L.P., an Illinois limited partnership, through a reorganization on February 8, 1994.

The Company operates in one business segment as an independent provider of Electronic Manufacturing Services (“EMS”), which includes printed circuit board assemblies and completely assembled (box-build) electronic products. In connection with the production of assembled products, the Company also provides services to its customers, including (1) automatic and manual assembly and testing of products; (2) material sourcing and procurement; (3) manufacturing and test engineering support; (4) design services; (5) warehousing 

 



and distribution services; and (6) assistance in obtaining product approval from governmental and other regulatory bodies. The Company provides these manufacturing services through an international network of facilities located in the United States, Mexico, China, Vietnam and Taiwan.

The Company provides manufacturing and assembly services ranging from the assembly of individual components to the assembly and testing of box-build electronic products. The Company has the ability to produce assemblies requiring mechanical as well as electronic capabilities. The products assembled by the Company are then incorporated into finished products sold in various industries, particularly industrial electronics, consumer electronics and medical/life sciences. In some instances, the Company manufactures and assembles the completed finished product for its customers.

The Company operates manufacturing facilities in Elk Grove Village, Illinois United States of America (“U.S.”); Union City, California, U.S.; Acuna, Coahuila, Mexico (“MX”); Chihuahua, Chihuahua, MX; and Tijuana, Baja California, MX; Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China; and Ho Chi Minh City, Dong Nai Province, Vietnam. In addition, the Company maintains an International Procurement Office and Compliance and Sustainability Center (“IPO”) in Taipei, Taiwan. The Company also provides design services in Elgin, Illinois and warehousing services in Del Rio, Texas; El Paso, Texas; Elk Grove Village, IL; and San Diego, California. The Company has an information technology office in Taichung, Taiwan. 

The Company’s international footprint provides our customers with flexibility within the Company to manufacture in China, Mexico, Vietnam or the U.S. We believe this strategy will continue to serve the Company well as its customers continuously evaluate their supply chain strategies.

For the fiscal year ended 2021 the Company reported pre-tax profit of approximately $2,100,000 and sales of approximately $278,000,000. The Company reported strong results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, including pre-tax profit of approximately $1,900,000 and sales of approximately $76,000,000. The year end results were strong despite the first fiscal quarter, which was the height of the COVID-19 pandemic for the Company. These results were obtained after incurring significant non-reoccurring expenses during the year related to changing the Company’ primary bank, COVID-19 related expenses, including reconfiguring operations to provide a safe environment and expenses related to a proposed acquisition of Wagz, Inc.  Furthermore, the continuing electronic component shortages in the marketplace have led to lower productivity on occasion, as the marketplace has remained volatile.  

Going forward, the Company’s backlog remains at an all-time high with demand staying strong across the vast majority of markets and customers the Company serves. The Company has several new customers of significance that the Company expects to begin shipping to in the first half of fiscal year 2022. However, the electronic component marketplace remains volatile in terms of both supply and price. It could well negatively impact the Company’s ability to ship the backlog on time.  This is a problem faced by almost every customer and competitor in the EMS industry, and the Company does not see the situation improving soon.  The Company’s supply chain and operations teams have challenges which continue for the foreseeable future and it would seem they will remain for fiscal year 2022.  The Company does not see any signs of weakening in the semiconductor demand across all markets, nor does the Company see any additional capacity coming online anytime soon.  

Recent Developments 

On May 29, 2020, SigmaTron and Wagz, Inc. (“Wagz”), a privately held company in the pet technology market, entered into a Convertible Secured Promissory Note in the principal sum of up to $4,052,478.  On January 27, 2021, Wagz issued an additional Convertible Secured Promissory Note to the Company in the principal sum of up to $1,588,328. On April 30, 2021, Wagz issued an additional Convertible Secured Promissory Note to the Company in the principal amount of $1,249,966. On April 30, 2021, Wagz issued a Secured Promissory Note to the Company in the principal amount of $308,329 (collectively, the “Notes”). At April 30, 2021, $7,014,594 and $184,507 was outstanding under Note receivable and Other receivables, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheet. The Notes are due (the “Maturity Date”) on the earliest to occur of (a) December 31, 2021 or, if the closing of the Company’s proposed acquisition of Wagz (the “Closing”) does not occur due to the Company’s termination, that date which is twelve (12) months after the date of such termination, (b) upon the closing of a sale of all or substantially all of the assets or common stock of Wagz 

 



(other than the Closing), or (c) an Event of Default (as defined in the Notes). Interest is payable at the rate of four percent (4%) per annum and is payable on the Maturity Date. The Notes are collateralized by substantially all assets of Wagz. 

On June 4, 2020, SigmaTron and Wagz, announced that they executed a Letter of Intent (“LOI”) relating to a proposed acquisition. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the LOI, SigmaTron expects to issue approximately 2,443,870 shares of SigmaTron common stock that would result in the stockholders of Wagz owning in the aggregate approximately one-third of the combined company. The potential benefits to the Company from that transaction were summarized in the June 4, 2020 announcement. On July 19, 2021 the definitive agreement was signed. The parties expect the transaction to close by September 30, 2021 and it remains subject to achievement of certain milestones and satisfaction of conditions by both parties prior to Closing including the Company having determined that the Wagz Freedom Smart Collar™ meets certain criteria, and the approval by the stockholders of both SigmaTron and Wagz. 

A pandemic of respiratory diseases, including variants (commonly known as "COVID-19") began to spread globally, including to the United States, in early 2020. The full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak is inherently uncertain at the time of this report. The COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in travel restrictions and in some cases, prohibitions of non-essential activities, disruption and shutdown of certain businesses and greater uncertainty in global financial markets. The Company cannot predict the extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak will continue to impact its business or operating results, which is highly dependent on inherently uncertain future developments, including the severity and duration of the COVID-19 outbreak and the actions taken by governments and businesses in relation to COVID-19 containment. The Company has adopted several measures in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. For more information on the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors – The ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic and measures taken in response thereto have adversely affected the Company’s results of operations and its financial condition, and the full impact of the pandemic will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.”

Products and Services

The Company provides a broad range of electronic and electromechanical manufacturing related outsourcing solutions for its customers. These solutions incorporate the Company’s knowledge and expertise in the EMS industry to provide its customers with an international network of manufacturing facilities, advanced manufacturing technologies, complete supply chain management, responsive and flexible customer service, as well as product design, test and engineering support. The Company’s EMS solutions are available from inception of product concept through the ultimate delivery of a finished product. Such technologies and services include the following:

Manufacturing and Testing Services: The Company’s core business is the assembly and testing of all types of electronic printed circuit board assemblies (“PCBA”) and often incorporating these PCBAs into electronic modules used in all types of devices and products that depend on electronics for their operation. This assembly work utilizes state of the art manufacturing and test equipment to deliver highly reliable products to the Company’s customers. The Company supports new product introduction (“NPI”), low volume / high mix as well as high volume/ low mix assembly work at all levels of assembly and text complexity. From simple component assembly through the most complicated industry testing, the Company offers most of the services required to build electronic devices commercially available in the market today.

Design Services: To complement the manufacturing services it offers its customers, the Company also offers design for manufacturing (“DFM”), and design for test (“DFT”) review services to help customers ensure that the products they have designed are optimized for production and testing. The Company also offers complete product design services.

Supply Chain Management: The Company provides complete supply chain management for the procurement of components needed to build customers’ products. This includes the procurement and management of all types of electronic components and related mechanical parts such as plastics and metals. The Company’s resources supporting this activity are provided both on a plant specific basis as well as globally 

 



through its IPO in Taipei, Taiwan. Each of its sites is linked together using the same Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) system and custom IScore software tools with real-time on-line visibility for customer access. The Company procures material from major manufacturers and distributors of electronic parts all over the world.

The Company relies on numerous third-party suppliers for components used in the Company’s production process. Certain of these components are available only from single-sources or a limited number of suppliers. In addition, a customer’s specifications may require the Company to obtain components from a single-source or a small number of suppliers. The loss of any such suppliers could have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations. Further, the Company could operate at a cost disadvantage compared to competitors who have greater direct buying power from suppliers. The Company orders material from its suppliers consistent with the purchase orders and forecasts it receives from its customers. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors – The availability of raw components or an increase in their price may affect the Company’s operations and profits”.

Warehousing and Distribution: The Company provides both in-house and third-party warehousing, shipping, and customs brokerage for border crossings as part of its service offering. This includes international shipping, drop shipments to the end customer as well as support of inventory optimization activities such as kanban and consignment.

Government Compliance, Green, Sustainability, and Social Responsible Initiatives: The Company supports initiatives that promote sustainability, green environment and social responsibility. The Company helps its customers in achieving effective compliance. Those include, but are not limited to, Restrictions of Hazardous Substances (“RoHS”), Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”) and Conflict Minerals regulations. 

Manufacturing Locations and Certifications: The Company’s manufacturing locations are strategically located to support our customers with locations in Elk Grove Village, Illinois U.S.; Union City, California U.S.; Acuna, Chihuahua and Tijuana, Mexico; Suzhou, China and Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. The Company’s ability to transition manufacturing to lower cost regions without jeopardizing flexibility and service differentiates it from many competitors. Manufacturing certifications and registrations are location specific, and include ISO 9001:2015, ISO 14001:2004, ISO 14001:2015, IATF 16949:2016, Medical ISO 13485:2016 and FDB Certification, Aerospace AS9100D and International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”) certifications.

The Company markets its services through six independent manufacturers’ representative organizations that together currently employ 14 sales personnel in the United States and Canada. Independent manufacturers’ representatives’ organizations receive variable commissions based on orders received by the Company and are assigned specific accounts, not territories. In addition, the Company markets itself through its website and tradeshows. 
Mexico, China, Vietnam and Taiwan Operations

The Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Standard Components de Mexico, S.A, a Mexican corporation, is located in Acuna, Coahuila Mexico, a border town across the Rio Grande River from Del Rio, Texas, and is 155 miles west of San Antonio. Standard Components de Mexico, S.A. was incorporated and commenced operations in 1968 and had 939 employees at April 30, 2021. The Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, AbleMex S.A. de C.V., a Mexican corporation, is located in Tijuana, Baja California Mexico, a border town south of San Diego, California. AbleMex S.A. de C.V. was incorporated and commenced operations in 2000. The operation had 408 employees at April 30, 2021. The Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Digital Appliance Controls de Mexico S.A., a Mexican corporation, operates in Chihuahua, Mexico, located approximately 235 miles from El Paso, Texas. Digital Appliance Controls de Mexico S.A. was incorporated and commenced operations in 1997. The operation had 594 employees at April 30, 2021. The Company believes that one of the key benefits to having operations in Mexico is its access to cost-effective labor resources while having geographic proximity to the United States.

The Company’s wholly-owned foreign enterprises, Wujiang SigmaTron Electronics Co., Ltd. and SigmaTron Electronic Technology Co., Ltd., are located in Suzhou, China. The Company has entered into an agreement with governmental authorities in the economic development zone of Wujiang, Jiangsu Province, Peoples Republic of China, pursuant to which the Company became the lessee of a parcel of land of approximately 100 Chinese acres. The term of the land lease is 50 years. The Company built a manufacturing plant, office space and dormitories on this site during 2004. In fiscal year 2015, the China facility expanded and added 40,000 square feet in warehouse and manufacturing. The total square footage of the facility is 216,950 and the operation had 417 employees as of April 30, 2021. Both SigmaTron China entities operate at this site. 

 




The Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Spitfire Controls (Vietnam) Co. Ltd. is located in Amata Industrial Park, Bien Hoa City, Dong Nai Province, Vietnam, and is 18 miles east of Ho Chi Minh City. Spitfire Controls (Vietnam) Co. Ltd. was incorporated and commenced operation in 2005 and had 334 employees as of April 30, 2021.

The Company maintains an IPO in Taipei, Taiwan which was incorporated in 1991. The total square footage of the office is 4,685 square feet. The Company has an information technology office in Taichung, Taiwan. The total square footage of the office is 1,650 square feet. The Company had 34 employees located in the Taiwan offices as of April 30, 2021.

The Company provides funds for manufacturing services such as salaries, wages, overhead and capital expenditure items as necessary to operate its wholly-owned Mexican, Vietnamese and Chinese subsidiaries and foreign enterprises and the IPO in Taiwan. The Company provides funding in U.S. Dollars, which are exchanged for Pesos, Dong, Renminbi, and New Taiwan dollars. The fluctuation of currencies from time to time, without an equal or greater increase in inflation, could have a material impact on the financial results of the Company. The impact of currency fluctuations for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2021, resulted in net foreign currency transaction losses of approximately $285,389 compared to net foreign currency losses of $285,654 in the prior year. In fiscal year 2021, the Company paid approximately $59,020,000 to its foreign subsidiaries for manufacturing services. All intercompany balances have been eliminated upon consolidation. 

The consolidated financial statements as of April 30, 2021, include the accounts and transactions of SigmaTron, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Standard Components de Mexico, S.A., AbleMex S.A. de C.V., Digital Appliance Controls de Mexico, S.A. de C.V., Spitfire Controls (Vietnam) Co. Ltd., Spitfire Controls (Cayman) Co. Ltd., wholly-owned foreign enterprises Wujiang SigmaTron Electronics Co., Ltd. and SigmaTron Electronic Technology Co., Ltd., and international procurement office, SigmaTron Taiwan Branch. The functional currency of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries operations is the U.S. Dollar. Intercompany transactions are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.

Competition

The EMS industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid change. Furthermore, both large and small companies compete in the industry, and many have significantly greater financial resources, more extensive business experience and greater marketing and production capabilities than the Company. The significant competitive factors in this industry include price, quality, service, timeliness, reliability, the ability to source raw components, and manufacturing and technological capabilities. The Company believes it can compete on all of these factors.
Consolidation

As a result of consolidation and other transactions involving competitors and other companies in the Company’s markets, the Company occasionally reviews potential transactions relating to its business, products and technologies. Such transactions could include mergers, acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures, licensing agreements, co-promotion agreements, financing arrangements or other types of transactions. In the future, the Company may choose to enter into these types of or other transactions at any time depending on available sources of financing, and such transactions could have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial condition or operations.
Governmental Regulations 

The Company’s operations are subject to certain foreign government, U.S. federal, state and local regulatory requirements relating to, among others, environmental, waste management, labor and health and safety matters.  Management believes that the Company’s business is operated in compliance with all such regulations, which include European regulations known as Restriction of Hazardous Substances (“RoHS”) and Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”).  From time-to-time the Company's customers request REACH required information and certifications on the assemblies the Company manufactures for them.  These requests require the Company to gather information from component suppliers to verify the presence and level of mass of any substances of very high concerns (“SVHCs”) greater than 0.1% in 

 



the assemblies the Company manufactures based on customer specifications.  If any SVHCs are present at more than 0.1% of the mass of the item, the specific concentration and mass of the SVHC must be reported to proper authorities by the Company's customer.

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) introduced reporting requirements for verification of whether the Company directly (or indirectly through suppliers of components) is purchasing the minerals or metals gold, columbite-tantalite, cassiterite, wolframite and their derivatives (tin, tungsten, and tantalum), that are being provided by sources in the conflict region of the Democratic Republic of Congo (“DRC”) and contributing conflict.  Consistent with recent prior years, in May 2021, the Company filed Form SD with the Securities and Exchange Commission stating the Company’s supply chain remains DRC conflict undeterminable.

The Company’s costs of compliance with environmental laws, including conflict mineral reporting, is estimated to be a total of approximately $1,800,000 for the three most recently completed fiscal years ending April 30, 2021.  Additional or modified requirements may be imposed in the future.  If such additional or modified requirements are imposed, or if conditions requiring remediation are found to exist, the Company may be required to incur additional expenditures.

Backlog

The Company relies on forecasted orders and purchase orders (firm orders) from its customers to estimate backlog. The Company’s backlog of firm orders as of April 30, 2021, and April 30, 2020, was approximately $307,130,000 and $272,550,000, respectively. The Company believes a significant portion of the backlog at April 30, 2021, will ship in fiscal year 2022. Because customers may cancel or reschedule deliveries, backlog may not be a meaningful indicator of future revenue. Variations in the magnitude and duration of contracts, forecasts and purchase orders received by the Company and delivery requirements generally may result in substantial fluctuations in backlog from period to period.
Employees

The Company employed approximately 3,200 full-time employees of which approximately 500 were located in the U.S. as of April 30, 2021. There were 224 engaged in engineering or engineering-related services, 2,633 in manufacturing and 339 in administrative and marketing functions. 

The Company makes a considerable effort to maintain a qualified and engaged work force. The Company makes a concerted effort to engage its employees and provide opportunities for growth and the Company believes that its employee relations are good. The Company considers the health and safety of its employees a key priority, and even more so since the COVID-19 pandemic started. The Company has adopted various safety, cleaning and social distancing protocols. The Company is committed to removing conditions that may cause personal injury or occupational illness. 

SigmaTron has a labor contract with Chemical & Production Workers Union Local No. 30, AFL-CIO, covering the Company’s workers in Elk Grove Village, Illinois which expires on November 30, 2021. The Company’s Mexican subsidiary, Standard Components de Mexico S.A., has a labor contract with Sindicato De Trabajadores de la Industra Electronica, Similares y Conexos del Estado de Coahuila, C.T.M. covering the Company’s workers in Acuna, Mexico which expires on February 7, 2022. The Company’s subsidiary located in Tijuana, Mexico has a labor contract with Sindicato Mexico Moderno De Trabajadores De La, Baja California, C.R.O.C. The contract does not have an expiration date. The Company’s subsidiary located in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, has a labor contract with CONG DOAN CO SO CONG TY TNHH Spitfire Controls Vietnam. The contract expires on April 30, 2022.

Since the time the Company commenced operations, it has not experienced any union-related work stoppages.
