Item 1.  Business
Organization
HMS Income Fund, Inc. (the “Company”) was formed as a Maryland corporation on November 28, 2011 under the General Corporation Law of the State of Maryland. The Company is an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end investment company that has elected to be treated as a business development company (“BDC”) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”). The Company has elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). 
Our primary investment objective is to generate current income through debt and equity investments. A secondary objective is to generate long-term capital appreciation through equity and equity related investments including warrants, convertible securities and other rights to acquire equity securities. Our portfolio strategy is to invest primarily in illiquid debt and equity securities issued by lower middle market (“LMM”) companies, which generally have annual revenues between $10 million and $150 million, and middle market (“Middle Market”) companies that are generally larger in size than the LMM companies. Our Middle Market investments are made in businesses that are generally larger in size than our LMM portfolio companies, with annual revenues typically between $10 million and $3 billion. Our LMM and Middle Market portfolio investments generally range in size from $1 million to $15 million. The Company categorizes some of its investments in LMM companies and Middle Market companies as private loan (“Private Loan”) portfolio investments. Private Loan investments, often referred to in the debt markets as “club deals,” are investments, generally in debt instruments, that we originate on a collaborative basis with other investment funds. Private Loan investments are typically similar in size, structure, terms and conditions to investments we hold in our LMM portfolio and Middle Market portfolio. Our portfolio also includes other portfolio (“Other Portfolio”) investments primarily consisting of investments managed by third parties, which differ from the typical profiles for our LMM, Middle Market, or Private Loan investments. 
We previously registered for sale up to 150,000,000 shares of common stock pursuant to a registration statement on Form N-2 (File No. 333-178548) which was initially declared effective by the SEC on June 4, 2012 (the “Initial Offering”). The Initial Offering terminated on December 1, 2015. We raised approximately $601.2 million under the Initial Offering, including proceeds from the distribution reinvestment plan of approximately $22.0 million. We also registered for sale up to $1,500,000,000 worth of shares of common stock (the “Offering”) pursuant to the Registration Statement, as amended, most recently declared effective on October 6, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, we had raised approximately $105.4 million in the Offering, including proceeds from the distribution reinvestment plan of approximately $24.8 million.
On February 22, 2017, the board of directors, after determining that it would be in the best interests of us and our stockholders, decided to continue our Offering until September 30, 2017 and authorized the closing of our Offering to new investors (the “Closing”) to occur on or about such date. The board of directors previously authorized the Closing to occur on or about March 31, 2017, subject to the board of directors’ final approval. The board of directors retained its right to provide final approval on the specific terms of the Closing, including its right to accelerate the Closing or to further continue our Offering if the board of directors determines that it is in the best interests of us and our stockholders to do so.
Our wholly owned subsidiaries, HMS Funding I LLC (“HMS Funding”) and HMS Equity Holding, LLC (“HMS Equity Holding”), were both organized as Delaware limited liability companies in 2014. Our wholly owned subsidiary, HMS Equity Holding II, Inc., (“HMS Equity Holding II”) was organized as a Delaware corporation in 2016. HMS Funding was created pursuant to the Capital One Credit Facility (as defined below) in order to function as a “Structured Subsidiary,” which is permitted to incur debt outside of the Capital One Credit Facility since it is not a guarantor under the Capital One Credit Facility. HMS Equity Holding, which has elected to be a taxable entity, primarily holds equity investments in portfolio companies which are “pass through” entities for tax purposes. HMS Equity Holding II, which has elected to be a taxable entity, holds an equity investment in a portfolio company which is a “pass through” entity for tax purposes.

The business of the Company is managed by HMS Adviser LP (the “Adviser”), a Texas limited partnership and affiliate of Hines Interests Limited Partnership (“Hines”), under an Investment Advisory and Administrative Services Agreement dated May 31, 2012, as amended (the “Investment Advisory Agreement”). Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser does not earn any profit under its provision of administrative services to the Company. The Company and the Adviser have retained MSC Adviser I, LLC (the “Sub-Adviser”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Main Street Capital Corporation (“Main Street”), a New York Stock Exchange listed-BDC, as the Company’s investment sub-adviser under an Investment Sub-Advisory Agreement (the “Sub-Advisory Agreement”) to identify, evaluate, negotiate and structure prospective investments, make investment and portfolio management recommendations for approval by the Adviser, monitor the Company’s investment portfolio and provide certain ongoing administrative services to the Adviser. The Adviser and Sub-Adviser are collectively referred to as the “Advisers,” and each is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”). Upon the execution of the Sub-Advisory Agreement, Main Street became an affiliate of the Company. The Company has engaged Hines Securities, Inc. (the “Dealer Manager”), an affiliate of the Adviser, to serve as the Dealer Manager for the Offering. The Dealer Manager is responsible for marketing the Company’s common stock.
We refer to HMS Income Fund, Inc. as the “Company,” and the use of “we,” “our,” “us” or similar pronouns in this Form 10-K refers to HMS Income Fund, Inc. or the Company as required by the context in which such pronoun is used.

Overview of our Business
As of December 31, 2016, we had 75 debt investments in 71 Middle Market portfolio companies with an aggregate fair value of approximately $638.4 million and a total cost basis of approximately $658.8 million, and five equity investments in four Middle Market portfolio companies with an aggregate fair value of approximately $5.1 million and a total cost basis of approximately $4.7 million. As of December 31, 2016, 82.0% of our Middle Market debt investments were secured by first priority liens. Our Middle Market portfolio investments have an average investment size of $8.0 million and have a weighted average annual effective yield of approximately 8.8%. The Middle Market debt investments generally have floating interest rates at a London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a premium, subject to LIBOR floors, and have an average term of three to seven years. 

As of December 31, 2016, we had 29 debt investments in 22 LMM portfolio companies with an aggregate fair value of approximately $78.4 million, and a total cost basis of approximately $78.0 million, and 28 equity investments in 22 LMM portfolio companies with an aggregate fair value of approximately $37.6 million, and a total cost basis of approximately $31.2 million. Our LMM debt investments generally have terms of five to seven years, with limited required amortization prior to maturity, and provide for monthly or quarterly payment of interest. We typically structure our LMM debt investments with the maximum seniority and collateral that we can reasonably obtain while seeking to achieve our total return target. In most cases, our LMM debt investment will be collateralized by a first priority lien on substantially all the assets of the portfolio company. As of December 31, 2016, our LMM debt investments had a weighted average annual effective yield of approximately 12.4%, and 95.1% of such investments were secured by first priority liens on the assets of the LMM portfolio companies. The LMM equity investments consist of equity ownership interests in the LMM portfolio companies and warrants to acquire equity interests in the LMM portfolio companies.
As of December 31, 2016, we had 29 debt investments in 28 Private Loan portfolio companies with an aggregate fair value of approximately $205.0 million and a cost basis of approximately $206.0 million, and nine equity investments in six Private Loan portfolio companies with an aggregate fair value of approximately $6.3 million and a cost basis of approximately $5.2 million. 
5

The Private Loan debt investments had a weighted average annual effective yield of approximately 9.2%, and 94.3% of the Private Loan debt investments were secured by first priority liens.
As of December 31, 2016, we had three Other Portfolio investments with an aggregate fair value of approximately $18.4 million and a cost basis of approximately $18.6 million, which comprised 1.9% of our investment portfolio at fair value. 
The value of our investment portfolio will fluctuate with changes in market pricing of our underlying investments. During the fourth quarter of 2014 through the first quarter of 2016, our portfolio experienced significant unrealized losses that were largely related to the impact of broad price declines in the high yield bond and leveraged loan markets and the effect of the declining oil prices on our investments in the oil and gas sector. In 2016, we recognized realized losses on investments in our portfolio, primarily driven by the restructuring of certain investments in the oil and gas sector. Although we have seen a recovery in the leveraged loan markets in the second half of 2016, it has not been sufficient to reverse these unrealized and realized losses. 
We will continue investing in, and intend to have a significant portion of our assets invested in, customized direct secured and unsecured loans to, and equity securities of, LMM companies. In most cases, companies that issue customized LMM securities to us will be privately held at the time we invest in them. Typically, our investment in LMM companies will require us to co-invest with Main Street and/or its affiliates. These types of co-investments required us to obtain an exemptive order from the SEC as discussed below. While the structure of our investments in customized LMM securities is likely to vary, we may invest in senior secured debt, senior unsecured debt, subordinated secured debt, subordinated unsecured debt, mezzanine debt, convertible debt, convertible preferred equity, preferred equity, common equity, warrants and other instruments, many of which generate current yields. We will make other investments as allowed by the 1940 Act and consistent with our continued qualification as a RIC. For a discussion of the risks inherent in our portfolio investments, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Relating to our Business and Structure.”

Our investments may include other equity investments, such as warrants, options to buy a minority interest in a portfolio company, or contractual payment rights or rights to receive a proportional interest in the operating cash flow or net income of such company. When determined by our Advisers to be in our best interest, we may acquire a controlling interest in a portfolio company. Any warrants we receive with our debt securities may require only a nominal cost to exercise, and thus, as a portfolio company appreciates in value, we may achieve additional investment return from this equity interest. We intend to structure such warrants to include provisions protecting our rights as a minority-interest or, if applicable, controlling-interest holder, as well as puts, or rights to sell such securities back to the company upon the occurrence of specified events. In addition, we may obtain demand or “piggyback” registration rights in connection with these equity interests.

We plan to hold many of our investments to maturity or repayment, but will sell our investments earlier if a liquidity event takes place, such as the sale or recapitalization of a portfolio company, or if we determine a sale of one or more of our investments to be in our best interest.
The Adviser is registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. Our Adviser oversees the management of our activities and is responsible for making investment decisions with respect to, and providing day-to-day management and administration of our investment portfolio. Our Adviser is wholly-owned by Hines. We and our Adviser have engaged our Sub-Adviser to identify, evaluate, negotiate and structure prospective investments, make investment and portfolio management recommendations for approval by our Adviser, monitor our investment portfolio and provide certain ongoing administrative services to our Adviser.

As a BDC, we are subject to certain regulatory restrictions in making our investments, including limitations on our ability to co-invest with certain affiliates. However, we have received exemptive relief from the SEC that permits us, subject to certain conditions, to co-invest with Main Street in certain transactions originated by Main Street and/or our Advisers. The exemptive relief permits us, and certain of our directly or indirectly wholly owned subsidiaries on the one hand, and Main Street and/or certain of its affiliates on the other hand, to co-invest in the same investment opportunities where such investment would otherwise be prohibited under Section 57(a)(4) of the 1940 Act. Under the co-investment program, we expect that co-investment between us and Main Street will be the norm rather than the exception, as substantially all potential co-investments that are appropriate investments for us should also be appropriate investments for Main Street, and vice versa. Limited exceptions to co-investing will be based on available capital, diversification and other relevant factors. Accordingly, our Sub-Adviser treats every potential investment in customized LMM securities evaluated by Main Street as a potential investment opportunity for us, determines the appropriateness of each potential investment for co-investment by us, provides to our Adviser, in advance, information about each potential investment that it deems appropriate for us and proposes an allocation according to an investment allocation policy reviewed periodically by our board of directors between us and Main Street. If our Adviser deems such potential co-investment transaction and proposed allocation appropriate for us, our Adviser presents the transaction and the proposed allocation to the members of our board of directors who are (1) not interested persons of us or Main Street, and (2) who do not have a financial interest in the proposed transaction or the proposed portfolio company, which directors are referred to as “Eligible Directors,” and our Sub-
6

Adviser presents the transaction and the proposed allocation for Main Street to the Eligible Directors of the Main Street board of directors. Each board of directors, including a majority of the Eligible Directors of each board of directors, must approve each proposed co-investment transaction and the associated allocations therewith prior to the consummation of any co-investment transaction. No independent director on our board of directors or Main Street’s board of directors may have any direct or indirect financial interest in any co-investment transaction or any interest in any related portfolio company, other than through an interest (if any) in our or Main Street’s securities, as applicable. Additional information regarding the operation of the co-investment program is set forth in the order granting our exemptive relief, which may be reviewed on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.
In addition to the co-investment program described in the Form 10-K and in the exemptive relief, we may continue to co-invest in syndicated deals and secondary loan market purchases in accordance with applicable regulatory guidance or interpretations.

We expect that the debt in which we invest will generally have stated terms of three to seven years. However, we are in no way limited with regard to the maturity or duration of any debt investment we may make, and we do not have a policy in place with respect to stated maturities of debt investments. 
We have employed, and in the future intend to employ, leverage as market conditions permit and at the discretion of our Adviser, but in no event will leverage employed exceed 50% of the value of our assets, as required by the 1940 Act.

Business Strategy

Our primary investment objective is to generate current income through debt and equity investments in LMM companies based in the United States and secured debt investments of Middle Market companies generally headquartered in the United States. A secondary objective is to generate long-term capital appreciation through equity and equity-related investments including warrants, convertible securities, and other rights to acquire equity securities. We have adopted the following business strategy to achieve our investment objective:

• | Utilize the experience and expertise of the principals of our Advisers. The investment professionals employed by our Sub-Adviser are also the investment professionals responsible for investing and managing Main Street’s securities portfolio. Main Street is a BDC whose shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Main Street’s primary investment focus is providing customized debt and equity financing to LMM companies and debt capital to Middle Market companies that operate in diverse industry sectors. At December 31, 2016, Main Street had debt and equity investments with an aggregate fair value of approximately $1.8 billion in over 200 portfolio companies. Our Adviser’s senior management team, through affiliates of Hines, has participated in the management of three publicly offered and non-traded real estate investment trusts and has extensive experience in evaluating and underwriting the credit of tenants, many of which are LMM companies, of its commercial real estate properties. The principals of our Adviser, including Sherri W. Schugart, the Chairman of our board of directors, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Ryan T. Sims, our Chief Financial Officer and Secretary, have access to a broad network of relationships with financial sponsors, commercial and investment banks, LMM companies and leaders within a number of industries that we believe produce significant investment opportunities.


• | Focus on Middle Market and LMM companies with stable cash flow. We believe that there are relatively few finance companies focused on transactions involving Middle Market and LMM companies, and this is one factor that allows us to negotiate favorable investment terms. Such favorable terms include higher debt yields and lower leverage levels, more significant covenant protection and greater equity participation than typical of transactions involving larger companies. We generally invest in established companies with positive cash flow. We believe that established companies possess better risk-adjusted return profiles than newer companies that are building management or in early stages of building a revenue base. These companies represent a significant portion of the U.S. economy and often require substantial capital investment to grow their businesses.


• | Emphasize discipline in our underwriting policies and rigor in our portfolio management. We employ an underwriting process that includes a review of the prospects, competitive position, financial performance and industry dynamics of each potential portfolio company. In addition, we perform due diligence on potential investments and seek to invest with management teams and/or private equity sponsors who have proven capabilities in building value. Through our Advisers, we offer managerial assistance to our portfolio companies, giving them access to our investment experience, direct industry expertise and contacts, and allowing us to continually monitor their progress. As part of the monitoring process, our Advisers analyze monthly and quarterly financial statements versus the previous periods and year, review financial projections, meet with management, attend board meetings and review all compliance certificates and covenants.


• | Focus on long-term credit performance and principal protection. We will structure our customized loan investments on a conservative basis with high cash yields, first and/or second lien security interests where possible, cash origination fees, and lower relative leverage levels. We will seek strong deal protections for our customized debt investments, including default

7

penalties, information rights, board observation rights, and affirmative, negative and financial covenants, such as lien protection and prohibitions against change of control. We believe these protections will reduce our risk of capital loss.

• | Diversification. We seek to diversify our portfolio broadly among companies in a multitude of different industries and end markets, thereby reducing the concentration of credit risk in any one company or sector of the economy. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in this effort.

Deal Origination

Over the years, we believe the management team of Main Street, who controls our Sub-Adviser, and the affiliates of Hines have developed and maintained a strong reputation as principal investors and an extensive network of relationships. Main Street sources investments of the type we expect to make on a day-to-day basis as part of operating a New York Stock Exchange-listed BDC. Main Street has business development professionals dedicated to sourcing investments through relationships with numerous loan syndication and trading desks, investment banks, private equity sponsors, business brokers, merger and acquisition advisors, finance companies, commercial banks, law firms and accountants. Moreover, through its over 60 years of experience in leasing commercial real estate on a global basis, Hines has developed relationships with a large number of Middle Market companies that are a potential source of Middle Market investment opportunities. Our Adviser also has continuous access to Main Street’s professional team due to its relationship with our Sub-Adviser.

We believe that our industry relationships are a significant source for new investment opportunities. We generally source our investments in ways other than going to auctions, which include capitalizing on long-standing relationships with companies and financial sponsors to obtain access to proprietary investment opportunities.

From time to time, we may receive referrals for new prospective investments from our portfolio companies as well as other participants in the capital markets. We may pay referral fees to those who refer transactions to us that we consummate.

Investment Selection

Our investment philosophy and portfolio construction involves:


• | An assessment of the overall macroeconomic environment and financial markets;


• | Company-specific research and analysis; and


• | An emphasis on capital preservation, low volatility and minimization of downside risk.

The foundation of our investment philosophy is intensive credit investment analysis based on fundamental value-oriented research and diversification. Our selection process is based on:

• | A comprehensive analysis of issuer creditworthiness, including a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the issuer’s business;


• | An evaluation of the management team;


• | An analysis of business strategy and long-term industry trends; and


• | An in-depth examination of capital structure, financial results and financial projections.

We seek to identify those issuers exhibiting superior fundamental risk-return profiles with a particular focus on investments with the following characteristics:


• | Established companies with a history of positive and stable operating cash flows. We seek to invest in established companies with sound historical financial performance. We typically focus on companies with a history of profitability. We generally will not invest in start-up companies or companies with speculative business plans.


• | Ability to exert meaningful influence. We target investment opportunities in which we will be the lead investor where we can add value through active participation.


• | Experienced management team. We generally require that our portfolio companies have an experienced management team. We also seek to invest in companies that have a strong equity incentive program in place that properly aligns the interests of management with a company’s investors.


• | Strong franchises and sustainable competitive advantages. We seek to invest in companies with proven products and/or services and strong regional or national operations.


• | Industries with positive long-term dynamics. We seek to invest in companies in industries with positive long-term dynamics.

8


• | Companies with exit alternative/refinancing. We generally exit from most debt investments through the portfolio company’s repayment of the debt to us or a successful refinancing with another debt provider. We may exit our equity positions by selling the equity back to the portfolio company or to another party if the company undergoes a transaction such as a merger or an acquisition. We typically assist our portfolio companies in developing and planning refinancing or exit opportunities, including any sale or merger of our portfolio companies. We may also assist in the structure, timing, execution and transition of the exit strategy or refinancing.

Except as restricted by the 1940 Act or the Code, we deem all of our investment policies to be non-fundamental, which means that they may be changed by our board of directors without stockholder approval.

Intensive Credit Analysis / Due Diligence

The process through which our Advisers make an investment decision with respect to a customized financing transaction in the LMM involves extensive research into the target company, its industry, its growth prospects and its ability to withstand adverse conditions. If the senior investment professional responsible for the transaction determines that an investment opportunity should be pursued, we will engage in an intensive due diligence process. Though each transaction involves a somewhat different approach, the regular due diligence steps generally to be undertaken include:

• | Meeting with senior management to understand the business more fully and evaluate the ability of the senior management team;


• | Checking management backgrounds and references;


• | Performing a detailed review of financial performance and earnings;


• | Visiting headquarters and other company locations and meeting with management;


• | Contacting customers and vendors to assess both business prospects and industry wide practices;


• | Conducting a competitive analysis, and comparing the issuer to its main competitors;


• | Researching industry and financial publications to understand industry wide growth trends;


• | Assessing asset value and the ability of physical infrastructure and information systems to handle anticipated growth; and


• | Investigating legal risks and financial and accounting systems.

For Middle Market investments, a comprehensive credit analysis is conducted and continuously maintained, the results of which are available for the transaction team to review. Our due diligence process with respect to Middle Market debt securities is necessarily less intensive than that followed for customized financings. The issuers in these private debt placements tend to be rated and have placement agents who accumulate a certain level of due diligence information prior to placing the securities. Moreover, these private placements generally have much shorter timetables for making investment decisions.

Portfolio Monitoring

Our Advisers employ several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and value of our investments, which include the following:


• | Assessment of success in adhering to the portfolio company’s business plan and compliance with covenants;


• | Regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor, to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments;


• | Attendance at, and participation in, board meetings of the portfolio company; and


• | Review of monthly and quarterly financial statements and financial projections for the portfolio company.

As a BDC, we are required to offer and provide managerial assistance to our portfolio companies. This assistance could involve monitoring the operations of our portfolio companies, participating in board and management meetings, consulting with and advising officers of portfolio companies and providing other organizational and financial guidance. Our Advisers or any third-party administrator will make available such managerial assistance, on our behalf, to our portfolio companies, whether or not they request this assistance. Our Advisers’ business experience makes them qualified to provide such managerial assistance. We may receive fees for these services and will reimburse our Advisers, or any third-party administrator, for their allocated costs in providing such assistance, subject to periodic review and approval by our board of directors.

Competition

Our primary competition in providing financing to Middle Market, including LMM, companies includes other BDCs, specialty finance companies, investment companies, opportunity funds, private equity funds and institutional investors, public and private buyout and other private equity funds, commercial and investment banks, commercial financing companies, and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, hedge funds. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical, and marketing resources than we do. For example, some competitors may have a lower cost of funds as well as access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC or the source-of-income, asset diversification and distribution requirements we must satisfy to maintain our qualification as a BDC. We use the industry information of our investment professionals to assess investment risks and determine appropriate pricing for our investments in portfolio companies. In addition, we believe that our relationships enable us to discover, and compete effectively for, financing opportunities with attractive Middle Market, including LMM, companies in the industries in which we seek to invest. See “Item IA. Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure — We may continue to face increasing competition for investment opportunities, which could delay deployment of our capital, reduce returns and result in losses.”
Exit Strategies/Refinancing

While we generally exit most investments through the refinancing or repayment of our debt, our Advisers typically assist our LMM portfolio companies in developing and planning exit opportunities, including any sale or merger of our portfolio companies. The Advisers may also assist in the structure, timing, execution and transition of the exit strategy. The refinancing or repayment of Middle Market debt investments typically does not require our assistance due to the additional resources available to these larger, Middle Market companies.

Determination of NAV

The value of our assets is determined quarterly and at such other times that an event occurs that materially affects the valuation. The valuation is made pursuant to Section 2(a)(41) of the 1940 Act, which requires that we value our assets as follows: (i) the market price for those securities for which a market quotation is readily available, and (ii) for all other securities and assets, fair value, as determined in good faith by our board of directors. As a BDC, Section 2(a)(41) of the 1940 Act requires the board of directors to determine in good faith the fair value of portfolio securities for which a market price is not available, and it does so in conjunction with the application of our valuation procedures by our Advisers.
There is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each asset while employing a valuation process that is consistently followed. Determinations of fair value involve subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the notes to our consolidated financial statements refer to the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations, and any change in such valuations in our consolidated financial statements. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies — Valuation of Portfolio Investments.”

Determinations in Connection With Offerings

From our initial closing under the Initial Offering through January 14, 2015, we sold our shares of common stock on a continuous basis at an offering price of $10.00 per share. To the extent that our NAV per share increases, we will sell our shares of common stock pursuant to the Offering at a price necessary to ensure that shares of common stock are not sold at a price per share, after deduction of selling commissions and Dealer Manager fees, that is below our NAV per share as determined within 48 hours prior to the date of each closing. In the event of a material decline in our NAV per share which we deem to be non-temporary, and that results in a 2.5% or higher decrease of our NAV per share below our then-current net offering price, and subject to certain conditions, we will reduce our offering price accordingly.
The following table summarizes adjustments we have made to our per share public offering price through March 3, 2017 and the closing date on which such adjustments were effective.

REGULATION

Regulation as a BDC

We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between BDCs and their affiliates, principal underwriters and affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters. The 1940 Act requires that a majority of our directors be persons other than “interested persons,” as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a BDC unless approved by the lesser of (i) 67% or more of the voting securities present at a meeting if the holders of more than 50% of our outstanding voting securities are present or represented by proxy or (ii) 50% of our voting securities.

We are generally not permitted to sell our common stock at a price below NAV per share. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to BDCs — Regulations governing our operation as a BDC and RIC will affect our ability to raise, and the way in which we raise, additional capital or borrow for investment purposes, which may have a negative effect on our growth.” We may, however, sell our common stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the then-current NAV of our common stock if our board of directors determines that such sale is in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders, and our stockholders approve such sale. In addition, we may generally issue new shares of our common stock at a price below NAV in rights offerings to existing stockholders, in payment of dividends and in certain other limited circumstances.

Qualifying Assets

Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the company’s total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are any of the following:

1. | Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer which:


a. | is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the U.S.;


b. | is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly owned by the BDC) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and


c. | satisfies any of the following:


i. | does not have any class of securities that is traded on a national securities exchange;

11


ii. | has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange, but has an aggregate market value of outstanding voting and non-voting common equity of less than $250 million;


iii. | is controlled by a BDC or a group of companies including a BDC and the BDC has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company; or


iv. | is a small and solvent company having total assets of not more than $4.0 million and capital and surplus of not less than $2.0 million


2. | Securities of any eligible portfolio company that we control.


3. | Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements.


4. | Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own 60% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company.


5. | Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described in (1) through (4) above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities.


6. | Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment.


In addition, a BDC must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the U.S. and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described in (1), (2) or (3) above.

Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies

In order to count portfolio securities as qualifying assets for the purpose of the 70% test, we must either control the issuer of the securities or must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities (other than small and solvent companies described above) significant managerial assistance. However, when we purchase such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, one of the other persons in the group may make available such managerial assistance. Making available managerial assistance means any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its directors, officers or employees, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company.
Temporary Investments

Pending investment in other types of “qualifying assets,” as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets.
Senior Securities

We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of debt and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 200% immediately after each such issuance. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to BDCs — Regulations governing our operation as a BDC and RIC will affect our ability to raise, and the way in which we raise, additional capital or borrow for investment purposes, which may have a negative effect on our growth.”
Code of Ethics

We, our Advisers and our Dealer Manager have each adopted a code of ethics under Rule 17j-1 of the 1940 Act that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to each code may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by us, so long as such investments are made in accordance with the code’s requirements. We have included these codes of ethics as exhibits to the Registration Statement. You may also read and copy, after paying a duplication fee, the codes of ethics at the SEC’s Public Reference Room located at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549, or by making an electronic request to the following email address: publicinfo@sec.gov. You may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at (202) 942-8090. In addition, the code of ethics is available on the EDGAR Database on the SEC’s Internet site at http://www.sec.gov.

Compliance Policies and Procedures

We and our Adviser have adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the federal securities laws, and our board of directors is required to review these compliance policies and procedures annually to assess their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation. Our board of directors has designated Jason Maxwell as our Chief Compliance Officer.
Introduction

As an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act, our Adviser has a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interests of its clients. As part of this duty, it recognizes that it must vote client securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in the best interests of its clients.

These policies and procedures for voting proxies for the investment advisory clients of our Adviser are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act.

Proxy Policies

Our Adviser will vote proxies relating to our securities in the best interest of our stockholders. It will review on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted for a stockholder vote to determine its impact on our portfolio securities. Although our Adviser will generally vote against proposals that may have a negative impact on our portfolio securities, it may vote for such a proposal if there exist compelling long-term reasons to do so.

It is unlikely that our portfolio investments will solicit proxies for stockholder votes on a regular basis. To the extent we receive proxy statements, however, we have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to our Adviser. The proxy voting policies and procedures of our Adviser are set forth below. The guidelines are reviewed periodically by our Adviser and our independent directors, and, accordingly, are subject to change.

The proxy voting decisions of our Adviser are made by the senior officers who are responsible for monitoring each of its clients’ investments. To ensure that its vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, it will require that: (a) anyone involved in the decision-making process disclose to its Chief Compliance Officer any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote; and (b) employees involved in the decision making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how our Adviser intends to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties.

Proxy Voting Records

You may obtain information, without charge, regarding how we voted proxies with respect to our portfolio securities by making a written request for proxy voting information to: Chief Financial Officer, 2800 Post Oak Boulevard, Suite 5000, Houston, Texas 77056-6118, or by collect calling the Company at (888) 220-6121. Also, the SEC maintains a website at www.sec.gov that contains such information.
Other

As a BDC, we are subject to periodic examinations by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act. We are required to obtain and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from misconduct, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person’s office.
Securities Exchange Act and Sarbanes-Oxley Act Compliance

We are subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the Exchange Act including the filing of quarterly, annual and current reports, proxy statements and other required items. In addition, we are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), which imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on publicly held companies and their insiders. Many of these requirements will affect us. For example:

• | pursuant to Rule 13a-14 under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are required to certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports;

13


• | pursuant to Item 307 of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act, our periodic reports are required to disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures; and


• | pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our management is required to prepare a report regarding its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to review our current policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. We monitor our compliance with all regulations that are adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and have taken actions necessary to ensure that we comply with that law.

Investment Adviser Regulations

Our Advisers are subject to regulation under the Advisers Act. The Advisers Act establishes, among other things, record keeping and reporting requirements, disclosure requirements, limitations on transactions between the adviser’s account and an advisory client’s account, limitations on transactions between the accounts of advisory clients, and general anti-fraud prohibitions. We and our Advisers may also be examined by the SEC from time to time for compliance with the Advisers Act.

Taxation as a RIC

We have elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally will not be subject to corporate-level federal income taxes on any income that we distribute to our stockholders from our tax earnings and profits. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, in order to obtain RIC tax treatment, we must distribute dividends to our stockholders, in respect of each taxable year, of an amount generally at least equal to 90% of our “investment company taxable income,” which is generally our taxable net investment income plus the excess, if any, of realized net short-term capital gain over realized net long-term capital loss, determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid (the “Annual Distribution Requirement”). Depending on the amount of taxable income we generate in a taxable year, we may choose to spill-over taxable income in excess of current taxable year distributions into the next taxable year and incur a 4% nondeductible U.S federal excise tax on such taxable income. Any such spill-over taxable income must be distributed through a distribution declared prior to the earlier of eight-and-one-half months after the close of the taxable year in which such taxable income was generated or the timely filing of the tax return related to the taxable year in which such taxable income was generated. Even if we qualify as a RIC, we could be subject to U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income, excise, withholding or other taxes.

Provided that we qualify as a RIC and satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, we will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our investment company taxable income and net capital gain (which is defined as net long-term capital gain in excess of net short-term capital loss) that we timely distribute to stockholders. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any income or capital gain not distributed (or deemed distributed) to our stockholders.

We will be subject to a 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on certain undistributed income unless we distribute in a timely manner in respect of a calendar year dividends of an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for the calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year (or, if we so elect, for the calendar year) and (3) any net ordinary income and capital gain net income for preceding years that was not distributed with respect to such years and on which the Company incurred no U.S. federal income tax (the “Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement”). Distributions declared and paid by us in a taxable year will generally differ from taxable income for that taxable year as such distributions may include the distribution of current taxable year’s taxable income, exclude amounts carried over into the following taxable year, and include the distribution of prior taxable year taxable income carried over into and distributed in the current taxable year.

In order to qualify as a RIC for federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things:


• | continue to qualify as a BDC under the 1940 Act at all times during each taxable year;


• | meet the Annual Distribution Requirement;


• | derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities, loans, gains from the sale or other disposition of stock or other securities or foreign currencies or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock, securities or currencies and net income derived from an interest in a “qualified publicly traded partnership” (as defined in the Code) (the “90% Income Test”); and


• | diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year to satisfy the RIC requirements:


a. | at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer; and

14


b. | no more than 25% of the value of our assets can be invested in the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs, (i) of one issuer, (ii) of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable tax rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or (iii) of one or more “qualified publicly traded partnerships” (collectively, the “Diversification Tests”).

To the extent that we invest in entities treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes (other than a “qualified publicly traded partnership”), we generally must include the items of gross income derived by the partnerships for purposes of the 90% Income Test, and the income that is derived from a partnership (other than a “qualified publicly traded partnership”) will be treated as qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test only to the extent that such income is attributable to items of income of the partnership which would be qualifying income if realized by us directly. In addition, we generally must take into account our proportionate share of the assets held by partnerships (other than a “qualified publicly traded partnership”) in which we are a partner for purposes of the Diversification Tests.
Certain of our investment practices are subject to special and complex U.S. federal income tax provisions that may, among other things, (i) convert dividends that would otherwise constitute qualified dividend income into ordinary income, (ii) treat dividends that would otherwise be eligible for deductions available to certain U.S. corporations under the Code as ineligible for such treatment, (iii) disallow, suspend or otherwise limit the allowance of certain losses or deductions, (iv) convert long-term capital gains into short-term capital gains or ordinary income, (v) convert short-term capital losses into long-term capital losses, (vi) convert an ordinary loss or deduction into a capital loss (the deductibility of which is more limited), (vii) cause us to recognize income or gain without a corresponding receipt of cash, (viii) adversely alter the characterization of certain complex financial transactions, and (ix) produce gross income that will not constitute qualifying gross income for purposes of the gross income requirement that applies to RICs. These rules also could affect the amount, timing and character of distributions to stockholders. We intend to monitor our transactions and may make certain tax elections to mitigate the effect of these provisions on our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC.
Some of the income that we might otherwise earn, such as fees for providing managerial assistance, certain fees earned with respect to our investments, income recognized in a work-out or restructuring of a portfolio investment, or income recognized from an equity investment in an operating partnership, may not satisfy the 90% Income Test. To manage the risk that such income might disqualify us as a RIC for failure to satisfy the 90% Income Test, we may establish one or more special purpose entities treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes (any such corporation, a “Taxable Subsidiary”) to hold assets from which we do not anticipate earning qualifying income under the 90% Income Test. Any investments held through a Taxable Subsidiary generally will be subject to U.S. federal income and other taxes, and therefore we can expect to achieve a reduced after-tax yield on such investments.
We may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive a corresponding payment in cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (such as debt instruments issued with payment-in-kind interest (“PIK”), or in certain cases, increasing interest rates or issued with warrants), we must include in our taxable income each taxable year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. We may also have to include in our taxable income other amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as deferred loan origination fees that are paid after origination of the loan or are paid in non-cash compensation such as warrants or stock. Consequently, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement, even though we have not received the corresponding cash amount.
Because any original issue discount or other amounts accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the taxable year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount. Furthermore, a portfolio company in which we invest may face financial difficulty that requires us to work-out, modify or otherwise restructure our investment in the portfolio company. Any such restructuring may result in unusable capital losses and future non-cash income. As a result, we may have difficulty meeting the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement. We may have to sell some of our investments at times and/or at prices we would not consider advantageous, raise additional debt or equity capital or forgo new investment opportunities for this purpose. If we are not able to obtain cash from other sources, we may fail to qualify for RIC tax treatment and thus become subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax. Any restructuring may also result in our recognition of a substantial amount of non-qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test.
15

Gain or loss realized by us from warrants acquired by us as well as any loss attributable to the lapse of such warrants generally will be treated as capital gain or loss. Such gain or loss generally will be long-term or short-term, depending on how long we held a particular warrant.
Although we do not presently expect to do so, we are authorized to borrow funds and to sell assets in order to satisfy distribution requirements. However, under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted to make distributions to our stockholders while our debt obligations and other senior securities are outstanding unless certain “asset coverage” tests are met. Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to meet our distribution requirements may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating to our status as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous.
If we were unable to qualify for treatment as a RIC, we would be subject to tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates, regardless of whether we make any distributions to our stockholders. Distributions would not be required, and any distributions would generally be taxable to our stockholders as ordinary dividend income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Subject to certain additional limitations in the Code, such distributions would be eligible for the preferential maximum federal income tax rate applicable to individual shareholders with respect to certain qualified dividend income. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, certain corporate distributees would be eligible for the dividends received deduction. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the shareholder’s tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain. Moreover, if we fail to qualify as a RIC in any taxable year, to qualify again to be subject to tax as a RIC in a subsequent taxable year, we would be required to distribute our earnings and profits attributable to any of our non-RIC taxable years as dividends to our stockholders. In addition, if we fail to qualify as a RIC for a period greater than two consecutive taxable years, to qualify as a RIC in a subsequent taxable year we may be subject to regular corporate tax on any net built-in gains with respect to certain of our assets (that is, the excess of the aggregate gains, including items of income, over aggregate losses that would have been realized with respect to such assets if we had sold the property at fair market value (“FMV”) at the end of the taxable year) that we elect to recognize on requalification or when recognized over the next five taxable years.
