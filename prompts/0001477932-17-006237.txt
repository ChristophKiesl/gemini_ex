ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 
We were incorporated in the State of Florida on September 3, 2010 under the name of “mLight Tech, Inc.” (“MLGT”). We are currently a “shell company” with no meaningful assets or operations other than our efforts to identify and merge with an operating company.
 
On July 11, 2017, MLGT merged with and into CX Network, Group, Inc., a Nevada corporation ("CX") and our wholly owned subsidiary which was set up for the purpose to effect the Domicile Change and Name Change (defined below), with CX as the surviving corporation that operates under the name “CX Network Group, Inc.” (the “Name Change”), pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger (the "Merger Agreement") dated July 3, 2017. 
 
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, immediately after the effective time of the Merger, the Company’s corporate existence is governed by the laws of the State of Nevada and the Articles of Incorporation and bylaws of CX (the “Domicile Change”), and each outstanding share of MLGT’s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share was converted into 0.0667 outstanding share of common stock of CX, par value $0.0001 per share at a one-for-fifteen reverse split ratio (the “Reverse Stock Split”). Immediately prior to the effectiveness of the reverse stock split, we had 217,300,000 shares of common stock of MLGT issued and outstanding. Immediately upon the effectiveness of the reverse stock split, we have 14,486,670 shares of common stock of CXKJ issued and outstanding. 
 
Market Information
 
In connection with the Name Change, Domicile Change, and Reverse Stock Split, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) assigned the Company a new stock symbol, MLGTD. The Name Change, Reverse Stock Split and Domicile Change took effect at the open of business on July 12, 2017. 
 
On August 11, 2017, the Company was notified by FINRA Department of Market Operations (the “Department”) that they did not process the Reverse Stock Split because they believed that the documentation provided by the Company did not support the Company’s request to process a reverse split. In the same letter, the Department notified the Company that they processed the Company’s request of the merger, the mechanism the Company used to consummate the corporate actions mentioned above. Also in that letter, the Department mentioned that it announced the Reverse Stock Split on July 11, 2017 but subsequently revised the announcement on July 28, 2017. On August 14, 2017, the Company received a notice from the Department that they did not process the symbol change because “there is currently no symbol assigned to the Company.” 
 
On August 16, 2017, the Company appealed the decisions made by Department as mentioned herein above in connection with Reverse Stock Split, Name Change and Domicile Change (for more information about the corporate actions, refer to the current report on Form 8-K the Company filed on July 12, 2017). On October 3, 2017, a Subcommitee of FINRA’s Uniform Practice Code Committee decided to remand the case to the Department for further review. Subsequently, the Department granted the Company’s application for a symbol change. On November 3, 2017, the trading symbol for the Company was changed to “CXKJ,” effective immediately. The new CUSIP number is 12672T 108. 
 
Our limited business until March 31, 2017, when control of our company changed (the “Change of Control”), pursuant to a share purchase agreement and a spin-off agreement set forth below (respectively “Change of Control SPA” and the “Spin-Off Agreement”), was in the business of training individuals for a career as a technician in the Automotive Appearance Industry, which includes paint less dent repair, interior restoration, windshield repair, window detailing, odor removal, detailing and alloy wheel repair. The potential students were employees of auto body shops, car rental companies and car dealers as well as entrepreneurs looking to start their own businesses. 
 
We are now exploring a business combination opportunity with an existing business.

Change of Control
 
On March 31, 2017, we entered into the Spin-Off Agreement with Ding King Training Institute, Inc., the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary (“DKTI”), and Todd Sudeck (“Mr. Sudeck”). Pursuant to the Spin-Off Agreement, Mr. Sudeck received all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of DKTI in exchange for approximately 166,667 shares of common stock of CX (pre-split 2,500,000 shares of common stock of MLGT) owned by Mr. Sudeck. Immediately upon the closing of the Spin-Off Agreement, Mr. Sudeck is the sole equity owner of DKTI and the Company has no further interest in DKTI.
 
On March 31, 2017, Mr. Sudeck entered into the Change of Control SPA with certain purchasers listed therein (the “Purchasers”), whereby the Purchasers acquired 12,000,000 shares of common stock of CX (pre-split 180,000,000 shares of common stock of MLGT) from Mr. Sudeck for an aggregate purchase price of $325,000, which represented approximately 87.17% of issued and outstanding equity of MLGT at that time, resulting in a change of the control of MLGT.
 
In connection with the Change of Control, Mr. Sudeck, the former President, former Chief Executive Officer, former Chief Financial Officer, former Secretary and former sole director, resigned from all his positions with the Company.
 
Simultaneously, Mr. Huibin Su was appointed as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and a director, Mr. Jiyin Li was appointed as the Chairman of the board of the directors, and Zizhong Huang was appointed as the Company’s Chief Operating Officer, all effective immediately.
