Our Business
 
We are a development stage biopharmaceutical company focused primarily on the development of pharmaceuticals to safely address one of the major underlying causes of many chronic diseases – inflammation – including cardiovascular disease, metabolic disease, liver disease, arthritis, and aging. We also have a commercial business unit that markets dietary supplements for inflammatory health. We believe we are well positioned for growth through the utilization of astaxanthin and zeaxanthin for chronic pharmaceutical applications by safely reducing chronic inflammation at the cellular and mitochondrial level – without inhibiting normal function. Similar mechanisms also support the use of our dietary supplement for inflammatory health.
 
We believe that our pharmaceutical product candidates and our dietary supplements have competitive advantages, primarily relating to a unique combination of the following benefits:
 

● | An excellent safety profile that supports chronic use 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Broad anti-inflammatory activity and pleiotropic effects with potential application to several chronic diseases as pharmaceuticals and various areas of health as dietary supplements 
● | Oral dosing convenience 
● | Scalable manufacturing 
● | Economical pricing 

Market Overview
 
There is broad acceptance in the scientific, medical, and financial communities that chronic inflammation is a significant factor in many chronic diseases, particularly cardiovascular disease. The double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled CANTOS clinical trial (10,061 patients; Novartis, 2017) and REDUCE-IT clinical trial (8,179 patients; Amarin Corporation, 2018), both published in the New England Journal of Medicine, helped to catalyze and support this consensus. Commonly used anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, COX-2 inhibitors, corticosteroids, and various biologics may reduce inflammation, but they have risks of significant side effects that limit their utility in chronic disease.
 
We believe that a safe anti-inflammatory is the solution. Our lead pharmaceutical candidate CDX-101, a proprietary prodrug of the naturally occurring marine molecule astaxanthin, may provide the needed combination of an excellent safety profile, anti-inflammatory activity, and economic pricing to become widely used for the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases driven by inflammation.
 
We are pursuing an initial indication of severe hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides ≥ 500 mg/dL) for CDX-101. Severe hypertriglyceridemia is associated with chronic inflammation and patients with the disorder have increased cardiovascular disease risk and incidence of pancreatitis. We believe the clinical pathway to FDA drug approval for severe hypertriglyceridemia, which relies on biomarker endpoints (i.e., measuring triglycerides in blood tests over a period of several months), will be more efficient than other potential indications that require clinical outcomes studies (e.g., evaluating heart attacks, strokes, and deaths over a period of several years), and is thus better suited as our initial indication for CDX-101.
 
An estimated 3.4 million Americans have severe hypertriglyceridemia according to peer-reviewed research published in the American Journal of Cardiology in 2011. Statins, fibrates, and prescription fish oils are all used to manage hypertriglyceridemia. 21% (42 million) of U.S. adults have mixed dyslipidemia (high levels of low-density lipoprotein “LDL” cholesterol with low levels of high-density lipoprotein “HDL” cholesterol and/or high levels of triglycerides), with nearly 6% (11.6 million people) having all three lipid abnormalities. Lovaza, Vascepa, and other prescription fish oils approved for severe hypertriglyceridemia are also used off-label in mixed dyslipidemia patients to reduce moderately elevated triglycerides and aggregate sales of these products for on and off-label use are estimated to be approaching $2 billion annually.

We believe CDX-101 will have several competitive advantages compared to prescription fish oils: (i) ease of administration: oral dosing of large fish oil capsules is problematic, whereas we expect CDX-101 tablets should be far smaller; (ii) scalability: prescription fish oil manufacturing is limited by the declining global fish supply, whereas we believe the synthetic production of CDX-101 is scalable; and (iii) safety: prescription fish oils have certain safety risks, whereas we believe that astaxanthin, the active moiety of CDX-101, has an excellent safety profile.
 
The REDUCE-IT clinical trial demonstrated that administration of Vascepa resulted in a significant reduction of major adverse cardiovascular events (“MACE”) in patients with mixed dyslipidemia on standard of care, specifically statins, and we believe is the primary basis of Amarin’s request to the FDA to expand Vascepa’s label. The reduction of triglycerides in the REDUCE-IT clinical trial was modest however, and the study’s authors concluded that Vascepa’s ability to reduce other markers of cardiovascular disease, including inflammation and oxidized LDL (as demonstrated in the MARINE and ANCHOR clinical trials), provided the pleiotropic effects that led to reduction of MACE in REDUCE-IT. In human proof-of-concept “pilot” studies conducted by third parties and animal models conducted by third parties and us, astaxanthin, the active moiety of CDX-101, has demonstrated similar pleiotropic effects, which are derived from its broad anti-inflammatory activity, but without the limitations of Vascepa or other prescription fish oils. As a result, we believe this market also presents a major opportunity as a potential second indication for CDX-101.
 
Beyond cardiovascular disease, we believe CDX-101 could be developed to address other chronic diseases driven by inflammation, including metabolic disease, liver disease, arthritis, and aging, each with potential annual sales exceeding a billion dollars.
 
We are also developing CDX-301, our zeaxanthin pharmaceutical candidate, for macular degeneration. Our target initial indication for CDX-301 is Stargardt disease, a juvenile form of macular degeneration and potential orphan drug indication. Zeaxanthin has a mechanism of action and excellent safety profile similar to astaxanthin, however, it accumulates in the human eye through uptake by a unique retinal receptor, providing protection against blue light, oxidative damage, and related inflammation that occurs in macular degeneration. Pre-clinical and clinical studies with zeaxanthin have demonstrated proof-of-concept for the treatment of macular disorders. Based on multiple academic and NIH sources, we believe there are no more than 42,000 persons in the United States with Stargardt disease, and therefore we believe a treatment for Stargardt disease may qualify for orphan drug designation. (By statute, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects less than 200,000 persons in the United States.) If CDX-301 receives FDA orphan drug designation for Stargardt disease and obtains FDA drug approval, we expect CDX-301 may benefit from certain advantages as an orphan drug, including orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application, including a full NDA, to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances. We also believe that age related macular degeneration, a larger market estimated to afflict more than three million people in the U.S. alone, presents a major opportunity as a potential second indication for CDX-301. We do not expect to use the proceeds of the Proposed Public Offering to pursue the development of CDX-301.

Astaxanthin
 
Astaxanthin Safety
 
Astaxanthin is a naturally occurring marine carotenoid found in salmon, microalgae, krill, lobster, and crab. Carotenoids are natural pigments that impart coloration and support animal health and vitality, especially in harsh marine environments. Astaxanthin is responsible for the characteristic red or pink color of salmon and shellfish. Salmon without astaxanthin are smaller, more susceptible to infection, have reproductive problems, and are not strong enough to swim upstream.
 
Astaxanthin is GRAS as a food substance according to FDA regulations and has undergone extensive toxicity testing by third parties and us with no clinically meaningful issues even at the extremely high doses summarized in the table below:
 

Type of Study | Maximum Dosing 
--------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------
Acute Toxicity | >8,000 mg/kg (mouse, rat), 2,000 mg/kg (non-human primates) 
Sub-Chronic Toxicity | 1,240 mg/kg (rat), 160 mg/kg (dog) 
1 Year Chronic Toxicity/Carcinogenicity | 1,000 mg/kg (rat), 1,400 mg/kg (mouse), 200 mg/kg (dog) 
2 Year Carcinogenicity | 1,000 mg/kg (rat) 
Genotoxicity/Mutagenicity | 2,000 mg/kg (mouse) 
Teratogenicity | 1,000 mg/kg (rat), 400 mg/kg (rabbit) 

 
Commonly used anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, COX-2 inhibitors, corticosteroids, and various biologics have risks of side effects including gastrointestinal bleeding, heart attacks, strokes, and severe infections. Prescription fish oil drugs, while safer than common anti-inflammatory drugs, also have risks of certain side effects. Lovaza and other DHA, EPA combination fish oil drugs, have risks of side effects including back pain, eructation, dysgeusia, and increases in LDL cholesterol. Vascepa has risks of side effects including arthralgia, atrial fibrillation, and increased bleeding. Fenofibrates have risks of side effects including stomach pain, nausea, and back pain.
 
In contrast, astaxanthin has no known side effects of clinical significance. We believe astaxanthin’s excellent safety profile will be a key competitive advantage compared to other drugs targeting inflammation and lipids.

Astaxanthin Mechanism of Action
 
The mechanism of action of astaxanthin, the active moiety in CDX-101, is quite different than most drugs, and we believe is responsible for its excellent safety profile. Most drugs target single receptors or enzymes in complex pathways, which can lead to side effects with chronic use. Astaxanthin is distributed systemically, including to the liver and heart, where it localizes in cellular and mitochondrial membranes and reduces the oxidative stress that causes chronic inflammation, without affecting the normal function of inflammatory/metabolic signaling pathways. And unlike other antioxidants such as beta-carotene, Vitamin C, and Vitamin E, astaxanthin spans and stabilizes cellular and mitochondrial membranes (biological lipid bilayers) to function as an aqueous and lipid phase antioxidant without membrane disruption, as proven by X-ray diffraction studies:
 


As a result, astaxanthin demonstrates positive and quantifiable pleiotropic effects on many inflammatory cytokines and drug targets.
 
In human proof-of-concept “pilot” studies conducted by third parties, astaxanthin statistically significantly decreased inflammation and oxidative stress:
 

● | TNF-α decreased (-30%, p=0.0022) 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------
● | CRP decreased (-20%, p<0.05; two studies) 
● | Oxidative stress decreased (MDA, IsoP, SOD, TAC increased) 

 
In animal studies conducted by third parties, astaxanthin statistically significantly decreased inflammation and oxidative stress:
 

● | Inflammatory markers decreased in various model systems: 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


○ | TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, NF-kB, PGE-2, iNOS, MCP-1, MPO, ERK, JNK, COX-2 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
○ | TNF-α decreased equivalent to an equal dose of prednisolone 


● | Oxidative stress decreased in mitochondria

Astaxanthin and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
 
In response to the COVID-19 global pandemic, our scientific team examined published scientific literature related to COVID-19 disease pathology in order to determine if there was a potential role of astaxanthin in the treatment of COVID-19. On March 20, 2020, we released a scientific white paper authored by Timothy J. King, Ph.D., M.S., our Vice President, Research, which discussed the scientific rationale of boosting the immune system and reducing the extreme inflammatory response that may lead to severe respiratory complications in subjects with COVID-19 as described below. We are presently seeking strategic collaborations with appropriate academic, governmental, and/or commercial organizations to further develop astaxanthin for COVID-19.
Scientific Rationale: Immune Response, Inflammation, and COVID-19
 
COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), can induce an extreme immune response characterized by the overproduction of immune cells and the uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Exceedingly high levels of the cytokines IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, and CRP result in overt inflammatory symptoms that include mild to severe respiratory disease, high fever, and cough. In progressed disease this “cytokine storm” will circulate throughout the body to trigger a surge of active immune cells into the lungs resulting in acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and may be particularly severe in immune compromised subjects such as the elderly, diabetics, and those with cardiovascular disease. This association between infection and progression of disease with inflammation suggests a strategy that would partner anti-infective agents, such as anti-virals and vaccines, with anti-inflammatory agents. An anti-inflammatory agent would be expected to mitigate symptoms including fever, pain, and swelling. Furthermore, an anti-inflammatory regimen initiated at a relatively early stage in disease progression might be expected to stem the immune over-response and to slow or even prevent progression of symptoms leading to lung injury and ARDS. Importantly, an appropriate anti-inflammatory intervention should not result in abnormal immune suppression but should target healthy immune homeostasis. An anti-inflammatory treatment that resulted in the decrease of inflammatory cytokine signaling would seem a promising approach. Chinese researchers have identified IL-6 as a main driver of immune overreaction in COVID-19 patients and have already included elevated IL-6 levels as a biomarker of disease worsening. China’s National Health Commission has updated its treatment guidelines for COVID-19 to include Roche’s injected biologic, Actemra (tocilizumab), an inhibitor of the IL-6 receptor. Actemra, first approved by the U.S. FDA in 2010 for rheumatoid arthritis, can now be used in China to treat serious COVID-19 patients with lung damage.
The Potential Role of Astaxanthin
 
In pre-clinical and clinical studies, astaxanthin has demonstrated the ability to decrease levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α, and CRP in multiple models of disease and in several patient populations. Furthermore, astaxanthin does not lead to abnormal immune suppression even at high doses and acts to restore healthy immune homeostasis. Astaxanthin has also demonstrated exceptional safety in multiple animal models, has been used extensively in humans for two decades as a dietary supplement, and is GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe), according to FDA regulations. Coronaviruses have been shown to induce lung damage by increasing inflammatory signaling pathways and cytokine production leading to elevated immune cell infiltration and macrophagic polarization shifts (M2 to M1). Astaxanthin has been shown to (i) significantly attenuate pathological elevation of critical inflammatory cell signaling pathways (NF-κB), (ii) decrease the resulting elevated proinflammatory cytokine levels, (iii) reduce immune cell infiltration of the lung, and (iv) positively influence macrophage polarization in humans and animal models of disease.

Our Products and Business Strategy
 
Our product platform consists of our development stage pharmaceutical candidates and our commercially available dietary supplement:
 

● | CDX-101, our lead pharmaceutical candidate, is in pre-clinical development for cardiovascular inflammation and dyslipidemia, with a target initial indication of severe hypertriglyceridemia. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | CDX-301 is in pre-clinical development for macular degeneration, with a target initial indication of Stargardt disease. 
● | ZanthoSyn® is a physician recommended astaxanthin dietary supplement for inflammatory health. 

Lead Pharmaceutical Candidate: CDX-101
 
Our lead pharmaceutical candidate, CDX-101, is a proprietary astaxanthin prodrug that cleaves following oral administration and delivers astaxanthin to the bloodstream. CDX-101 is being developed initially for cardiovascular inflammation and mixed dyslipidemia, with a target initial indication of severe hypertriglyceridemia.
 
We believe that the results from two major cardiovascular clinical trials—the 10,061 patient CANTOS study by Novartis in 2017 and the 8,179 patient REDUCE-IT study by Amarin in 2018—clearly demonstrated the clinical significance of reducing chronic inflammation, validating the cardiovascular inflammation hypothesis we have supported for more than a decade. We believe that astaxanthin’s unique mechanism of action—reduction of oxidative stress driven inflammation at the cellular and mitochondrial level without inhibiting normal function—results in an impact on key inflammatory drug targets and pathways, and importantly, an excellent safety profile that supports chronic administration. In addition to the safety advantages described in this report, we believe that production of CDX-101, unlike Vascepa and other prescription fish oil drugs, will be highly scalable to address these large mass markets for chronic diseases driven by inflammation.
 
Clinical and non-clinical studies with astaxanthin have provided proof-of-concept for the treatment of cardiovascular risk factors including inflammation and triglycerides as described in this report. In addition, interim results from our Cardiovascular Health Astaxanthin Supplement Evaluation (“CHASE”) clinical trial demonstrate beneficial changes in markers of cardiovascular health, including CRP, LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides, oxidized LDL, and blood pressure, and also underscore astaxanthin’s safety profile with no adverse safety signals observed. We believe these findings provide further mechanistic support for our pharmaceutical development program. We refer you to “CHASE Clinical Trial” in this report for additional information regarding the CHASE clinical trial.
 
We believe that an initial indication of severe hypertriglyceridemia provides an efficient clinical pathway to drug approval for CDX-101 and will be similar to the pathway as reported by Amarin for the development of Vascepa, its prescription fish oil. CDX-101 is currently in pre-clinical development, including the planning of IND enabling studies. We plan to use proceeds from the Proposed Public Offering to complete IND enabling studies and to engage third party contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs) to manufacture drug substance and drug product for such studies, with the goal of filing an IND approximately one year from the closing of the Proposed Public Offering.

We have retained Paresh N. Soni, M.D., Ph.D., the former Senior Vice President and Head of Development at Amarin, to guide our clinical and regulatory strategy, interact with the FDA, and advise us on a full range of development issues. While at Amarin, Dr. Soni led the design of Amarin’s clinical trials, development strategy, and interaction with the FDA, including for Vascepa, which was approved for treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemia in 2012. Dr. Soni played a key role in the design and conduct of the MARINE, ANCHOR and REDUCE-IT clinical trials with Vascepa. In addition, Dr. Soni has held several senior R&D executive roles over the past 2 decades at Pfizer, Alexion, and Albireo. Dr. Soni is also a member of our Scientific Advisory Board.
 
In addition to Dr. Soni, our Scientific Advisory Board includes Deepak L. Bhatt, M.D., M.P.H. and R. Preston Mason, Ph.D.
 
Deepak L. Bhatt, M.D., M.P.H., is the Chairman of our Scientific Advisory Board. Dr. Bhatt is also the Chair of the REDUCE-IT clinical trial with Vascepa, Executive Director of Interventional Cardiovascular Programs at Harvard Medical School affiliated Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and Professor at Harvard Medical School. He is also the Editor of the peer-reviewed Journal of Invasive Cardiology and Editor-in-Chief of the Harvard Heart Letter for patients.
 
R. Preston Mason, Ph.D. is on the faculty of the Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiology at Harvard Medical School affiliated Brigham and Women’s Hospital. He has published more than 250 peer reviewed papers, including papers published in collaboration with Cardax, and is a recognized expert on the mechanism of action of astaxanthin and fish oils, particularly Vascepa.
 
CDX-101 vs. ZanthoSyn®
 
CDX-101 is a synthetic astaxanthin prodrug (new chemical entity) for pharmaceutical applications and ZanthoSyn® is a formulation of synthetic nature-identical astaxanthin for dietary supplement applications. While both deliver astaxanthin to the bloodstream, we believe the unique molecular structure of CDX-101 and its pharmaceutical pathway will provide substantial differentiation. In particular, we believe that:
 

● | CDX-101 will be approved by the FDA as a drug for one or more disease indications, whereas ZanthoSyn® is marketed as a dietary supplement for health applications; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | CDX-101 will be prescribed by doctors and covered by health insurance, whereas ZanthoSyn® is sold through retail and e-commerce channels; 
● | CDX-101 will be administered at a higher dose and in different oral dosage form; and 
● | CDX-101 will have superior intellectual property protection. 

Pharmaceutical Candidate: CDX-301
 
Our zeaxanthin pharmaceutical candidate, CDX-301, has a mechanism of action and excellent safety profile similar to astaxanthin, however, it is being developed for macular degeneration because zeaxanthin accumulates in the human eye through uptake by a unique retinal receptor, providing protection against blue light, oxidative damage, and related inflammation that occurs in macular degeneration. Pre-clinical and clinical studies with zeaxanthin have demonstrated proof-of-concept for the treatment of macular disorders. We believe that an initial indication of Stargardt disease, a juvenile form of macular degeneration, provides an efficient clinical pathway to drug approval for CDX-301. On November 30, 2018, we submitted a request for orphan drug designation to the FDA for zeaxanthin as a treatment of Stargardt disease, and we are currently in communications with the FDA regarding this matter. Additional financing beyond that contemplated in the Proposed Public Offering will be needed to fund IND enabling studies and clinical development of CDX-301.

ZanthoSyn® is our commercially available physician recommended astaxanthin dietary supplement. Astaxanthin is a naturally occurring molecule with safe anti-inflammatory activity that supports cardiovascular health, metabolic health, liver health, joint health, and longevity. The form of astaxanthin utilized in ZanthoSyn® has demonstrated an excellent safety profile in peer-reviewed published studies and is GRAS according to FDA regulations.
 
We sell ZanthoSyn® primarily through wholesale and e-commerce channels. We launched our e-commerce channel in 2016 and began selling to GNC stores in 2017. ZanthoSyn® is currently available at GNC corporate stores nationwide in the United States.
 
We market ZanthoSyn® primarily through a multi-pronged approach:
 

● | Physician outreach and education, where ZanthoSyn® is positioned as the first safe, physician friendly, anti-inflammatory dietary supplement for health and longevity, with retail locations and e-commerce serving as convenient and credible distribution channels for physicians recommending ZanthoSyn® 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Retail store outreach, education, and in-store sales support, building on the ability to utilize ZanthoSyn® as a foundation of health and wellness regimens 
● | E-commerce platforms 

 
We believe ZanthoSyn® is physician friendly for several reasons:
 

● | ZanthoSyn® delivers the safety, purity, manufacturing rigor, bioavailability, and scientific support that provides physicians comfort in the quality and utility of the product, which is often not present in other dietary supplements. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | ZanthoSyn® is well-accepted at medical conferences where crowds of physicians and other healthcare professionals stand in line to receive ZanthoSyn® samples and product information after attending educational seminars. 

 
Our sales and marketing program was initially launched in Hawaii, where we believe that robust physician outreach and education coupled with GNC retail store outreach, education, and in-store sales support increased consumer awareness and catalyzed strong sales growth. We also launched this program in major markets on the West Coast and East Coast in the U.S. beginning in 2017. To support these efforts, we have hired additional sales and marketing personnel. We are currently evaluating our strategy related to further expansion.
 
We sell ZanthoSyn® to GNC under a purchasing agreement. The exclusivity provision under such agreement related to distribution of ZanthoSyn® by GNC in the “brick and mortar” retail channel in the United States expired on October 16, 2019. GNC remains our only distributor of ZanthoSyn® in such channel, but we may expand retail distribution to mass market retailers, other specialty nutrition stores, pharmacies, and other retailers. We also plan to increase our sales and marketing efforts through e-commerce.
 
To date, our sales and marketing efforts of ZanthoSyn® have primarily been through GNC retail store outreach, education, and in-store sales support together with physician outreach and education. We plan to increase our sales and marketing efforts through e-commerce by capitalizing on one of the most important lessons learned from our sales and marketing program: “Conversations Create Customers.” Whether at GNC stores, directly with Cardax personnel, or at conferences with healthcare professionals, thousands of ZanthoSyn® customers have been created by understanding and experiencing the benefits of ZanthoSyn® firsthand. Cardax plans to implement strategies that it believes may create a similar customer experience more broadly, with fulfillment online, where margins may be greater than retail stores.

CHASE Clinical Trial
 
In September 2018, we initiated a human clinical trial entitled, Cardiovascular Health Astaxanthin Supplement Evaluation (“CHASE”), targeting cardiovascular inflammatory health. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial is evaluating the effect of low-dose and high-dose ZanthoSyn® on cardiovascular health as measured by CRP levels over 12 weeks in up to 120 subjects with documented cardiovascular risk factors. The study also includes an optional open label extension through 48 weeks.
 
Interim results from an initial cohort of subjects were announced on September 23, 2019. The interim results were based on data from 40 subjects administered high-dose ZanthoSyn® (96 mg/day astaxanthin – 48 mg twice a day), low-dose ZanthoSyn® (24 mg/day astaxanthin – 12 mg twice a day), or placebo.
 
Highlights from the interim review shown below are median percentage changes from baseline to week 12 unless otherwise stated. While the interim review was not powered for statistical significance, p-values less than 0.05 compared to placebo are provided. The p-values reported below (*p<0.05, **p<0.01) are nominal p-values from non-parametric comparisons of the median between each group and placebo and no adjustments for multiple comparisons were made.
 

Interim Results | High Dose | | | Low Dose | | Placebo
--------------------------------------------+-----------+-------------+-----+----------+-----------+--------
CRP | | -28 | % | | -32 | % | -5 | %
LDL-C | | -12 | %** | | -7 | % | +5 | %
Total cholesterol | | -8 | %* | | -5 | % | +4 | %
Triglycerides | | -16 | % | | -13 | % | +6 | %
Oxidized LDL | | -10 | %* | | +3 | % | +4 | %
Blood pressure | | -5 | %* | | -4 | %* | +6 | %
Median astaxanthin blood levels at 12 weeks | | 2,184 ng/mL | | | 790 ng/mL | | <10 ng/mL | 

 
We believe these findings provide:
 

● | Further mechanistic support for our astaxanthin pharmaceutical development program 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Basis for additional patent filings 
● | Support for the cardiovascular health benefits of ZanthoSyn® 

 
The interim results also underscore astaxanthin’s safety profile with no adverse safety signals observed. The CHASE Data Safety Review Board, which is comprised of a majority of independent clinical trial professionals, recommended that the clinical trial continue enrollment.
 
The FDA does not require human clinical trials for dietary supplements, but we believe that positive results from the CHASE trial may help promote scientific and consumer awareness of astaxanthin’s health and longevity applications and serve as further mechanistic support for our pharmaceutical development program.
 
We refer to you the “Risk Factors” section of this report for a summary of certain risks related to clinical trial results.

Benefits of Synthetic Astaxanthin vs. Natural Astaxanthin
 
Dietary supplements containing astaxanthin typically derive astaxanthin from microalgae, krill, or other natural sources, whereas ZanthoSyn® astaxanthin is made through total synthesis. While multiple studies demonstrate that astaxanthin from either natural or synthetic sources is efficacious and both are Generally Recognized as Safe according to FDA regulations, we believe synthetic astaxanthin offers significant advantages compared to astaxanthin from microalgae, krill, or other natural sources:

● | Synthetic astaxanthin can be formulated for superior bioavailability. In a human crossover study comparing ZanthoSyn® to a leading microalgal astaxanthin dietary supplement, the astaxanthin blood levels following administration of ZanthoSyn® were nearly three times higher than the microalgal astaxanthin product at the same dose: 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | AUC (area under curve, astaxanthin blood levels) = 2.85-fold greater (p=0.013) 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Cmax (maximum concentration, astaxanthin blood levels) = 3.0-fold greater (p=0.013) 
● | Coefficient of variation (variation between subjects of astaxanthin blood levels) 


○ | ZanthoSyn® = 27% 
--+---------------------------------
○ | Microalgal astaxanthin = 62% 


● | Tmax (time of maximum concentration) = 6 hours 
--+---------------------------------------------------
● | No adverse events observed 

 
The superior bioavailability described in this report means that three times more astaxanthin from ZanthoSyn® is absorbed into the body from each dose, which provides a superior value proposition compared to other astaxanthin dietary supplements.
 

● | Synthetic astaxanthin has been extensively tested in a wide range of toxicity studies, including acute, subacute, sub-chronic, and chronic toxicity studies, carcinogenicity studies, genotoxicity/mutagenicity studies, and developmental and reproductive toxicity studies; whereas to our knowledge microalgal or other sources of astaxanthin have not undergone the same amount of safety testing in such toxicity studies. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Synthetic astaxanthin is manufactured with superior purity and precision, whereas astaxanthin extracted from microalgae and krill oil is obtained in a complex mixture, which may include many unknown marine byproducts. 
● | Synthetic manufacture of astaxanthin is scalable, whereas we believe the ability to readily scale the production and extraction of astaxanthin from microalgae or other sources will be limited as demand for astaxanthin grows. 
● | Synthetic manufacture of astaxanthin emits fewer greenhouse gases and consumes less energy, raw material, and land than traditional microalgal astaxanthin production.

Intellectual Property
 
We have obtained and are continuing to seek patent protection for compositions of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, and pharmaceutical uses, in certain disease areas, of our various carotenoid analogs and derivatives. Such carotenoids include astaxanthin, zeaxanthin, lutein, and/or lycophyll, and esters and other analogs and derivatives of these compounds. More specifically, we seek to protect: (i) the composition of matter of novel carotenoid analogs and derivatives, (ii) pharmaceutical compositions comprising synthetic or natural preparations of novel or natural occurring carotenoid analogs and derivatives, and (iii) the pharmaceutical use of synthetic preparations of novel or naturally occurring carotenoid analogs and derivatives in specific disease areas, including, but not limited to, the treatment of inflammation and related tissue damage, liver disease, and reperfusion injury, as well as the pharmaceutical use of synthetic or natural preparations of novel or natural occurring carotenoid analogs and derivatives for the reduction of platelet aggregation. We intend to enforce and defend our intellectual property rights consistent with our strategic business objectives.
 
We have 29 issued patents and one pending patent related to the composition of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, and pharmaceutical uses of our drugs candidates as well as many other related molecules that will expire between 2023 and 2028, subject to patent term extensions. We also have filed four additional patents that if issued would extend patent coverage in the U.S. and worldwide to 2039-2041, with such applications related to (i) certain cardiovascular uses on the basis of the CHASE clinical trial results, (ii) certain uses related to the potential role of astaxanthin in the treatment of COVID-19, and (iii) the composition of matter of CDX-101.
 
The Company’s patents are summarized in the table below.
 

 | United States | | Foreign | | Expiration
----------------+---------------+----+---------+----+-----------
Issued Patents | | 14 | | 15 | | 2023-2028
Pending Patents | | 0 | | 1 | | 2023-2028
Pending Patents | | 3 | | 1 | | 2039-2041

Research and Development
 
Our research and development program is presently comprised of employees, consultants, including regulatory, scientific, and medical professionals, and third-party collaborators or contract organizations, including academic institutions, contract research organizations, and contract development and manufacturing organizations. Contract organizations provide us with access to significant research and development resources and infrastructure. We anticipate that our research and development will be primarily conducted by contract organizations with direction and oversight by our in-house research and development personnel.
 
In addition to conducting or overseeing research and development activities, our research and development personnel analyze and interpret other research on astaxanthin, as well as related compounds, competing products, applications, and industry trends. In the United States National Library of Medicine’s online repository, PubMed.gov, there are more than 2,000 peer-reviewed journal articles that reference astaxanthin in the title or abstract, over 500 of which were published in the last three years, with the vast majority published by organizations and researchers that are not affiliated with us. This type of “open-source” research has served to significantly advance the understanding of astaxanthin and related carotenoids, and has also presented our research and development personnel with the critical task of keeping up-to-date on all of the latest research and interpreting and integrating the findings with our research and that of others in order to serve as leading experts on the mechanism of action and biological applications of astaxanthin and related carotenoids.
 
Our research and development expenditures totaled $315,994 and $269,077 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These expenditures primarily reflect the cost of product development activities, including clinical trials. The compensation of our research and development personnel are included as a component of salaries and wages in the consolidated statements of operations.

Manufacturing
 
We utilize contract manufacturers and/or other third-party suppliers for the production of our products. The raw materials and supplies required for the production of our products may be available, in some instances from one supplier, and in other instances, from multiple suppliers. In those cases where raw materials are only available through one supplier, such supplier may be either a sole source (the only recognized supply source available to us) or a single source (the only approved supply source for us among other sources). We, our contract manufacturers, and/or other third-party suppliers will adopt appropriate policies to attempt, to the extent feasible, to minimize our raw material supply risks, including maintenance of greater levels of raw materials inventory and implementation of multiple raw materials sourcing strategies, especially for critical raw materials. Although to date we have not experienced any significant delays in obtaining any raw materials from suppliers, we cannot provide assurance that we, our contract manufacturers, and/or other third-party suppliers will not face shortages from one or more suppliers in the future.
Competition
 
The industries in which we intend to compete are subject to intense competition. The primary competition for our pharmaceutical candidates are the numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies developing or marketing anti-inflammatories and other drugs or therapeutics targeting chronic diseases driven by inflammation, including cardiovascular disease, metabolic disease, liver disease, arthritis, aging, and macular degeneration. Certain competitors for our pharmaceutical candidates include, but are not limited to, AbbVie, Acasti Pharma, Acucela, Alkeus Pharmaceuticals, Amarin, Amgen, Astellas, AstraZeneca, Bayer, Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly, Gilead, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, Matinas Biopharma, Merck, MT Pharma, Nestle/Pamlab, Novartis, Pfizer, Reata Pharmaceuticals, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Roche/Genentech, Sanofi-Aventis, Servier, and Takeda. The primary competition for our dietary supplements are the many companies developing or marketing astaxanthin dietary supplements and other supplements targeting inflammatory health, cardiovascular health, metabolic health, liver health, joint health, and longevity. We believe that our ability to compete will be based primarily on scientific superiority, availability of patent protection, protection of other intellectual property rights, access to adequate capital, ability to develop, acquire, and market products successfully, ability to obtain governmental approvals, and ability to serve the particular needs of customers.
 
Our success will depend in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain international and domestic patents, other intellectual property, and other legal protections for the proprietary technology that we consider important to our business. We intend to continue to seek appropriate patent protection for our products where applicable by filing patent applications in the United States and other selected countries. We intend for these patent applications to cover, where applicable, claims for composition of matter, uses, manufacturing processes, and formulations. Our success will also depend on our ability, and the ability of our current and/or future strategic partners to maintain intellectual property rights related to proprietary production methods for products that we, or our partners, intend to market.

Government Regulation
 
Most aspects of our business are subject to some degree of government regulation. For some of our products, government regulation is significant and, in general, there appears to be a trend toward more stringent regulation throughout the world, as well as global harmonization of various regulatory requirements. We expect to devote significant time, effort and expense to address the extensive government and regulatory requirements applicable to our business. We believe that we are no more or less adversely affected by existing government regulations than our competitors.
 
FDA Regulation
 
Biopharmaceutical companies must comply with comprehensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the United States and comparable authorities in other countries. While the FDA does not require human clinical trials for dietary supplements, we have conducted and may continue to conduct clinical trials with our dietary supplements to promote scientific and consumer awareness. We may also conduct Phase I, Phase II, and/or Phase III clinical trials with our pharmaceutical candidates.
 
We must obtain regulatory approvals by the FDA and similar health authorities in foreign countries to the extent applicable prior to human clinical testing and marketing of any pharmaceutical and for post-approval clinical studies for additional indications of approved drugs. We anticipate that any pharmaceutical candidate will be subject to rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and pre-market approval procedures by the FDA and similar health authorities in foreign countries to the extent applicable. The extent to which our products are regulated by the FDA will depend upon the types of products we ultimately develop. We are currently evaluating and pursuing various developmental strategies and cannot predict, during this stage of our development, the scope of FDA or other agency regulation to which we or our products will be subject. Various federal statutes and regulations also govern or influence the preclinical and clinical testing, record-keeping, approval, labeling, manufacture, quality, shipping, distribution, storage, marketing and promotion, export, and reimbursement of pharmaceuticals.
 
The steps ordinarily required before a drug product may be marketed in the United States include:
 

● | preclinical studies; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug (“IND”) application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may commence; 
● | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the pharmaceutical candidate in the desired indication for use; 
● | submission to the FDA of a new drug application (“NDA”), together with payment of a substantial user fee; and 
● | FDA approval of the NDA, including inspection and approval of the product manufacturing facility and select sites at which human clinical trials were conducted. 

 
Preclinical studies typically involve laboratory evaluation of pharmaceutical candidate chemistry, formulation, and stability, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the pharmaceutical candidate. The results of preclinical studies are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND and are reviewed by the FDA before the commencement of clinical trials. Unless the FDA objects to an IND, the IND will become effective 30 days following its receipt by the FDA. Submission of an IND may not result in FDA clearance to commence clinical trials, and the FDA’s failure to object to an IND does not guarantee FDA approval of a marketing application.

Clinical trials involve the administration of the test agent to humans under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator. In the United States, clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practices. In addition, each clinical trial must be approved and conducted under the auspices of an institutional review board and with the subject’s informed consent. We would be subject to similar regulatory considerations if we conduct clinical trials outside the United States.
 
The goal of Phase I clinical trials is to establish initial data about safety and tolerability of the pharmaceutical candidate in humans. The investigators seek to evaluate the effects of various dosages and to establish an optimal dosage level and schedule.
 
The goal of Phase II clinical trials is to provide evidence about the desired therapeutic efficacy of the pharmaceutical candidate in limited studies with small numbers of carefully selected subjects. Investigators also gather additional safety data.
 
Phase III clinical trials consist of expanded, large-scale, multi-center studies in the target patient population. This phase further tests the product’s effectiveness, monitors side effects, and, in some cases, compares the product’s effects to a standard treatment, if one is already available. Phase III trials are designed to more rigorously test the efficacy of a pharmaceutical candidate and are normally randomized, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled. Phase III trials are typically monitored by an independent data monitoring committee, or DMC, which periodically reviews data as a trial progresses. A DMC may recommend that a trial be stopped before completion for a number of reasons including safety concerns, patient benefit, or futility.
 
Data obtained from this development program are submitted as part of an NDA to the FDA and possibly to corresponding agencies in other countries for review. The NDA requires agency approval prior to marketing in the relevant country. Extensive regulations define the form, content and methods of gathering, compiling and analyzing the pharmaceutical candidate’s safety and efficacy data.
 
The process of obtaining regulatory approval can be costly, time consuming and subject to unanticipated delays. Regulatory agencies may refuse to approve an application if they believe that applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied and may also require additional testing for safety and efficacy and/or post-marketing surveillance or other ongoing requirements for post-marketing studies. In some instances, regulatory approval may be granted with the condition that confirmatory Phase IV clinical trials are carried out, and if these trials do not confirm the results of previous studies, regulatory approval for marketing may be withdrawn. Moreover, each regulatory approval of a product is limited to specific indications. The FDA or other regulatory authorities may approve only limited label information for the product. The label information describes the indications and methods of use for which the product is authorized, may include Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies and, if overly restrictive, may limit a sponsor’s ability to successfully market the product. Regulatory agencies routinely revise or issue new regulations, which can affect and delay regulatory approval of pharmaceuticals.
 
Furthermore, pharmaceutical manufacturing processes must conform to current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs. Manufacturers, including a drug sponsor’s third-party contract manufacturers, must expend time, money and effort in the areas of production, quality control and quality assurance, including compliance with stringent record-keeping requirements. Manufacturing establishments are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA or other health authorities, in order to assess, among other things, compliance with cGMP. Before approval of the initiation of commercial manufacturing processes, the FDA will usually perform a preapproval inspection of the facility to determine its compliance with cGMP and other rules and regulations. In addition, foreign manufacturers must also comply with cGMPs in order to supply products for use in the United States, and are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA or by regulatory authorities in certain countries under reciprocal agreements with the FDA. Manufacturing processes and facilities for pharmaceuticals are highly regulated. Regulatory authorities may choose not to certify or may impose restrictions, or even shut down existing manufacturing facilities that they determine are non-compliant.

FDA GRAS Determination
 
“GRAS” is an acronym for the phrase “generally recognized as safe,” which the FDA utilizes to describe those substances that, in the generally recognized opinion of the scientific community, will not be harmful to consumers, provided the substance is used as intended. According to applicable FDA regulations, any substance that is intentionally added to food is a food additive, which is subject to premarket review and approval by FDA, unless the substance is generally recognized, among qualified experts, as having been adequately shown to be safe under the conditions of its intended use. Under sections 201(s) and 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FD&C Act”), and FDA’s implementing regulations in 21 CFR 170.3 and 21 CFR 170.30, the use of a food substance may be GRAS either through scientific procedures or, for a substance used in food before 1958, through experience based on common use in food. General recognition of safety through scientific procedures requires the same quantity and quality of scientific evidence as is required to obtain approval of the substance as a food additive and ordinarily is based upon published studies, which may be corroborated by unpublished studies and other data and information. General recognition of safety through experience based on common use in foods requires a substantial history of consumption for food use by a significant number of consumers.
 
Manufacturers of GRAS substances may provide the FDA with a notification of GRAS determination, which includes a description of the substance, the applicable conditions of use, and an explanation of how the substance was determined to be safe. Upon review of such a notification, the FDA may respond with a “no questions” position, whereby the manufacturer’s determination that a product is GRAS for its intended purposes is affirmed. Alternatively, manufacturers may elect to “self-affirm” a given substance as GRAS without FDA notification but should retain all applicable safety data used for GRAS determination in the case of FDA inquiry.
 
Synthetic copies of naturally-occurring dietary ingredients or related components do not qualify as dietary ingredients under the FD&C Act, but substances that have been affirmed by the FDA as GRAS, self-affirmed as GRAS, or approved as direct food additives in the U.S. may be marketed as dietary ingredients, subject to FDA regulations for dietary ingredients.
 
FDA NDI Notification
 
The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (the “DSHEA”) (Pub. L. 103-417) was signed into law on October 25, 1994 and amended the FD&C Act by adding: (i) section 201(ff) (21 U.S.C. 321(ff)), which defines the term “dietary supplement”, and (ii) section 413 (21 U.S.C. 350b), which defines the term “new dietary ingredient” (“NDI”) and requires the manufacturer or distributor of an NDI, or of the dietary supplement that contains the NDI, to submit a premarket notification to FDA at least 75 days before introducing/delivering the supplement into interstate commerce, unless the NDI and any other dietary ingredients in the dietary supplement have been present in the food supply without chemical alteration (21 U.S.C. 350b(a)(1)). The NDI notification must contain applicable information, including history of use and citations to published articles, from which the manufacturer or distributor of the NDI or dietary supplement has concluded that the dietary supplement containing the NDI will be reasonably expected to be safe under the conditions of its intended use. NDI notifications are not required for the marketing of approved food additives or GRAS substances as NDIs unless the dietary ingredient has been chemically altered.

FDA Orphan Drug Designation
 
The Orphan Drug Act was signed into law on January 4, 1983. The Congressional findings for the Orphan Drug Act were as follows: (i) there are many rare diseases and conditions that affect such small numbers of individuals residing in the United States; (ii) adequate drugs for many rare diseases and conditions have not been developed; (iii) drugs for rare diseases and conditions are commonly referred to as “orphan drugs”; (iv) because so few individuals are affected by any one rare disease or condition, a pharmaceutical company that develops an orphan drug may reasonably expect the drug to generate relatively small sales in comparison to the cost of developing the drug and consequently to incur a financial loss; (v) there is reason to believe that some promising orphan drugs will not be developed unless changes are made in the applicable Federal laws to reduce the costs of developing such drugs and to provide financial incentives to develop such drugs; and (vi) it is in the public interest to provide such changes and incentives for the development of orphan drugs.
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition that (i) affects less than 200,000 persons in the United States, or (ii) affects more than 200,000 in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for such disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States of such drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.
 
In the United States, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages, and NDA user-fee waivers. In addition, if a drug receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the drug is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application, including a full NDA, to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the drug with orphan exclusivity or where the manufacturer with orphan exclusivity is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the approved orphan-designated drug. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different drugs for the indication that the orphan drug has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same drug but for a different indication for which the orphan drug has exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our drugs for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug as defined by the FDA or if our drug is determined to be contained within the competitor’s drug for the same indication or disease. If a drug designated as an orphan drug receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. There can be no assurance that any request for orphan drug designation will be granted by the FDA.

Other Regulations
 
Pharmaceutical companies are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare “fraud and abuse,” including anti-kickback and false claims laws. The Anti-Kickback Statute is a federal criminal statute that makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer, or a party acting on its behalf, to knowingly and willfully solicit, offer, receive or pay any remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for, or to induce, the referral of business, including the purchase, order or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Some of the state prohibitions apply to referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
 
In the course of practicing medicine, physicians may legally prescribe FDA approved drugs for an indication that has not been approved by the FDA and which, therefore, is not described in the product’s approved labeling, so-called “off-label use.” The FDA does not ordinarily regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA and other governmental agencies do, however, restrict communications on the subject of off-label use by a manufacturer or those acting on behalf of a manufacturer. Companies may not promote FDA-approved drugs for off-label uses. The FDA and other governmental agencies do permit a manufacturer (and those acting on its behalf) to engage in some limited, non-misleading, non-promotional exchanges of scientific information regarding unapproved indications. The United States False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, anyone from knowingly and willfully presenting, or causing to be presented for payment to third-party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including imprisonment, fines and civil monetary penalties, as well as possible exclusion from federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). In addition, under this and other applicable laws, such as the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, there is an ability for private individuals to bring similar actions. Further, there is an increasing number of state laws that require manufacturers to make reports to states on pricing and marketing information. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the law.
 
We are subject to various laws and regulations regarding laboratory practices and the experimental use of animals in connection with our research. In each of these areas, as above, the FDA and other regulatory authorities have broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including the ability to suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize or recall products, withdraw approvals, enjoin violations and institute criminal prosecution, any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 
We must comply with regulations under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act and other federal, state and local regulations. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, air emission, effluent discharge, handling and disposal of certain hazardous or potentially hazardous materials. We may be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental and health and safety regulations in the future. Our research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous materials, including, but not limited to, certain hazardous chemicals.
 
Our activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. We are also subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, which prohibits companies and individuals from engaging in specified activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. Under the FCPA, it is illegal to pay, offer to pay, or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, governmental staff members, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. In addition, federal and state laws protect the confidentiality of certain health information, in particular, individually identifiable information, and restrict the use and disclosure of that information. At the federal level, the Department of Health and Human Services promulgated health information privacy and security rules under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. In addition, many state laws apply to the use and disclosure of health information.

Customers
 
We sell ZanthoSyn® primarily through wholesale and e-commerce channels. We launched our e-commerce channel in 2016, and we began selling to GNC stores in 2017. ZanthoSyn® is currently available at over two thousand GNC corporate stores in the United States.
 
During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, sales to GNC accounted for approximately 90% of our revenues. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our revenues during these years.
 
We sell ZanthoSyn® to GNC under a purchasing agreement. The exclusivity provision under such agreement related to distribution of ZanthoSyn® by GNC in the “brick and mortar” retail channel in the United States expired on October 16, 2019.
