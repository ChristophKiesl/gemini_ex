In December 2019, an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) originated in Wuhan, China and has since spread to a number of other countries, including the U.S. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. In addition, several states in the U.S., including California, where the Company is headquartered, have experienced an increase of new cases of COVID-19. It is uncertain if this trend will continue into 2021, as shown by the recent uptick in reported cases. The COVID-19 outbreak is disrupting supply chains and affecting production and sales across a wide range of industries. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, impact on our customers, employees and vendors all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. At this point, the extent to which COVID-19 may impact our financial condition or results of operations is uncertain.

Core Technologies
 
The Company’s core technologies can be referred to as “transaction-enabling” and “business process work flow” technologies. These technologies include various forms of electronic signature methods, such as handwritten, biometric, click-to-sign and others, as well as technologies related to signature verification, authentication, cryptography and the logging of audit trails to prove signers’ intent. These technologies enable the appending of secure, legal and regulatory compliant electronic signatures coupled with an enhanced user experience, all at a fraction of the time and cost required by traditional, paper-based processes for signature capture.
Products
 
The Company’s enterprise-class SignatureOne® and iSign® suite of electronic signature solutions enable businesses to implement truly paperless, electronic signature-driven business processes. The aggregate of the software functionality enabling the digitization of end-to-end work flow processes is sometimes referred to as “digital transaction management” (DTM). Many applications provide electronic forms and allow users to fill-in information, but most of these applications still require users to print out a paper copy for a handwritten, ink signature. Solutions powered by iSign products allow legally binding electronic signatures to be added to digital documents, eliminating the need for paper to memorialize the completion, approval or authentication of the transaction. This allows users to reduce transaction times and processing costs.
