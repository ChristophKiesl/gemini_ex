Item 1. Business
Overview 
 Tivity Health, Inc. (the “Company”), was founded and incorporated in Delaware in 1981.  We are a leading provider of healthy life-changing solutions, including SilverSneakers®, Prime® Fitness, and WholeHealth Living®. We help adults improve their health and support them on life’s journey by providing access to in-person and virtual physical activity, social engagement, and mental enrichment programs. We deliver resources that enable members to live healthier, happier, more connected lives. Our solutions support health plans and employers nationwide as they seek to reduce costs and improve health outcomes.   

We offer SilverSneakers to approximately 18 million eligible members of Medicare Advantage, Medicare Supplement, and group retiree plans.  We also offer Prime Fitness, a fitness facility access program, through commercial health plans, employers, and other sponsoring organizations.  Our national network of fitness centers delivers both SilverSneakers and Prime Fitness.  At December 31, 2021, our SilverSneakers fitness network encompassed approximately 16,000 locations.  In January 2022, we launched a customizable, premium fitness network for SilverSneakers that increased our total SilverSneakers fitness network to approximately 23,000 locations. We also offer virtual fitness experiences, including live instructor-led classes.  Through our WholeHealth Living program, which we sell primarily to health plans, we offer a continuum of services related to physical and integrative medicine.  Our WholeHealth Living network includes relationships with approximately 29,000 physical and integrative medicine practitioner locations to serve individuals through health plans and employers who seek health services such as chiropractic care, acupuncture, physical therapy, occupational therapy, massage therapy, and more.   
 The Company is headquartered at 701 Cool Springs Boulevard, Franklin, Tennessee 37067.
 COVID-19 
 
COVID-19, the global pandemic first recognized by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) as a national public health emergency in January 2020, continues to spread throughout the United States and other countries. Many federal, state, and local governments recommended and mandated precautions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, including ordering closure of certain businesses and imposing stay-at-home orders, social distancing guidelines, mask mandates, and vaccine requirements for individuals. Such measures resulted in reduced demand for many businesses. Although many of these restrictions have been eased across the United States, some restrictions remain in place, and new restrictions may be adopted as the pandemic evolves and new variant strains of COVID-19 emerge.
 
By March 31, 2020, substantially all of the fitness centers in our national network were temporarily closed, which had an adverse impact on our results of operations for the first quarter of 2020 and beyond because a significant portion of revenues from our SilverSneakers program is based on member visits to a fitness partner location.  Some locations began reopening in May 2020 and additional locations reopened in June and throughout the remainder of 2020. SilverSneakers in-person visits totaled 46.0 million and 58.4 million for 2020 and 2021, respectively.  In addition, while the number of active subscribers for Prime Fitness declined from April through December 2020, as of December 31, 2021, the number of active subscribers had increased slightly since the beginning of 2021.  We are unable to predict with certainty how many of our fitness partner locations will be subject to any operational restrictions in the future and for what duration, or the level of member participation at our fitness partner locations.  
 
As fitness locations closed as a result of the pandemic, we quickly adapted to the changing needs of our members and clients by launching a new and dynamic suite of virtual offerings beginning in March 2020, which we will continue to offer.  Virtual visits were 1.7 million and 3.4 million for 2020 and 2021, respectively.  We believe these digital offerings not only allow our currently homebound members to stay active and connected with the help 
 4

of SilverSneakers but that they will also be a critical contributor to our new digitally-enabled member engagement platform going forward.
 
Customer and Partner Contracts
 Except for Prime Fitness, our customer contracts generally have initial terms of approximately three years.  Some contracts allow the customer to terminate early and/or determine on an annual basis to which of their members they will offer our programs.  For Prime Fitness, our contracts with commercial health plans, employers, and other sponsoring organizations generally have initial terms of approximately three years, while individuals who purchase the Prime Fitness program through these organizations may cancel at any time (on a monthly basis) after an initial period of one to three months.  Our fitness partner location contracts generally have initial terms ranging from one to three years and auto-renew for successive one-year renewal terms. 
Business Strategy 
 
Our strategy is to enable healthier, happier and more connected lives as a digital platform engagement company that not only provides in-person and virtual fitness, social engagement and mental enrichment opportunities, but also an insights-driven, personalized experience.  Our goal is to increase the number of eligible and enrolled SilverSneakers members and broaden engagement through strong health plan partnerships, a robust national network of approximately 23,000 fitness locations, live-with-instructor and on-demand virtual classes, and non-fitness activities that support social connection and lifelong learning. We will also focus on increasing the number of subscribers to Prime Fitness, targeting adults aged 18-64 who are members of sponsoring organizations, through our national network of approximately 12,500 participating locations and our daily live streaming classes. In addition, we plan to accelerate growth in our WholeHealth Living offering through market share expansion and improved technology.  
 
Disposition of our Nutrition Business
 
Effective as of December 9, 2020, we completed the sale of Nutrisystem, Inc. (“Nutrisystem”), a wholly owned 
 subsidiary of the Company that included the Nutrisystem® and South Beach Diet® programs, to KNS Acquisition Corp. (“Kainos”) pursuant to terms of a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”), dated October 18, 2020, by and among the Company, Kainos, and Kainos NS Holdings LP. At the closing (the “Closing”) of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement (the “Transactions”), Nutrisystem and its subsidiaries were acquired by, and became wholly owned subsidiaries of, Kainos. Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, Kainos paid to the Company an aggregate purchase price, after giving effect to customary indebtedness and cash adjustments, of approximately $559 million, which amount was subject to a customary working capital adjustment post-Closing. Such working capital adjustment was finalized in the second quarter of 2021 and resulted in $2.7 million of additional proceeds. We used the significant majority of the net proceeds from the divestiture to pay down principal on the term loans under our Prior Credit Agreement (as defined below).  Results of operations for Nutrisystem have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements.
 Segment and Major Customer Information
 
Following the sale of Nutrisystem in December 2020, we have one operating and reportable segment.  
 During 2021, our top three customers, including Humana, Inc. (“Humana”), together comprised 40% of our revenues from continuing operations. Our primary contract with Humana continues through December 31, 2022.  See Note 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report relating to revenues from external customers and customer concentration.
 Competition
 The healthcare and fitness industries are highly competitive, and the manner in which services are provided is subject to continual change. Other entities, whose financial and marketing resources may exceed our resources, may choose to initiate or expand programs in competition with our offerings.
 We believe we have certain advantages over our competitors such as:
 5

 
• | the brand recognition of our programs such as SilverSneakers;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | our long-term relationships with health plans;
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | our long-term relationships with network partners;
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | our proprietary class programming, including our growing digital programming;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the depth and breadth of our fitness center network relationships, which encompass approximately 23,000 SilverSneakers locations; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the trusting connections with our members developed over more than 25 years.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 However, we cannot assure you that we can compete effectively with other entities who provide similar services.
 Industry Integration and Consolidation
 Consolidation remains an important factor in all aspects of the healthcare industry.  While we believe the size of our membership base provides us with the economies of scale to compete even in a consolidating market, we cannot assure you that we can effectively compete with companies formed as a result of industry consolidation or that we can retain existing customers if they are acquired by other entities that already have or contract for programs similar to ours or are not interested in our programs.
Governmental Regulation
 Governmental regulation impacts us in a number of ways in addition to those regulatory risks presented under Item 1A. “Risk Factors” below.
 Health Reform
 
In recent years, Congress and certain state governments have passed a large number of laws and regulations intended to result in major changes within the healthcare system. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “ACA”), the most prominent of these efforts, changes how healthcare services are covered, delivered, and reimbursed through, among other things, expanded health insurance coverage, reduced growth in Medicare program spending, the establishment of programs that tie reimbursement to care quality and value, and private sector health insurance reforms. For example, the ACA established uniform minimum medical loss ratios (“MLRs”) for health plans, requiring a minimum percentage of health coverage premium revenue to be spent on healthcare medical costs and quality improvement expenses. 
 
The ACA has been subject to legislative and regulatory changes. For example, effective January 2019, Congress eliminated the financial penalty associated with the ACA’s individual mandate. This change resulted in legal challenges to the constitutionality of the individual mandate and validity of the ACA as a whole. However, in June 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court determined that the plaintiffs lacked standing, allowing the law to remain in place. Nonetheless, the elimination of the individual mandate penalty may impact the number of individuals that elect to obtain public or private health insurance or the scope of such coverage, if purchased.
 
The current presidential administration has indicated that it generally intends to protect and strengthen the ACA, but there is uncertainty regarding the ongoing net effect of the ACA due to the potential for changes to the law, its implementation, and its interpretation. There is also uncertainty regarding the potential impact of other health reform efforts at the federal and state levels. For example, beginning in 2020, the Creating High-quality Results and Outcomes Necessary to Improve Chronic (CHRONIC) Care Act of 2018 (“Chronic Care Act”) allows Medicare Advantage plans to cover supplemental benefits that are not primarily health-related, but that have the reasonable expectation of improving or maintaining health. Additionally, some members of Congress have proposed measures that would expand government-sponsored coverage, including single-payor proposals (often referred to as "Medicare for All").
 6

Other Laws
 While many of the governmental and regulatory requirements affecting healthcare delivery generally do not directly apply to us, our customers must comply with a variety of regulations including those governing Medicare Advantage plans and their marketing and the licensing and reimbursement requirements of federal, state and local agencies. Certain of our services, including health service utilization management and certain claims payment functions, require licensure by state government agencies. We are subject to a variety of legal requirements in order to obtain and maintain such licenses.
 Federal privacy regulations issued pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) extensively restrict the use and disclosure of individually-identifiable health information by health plans, most healthcare providers, and certain other entities (collectively, “covered entities”). Federal security regulations issued pursuant to HIPAA require covered entities to implement and maintain administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic individually-identifiable health information. Because we handle individually-identifiable health information on behalf of covered entities, we are considered a "business associate" and are required to comply with most aspects of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations. Violations of HIPAA and its implementing regulations may result in criminal penalties and in substantial civil penalties for each violation. These penalties are updated annually based on changes to the consumer price index.
 In the event of a data breach involving individually-identifiable health information, we are subject to contractual obligations and state and federal requirements that require us to notify our customers. These requirements may also require us or our customers to notify affected individuals, regulatory agencies, and the media of the data breach. Under HIPAA, non-permitted uses and disclosures of unsecured individually identifiable health information are presumed to be breaches for which notice is required, unless it can be demonstrated that there is a low probability the information has been compromised.
 In addition, there are numerous other laws and legislative and regulatory initiatives at the federal and state levels addressing the confidentiality and security of confidential personal information that may apply to us directly or contractually. These laws vary, are subject to frequent changes and updates in regulations, and could impose additional penalties and other legal liability. For example, the potential effects of the CCPA and CPRA (as defined under Item 1A “Risk Factors”) are far-reaching and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission uses its consumer protection authority to initiate enforcement actions in response to data use and data breaches. If we fail to comply with these or other applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to liabilities, including civil penalties, money damages, and criminal penalties. 
 Federal law contains various prohibitions related to false statements and false claims, some of which apply to private payors as well as federal programs. Our contracts with Medicare Advantage plans may subject us to a number of obligations, including billing and reimbursement requirements, prohibitions on fraudulent and abusive conduct and related training and screening obligations. Actions may be brought under the federal False Claims Act by the government as well as by private individuals, known as “whistleblowers,” who are permitted to share in any settlement or judgment. Liability under the federal False Claims Act arises when an entity knowingly submits a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The federal False Claims Act defines the term “knowingly” broadly. There are many other potential bases for liability under the federal False Claims Act, including knowingly and improperly avoiding repayment of an overpayment received from the government and the knowing failure to report and return an overpayment within 60 days of identifying the overpayment. The submission of claims for services or items generated in violation of certain “fraud and abuse” provisions of the Social Security Act, including the anti-kickback provisions, constitutes a false or fraudulent claim under the federal False Claims Act. In some cases, whistleblowers, the federal government, and some courts have taken the position that entities that allegedly have violated other statutes, such as the federal self-referral prohibition commonly known as the Stark Law, have thereby submitted false claims under the federal False Claims Act.
 From time to time, participants in the healthcare industry, including the Company and our customers, may be subject to actions under the federal False Claims Act or other fraud and abuse laws, including similar state statutes, and it is not possible to predict the impact of such actions. Violations of applicable laws may result in significant civil and criminal penalties. For example, violations of the federal False Claims Act may result in penalties of three times 
 7

the actual damages sustained by the government, plus substantial mandatory civil penalties for each separate false claim. These penalties are updated annually based on changes to the consumer price index.
 Because of the international operations previously conducted as part of our total population health services (“TPHS”) business that we sold to Sharecare, Inc. (“Sharecare”) in July 2016, we were subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) and similar anti-bribery laws of other countries in which we provided services prior to the sale. The FCPA and similar antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or gaining any business advantage. Failure to comply with the FCPA and similar legislation prior to the sale of our TPHS business could result in the imposition of civil or criminal fines and penalties.
 Intellectual Property 
 We own numerous trademarks and other proprietary rights that are important to our business. Depending upon the jurisdiction, trademarks are valid as long as they are used in the regular course of trade and/or their registrations are properly maintained. We believe the protection of our trademarks, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, and trade secrets is important to our success. We protect our intellectual property rights by relying on a combination of watch services and trademark, copyright, trade dress and trade secret laws, and through the domain name dispute resolution system.
Human Capital Resources
 
Employee Profile
 
As of February 21, 2022, we had approximately 380 employees, comprised of approximately 35% male and 65% female.  Of our total employees, approximately 50% were assigned to our office in Chandler, Arizona, 10% were assigned to our office in Franklin, Tennessee, and the remaining 40% were based off-campus within the United States.  Throughout 2021, however, the majority of our employees worked primarily from their homes. We believe we have good relationships with our employees, and we encourage open and candid communication to ensure we maintain positive relationships, connectivity, and engagement.
Health and Safety
 
We are committed to the health and safety of our employees.  We have implemented health and safety policies and practices, taking into account CDC guidance and any applicable state or local requirements, to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, including adopting flexible work-from-home arrangements, imposing travel restrictions, promoting social distancing, and cleaning protocols at our two office locations.  Employees who choose to be in the office must either provide proof of vaccination or wear a mask, and attendance at in-person meetings requires proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test. 
Diversity and Inclusion
 
We embrace diversity and inclusion and believe in creating an inclusive and equitable environment that represents a broad spectrum of backgrounds and cultures.  Our CEO has pledged his commitment to the CEO Action for Diversity & InclusionTM, which outlines a specific set of actions the CEO will take to cultivate a trusting environment where all ideas are welcomed, and employees feel comfortable and empowered to have discussions about diversity and inclusion.  To further this effort and in addition to our existing communication vehicles, we have created a diversity and inclusion council, which includes internally- and externally-focused committees; launched a diversity-focused listening series; and conducted unconscious bias training sessions with all employees, including as part of the on-boarding program for new employees. With the assistance of our diversity and inclusion council, we continue to explore additional diversity and inclusion initiatives, and we provide regular updates to our Board of Directors.
Employee Engagement
 We regularly conduct anonymous surveys to seek feedback from our employees on a variety of topics, including but not limited to, confidence in Company leadership, competitiveness of our compensation and benefits package, career growth opportunities and improvements on how we could make our Company an employer of 
 8

choice. The results are shared with the entire organization and are reviewed by senior leadership, who analyze areas of progress or deterioration and prioritize actions and activities in response to this feedback to drive meaningful improvements in employee engagement.  We have also established regular communication between the CEO and employees.  Finally, we monitor employee turnover, with a particular emphasis on regretted turnover, and conduct exit interviews with departing employees.
