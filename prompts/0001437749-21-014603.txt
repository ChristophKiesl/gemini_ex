Business
 
History and Development of Seneca Foods Corporation
 
SENECA FOODS CORPORATION (the “Company”) is one of North America's leading providers of packaged vegetables with facilities located throughout the United States. The Company’s product offerings include canned, frozen and bottled produce and snack chips and its products are sold under private label as well as national and regional brands that the Company owns or licenses, including Seneca®, Libby’s®, Aunt Nellie’s®, READ®, Green Valley® and CherryMan®.
 
As of March 31, 2021, the Company’s facilities consisted of 22 packaging plants strategically located throughout the United States, two can manufacturing plants one of which also packages, three seed packaging operations, a farming operation and a logistical support network. The Company also maintains warehouses which are generally located adjacent to its packaging plants. The Company is a New York corporation and its headquarters is located at 3736 South Main Street, Marion, New York and its telephone number is (315) 926-8100.
 
The Company was founded in 1949 and has evolved through internal growth and strategic acquisitions. The Company pursues acquisitions when they are strategic and financially additive and meet its overall business needs. In 73 years of operation the Company has made over 50 strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances that have expanded its leadership in the packaged fruit and vegetable industry. Most recently, during 2021, the Company acquired a facility in Berlin, Wisconsin to aid its frozen business by expanding freezing capability and adding frozen celery production to the core fruit and vegetable business. The Company also engages in strategic sales of its assets from time to time, as it makes financial sense to do so. During 2021, the Company completed the sale of its prepared foods business as the nature of that business was not central to the Company’s primary business and the sale allowed for the continued focus and investment in the Company’s core fruit and vegetable business.

Financial Information about Industry Segments
 
Entering 2021, the Company managed its business on the basis of three reportable segments which makeup its food operation – the primary segment being the packaging and sale of fruit and vegetables, secondarily, the packaging and sale of prepared food products and third being the packaging and sale of snack products. Other nonfood products round out the Company’s operations. During December 2021, the Company completed the sale of its prepared foods business, leaving two remaining reportable segments. The Company’s food operation constituted 98% of total sales in 2021, of which approximately 81% is canned vegetable packaging, 6% is canned fruit packaging, 7% is frozen fruit and vegetable packaging, 5% is prepared foods prior to the sale, and 1% is chip packaging. The non-food operation, which is primarily related to the sale of cans and ends and outside revenue generated from our trucking and aircraft operations, represents 2% of the Company’s total sales.

Source and Availability of Raw Materials
 
The Company’s food packaging plants are located in major vegetable producing states. Vegetables are primarily obtained through supply contracts with independent growers.
 
Intellectual Property
 
The Company's most significant brand name, Libby's®, is held pursuant to a trademark license granted to the Company in March 1982 and renewable by the Company every 10 years for an aggregate period expiring in March 2081. The original licensor was Libby, McNeill & Libby, Inc., then an indirect subsidiary of Nestlé, S. A. ("Nestlé") and the license was granted in connection with the Company's purchase of certain of the licensor's canned vegetable operations in the United States. Corlib Brands Management, LTD acquired the license from Nestlé during 2006. The license is limited to vegetables which are shelf-stable, frozen, and thermally packaged, and includes the Company's major vegetable varieties – corn, peas and green beans – as well as certain other thermally packaged vegetable varieties and sauerkraut.
 
The Company is required to pay an annual royalty to Corlib Brands now known as Libby's Brand Holding, Ltd., who may terminate the license for non-payment of royalty, use of the trademark in sales outside the licensed territory, failure to achieve a minimum level of sales under the licensed trademark during any calendar year or a material breach or default by the Company under the agreement (which is not cured within the specified cure period). With the purchase of Signature Fruit Company, LLC, which also uses the Libby’s® brand name, the Company re-negotiated the license agreement and created a new, combined agreement based on Libby’s® revenue dollars for fruits, vegetables, and dry beans. During 2021, the Company and Libby’s Brand Holding, Ltd. renegotiated again to remove fruit from the license agreement. A total of $114,000 was paid as a royalty fee for the year ended March 31, 2021.
 
The Company also sells canned vegetables, frozen vegetables and other food products under several other brands for which the Company has obtained registered trademarks, including, Aunt Nellie’s®, CherryMan®, Green Valley®, READ®, and Seneca® and other regional brands.

Seasonal Business
 
While individual vegetables have seasonal cycles of peak production and sales, the different cycles are somewhat offsetting. Minimal food packaging occurs in the Company's last fiscal quarter ending March 31, which is the optimal time for maintenance, repairs and equipment changes in its packaging plants. The supply of commodities, current pricing, and expected new crop quantity and quality affect the timing and amount of the Company’s sales and earnings. When the seasonal harvesting periods of the Company's major vegetables are newly completed, inventories for these packaged vegetables are at their highest levels. For peas, the peak inventory time is mid-summer and for corn, the Company's highest volume vegetable, the peak inventory is in mid-autumn.
 
These seasonal fluctuations are illustrated in the following table, which presents certain unaudited quarterly financial information for the periods indicated:
 

 | First Quarter | | Second Quarter | | | Third Quarter | | Fourth Quarter
--------------------------------------+----------------+---------+----------------+---+---------+---------------+---+---------------

Backlog
 
In the food packaging business, an end of year sales order backlog is not considered meaningful. Traditionally, larger customers provide tentative bookings for their expected purchases for the upcoming season. These bookings are further developed as data on the expected size of the related national harvests becomes available. In general, these bookings serve as a yardstick rather than as a firm commitment, since actual harvest results can vary notably from early estimates. In actual practice, the Company has substantially all of its expected seasonal production identified to potential sales outlets before the seasonal production is completed.
Competition and Customers
 
Competition in the food business is substantial with brand recognition and promotion, quality, service, and pricing being the major determinants in the Company’s relative market position. The Company believes that it is a major producer of canned vegetables, but some producers of canned, frozen and other forms of vegetable products have sales which exceed the Company's sales. The Company is aware of at least 13 competitors in the U.S. packaged vegetable industry, many of which are privately held companies.
 
During the past year, approximately 10% of the Company’s packaged foods, excluding cherry products, were sold under its own brands, or licensed trademarks, including Seneca®, Libby's®, Aunt Nellie's®, Green Valley® and READ®. The remaining 90% of packaged foods were sold under private labels, food service, international, contracting packaging, industrial, prepared foods, chips, and cherry products (including the CherryMan® brand) segments.
 
The Company's principal branded products are its Libby’s canned vegetable products, which rate among the top three national brands according to a leading market research firm.

Environmental Regulation
 
Environmental Protection
 
Environmental protection is an area that has been worked on diligently at each food packaging facility. In all locations, the Company has cooperated with federal, state, and local environmental protection authorities in developing and maintaining suitable antipollution facilities. In general, we believe our pollution control facilities are equal to or somewhat superior to those of our competitors and are within environmental protection standards. The Company does not expect any material capital expenditures to comply with environmental regulations in the near future.
 
There has been a broad range of proposed and promulgated state, national and international regulations aimed at reducing the effects of climate change. In the United States, there is a significant possibility that some form of regulation will be forthcoming at the federal level to address the effects of climate change. Such regulation could result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes, the restriction of output, investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations, or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances.
 
Environmental Litigation and Contingencies
 
In the ordinary course of its business, the Company is made a party to certain legal proceedings seeking monetary damages, including proceedings involving product liability claims, worker’s compensation and other employee claims, tort and other general liability claims, for which it carries insurance as well as patent infringement and related litigation. The Company is in a highly regulated industry and is also periodically involved in government actions for regulatory violations and other matters surrounding the manufacturing of its products, including, but not limited to, environmental, employee, and product safety issues. While it is not feasible to predict or determine the ultimate outcome of these matters, the Company does not believe that an adverse decision in any of these legal proceedings would have a material adverse impact on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
Employment
 
As of the end of December 2020, the Company had approximately 3,000 employees of which 2,900 full time and 100 seasonal employees work in food packaging and 100 full time employees work in other activities. The number of employees increases by approximately 4,000 due to an increase in seasonal employees during our peak pack season.
 
The Company has six collective bargaining agreements with three unions covering approximately 840 of its full-time employees.  The terms of these agreements result in wages and benefits which are substantially the same for comparable positions for the Company’s non-union employees.  There are two agreements that will expire in calendar 2022, two agreements that will expire in calendar 2023, one agreement that will expire in calendar 2024, and one agreement that will expire in calendar 2025.
