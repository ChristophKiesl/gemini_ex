ITEM 1.BUSINESS
General 
CatchMark Timber Trust, Inc. ("CatchMark Timber Trust") (NYSE: CTT) owns and operates timberlands located in the United States and has elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. CatchMark Timber Trust acquires, owns, operates, manages, and disposes of timberland properties directly, through wholly-owned subsidiaries, or through joint ventures. We seek to capture the highest value per acre and to generate sustainable yields through disciplined management and superior stewardship of our exceptional resources. We intend to grow over time through selective acquisitions and investments in high-demand fiber markets and to efficiently integrate new acquisitions and investments into our operations. Operationally, we focus on generating cash flows from sustainable harvests and improved harvest mix on high-quality industrial timberlands, as well as opportunistic land sales, rent from hunting and recreational leases and asset management fees to provide recurring dividends to our stockholders. We continue to practice intensive forest management and silvicultural techniques that improve the biological growth of our forests.
We also seek to create additional value from economic realization of environmental initiatives, including carbon sequestration, wetlands mitigation banking, and solar projects, recognizing the key role that forests play in protecting the environment. From time-to-time, we enter into joint ventures with long-term, institutional equity partners to opportunistically acquire, own, and manage timberland properties that fit our core investment strategy. Our joint venture platform leverages our operating scale and timberland management efficiencies to generate management fee revenues.
For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, our revenues from timber sales, timberland sales, asset management fees, and other non-harvest related sources, as a percentage of our total revenue, are set forth in the table below: 

 | 2021 | | 2020 | | 2019
Timber sales | 71 | % | | 69 | % | 68 | %
Timberland sales | 14 | % | | 15 | % | 17 | %
Asset management fees | 11 | % | | 12 | % | 11 | %
Other revenues | 4 | % | | 4 | % | 4 | %
Total | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

CatchMark Timber Trust conducts substantially all of its business through CatchMark Timber Operating Partnership, L.P. (“CatchMark Timber OP”), a Delaware limited partnership in which CatchMark Timber Trust is the general partner and owns, directly or indirectly, 99.77% of CatchMark Timber OP's Common Units. CatchMark Timber Trust conducts certain aspects of its business through CatchMark Timber TRS, Inc.

Current Timberland Holdings
As of December 31, 2021, we wholly owned interests in 369,700 acres of high-quality industrial timberlands located in the U.S. South, consisting of 14.6 million tons of merchantable timber inventory. Our timberlands have been intensively managed for sustainable commercial timber production and are located within attractive and desirable fiber baskets encompassing a diverse group of pulp, paper and wood products manufacturing facilities. 
In addition to our wholly-owned timber assets, as of December 31, 2021, we owned a 50% membership interest in the Dawsonville Bluffs Joint Venture, which owns two wetlands mitigation banks with an aggregate book basis of $2.0 million as of December 31, 2021. 
Please refer to Item 2 — Properties for more details on our timber and timberland properties.
Our Business and Growth Strategies
Our objective is to capture the highest value per acre from our prime timberlands and to generate sustainable yields through the ongoing implementation of the following business and growth strategies: 
Actively Manage Our Timberlands for Long-Term Results. We seek to maximize long-term returns by actively managing our timberlands to achieve an optimum balance among biological timber growth, current harvest cash flow, and responsible environmental stewardship. Further, we expect to continue making investments in forest technology, including improved seedlings, in order to increase the sustainable yield of our timberlands over the long-term. 
Maximize Profitability on Timber Sales. We actively manage our log merchandising efforts together with delivered and stumpage sales with the goal of achieving the highest available price for our timber products. We compete with other timberland owners on the basis of the quality of our logs, the prices of our logs, our reputation as a reliable supplier, and our ability to meet customer specifications. We will continue to work diligently and proactively with our third-party contractors with a view towards optimizing our logging, hauling, sorting, and merchandising operations to extract the maximum profitability from each of our logs based on the foregoing considerations. 
Pursue Attractive Timberland Acquisitions. We seek to identify and acquire high-quality industrial timberland properties, with our target deal size ranging from $5 million to $50 million. We currently focus on acquiring tracts to expand our presence in superior mill markets where we already have strong local relationships, seeking to strengthen our harvest EBITDA while maintaining stable merchantable inventory per acre. Our targets include a high allocation of pine plantations with strong site indices as well as above-average operability and fall into three categories:
•Near-term cash accretive acquisitions — higher yielding, more immediately harvestable properties with higher merchantable stocking levels and an older average age; 
•Portfolio accretive acquisitions — properties that help balance portfolio age class distribution and productivity and would likely consist of younger plantations that complement our long-term objectives; and
•Environmentally-focused income opportunities — centered around carbon sequestration, wetlands mitigation bank credits, and solar projects.
We expect our transaction pipeline to come from a variety of sources, including timber fund portfolio rebalancing and private owner liquidations. 
We may enter into fiber supply agreements with respect to acquired properties in order to ensure a steady source of demand for our incremental timber production. 
Opportunistically Sell Timberland Assets. We continuously assess potential alternative uses of our timberlands, as some of our properties may be more valuable for development, conservation, recreational or other purposes than for growing timber. We intend to capitalize on the value of our timberland portfolio by opportunistically monetizing timberland properties. When evaluating our land sale opportunities, we assess a full range of matters relating to the timberland property or properties, including, but not limited to:
•Inventory stocking below portfolio average;
•Predominantly hardwood merchantable inventory mix; and
•Poor productivity.
The close proximity of our existing timberlands to several major population centers provides us with opportunities to periodically sell parcels of our land at favorable valuations. We generally expect to sell approximately 2% to 3% of our fee timberland acreage on an annual basis pursuant to our land sales program, although such results may vary. We may also decide to pursue various land entitlements on certain properties in order to realize higher long-term values on such properties.
From time to time, we have also sold blocks of timberland properties under a capital recycling program in order to generate proceeds to fund capital allocation priorities, including, but not limited to, redeployment into more desirable timberland investments, paying down outstanding debt, or repurchasing shares of our common stock. Such large dispositions are not part of core operations, are infrequent in nature, and may or may not have a higher or better use than timber production or result in a price premium above the land’s timber production value. Timberland disposition opportunities under our capital recycling program have been evaluated based in part on inventory stocking and mix profiles, productivity characteristics, geographical diversification and procurement and operating areas. We currently have no plans to complete additional large dispositions under our capital recycling program.
Create Value Through the Economic Realization of Environmental Initiatives.  Our strategic investment opportunities also include the development of new value-creation opportunities such as carbon sequestration, wetlands mitigation banking, and solar projects. We are currently pursuing the development of a carbon program to enable us to turn our greenhouse gas emissions reductions and removals into verified carbon units that can be marketed and sold to third parties. Wetlands mitigation banking includes the creation and selling of mitigation credits on existing portfolio holdings and future timberland investments. Through the Dawsonville Bluffs Joint Venture, we own interests in two mitigation banks and we continue to evaluate opportunities to develop mitigation banks on our wholly-owned timberlands as well as through additional joint ventures. Solar projects include leasing or selling property to solar developers to help produce renewable energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Generate Additional Value Through Joint Ventures. From time to time, we seek to create additional value through institutional equity joint ventures to acquire, own, and manage timberland properties that meet our core investment strategy. We expect future joint venture investments to follow the model of the successful Dawsonville Bluffs Joint Venture – transactions with straightforward, pari passu capital structures where we control management and can earn asset management fees, including promotes for strong performance. The timberland properties acquired through the Dawsonville Bluffs Joint Venture fit our profile for high quality assets with HBU characteristics, which we were able to sell at significant profits. The wetlands mitigation banks acquired through the Dawsonville Bluffs Joint Venture exemplify our opportunities to generate significant value through various environmental initiatives on our existing and future timberland ownership. Additionally, we have established our investment management business by managing the day-to-day operations of such joint ventures and earning significant asset management fee income that has and can support our dividend and growth strategy. 
Practice Sound Environmental Stewardship. We remain committed to responsible environmental stewardship and sustainable forestry. Our wholly-owned timberlands have been third-party audited and certified in accordance with the 2015-2019 SFI standards (extended through December 2021). SFI standards promote sustainable forest management through recognized core principles, including measures to protect water quality, biodiversity, wildlife habitat and at-risk species. Our timberlands are further managed to meet or exceed all state regulations through the implementation of best management practices as well as internal policies designed to ensure compliance. Commencing in 2022, we will be subject to the new SFI 2022 standards, which provide additional focus on forest management activities that address climate change adaptation and mitigation measures as well as management of 
fire risk in the face of climate change. We believe our continued commitment to environmental stewardship will allow us to maintain our timberlands’ productivity, grow our customer base, and enhance our reputation as a preferred timber supplier. 
Financing Strategy
Our long-term financing strategy seeks to maximize balance sheet liquidity and operational flexibility for the purpose of generating current income and attractive long-term returns for our stockholders. We intend to employ prudent amounts of debt and equity financing as a means of providing additional funds for the selective acquisitions of timber assets, to refinance existing debt, or for general corporate purposes. In particular, we seek to maximize balance sheet liquidity and flexibility by:
•Maintaining sufficient liquidity through borrowing capacity under our credit facilities and cash-on-hand;
•Minimizing the amount of near-term debt maturities in a single year;
•Maintaining low to modest leverage; 
•Managing interest rate risk through an appropriate mix of fixed and variable rate debt instruments, either directly or using interest rate swaps, caps or other arrangements; and
•Maintaining access to diverse sources of capital.
We determine the amount of debt and equity financing to be used when acquiring an asset by evaluating terms available in the credit markets (such as interest rate, repayment provisions and maturity), our cost of equity capital, and our assessment of the particular asset’s risk. Historically, a significant portion of our debt has consisted of long-term borrowings secured by our timber assets. 
We anticipate that we will continue to use a number of different sources to finance our operations and selective acquisitions going forward, including cash from operations, proceeds from asset dispositions, funds available under bank credit facilities (which may or may not be secured by our assets), co-investments through partnerships or joint ventures, potential future issuances of common or preferred equity or partnership interests in our operating partnership, or any combination of these sources, to the extent available to us, or other sources that may become available from time to time. 
Transaction Activities
Our capital allocation priorities are to deliver quarterly dividends, maintain healthy liquidity and ample working and growth capital, execute on strategic acquisition and investment opportunities, and maintain a stable and attractive debt profile. Over the past three years, in order to position ourselves for further growth, we have focused on strengthening our balance sheet through deleveraging with proceeds from large dispositions completed under our capital recycling program. In October 2021, we exited the Triple T Joint Venture, using proceeds received to further pay down our outstanding debt. We did not acquire additional timberlands during 2021 and 2020 and acquired 900 acres in 2019. We completed the following transactions during the three years ended December 31, 2021:
Land Sales
During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, we sold 7,500 acres, 9,300 acres, and 9,200 acres of timberland, respectively, in the U.S. South. These land sales represented approximately 2.0%, 2.3%, and 2.2%, respectively, of our average fee timberland acreage (based on average quarterly fee timberland acreage) for each year. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, the disposed timberlands had an average merchantable timber stocking of 21, 26, and 37 tons per acre, respectively, as compared to 41, 42, and 43 tons per acre for our U.S. South portfolio at the beginning of each respective year.
Large Dispositions
During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, we completed large dispositions of 23,100 acres, 14,400 acres, and 14,400 acres of wholly-owned timberlands for $107.5 million, $21.3 million, and $25.4 million, respectively. Two large dispositions were completed in 2021 consisting of 5,000 acres sold in the U.S. South for $7.5 million and 18,100 acres sold in the Pacific Northwest for $100.0 million (the "Bandon Disposition"). We 
recognized gains of $0.8 million and $23.4 million, respectively, from these two large dispositions. Over the term of our ownership of the Bandon property from August 2018 to August 2021, we harvested 283,600 tons of timber and generated cumulative timber sales revenue of $26.0 million. Net proceeds of $102.7 million received from these large dispositions were used to pay down our outstanding debt. The large dispositions in the U.S. South had an average merchantable timber stocking of 24, 29, and 37 tons per acre, as compared to 41, 42, and 43 tons per acre for our U.S. South portfolio at the beginning of each respective year. 
Triple T Exit
On October 14, 2021, we entered into a recapitalization and redemption agreement with TexMark Timber Treasury, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “Triple T Joint Venture"), and the preferred limited partners of the Triple T Joint Venture for the redemption of our common equity interests in the Triple T Joint Venture in exchange for $35.0 million in cash (the “Triple T Exit”). The amended and restated asset management agreement between the Triple T Joint Venture and us was terminated and replaced by a transition services agreement, effective retroactively from September 1, 2021 through March 31, 2022, under which we provide transition services in exchange for a service fee of $5.0 million. We used the $40.0 million received to pay down our outstanding debt. The Triple T Exit is an important step in delivering on our long-term strategy and positions us for future growth.
Timber Agreements
Mahrt Timber Agreements
We are party to a master stumpage agreement and a fiber supply agreement (collectively, the “Mahrt Timber Agreements”) with a wholly-owned subsidiary of WestRock. The master stumpage agreement provides that we will sell specified amounts of timber and make available certain portions of our timberlands to CatchMark TRS for harvesting. The fiber supply agreement provides that WestRock will purchase a specified tonnage of timber from CatchMark TRS at specified prices per ton, depending upon the type of timber product. The prices for the timber purchased pursuant to the fiber supply agreement are negotiated every two years but are subject to quarterly market pricing adjustments based on an index published by TimberMart-South, a quarterly trade publication that reports raw forest product prices in 11 southern states. The initial term of the Mahrt Timber Agreements is October 9, 2007 through December 31, 2032, subject to extension and early termination provisions. The Mahrt Timber Agreements ensure a long-term source of supply of wood fiber products for WestRock in order to meet its paperboard and lumber production requirements at specified mills and provide us with a reliable consumer for the wood products from its timberlands. 
For the year ended December 31, 2021, WestRock purchased 367,600 tons under the Mahrt Timber Agreements. See Note 7 — Commitments and Contingencies to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the material terms of the Mahrt Timber Agreements. 
We derived approximately 11%, 11%, and 12% of our net timber sales revenue from the Mahrt Timber Agreements in each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. For 2022, WestRock is required to purchase, and we are required to make available for purchase to WestRock, at least 371,100 tons of timber under the Mahrt Timber Agreements. 
Carolinas Supply Agreement
We assumed a pulpwood supply agreement with IP (the "Carolinas Supply Agreement") in connection with a timberland acquisition completed in 2016. The Carolinas Supply Agreement is effective through November 3, 2026 and requires us to sell agreed-upon pulpwood volumes to IP and IP is required to purchase these volumes at defined market prices.
We sold 88,500 tons of timber under the Carolinas Supply Agreement in 2021. We derived approximately 3%, 2%, and 4% of our net timber sales revenue from the Carolinas Supply Agreement in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. For 2022, IP is required to purchase, and we are required to make available for purchase to IP, at least 50,000 tons of timber under the Carolinas Supply Agreement. 
Credit Risk of Customers
For the year ended December 31, 2021, our largest customer, WestRock, represented 16% of our total revenues. No other customer represented more than 10% of our total revenues. The loss of WestRock as a customer would have a material adverse effect on our operating results. We sold timber to 61 customers in 2021, compared to 74 in 2020 and 69 in 2019.
We are not aware of any reason why our current customers will not be able to pay their contractual amounts as they become due in all material respects. 
Competition 
We compete with various private and industrial timberland owners as well as governmental agencies that own or manage timberlands in the U.S. South. Due to transportation and delivery costs, pulp, paper and wood products manufacturing facilities typically purchase wood fiber within a 100-mile radius of their location, which thereby limits, to some degree, the number of significant competitors in any specific regional market. Factors affecting the level of competition in our industry include price, species, grade, quality, proximity to the mill customer, and our reliability and consistency as a supplier. Also, as we seek to acquire timberland assets, we are in competition for targeted timberland tracts with other similar timber investment companies, as well as investors in land for purposes other than growing timber. As a result, we may have to pay more for the timberland tracts to become the owner if another suitable tract cannot be substituted. When it becomes time to dispose of timberland tracts, we will again be in competition with sellers of similar tracts to locate suitable purchasers of timberland. We will face competition from other landowners and alternative products as we seek to create and monetize revenue-generating environmental solutions, including solar projects, carbon sequestration and wetlands mitigation banking. 
Seasonality
Our harvest operations are affected by seasonal weather conditions, where wet weather could reduce our harvest volume but boost prices due to limited supply, while dry weather could suppress prices due to increases in supply.
COVID-19 Pandemic
See Part II, Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the impact of COVID-19 on our business.
Regulatory Matters 
See Item 1A — Risk Factors, Risk Related to Our Business and Operations for discussions of regulatory matters, including environmental matters, that impact our business. 
Human Capital Management
As of December 31, 2021, we had 21 employees, all of whom were full-time and based in the United States. We care about our employees and recognize that they are key to our success. Our Compensation Committee has oversight for our policies and strategies regarding human capital management and has determined that the policies and strategies discussed below are important to our company’s performance.
Protection from Harassment, Discrimination and Retaliation. We believe that all individuals should be treated with dignity and respect, and have adopted a Human Rights Policy that, among other things, includes a No Harassment Policy that does not tolerate discriminatory harassment of any sort, including based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions, gender identity, sexual orientation, genetic information, citizenship status, service member status or any other characteristic protected by federal, state or local anti-discrimination laws. We also value and protect an employee's right to raise workplace issues without concern for retaliation. We believe our employee relations are good and we have policies and procedures in place to quickly address and remedy employee grievances and any workplace disputes.
Diversity and Inclusion. We value diversity in the workplace. As of December 31, 2021, 50% of our executive officers were women and 57% of our total number of employees were women. Approximately 24% of our workforce is comprised of individuals that identify as a member of an ethnic or racial minority group, including approximately 10% identifying as Asian, 10% identifying as Black and 5% identifying as Hispanic or Latino. 
Health and Safety. We are committed to providing and maintaining a safe and healthy workplace for all workers (including vendors, contractors, temporary employees and volunteers) as well as clients, visitors and members of the public. Risks and hazards to health and safety will be eliminated or minimized, as far as is reasonably practicable. We have adopted a Health and Safety Policy in furtherance of this commitment. During the year ended December 31, 2021, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we maintained safety protocols to protect our employees and others, including protocols regarding social distancing, health checks and working remotely. Our experienced teams continued to successfully manage our business during this challenging time. 
Benefits, Training and Professional Development. We provide high-quality benefits to our employees, including equity grants for all employees, healthcare and wellness initiatives, and a 401(k) plan with a generous company match, time-off for volunteering, a charitable matching program, and a scholarship program for children of non-executive employees. We also provide regular training and professional development opportunities for our employees. These include semi-annual, company-wide information security training programs, as well as personal coaching for all officers and executives, and opportunities to attend conferences and other events relevant to the timberland, forest products and REIT industries. During 2021, our employees participated in over 360 hours of training and education programs, or an average of approximately 16 hours per employee. 
Low Average Turnover Rate. We believe that all of our initiatives to make CatchMark an exceptional place to work have resulted in our low historic turnover rate, which averaged 9.7% annually over the past three years. In 2021, our turnover rate was 17.4%, which was higher than average due to the departure of four employees, three of whom had been dedicated to the Triple T Joint Venture, which CatchMark exited in October 2021. While the Company’s 2021 turnover rate was higher than its average, it was still well below the total turnover rate for the United States for 2020 of 57.3% and the turnover rate for financial activities for 2020 of 31.3%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
