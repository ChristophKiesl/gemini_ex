Item 1. Business.
Overview



Gushen, Inc., a Nevada corporation, (“we”, “us” or “the Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 9, 2015.



The Company was originally set up as a holding company operating through its wholly owned subsidiary, Gushen Holding Limited, to provide managerial and IT support to start-ups as well as SME (small and medium enterprises) in Hong Kong and Malaysia to assist them in their early stages of operations as they expand and grow their own company. On August 5, 2016, the Company acquired a Hong Kong company, Gushen Credit Limited, with a money lender license registered according to Cap163 Money Lenders Ordinance of Hong Kong. Due to the keen competition and high rental expense in Hong Kong, on April 27, 2017, the Company decided to dispose of the asset for a consideration of $105,000 and ceased the business in Hong Kong. Thereafter, the Company did not open for business or generate any revenue from November 2017 to March 2020, making it dormant.



On March 27, 2020, as a result of a custodianship in Clark County, Nevada, Custodian Ventures, LLC was appointed custodian of Gushen Inc. David Lazar, a private investor and managing member of Custodian Ventures, LLC (together with David Lazar, the “Custodian”), was appointed as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, President, Secretary, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors. The Custodian was tasked to solicit investment on behalf of the Company.



On December 9, 2020, the Company, Custodian, and certain investors (“Purchasers”) entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”), pursuant to which the Purchasers acquired 30 million shares of Series A preferred stock (the “Preferred A Shares”), each convertible into 10 shares of Common Stock, from Custodian for an aggregate purchase price of $525,000. In connection with the SPA, the Company, Custodian, and Gushen Holding Limited entered into a spin-off agreement, pursuant to which the Custodian acquired all issued and outstanding stock of Gushen Holdings Limited at a minimal purchase price of $1. Thereafter, the Company no longer retains any interest in Gushen Holding Limited.



On July 30, 2021, the Company and Dyckmanst Limited, a British Virgin Islands company (“Dyckmanst Limited”), and all shareholders of Dyckmanst Limited entered into a share exchange agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding equity securities of Dyckmanst Limited in exchange for 381,600,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Common Stock”) of the Company (the “Share Exchange”). Immediately prior to the closing of the Share Exchange, two existing holders of aggregated 30,000,000 shares of Series A preferred stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Preferred Stock”) delivered 29,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock to the Company for cancellation (“the “Cancellation of Certain Preferred Stock”), each Preferred Stock is convertible into 10 shares of Common Stock. As a result, shareholders of Dyckmanst Limited collectively control 90.72% voting power of the Company on as converted basis, with respect to all of the shares of common stock and preferred stock, voting as a single class, with each share of common stock entitles to 1 vote and each share of preferred stock entitles to 10 votes.



As a result of the Share exchange, the Company assumes the business of Dyckmanst Limited. Through certain overseas subsidiaries and contractual arrangements, the Company is able to consolidate the financial results of Beijing Zhuoxun Century Culture Communication Co., Ltd. (“Zhuoxun Beijing”) and its subsidiary in accordance with US GAAP as the primary beneficiary. Zhuoxun Beijing is a PRC company that provides family education resources to promote all-around education onsite in local communities organized by our regional collaborative education agency and offer parents easy access to a wide variety of courses online through our application.

Going Concern



The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business are dependent on, among other things, the Company’s ability to operate profitably, to generate cash flows from operations, and to pursue financing arrangements to support its working capital requirements.



In assessing the Company’s liquidity, the Company monitors and analyzes its cash and cash equivalents and its operating and capital expenditure commitments. The Company’s liquidity needs are to meet its working capital requirements, operating expenses and capital expenditure obligations. As of September 30, 2022, the Company’s current liabilities exceeded the current assets by $11,282,551, its accumulated deficit was $12,080,418 and the Company has incurred losses during the year ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. None of the Company’s stockholders, officers or directors, or third parties, are under any obligation to advance us funds, or to invest in us. Accordingly, we may not be able to obtain additional financing. If we are unable to raise additional capital, we may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily be limited to, curtailing operations, suspending the pursuit of our business plan, and reducing overhead expenses. We cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.



These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

Industry Focus



Zhuoxun Beijing’s primary business is in the family education industry, integrated with online and onsite classes, which it believes fulfills increasing needs for parents to enhance their family education. In China, many educational companies for students aged from 3 to 16 years old currently offer K-12 education and interest classes, emphasizing on helping students on their K-12 school study or providing professional courses to develop students’ after-class interest. Its family educational services offer well-designed courses for both parents and students, focusing on children’s all-around development and parenting methods, with a goal to enable effective and efficient communications among children and parents, to promote science-based parenting methods, and to assist with children’s full skill growth.



The PRC Family Education Promotion Law went into effect on January 1, 2022, setting forth specific regulatory requirements for the family education industry and clarifying that parents are the main body of responsibility for family education. To raise more awareness on the importance of family education and the health and growth of children, the law officially names the week of May 15 (the International Family Day) every year as the National Family Education Awareness Week. In April 2022, 11 departments including the Ministry of Education jointly issued the “Five-Year Plan on Guiding and Promoting Family Education (2021-2025)”, emphasizing the importance of uniting governmental and social forces to work together in the deliveries of family education.



These measures clarify the regulatory framework and signals government support for the development of the family education industry.



The Chinese family education industry has significant growth potential. At present, there are about 200 million preschool children and primary and secondary school students in China, and about 340 million parents (parents), 50% of whose families have spent an average of more than 10,000 RMB annually (or approximately 1,408 USD) on education. China’s home education market totaled 2 trillion RMB (or approximately 282 billion USD), with out-of-school education spending accounted for one-third of household expenditures (16.6% in rural areas; 42.2% in urban areas). Additionally, the country currently has 367 million people under the age of 18, accounting for 28% of the total population.



Recently, the PRC government continues to put more emphasis on the implementation of the “three-child” family planning policy, improved level of prenatal and postnatal care services, development in the nursery service system, and reduced cost of child care and education. In particular, within the 2 trillion RMB (or approximately 282 billion USD) national education service industry, which accounts for 2% of the annual GDP, the out-of-school training sector for primary and secondary school students accounts for 40% of the market opportunities. In addition, the industry continues to experience significant growth from the 10 million jobs that the industry current provides.



From 2021 to 2025, the average growth rate of the size of the out-of-school training market will remain stable at around 15%. It is estimated that by 2025, the size of China’s education market will reach 7.5 trillion RMB (or approximately 1,056 billion USD). It is expected that the market will continue to experience supply shortage in the next 30 years, furnishing new growth space for the family education service providers.

Customer Base

Seasonality



Seasonal fluctuations have traditionally affected, and may affect our business in the future, especially between school academic years and summer and winter holidays. Seasonal fluctuations affected our business when we focused on family education products and services for parents with children of school age in China, and may continue to affect our business as we shift to new business models. Due to our limited operating history and the fact that we are shifting our focus from family education to new business models and service offerings, the seasonal trends that we have experienced in the past may not be indicative of our future operating results.



However, due to COVID-19, the family education industry has encountered marketing difficulties. The traditional school year-summer/winter holiday and weekday-weekend distinctions have been disrupted, giving way to continuous school shutdowns and remote learning. These activities have impacted our course scheduling patterns and in-person marketing activities. We are moving away from traditional weekend- and holiday-based scheduling, and are balancing our in-person and online marketing and education initiatives. Our financial condition and results of operations for future periods may continue to fluctuate.

Family education industry is still at the early stage in China, where Zhuoxun Beijing believes there is no dominating company yet. Zhuoxun Beijing competes with a number of large and small companies, including integrated online virtue education platforms and onsite educational service companies.



Zhuoxun Beijing believes its ability to compete depends upon many factors both within and beyond its control, including the following:




● | high-quality and numbers of courses, meetings the needs of the parents with different aged children;

Government Regulations



Zhuoxun Beijing’s business is regulated by diverse and evolving laws and governmental authorities in China. It is subject to laws and regulations related to Internet communications, privacy, consumer protection, security and data protection, intellectual property rights, commerce, taxation, entertainment, recruiting and advertising. These laws and regulations are becoming more prevalent, and new laws and regulations are under consideration by the Chinese governments. Any failure by it to comply with existing laws and regulations may subject it to liabilities. New laws and regulations governing such matters could be enacted or amendments may be made to existing regulations at any time that could adversely impact our services. Plus, legal uncertainties surrounding Chinese government regulations could increase Zhuoxun Beijing’s costs of doing business, require it to revise its services, prevent it from delivering its services over the Internet or slow the growth of the Internet, any of which could materially adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.
Foreign Investment



On March 15, 2019, the National People’s Congress (“NPC”) approved the Foreign Investment Law of the PRC, or the Foreign Investment Law, which came into effect on January 1, 2020 and replaced the trio of existing laws regulating foreign investment in China, namely, the Sino-foreign Equity Joint Venture Enterprise Law, the Sino-foreign Cooperative Joint Venture Enterprise Law of the PRC and the Wholly Foreign-invested Enterprise Law of the PRC, together with their implementation rules and ancillary regulations. The organization form, organization and activities of foreign-invested enterprises shall be governed, among others, by the PRC Company Law and the PRC Partnership Enterprise Law. Foreign-invested enterprises established before the implementation of the Foreign Investment Law may retain the original business organization and so on within five years after the implementation of this Law.



The Foreign Investment Law is formulated to further expand opening-up, vigorously promote foreign investment and protect the legitimate rights and interests of foreign investors. According to the Foreign Investment Law, foreign investments are entitled to pre-entry national treatment and are subject to negative list management system. The pre-entry national treatment means that the treatment given to foreign investors and their investments at the stage of investment access shall not be less favorable than that of domestic investors and their investments. The negative list management system means that the state implements special administrative measures for access of foreign investment in specific fields. The Foreign Investment Law does not mention the relevant concept and regulatory regime of VIE structures. However, since it is relatively new, uncertainties still exist in relation to its interpretation and implementation.





10







Foreign investors’ investment, earnings and other legitimate rights and interests within the territory of China shall be protected in accordance with the law, and all national policies on supporting the development of enterprises shall equally apply to foreign-invested enterprises. Among others, the state guarantees that foreign-invested enterprises participate in the formulation of standards in an equal manner and that foreign-invested enterprises participate in government procurement activities through fair competition in accordance with the law. Further, the state shall not expropriate any foreign investment except under special circumstances. In special circumstances, the state may levy or expropriate the investment of foreign investors in accordance with the law for the needs of the public interest. The expropriation and requisition shall be conducted in accordance with legal procedures and timely and reasonable compensation shall be given. In carrying out business activities, foreign-invested enterprises shall comply with relevant provisions on labor protection.



On December 26, 2019, the State Council issued the Implementing Regulation of the Foreign Investment Law (the “Implementing Regulation”), which went into effect on January 1, 2020, delegating the authority to the Ministry of Commerce, or MOFCOM, and the National Development and Reform Commission, or the NDRC, the authority to determine the limitation of foreign investment activities in certain industries under a Foreign Investment Access Negative List. Further, it delegated the authority for registration and licensure of foreign invested businesses to the State Administration for Market Regulation, or SAMR. On August 4, 2020, the Beijing Municipal Market Regulatory Bureau and all of its district-level counterparts were authorized by the SAMR to directly oversee the registration and licensure of foreign invested businesses.



As indicated in the Implementing Regulation, investment activities in the PRC by foreign investors are principally governed by the Foreign Investment Access Negative List (the “Negative List”), which replaces its predecessor, the Guidance Catalog of Industries for Foreign Investment. The Negative List is promulgated and as amended from time to time by the MOFCOM and National Development and Reform Commission (the “NDRC”). In June 2020, the MOFCOM and the NDRC promulgated the Special Administrative Measures (Negative List) for Foreign Investment Access (2020 Version), or the Negative List, which became effective on July 23, 2020. In December 2021, the MOFCOM and the NDRC promulgated the Special Administrative Measures (Negative List) for Foreign Investment Access (2021 Version), which became effective on January 1, 2022. The 2021 version of the Negative list will replace the 2020 version of the Negative list. Industries listed in the Negative List are divided into two categories: restricted and prohibited. Industries not listed in the Negative List are generally deemed as constituting a third “permitted” category. Establishment of wholly foreign-owned enterprises is generally allowed in permitted industries. Some restricted industries are limited to equity or contractual joint ventures, while in some cases Chinese partners are required to hold the majority interests in such joint ventures. In addition, restricted category projects are subject to higher-level government approvals. Foreign investors are not allowed to invest in industries in the prohibited category. Industries not listed in the Negative List are generally open to foreign investment unless specifically restricted by other PRC regulations.



Pursuant to the 2021 Negative List, the business engaged by Zhuoxun Beijing and its subsidiary of Radio and TV program production fall within prohibited industries for foreign investors and can only be carried out by Zhuoxun Beijing.



In addition, the provision of value-added telecommunications services falls in the restricted category and, with a few exceptions, the percentage of foreign ownership cannot exceed 50%. However, according to the Notice of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) on Opening the Limitation of Foreign Shareholding Ratios in Online Data Processing and Transaction Processing Business (Business E-commerce), issued on June 19, 2015, foreign ownership of online data processing and transaction processing businesses (B21) can reach as high as 100%. Zhuoxun Beijing operates as a value-added, e-commerce knowledge service provider, and complies with the MIIT Notice. Zhuoxun Beijing also has acquired a value-added telecommunication service provider license to conduct online data processing and transaction processing business.

Value-added Telecommunications Services



Licenses for Value-Added Telecommunications Services



On September 25, 2000, the State Council issued the Regulations on Telecommunications of China, or the Telecommunications Regulations, to regulate telecommunications activities in China. The Telecommunications Regulations, revised on February 6, 2016, divide the telecommunications services into two categories, namely “infrastructure telecommunications services” and “value-added telecommunications services.” Pursuant to the Telecommunications Regulations, operators of value-added telecommunications services must first obtain a Value-added Telecommunications Business Operating License, or VTB License, from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, or MIIT, or its provincial level counterparts. On July 3, 2017, the MIIT promulgated the Administrative Measures on Telecommunications Business Operating Licenses, which set forth more specific provisions regarding the types of licenses required to operate value-added telecommunications services, the qualifications and procedures for obtaining such licenses and the administration and supervision of such licenses.



According to the Catalog of Classification of Telecommunications Businesses effective from April 1, 2003, internet information services, also called internet content services, or ICP services, are deemed as a type of value-added telecommunications services. On December 28, 2015, the MIIT published a revised Catalog of Classification of Telecommunication Businesses, or the 2016 MIIT Catalog, which took effect on March 1, 2016 and the 2016 MIIT Catalog was recently amended on June 6, 2019. According to the latest MIIT Catalog, internet information services, which include information release and delivery services, information search and query services, information community platform services, information real-times interactive services, and information protection and processing services, continues to be classified as a category of value-added telecommunication services. The Administrative Measures on Internet Information Services, or ICP Measures, also promulgated by the PRC State Council on September 25, 2000 and most recently amended on January 8, 2011, set forth more specific rules on the provision of ICP services. According to ICP Measures, any company that engages in the provision of commercial ICP services shall obtain a sub-category VTB License for Internet Information Services, or ICP License, from the relevant government authorities before providing any commercial internet content services within the PRC, and when the ICP services involve areas of news, publication, education, medical treatment, health, pharmaceuticals and medical equipment, and if required by law or relevant regulations, specific approval from the respective regulatory authorities must be obtained prior to applying for the ICP License from the MIIT or its provincial level counterpart. Pursuant to the above-mentioned regulations, “commercial ICP services” generally refers to provision of specific information content, online advertising, web page construction and other online application services through internet for profit making purpose.



Operating our online platform to provide information and services to our users is classified as commercial ICP services. Zhuoxun Beijing hold an ICP License, which is valid until March 13, 2024.



Foreign Investment in Value-Added Telecommunication Services



The Regulations on Administration of Foreign-Invested Telecommunications Enterprises, or the FITE Regulations, which took effect on January 1, 2002 and were amended on September 10, 2008 and February 6, 2016, respectively, are the key regulations that regulate foreign direct investment in telecommunications companies in China. The FITE Regulations stipulate that the foreign investor of a telecommunications enterprise is prohibited from holding more than 50% of the equity interest in a foreign-invested enterprise that provides value-added telecommunications services. In addition, for a foreign investor to acquire any equity interest in a business providing value-added telecommunications services in China, it must demonstrate a positive track record and experience in providing such services.





12







On July 13, 2006, the MIIT issued the Circular on Strengthening the Administration of Foreign Investment in Value-added Telecommunications Services, or the MIIT Circular 2006, which requires that (i) foreign investors can only operate a telecommunications business in China through establishing a telecommunications enterprise with a valid telecommunications business operation license; (ii) domestic license holders are prohibited from leasing, transferring or selling telecommunications business operation licenses to foreign investors in any form, or providing any resource, sites or facilities to foreign investors to facilitate the unlicensed operation of telecommunications business in China; (iii) value-added telecommunications services providers or their shareholders must directly own the domain names and registered trademarks they use in their daily operations; (iv) each value-added telecommunications services provider must have the necessary facilities for its approved business operations and maintain such facilities in the geographic regions covered by its license; and (v) all value-added telecommunications services providers should improve network and information security, enact relevant information safety administration regulations and set up emergency plans to ensure network and information safety. The provincial communications administration bureaus, as local authorities in charge of regulating telecommunications services, (i) are required to ensure that existing qualified value-added telecommunications service providers will conduct a self-assessment of their compliance with the MIIT Circular 2006 and submit status reports to the MIIT before November 1, 2006; and (ii) may revoke the value-added telecommunications business operation licenses of those that fail to comply with the above requirements or fail to rectify such non-compliance within specified time limits. Due to the lack of any additional interpretation from the regulatory authorities, it remains unclear what impact MIIT Circular 2006 will have on us or the other PRC internet companies with similar corporate and contractual structures. After the MOFCOM and NDRC amended the FIE Catalog in March 2015, MIIT also issued the Circular on Removing the Restrictions on Shareholding Ratio Held by Foreign Investors in Online Data Processing and Transaction Processing (Operating E-commerce) Business on June 19, 2015, which amended the relevant provision in FITE Regulations by allowing foreign investors to own more than 50% of the equity interest in an operator of e-commerce business. However, foreign investors continue to be prohibited from holding more than 50% of the equity interest in a provider of other category of value-added telecommunications services except for e-commerce, domestic multi-party communications, store-and-forward and call center. The aforementioned restrictions remain applicable pursuant to the Negative List. Based on the Notice regarding the Strengthening of Ongoing and Post Administration of Foreign Investment Telecommunications Enterprises issued by MIIT on October 15, 2020, the MIIT will not issue Examination Letter for Foreign Investment in Telecommunications Business. Still, foreign invested enterprises need to submit relevant foreign investment materials to MIIT for initial applications and changes of telecommunications operating permits.



To comply with the above-mentioned foreign ownership restrictions, all of the shareholders of Zhuoxun Beijing are PRC domestic residents, and Fengyuan Beijing, our PRC subsidiary, have entered into the VIE Agreements with Zhuoxun Beijing (together with Fengyun Beijing and Zhuoxin Beijing, the “PRC operating entities”) so that we are able to consolidate the financial results of Zhuoxun Beijing and its subsidiary in accordance with US GAAP as the primary beneficiary of the arrangements. Zhuoxun Beijing is the holders of the domain names, trademarks and facilities necessary for daily operations of our online platforms in compliance with the MIIT Circular 2006.



Internet Culture Activities



On February 17, 2011, the Ministry of Culture, or MOC, promulgated the Interim Administrative Provisions on Internet Culture, or the Internet Culture Provisions, which became effective on April 1, 2011 and amended on December 15, 2017. The Internet Culture Provisions require ICP services providers engaging in commercial “internet culture activities” to obtain an Internet Culture Business Operating License from the MOC. “Internet cultural activities” is defined in the Internet Culture Provisions as an act of provision of internet cultural products and related services, which includes (i) the production, duplication, importation, and broadcasting of the internet cultural products; (ii) the online dissemination whereby cultural products are posted on the internet or transmitted via the internet to end-users, such as computers, fixed-line telephones, mobile phones, television sets and games machines, for online users’ browsing, use or downloading; and (iii) the exhibition and comparison of the internet cultural products. In addition, “internet cultural products” is defined in the Internet Culture Provisions as cultural products produced, broadcast and disseminated via the Internet, which mainly include internet cultural products specially produced for the Internet, such as online music entertainment, online games, online shows and plays (programs), online performances, online works of art and online cartoons, and internet cultural products produced from cultural products such as music entertainment, games, shows and plays (programs), performances, works of art, and cartoons through certain techniques and duplicating those to internet for dissemination. On May 14, 2019, the Office of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism issued the Notice Regarding the Adjustment of the Approval Scope of “Internet Culture Business Operation License” and Further Standardizing the Approval Work, or the No.81 Notice, the scope of examination and approval of the “Internet Culture Business Operation License” includes network music, network performances (programs), network performances, network artwork, network animation and exhibitions, and competition activities. For units that do not meet the scope of approval to engage in other Internet business activities, the “Internet Culture Business Operation License” will not be issued.





13







Zhuoxun Beijing previously held an Internet Culture Business Operation License, which was valid until October 23, 2021, to conduct business involving internet music entertainment products and services. However, since Zhuoxun Beijing no longer conducts or intends to conduct any business involving such products or services, and it currently only operates in activities involving internet cultural communication, education consulting and e-commerce which are exempted from the application of the Internet Culture Business Operation License under the No. 81 Notice, Zhuoxun Beijing currently does not hold and is required to hold such license.



Television Program Industry



Television program productions and distribution businesses are mainly regulated by Regulations on Administration of Radio and Television, which came in to effect on August 11, 1997 and was recently amended on November 29, 2020, and the Administrative Regulations on Production and Operation of Radio and Television Program, which came into effect on August 20, 2004 and was recently amended on October 29, 2020. Pursuant to these regulations, television programs can only be produced by television stations at the municipal level or above or entities with a License for the Production and Operation of Radio and Television Program. Any entity producing and operating radio and television program without the License for the Production and Operation of Radio and Television Program will be subject to the confiscation of tools, equipment of producing radio and television program and a fine of more than 10 thousand RMB and less than 50 thousand RMB by competent local branch of SAPPRFT.



Zhuoxun Beijing holds a License for the Production and Operation of Radio and Television Program, which is valid until September 16, 2024. According to this license, the mode of operation is production and distribution, and the approved business scope includes animation, feature films, TV variety shows (current affairs news, similar topics or columns and other radio and TV programs are not allowed).



Online Audio-Visual Programs



The Measures for the Administration of Publication of Audio-Visual Programs through Internet or Other Information Network, or the Audio-Visual Measures, promulgated by the SAPPRFT, on July 6, 2004 and put into effect on October 11, 2004, apply to the activities relating to the opening, broadcasting, integration, transmission or download of audio-visual programs using internet or other information network. Under the Audio-Visual Measures, to engage in the business of transmitting audio-visual programs, a license issued by SAPPRFT is required, and “audio-visual programs (including audio-visual products of films and televisions)” are defined as the audio-visual programs consisting of movable pictures or sounds that can be listened to continuously, which are shot and recorded using video cameras, vidicons, recorders and other audio-visual equipment for producing programs. Foreign invested enterprises are not allowed to carry out such business. On April 13, 2005, the State Council promulgated the Certain Decisions on the Entry of the Non-state-owned Capital into the Cultural Industry. On July 6, 2005, five PRC governmental authorities, including the SAPPRFT, jointly adopted the Several Opinions on Canvassing Foreign Investment into the Cultural Sector. According to these regulations, non-state-owned capital and foreign investors are not allowed to engage in the business of transmitting audio-visual programs through information networks. However, the Audio-Visual Measures have been repealed according to the Administrative Provisions on Audio-Visual Program Service through Special Network and Directed Transmission that promulgated by the SAPPRFT on April 25, 2016, effective as of June 1, 2016 and last amended on March 23, 2021.





14







To further regulate the provision of audio-visual program services to the public via the internet, including through mobile networks, within the territory of the PRC, the SAPPRFT and the MIIT jointly promulgated the Administrative Provisions on Internet Audio-Visual Program Service, or the Audio-Visual Program Provisions, on December 20, 2007, which came into effect on January 31, 2008 and were amended on August 28, 2015. Under the Audio-Visual Program Provisions, “internet audio-visual program services” is defined as activities of producing, redacting and integrating audio-visual programs, providing them to the general public via internet, and providing services for other people to upload and transmit audio-visual programs, and providers of internet audio-visual program services are required to obtain a License for Online Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs issued by SAPPRFT, or complete certain registration procedures with SAPPRFT. In general, providers of internet audio-visual program services must be either state-owned or state-controlled entities, and the business to be carried out by such providers must satisfy the overall planning and guidance catalog for internet audio-visual program services determined by SAPPRFT. In a press conference jointly held by SAPPRFT and MIIT to answer questions relating to the Audio-Visual Program Provisions in February 2008, SAPPRFT and MIIT clarified that providers of internet audio-visual program services who engaged in such services prior to the promulgation of the Audio-Visual Program Provisions are eligible to re-register with the relevant authorities and continue their operation of internet audio-visual program services so long as those providers did not violate the relevant laws and regulations in the past. On May 21, 2008, SAPPRFT issued a Notice on Relevant Issues Concerning Application and Approval of License for the Online Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs, as amended on August 28, 2015, which further sets out detailed provisions concerning the application and approval process regarding the License for Online Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs. The notice also states that providers of internet audio-visual program services that engaged in such services prior to the promulgation of the Audio-Visual Program Provisions are eligible to apply for the license so long as their violation of the laws and regulations is minor in scope and can be rectified in a timely manner and they have no records of violation during the last three months prior to the promulgation of the Audio-Visual Program Provisions. Further, on March 30, 2009, SAPPRFT promulgated the Notice on Strengthening the Administration of the Content of Internet Audio-Visual Programs, which reiterates the pre-approval requirements for the audio-visual programs transmitted via the internet, including through mobile networks, where applicable, and prohibits certain types of internet audio-visual programs containing violence, pornography, gambling, terrorism, superstition or other similarly prohibited elements.



According to the Tentative Categories of Internet Audio-Visual Program Services, or the Categories, promulgated on March 17, 2010 and amended on March 10, 2017, there are four categories of internet audio-visual program services which are further divided into seventeen sub-categories. The third sub-category to the second category covers the making and editing of certain specialized audio-video programs concerning, among other things, educational content, and broadcasting such content to the general public online. However, there are still significant uncertainties relating to the interpretation and implementation of the Audio-Visual Program Provisions, in particular, the scope of “internet audio-video programs.”



At present, the licenses for online audio-visual program are mainly required for radio stations, TV station services, and current affairs audiovisual news services; as well as interviews, news reports, online dramas and such other forms of radio and television media programs available on the Internet. The main purpose of the license is to regulate and guide the dissemination of radio and television programs that affect public opinions. Beijing Zhuoxun’s programs are mainly knowledge-based content and does not involve content regulated by the regulations. In addition, under Section 8 of the Audio-Visual Program Provisions, only state-owned or state-controlled business may apply for the license. Zhuoxun Beijing is not a state-owned or state-controlled entity and as such cannot apply for such a license.



Accordingly, Beijing Zhuoxun does not need to apply for nor owns such license. However, if the government tightens control in the future, it may issue such new requirements for licensing and certifications, which may bring uncertainty to Beijing Zhuoxun’s business.

Cybersecurity



On November 7, 2016, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress (“SCNPC”) promulgated the Cybersecurity Law. The Cybersecurity Law regulates network operators and others from the following perspectives: the principle of cyberspace sovereignty, security obligations of network operators and providers of network products and services, protection of personal information, protection of critical information infrastructure, data use and cross-border transfers, network interoperability and standardization. Under the Cybersecurity Law, network operators are generally obligated to protect their networks against disruption, damage or unauthorized access, and to prevent data leakage, theft or tampering. In addition, network operators will also be subject to specific rules depending on their classification under the multi-level network security protection scheme. Providers of network products and services must comply with national standards and ensure the security of their products. Personal information and important data collected and generated by a critical information infrastructure operator in the course of its operations in China must be stored in China, and if a critical information infrastructure operator purchases internet products and services that affects or may affect national security, it should be subject to cybersecurity review by the Cyberspace Administration of China, or the CAC.



Measures for Cybersecurity Supervision, which became effective on June 1, 2020, provide more detailed rules relating to cyber security inspections. On July 10, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China (“CAC”) publicly issued the Measures for Cybersecurity Censorship (Revised Draft for Comments) aiming to, upon its enactment, replace the existing Measures for Cybersecurity Censorship. The draft measures extend the scope of cybersecurity reviews to data processing operators engaging in data processing activities that affect or may affect national security, including listing in a foreign country. There still exists uncertainty how the enacted version would have any substantial changes from this draft and whether clearance of cybersecurity review and other specific actions shall be completed by companies like us.



On June 14, 2022, the CAC promulgated the Administrative Provisions on Mobile Internet Applications Information Services, or the APP Provisions, which became effective on August 1, 2022. The APP Provisions replaced the former Administrative Provisions on Mobile Internet Applications Information Services promulgated on June 28, 2016. Under the APP Provisions, mobile application providers are prohibited from engaging in any activity that may endanger national security, disturb the social order, or infringe the legal rights of third parties. The APP Provisions also require application providers to procure approval of the relevant competent departments or the relevant licenses required by laws and regulations to provide services through such applications.



On June 10, 2021, the SCNPC promulgated the Data Security Law of the PRC, or the Data Security Law, which will come into effect on September 1, 2021. The Data Security Law provides for data security and privacy obligations on entities and individuals engaged in data activities. The Data Security Law also introduces a data classification and hierarchical protection system based on the importance of data in economic and social development, as well as the degree of harm it may cause to national security, public interests, or legitimate rights and interests of individuals or organizations when such data is tampered with, destroyed, leaked, or illegally acquired or used. The appropriate level of protection measures is required for each category of data. For example, a processor of important data must have designated personnel and internal supervision body responsible for data security, carry out risk assessments for data processing activities and file the risk assessment reports with the competent government authorities. In addition, the Data Security Law provides a national security review procedure for data activities which may affect national security and imposes export restrictions on certain data and information.



The Cybersecurity Review Measures, or the “Review Measures”, which were promulgated on April 13, 2020, and were amended on December 28, 2021 and became effective on February 15, 2022, provide online platform operator holding more than one million users/users’ individual information shall be subject to cybersecurity review before listing abroad. Cybersecurity Review Measures do not provide a definition of “online platform operator”, therefore, we cannot assure you that the VIE and its subsidiary will not be deemed as an “online platform operator”. On November 14, 2021, the CAC promulgated the Data Security Management Regulations Draft to solicit public opinion and comments, which provides that an overseas initial public offering to be conducted by a data processor processing the personal information of more than one million individuals shall apply for a cybersecurity review. Data processor means an individual or organization that independently make decisions on the purpose and manner of processing in data processing activities.





16







We may be deemed as a data processor under the Data Security Management Regulations Draft. Notwithstanding the foregoing, even if we are deemed as an online platform operator under the Cybersecurity Review Measures or a data processor under the Data Security Management Regulations Draft, we do not expect to be subject to the cybersecurity review in connection with our status as a U.S. company, because the VIE and its subsidiary do not hold more than one million users’ individual information.



The Cybersecurity Review Measures also provide that if a critical information infrastructure operator (“CIIO”) purchases internet products and services that affect or may affect national security, it should be subject to cybersecurity review by the CAC. Due to the lack of further interpretations, the exact scope of what constitutes a “CIIO” remains unclear. We do not expect to be a CIIO, since (i) we do not hold a large amount of individual information, and (ii) data processed in our business is less likely to have a bearing on national security, thus it may not be classified as core or important data by the authorities. As of the date of this Annual Report, we have not received any notice from any authorities identifying us as a CIIO or requiring us to undertake a cybersecurity review by the CAC. Further, as of the date of this Annual Report, we have not been subject to any penalties, fines, suspensions, or investigations from any competent authorities for violation of the regulations or policies that have been issued by the CAC.



Privacy Protection



The PRC Constitution states that PRC law protects the freedom and privacy of communications of citizens and prohibits infringement of these rights. In recent years, PRC government authorities have enacted laws and regulations on internet use to protect personal information from any unauthorized disclosure. According to the Law on the Protection of Consumer Rights and Interests promulgated in 1993 and last amended in 2013, business operators shall collect and use the personal information of consumers in a lawful and proper manner by following the principle that information collection or use is genuinely necessary. They shall expressly state the purposes, methods and scope of information collection or use, and obtain the consent of the consumers whose information is to be collected. To collect or use the personal information of consumers, business operators shall disclose their information collection or use rules, and shall not collect or use information in violation of laws or regulations, or in breach of the agreements between the parties concerned. Business operators and their staff members shall strictly keep confidential the personal information of consumers collected, and shall not divulge, sell or illegally provide others with the same. According to the PRC Cybersecurity Law promulgated On November 7, 2016 and became effective from June 1, 2017, network operators shall strictly keep confidential users’ personal information that they have collected, and establish and improve the users’ information protection system. To collect and use personal information, network operators shall follow the principles of legitimacy, rightfulness and necessity, disclose their rules of data collection and use, clearly express the purposes, means and scope of collecting and using the information, and obtain the consent of the persons whose data is gathered. Pursuant to the Decision on Strengthening the Protection of Online Information issued by the SCNPC on December 28, 2012 and the Order for the Protection of Telecommunication and Internet User Personal Information issued by the MIIT in July 16, 2013, any collection and use of user personal information must be subject to the consent of the user, abide by the principles of legality, rationality and necessity and be within the specified purposes, methods and scopes. “Personal information” is defined in these regulations as information that identifies a citizen, the time or location for his/her use of telecommunication and internet services, or involves privacy of any citizen such as his birth date, ID card number, and address. An ICP service provider must also keep information collected strictly confidential, and is further prohibited from divulging, tampering or destroying of any such information, or selling or providing such information to other parties. Any violation of the above decision or order may subject the ICP service provider to warnings, fines, confiscation of illegal gains, revocation of licenses, cancellation of filings, closedown of websites or even criminal liabilities. Pursuant to the Ninth Amendment to the Criminal Law issued by the SCNPC in August 2015, which became effective in November 2015, any internet service provider that fails to fulfill the obligations related to internet information security administration as required by applicable laws and refuses to rectify upon orders, shall be subject to criminal penalty for the result of (i) any dissemination of illegal information in large scale; (ii) any severe effect due to the leakage of the client’s information; (iii) any serious loss of criminal evidence; or (iv) other severe situation, and any individual or entity that (i) sells or provides personal information to others in a way violating the applicable law, or (ii) steals or illegally obtains any personal information, shall be subject to criminal penalty in severe situation. According to the Interpretation of the Supreme People’s Court and the Supreme People’s Procuratorate on Several Issues Concerning the Application of Law in Handling Criminal Cases of Infringing Personal Information of Citizens promulgated on May 8, 2017 and became effective from June 1, 2017, if a business operator collects personal information of citizens by purchasing, accepting or exchanging, or collects personal information of citizens in the course of performing their duties and providing services in violation of relevant provisions of the State (including Law on the Protection of Consumer Rights and Interests) and meet one of the following standards, such operator shall be considered breaching criminal law and such operator and its responsible personnel shall undertake the criminal liabilities: (i) illegal acquisition, sale or provision of more than 50 pieces of track information, communication content, credit information, property information; (ii) illegal acquisition, sale, or provision of more than 500 pieces of accommodation information, communication records, health, physiological information, trading information, and other personal information may affect the safety of personal and property; (iii) illegal acquisition, sale, or provision of more than 5000 pieces of personal information other than the information mentioned in the preceding (i) and (ii); (iv) the profits generated from using the illegally collected and acquired personal information is more than fifty thousand RMB; and (v) resale of the personal information collected in the course of performing their duties and providing service and the amount of resold personal information reaches 50% of the prescribed standard mentioned in (i) or (ii), as applicable.

The Private Education Law and the Amended PE Implementation Rules provide rules for social organizations or individuals, other than state-owned entities, to establish schools or other educational organizations using non-government funds in PRC, such schools or educational organizations established using non-government funds are referred to as “private school.”



According to the Private Education Law, establishment of private schools for academic education, pre-school education, self-taught examination support and other cultural education shall be subject to approval by the authorities in charge of education, while establishment of private schools for vocational qualification training and vocational skill training shall be subject to approvals from the authorities in charge of labor and social welfare, A duly approved private school will be granted a private school operating permit, and shall be registered as a legal person at the competent registration authorities. Sponsors of private schools may set up, at their sole discretion, non-profit or commercial private schools. Nonetheless, sponsors may not establish commercial private schools providing compulsory education.



According to the Amended PE Implementation Rules, social organizations and individuals are prohibited from controlling a private school that provides compulsory education or a non-profit private school that provides pre-school education through mergers and acquisitions and control agreements. A private school providing compulsory education is prohibited from conducting transactions with its related party. Relevant government authorities shall enhance the supervision on the agreements entered into between non-profit private schools and its related party and shall review such transaction on an annual basis; online education activities using internet technology are encouraged by the regulatory authorities and shall comply with laws and regulations related to internet management. A private school engaging in online education activities using internet technology shall obtain the relevant private school operating permit. It shall also establish and implement internet security management systems and take technical security measures. Upon discovery of any information whose release or transmission is prohibited by applicable laws or regulations, the private school shall immediately cease the transmission of that information and take further remedial actions, such as deleting that information, to prevent it from spreading. Records pertaining to the situation shall be kept and reported to the appropriate authorities.



Under the Private Education Law and Amended PE Implementation Rules, private education is deemed as a public welfare undertaking, and entities and individuals who establish private schools are commonly referred to as “sponsors” instead of “investors” or “shareholders.” Sponsors of non-profit private schools may not obtain proceeds from running the schools, and all school-running balances shall be used for running schools. Sponsors of commercial private schools may obtain proceeds from running the schools, and the school-running balances shall be disposed of in accordance with the provisions of the Company Law and other relevant laws and administrative regulations. Private schools shall enjoy property rights of the legal persons in respect of the assets provided by sponsors to private schools, state-owned assets, donated property and school accumulation.

The specific charging measures for non-profit private schools shall be developed by the relevant governments, while the charging standards for commercial private schools shall be subject to market regulation and determined by the schools at their sole discretion.

Regulations Relating to Online Commercial Private Training



Under the Private Education Law, private education institutions will be classified as either “non-profit private schools” or “commercial private schools”, and both nonprofit private schools and commercial private schools are required to obtain a private school operating permit prior to its registration with applicable registry agency as legal entities. Pursuant to the Implementation Rules for the Classification Registration of Private Schools jointly issued by the Ministry of Education, or the MOE, and several other government authorities on December 30, 2016, a commercial private school shall first obtain a private school operating permit prior to its registration with the SAMR or its local counterparts. Pursuant to the Implementation Rules for the Supervision and Administration of Commercial Private Schools jointly issues by the MOE, the SAIC and Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security on December 30, 2016, commercial private training institutions shall also be treated by reference to the requirements applicable to commercial private schools. Therefore, we may be required to apply for a private school operating permit and may be prohibited from continuing operating our English training business before obtaining the said permit.



According to the Amended PE Implementation Rules, a private school providing online education for academic qualifications by using Internet technology shall obtain the school operating permit that shall be obtained for education for academic qualifications at the same level and of the same type, as well as the Internet operating license. A private school carrying out online training and education activities and occupational qualification training and occupational skills training activities by using Internet technology, or an Internet technology service platform providing services for the aforementioned online activities, shall obtain the corresponding Internet operating license, and shall apply to the educational administrative department and human resources and social security department of the people’s government at the provincial level at the place where it is located for record-filing, and shall not carry out the education and teaching activities for which a school operating permit shall be obtained.



On January 2, 2018, Beijing Municipal Education Commission promulgated Several Opinions on Strengthening the Administration of Private Non-degree Education Institutions in Beijing, where the VIE and its subsidiary are incorporated, providing that private training institutions carrying out non-academic qualifications educations without obtaining required school operating permit shall be handled in accordance with the Private Education Law, and the total amount of newly established private non-academic qualifications training institutions shall be limited.



According to Online After-School Training Opinions, online after-school training institutions shall file with the competent provincial education regulatory authorities, see “Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business Overview—Government Regulations—Private Education—Regulations Relating to After-School Tutoring”. Furthermore, specific administration measures regarding the institutions offering training service only via internet have been promulgated by the above-mentioned local government in Beijing as of this annual report. On October 8, 2019, the Municipal Education Commissions of Beijing promulgated Rules of Beijing Municipality for the Implementation of Online After-school Training Filing, providing specific administrative measures for institutions offering after-school training service only via internet to put on record.



However, given that a pure online commercial training institution like us does not have any school premises, which are generally required in the process of applying for the private school operating permit pursuant to the currently effectively Private Education Law and its relevant implementation rules, we would not be able to obtain the private school operating permit had we applied for it. The Amended PE Implementation Rules stimulates that a private school providing online education for academic qualifications by using internet technology shall obtain the private school operating permit. However, after consulting with the local competent governmental authorities, we were advised that any institution offering training service on academic subjects shall obtain the private school operating permit which in practice would not be issued to such institutions after the end of 2021, and that prior to any specific rules on online commercial private training, they will not grant private school operating permits to the institutions offering training service on non-academic subjects only via internet like us or request such institutions to hold such permits.

Capital account items, such as direct equity investments, loans and repatriation of investment, unless expressly exempted by laws and regulations, still require prior approval from SAFE, its local counterparts or designated banks for conversion of RMB into a foreign currency, such as U.S. dollars, and remittance of the foreign currency outside of the PRC. Payments for transactions that take place within the PRC must be made in RMB. Foreign currency revenues received by PRC companies may be repatriated into China or retained outside of China in accordance with requirements and terms specified by SAFE.
Dividend Distribution



Pursuant the FIL, foreign investors may, according to the present law, freely remit into or out of China, in RMB or any other foreign currency, their capital contributions, profits, capital gains, income from asset disposal, intellectual property royalties, lawfully acquired compensation, indemnity or liquidation income and so on within the territory of China. In addition, pursuant to the Company Law of PRC, a foreign invested enterprise in China is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profit based on PRC accounting standards each year to its general reserves until its cumulative total reserve funds reach 50% of its registered capital. These reserve funds, however, may not be distributed as cash dividends.
Foreign Exchange Registration of Overseas Investment by PRC Residents



SAFE Circular on Relevant Issues Relating to Domestic Resident’s Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment through Special Purpose Vehicles, or Circular 37, issued by SAFE and effective in July 4, 2014, regulates foreign exchange matters in relation to the use of special purpose vehicles, or SPVs, by PRC residents or entities to seek offshore investment and financing and conduct round trip investment in China. Under Circular 37, a SPV refers to an offshore entity established or controlled, directly or indirectly, by PRC residents or entities for the purpose of seeking offshore financing or making offshore investment, using legitimate domestic or offshore assets or interests, while “round trip investment” refers to the direct investment in China by PRC residents or entities through SPVs, namely, establishing foreign-invested enterprises to obtain the ownership, control rights and management rights. Circular 37 requires that, before making contribution into an SPV, PRC residents or entities are required to complete foreign exchange registration with the SAFE or its local branch. SAFE Circular 37 further provides that option or share-based incentive tool holders of a non-listed SPV can exercise the options or share incentive tools to become a shareholder of such non-listed SPV, subject to registration with SAFE or its local branch.





26







PRC residents or entities who have contributed legitimate domestic or offshore interests or assets to SPVs but have yet to obtain SAFE registration before the implementation of Circular 37 shall register their ownership interests or control in such SPVs with SAFE or its local branch. An amendment to the registration is required if there is a material change in the SPV registered, such as any change of basic information (including change of such PRC residents, name and operation term), increases or decreases in investment amount, transfers or exchanges of shares, or mergers or divisions. Failure to comply with the registration procedures set forth in Circular 37, or making misrepresentation on or failure to disclose controllers of foreign-invested enterprise that is established through round-trip investment, may result in restrictions on the foreign exchange activities of the relevant foreign-invested enterprises, including payment of dividends and other distributions, such as proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation, to its offshore parent or affiliate, and the capital inflow from the offshore parent, and may also subject relevant PRC residents or entities to penalties under PRC foreign exchange administration regulations. On February 13, 2015, SAFE further promulgated the Circular on Further Simplifying and Improving the Administration of the Foreign Exchange Concerning Direct Investment, or SAFE Circular 13, which took effect on June 1, 2015 and partially abolished on December 30, 2019. This SAFE Circular 13 has amended SAFE Circular 37 by requiring PRC residents or entities to register with qualified banks rather than SAFE or its local branch in connection with their establishment or control of an offshore entity established for the purpose of overseas investment or financing.



Loans to and Direct Investment in the PRC Entities by Offshore Holding Companies



We are permitted under PRC laws and regulations as an offshore holding company to provide funding to the PRC operating entities through loans or capital contributions, subject to satisfaction of applicable government registration, approval and filing requirements.



In the event of subsequent changes in the capital of the FIE such as increase in capital, such FIE shall complete change registration formalities with competent administrations for market regulation, and change reporting formalities with competent administrations for commerce in accordance with relevant regulations, and registration change formalities shall also be completed with the competent administration of foreign exchange according to the Provisions on Foreign Exchange Control on Direct Investments in China by Foreign Investors.



Pursuant to the Provisional Measures on Administration of Foreign Debt or the Foreign Debt Measures, issued by the State Development Planning Commission (now the NDRC), Ministry of Finance and SAFE on January 8, 2003 and became effective on March 1, 2003, any loans provided by us to PRC operating entities in foreign currencies shall be classified as foreign debt under the Foreign Debt Measures. According to the Foreign Debt Measures, the sum of cumulative accrued amounts of medium-term to long-term foreign loans and balance amounts of short-term foreign loans taken by a foreign investment enterprise shall be limited to the difference between the total project investment amount approved by the government and the amount of registered capital. Foreign investment enterprises may take foreign loans freely within the scope of difference.



On January 12, 2017, the PBOC issued the Notice of People’s Bank of China on Matters Concerning Macro-prudential Management on All-round Cross-border Financing or the No.9 Notice, which improved the policy framework of the cross-border financing. The No.9 Notice clarifies the new calculation methods of the upper limit of the risk-weighted balance for all types of cross-border financing, in particular, the upper limit for risk-weighted balance for cross-border financing equals to the capital or the net assets multiplied by the leverage rate of cross-border financing and the macro-prudential adjustment parameters. In the case of PRC operating entities, the capital or the net assets is calculated at the net assets of each subsidiary, the leverage rate for cross-border financing for an enterprise is 2, and the macro-prudential adjustment parameter is 1 (the “All-Round Mode”). On March 11, 2020, the PBOC and SAFE promulgated the Circular on Adjusting the Macro-prudential Regulation Parameter for Full-covered Cross-border Financing, which provides that based on the current macro economy and international balance of payments, the macro-prudential regulation parameter as set forth in the Notice 9 is updated from 1 to 1.25. On January 7, 2021, the PBOC and SAFE issued a new circular which adjusted the macro-prudential regulation parameter from 1.25 to 1. Currently, the implementation of the foregoing methodologies in cross-border financing have not been formally determined by the PBOC and the SAFE. In the practice, it is still uncertain whether FIEs shall apply the Investment Difference Mode or the All-round Mode. Based on the current registered capital and total project investment amount, if we would provide funding to PRC operating entities through loans and use the Investment Difference Mode, PRC operating entities will be required to increase its registered capital and total project investment amount. Alternatively, if we choose to use the All-Round Mode, the amount of loans we can make to PRC operating entities as calculated according to the foregoing macro-prudential regulation parameter will not be more than 2 times of the net assets of such entities.





27







Moreover, as the debtors of cross-border financing, the PRC operating entities are also required to comply with certain registration formalities for execution of foreign debt contracts with the foreign exchange bureau at the locality within fifteen working days after signing the contracts according to the Notice of State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Promulgation of the Administrative Measures on Registration of Foreign Debt which was promulgated by the SAFE on April 48, 2013 and revised in May 2015.



Pursuant to the Circular of the National Development and Reform Commission on Promoting the Administrative Reform of the Record-filing and Registration System for the Issuance of Foreign Debts by Enterprises promulgated on September 14, 2015, or the Circular 2044, before the issuance of foreign debts, enterprises shall first apply to the National Development and Reform Commission for the handling of the record-filing and registration procedures and shall report the information on the issuance to NDRC within 10 working days of completion of each issuance. The term “foreign debts” shall mean yuan-denominated or foreign currency-denominated debt instruments with a maturity of one year or above which are issued overseas by domestic enterprises and their controlled overseas enterprises or branches and for which the principal and interest are repaid as agreed, including bonds issued overseas and long- and medium-term international commercial loans, etc. In February 2020, the NDRC circulated the Guide to the Registration of Foreign Debt Issued by Enterprises on its official website, according to which, domestic companies (and their controlled overseas companies or branches) who borrowed from foreign companies (including overseas shareholders) for more than one year need to apply to the NPRC.



PRC Enterprise Income Tax



On January 1, 2008, the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, or PRC EIT Law, took effect. The PRC EIT Law applies a uniform 25% enterprise income tax rate to both foreign-invested enterprises and domestic enterprises, except where tax incentives are granted to special industries and projects. Enterprises qualified as “High and New Technology Enterprises” are entitled to a 15% enterprise income tax rate rather than the 25% uniform statutory tax rate. The preferential tax treatment continues as long as an enterprise can retain its “High and New Technology Enterprise” status. Under the PRC EIT Law and its implementation regulations, dividends generated from the business of a PRC subsidiary after January 1, 2008 and payable to its foreign investor may be subject to a withholding tax rate of 10% if the PRC tax authorities determine that the foreign investor is a non-resident enterprise, unless there is a tax treaty with China that provides for a preferential withholding tax rate. Distributions of earnings generated before January 1, 2008 are exempt from PRC withholding tax.



Under the PRC EIT Law, an enterprise established outside China with “de facto management bodies” within China is considered a “resident enterprise” for PRC enterprise income tax purposes and is generally subject to a uniform 25% enterprise income tax rate on its worldwide income. A circular issued by the State Administration of Taxation in April 2009 regarding the standards used to classify certain Chinese-invested enterprises controlled by Chinese enterprises or Chinese enterprise groups and established outside of China as “resident enterprises” clarified that dividends and other income paid by such PRC “resident enterprises” will be considered PRC-source income and subject to PRC withholding tax, currently at a rate of 10%, when paid to non-PRC enterprise shareholders. This circular also subjects such PRC “resident enterprises” to various reporting requirements with the PRC tax authorities. Under the implementation regulations to the PRC EIT Law, a “de facto management body” is defined as a body that has material and overall management and control over the manufacturing and business operations, personnel and human resources, finances and properties of an enterprise. In addition, the tax circular mentioned above specifies that certain PRC-invested overseas enterprises controlled by a Chinese enterprise or a Chinese enterprise group in the PRC will be classified as PRC resident enterprises if the following are located or resided in the PRC: (i) senior management personnel and departments that are responsible for daily production, operation and management; (ii) financial and personnel decision making bodies; (iii) key properties, accounting books, the company seal, and minutes of board meetings and shareholders’ meetings; and (iv) half or more of the senior management or directors who have the voting rights.

PRC Value-added Tax (“VAT”)



Pursuant to the Provisional Regulations on Business Tax which was promulgated by the State Council in December 1993 and revised in November 2008, organizations and individuals engaging in provision of labor services stipulated in these regulations, transfer of intangible assets or sale of immovables in China shall be taxpayers of business tax and shall pay business tax and the applicable business rate for service industry is 5%. The Provisional Regulations on Business Tax was abolished in November 2017. In accordance with Circular on Comprehensively Promoting the Pilot Program of the Collection of Value-added Tax in Lieu of Business Tax (Caishui [2016] No. 36), which was promulgated on March 23, 2016 and came into effect on May 1, 2016 and has been partially abolished, upon approval of the State Council, the pilot program of the collection of value-added tax (the “VAT”) in lieu of business tax shall be promoted nationwide in a comprehensive manner starting from May 1, 2016, and all business tax payers engaged in the building industry, the real estate industry, the financial industry and the life service industry shall be included in the scope of the pilot program with regard to payment of value-added tax instead of business tax. For educational service income, the application VAT tax rate is 6% unless otherwise provided by the circular.



According to Provisional Regulations on Value-added Tax of the PRC or the VAT Regulations, which was promulgated by the State Council on December 13, 1993, came into effect on January 1, 1994, and was amended on November 10, 2008, February 6, 2016 and November 19, 2017, and The Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Provisional Regulations of the People’s Republic of China on Value-added Tax (Revised in 2011), which was promulgated by the Ministry of Finance and was last amended on October 28, 2011 and came into effect on November 1, 2011, organizations and individuals engaging in sale of goods or processing, repair and assembly services, sale of services, intangible assets, immovables and importation of goods in the PRC shall be taxpayers of VAT, and shall pay VAT pursuant to these Regulations. The amount of VAT payable is calculated as “output VAT” minus “input VAT.” Pursuant to the VAT Regulations, the rate of VAT is 17% for those engaging in the sale of goods or labor services or tangible personal property leasing services or importation of goods except as otherwise provided by the VAT Regulations. The tax rate of VAT is 11% for the sales of the service of transportation, posting, basic telecommunications, construction and leasing real estate, the sale of real estate and the transfer of land use right, or sell or import the goods listed in the VAT Regulations.



On April 4, 2018, MOF and SAT jointly promulgated the Circular of the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation on Adjustment of Value-Added Tax Rates, or Circular 32, according to which for VAT taxable sales acts or importation of goods originally subject to value-added tax rates of 17% and 11% respectively, such tax rates shall be adjusted to 16% and 10%, respectively. Circular 32 became effective on May 1, 2018 and shall supersede existing provisions which are inconsistent with Circular 32. On March 20, 2019, MOF, SAT and GAC jointly promulgated the Announcement on Policies for Deepening the VAT Reform, or Circular 39, according to which for general VAT payers’ sales activities or imports that are subject to VAT at an existing applicable rate of 16% or 10%, the applicable VAT rate is adjusted to 13% or 9% respectively. This Announcement came into force on April 1, 2019.



Dividend Withholding Tax



Pursuant to the Arrangement Between the Mainland of China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Tax on Income or the Double Tax Avoidance Arrangement, and other applicable mainland Chinese laws, if a Hong Kong resident enterprise is determined by the competent tax authority in mainland China to have satisfied the relevant conditions and requirements under such Double Tax Avoidance Arrangement and other applicable laws, the 10% withholding tax on the dividends the Hong Kong resident enterprise receives from a mainland China resident enterprise may be reduced to 5% upon receiving approval from in-charge tax authority. However, based on the Notice on Certain Issues with Respect to the Enforcement of Dividend Provisions in Tax Treaties, or the Notice No. 81, issued on February 20, 2009 by the SAT, if the relevant Chinese tax authorities determine, in their discretion, that a company benefits from such reduced income tax rate due to a structure or arrangement that is primarily tax-driven, such Chinese tax authorities may adjust the preferential tax treatment. Based on Notice of the State Administration of Taxation on How to Understand and Determine the “Beneficial Owners” in Tax Agreements, or the Notice No. 601, issued on October 27, 2009 by the SAT, conduit companies, which are established for the purpose of evading or reducing tax, or transferring or accumulating profits, shall not be recognized as beneficial owners and thus are not entitled to the above-mentioned reduced income tax rate of 5% under the Double Tax Avoidance Arrangement. On February 3, 2018, the SAT issued the Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation on Issues Relating to “Beneficial Owner” in Tax Treaties, or the Circular 9, which became effective on April 1, 2018 and the Notice 601 was repealed simultaneously. The Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation on Issues Relating to “Beneficial Owner” in Tax Treaties stipulates issues relating to determination of “beneficial owner” status in clauses of tax treaties on dividends, interest and royalties.



Accordingly, Edeshler HK may be able to benefit from the 5% withholding tax rate for the dividends it receives from Fengyuan Beijing, if it satisfies the conditions prescribed under the Notice No. 81 and other relevant tax rules and regulations. However, if the relevant tax authorities consider the transactions or arrangements we have are for the primary purpose of enjoying a favorable tax treatment, the relevant tax authorities may adjust the favorable withholding tax in the future.

Employment and Social Insurance



We are subject to laws and regulations governing our relationship with our employees, including wage and hour requirements, working and safety conditions, and social insurance, housing funds and other welfare. The compliance with these laws and regulations may require substantial resources.



Pursuant to the PRC Labor Law effective from January 1, 1995 (as amended on December 29, 2018) and the PRC Labor Contract Law effective as of January 1, 2008 (as amended on December 28, 2012), a written labor contract shall be executed by employer and an employee when the employment relationship is established, and an employer is under an obligation to sign an unlimited-term labor contract with any employee who has worked for the employer for ten consecutive years. Further, if an employee requests or agrees to renew a fixed-term labor contract that has already been entered into twice consecutively, the resulting contract must have an unlimited term, with certain exceptions. The employer must also pay severance to an employee in nearly all instances where a labor contract, including a contract with an unlimited term, is terminated or expires. All employers must compensate their employees equal to at least the local minimum wage standards. All employers are required to establish a system for labor safety and sanitation, strictly abide by state rules and standards and provide employees with appropriate workplace safety training. In addition, the government has continued to introduce various new labor-related regulations after the Labor Contract Law. Among other things, new annual leave requirements mandate that annual leave ranging from 5 to 15 days is available to nearly all employees and further require that the employer compensate an employee for any annual leave days the employee is unable to take in the amount of three times his daily salary, subject to certain exceptions. Moreover, all PRC enterprises are generally required to implement a standard working time system of eight hours a day and forty hours a week, and if the implementation of such standard working time system is not appropriate due to the nature of the job or the characteristics of business operation, the enterprise may implement a flexible working time system or comprehensive working time system after obtaining approvals from the relevant authorities. In addition, employers in China are obliged to pay contributions to the social insurance plan and the housing fund plan for their employees, and such contribution amount payable shall be calculated based on the employee actual salary in accordance with the relevant regulations.



M&A Rules and Overseas Listing



The Provisions Regarding Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors, or the M&A Rule, were jointly adopted by six PRC regulatory authorities, including China Securities Regulatory Commission, or CSRC, on August 8, 2006 and became effective as of September 8, 2006, and were later amended on June 22, 2009. The M&A Rules require that a foreign investor is required to obtain necessary approvals when (1) a foreign investor acquires equity in a domestic non-foreign invested enterprise thereby converting it into a foreign-invested enterprise, or subscribes for new equity in a domestic enterprise via an increase of registered capital thereby converting it into a foreign-invested enterprise; or (2) a foreign investor establishes a foreign-invested enterprise which purchases and operates the assets of a domestic enterprise, or which purchases the assets of a domestic enterprise and injects those assets to establish a foreign-invested enterprise. According to Article 11 of the M&A Rules, where a domestic company or enterprise, or a domestic natural person, through an overseas company established or controlled by it/him/her, acquires a domestic company which is affiliated with it/him/her, an approval from the MOFCOM is required.



This M&A Rules purport to require, among other things, offshore SPVs, formed for listing purposes through acquisition of PRC domestic companies and controlled by PRC companies or individuals, to obtain the approval of the CSRC prior to publicly listing their securities on an overseas stock exchange. We believe that CSRC approval is not required as we are not a special purpose vehicle formed for listing purpose through acquisition of domestic companies that are controlled by our PRC individual shareholders, as we acquired contractual control rather than equity interests in the VIE.



However, we cannot assure you that the relevant PRC government authority, including the CSRC, would reach the same conclusion as we do. If the CSRC or other PRC regulatory authority subsequently determines that we need to obtain the CSRC’s approval or if CSRC or any other PRC government authorities will promulgate any interpretation or implementing rules before the Share Exchange that would require CSRC or other governmental approvals for the Share Exchange, we may face sanctions by the CSRC or other PRC regulatory agencies. In such event, these regulatory agencies may impose fines and penalties on the VIE’s operations in the PRC, limit VIE’s operating privileges in the PRC, delay or restrict the repatriation of the proceeds from any future offerings into the PRC, or take other actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects, as well as the trading price of our shares.
