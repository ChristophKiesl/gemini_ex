Item 1. Business.
GSV Growth Credit Fund Inc.
 
GSV Growth Credit Fund Inc., a Maryland corporation formed on August 31, 2015 (“we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company”), is structured as an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end management investment company. We were formed to create significant value for our stockholders, and the entrepreneurs we support, by providing high growth-potential companies with hybrid debt and equity financing that is more flexible than traditional credit and less dilutive than equity. Our investment objective is to maximize our total return to our stockholders primarily through current income on our loan portfolio, and secondarily through capital appreciation on our warrants and other equity positions.
 
On December 15, 2016, we filed an election to be regulated as a business development company (“BDC”) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the “1940 Act”). We intend to elect to be treated and expect to qualify as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), for 2016 and intend to qualify as a RIC annually thereafter. While we intend to qualify to be treated as a RIC, no assurance can be provided that we will be able to maintain our qualification as a RIC. For example, we anticipate that we may have difficulty satisfying the asset diversification requirements as we deploy initial capital and build our portfolio. If we fail to qualify as a RIC for any taxable year, we will be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on any net taxable income for such year. See “— Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations” and “Note 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. for more information.
 
On December 16, 2016, we completed the initial closing of capital commitments (the “Initial Closing”) in our private offering of shares of common stock to investors in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and other applicable securities laws (the “Private Offering”). Prior to December 16, 2016, we had not commenced operations and were a development stage company as defined by Accounting Standards Codification ASC 915-10-05, “Development Stage Entity.” During this time, we focused substantially all of our efforts on establishing our business. We expect to operate as a “private” BDC while we invest the proceeds of the Private Offering, after which, if market conditions are favorable, we plan to give our investors the opportunity to elect to participate in a Spin-Off transaction, as further discussed in “— Investor Optionality; Potential Spin-Offs”. We are an “emerging growth company” under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, as amended (the “JOBS Act”). For so long as we remain an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act, we will be subject to reduced public company reporting requirements.
 
Our investment activities are managed by our external investment adviser, GSV Growth Credit LLC (“GSVGC”). GSV Credit Service Company, LLC (the “Administrator”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of GSVGC, provides all administrative services necessary for us to operate.
 
About GSVGC
 
GSVGC serves as our investment adviser and is responsible for our overall management and affairs. GSVGC is an investment adviser that has registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the “Advisers Act”). For providing these services, GSVGC receives a fee from us pursuant to an investment advisory agreement (the “Advisory Agreement”) consisting of two components: a base management fee and an incentive fee.
 

1
-

Base Management Fee
 
The base management fee is payable on the first day of each calendar quarter, calculated based on the average of the amount of capital commitments and assets purchased with borrowed funds or other forms of leverage (collectively, the “Gross Assets,” which term does not necessarily equate to the amount of gross assets that could be derived from our financial statements) during the preceding calendar quarter. Until the earlier of (1) the consummation of an initial public offering (“IPO”) of the Public Fund (defined below under “—Investor Optionality; Potential Spin-Offs”) in connection with a Spin-Off transaction (defined below under “—Investor Optionality; Potential Spin-Offs”) and (2) the earliest date at which (a) all capital commitments have been called for investments or expenses and (b) we hold no more than 10.0% of our total assets in cash, the base management fee will be the lesser of (i) an amount equal to 0.4375% (1.75% annualized) of the average amount of our Gross Assets during the most recently completed calendar quarter and (ii) the actual operating expenses incurred by GSVGC during such calendar quarter.
 
Following the earlier of (1) the consummation of an IPO of the Public Fund in connection with a Spin-Off transaction and (2) the earliest date at which (a) all capital commitments have been called for investments or expenses and (b) we hold no more than 10% of our total assets in cash, the base management fee will be an amount equal to 0.4375% (1.75% annualized) of the average amount of our Gross Assets during the most recently completed calendar quarter for so long as the aggregate amount of our Gross Assets as of the end of the most recently completed calendar quarter is less than $500,000,000. If the aggregate amount of our Gross Assets as of the end of the most recently completed calendar quarter is equal to or greater than $500,000,000, but less than $1,000,000,000, the base management fee will be an amount equal to 0.40% (1.60% annualized) of the average amount of our Gross Assets for the most recently completed calendar quarter. If the aggregate amount of our Gross Assets as of the end of the most recently completed calendar quarter is equal to or greater than $1,000,000,000, the base management fee will be an amount equal to 0.375% (1.50% annualized) of the average amount of our Gross Assets for the most recently completed calendar quarter.
 
The base management fee will be appropriately prorated for any partial month or quarter.
 
Incentive Fee
 
The incentive fee, which provides GSVGC with a share of the income that GSVGC generates for us, will consist of an investment-income component and a capital-gains component, which are largely independent of each other, with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not.
 
Under the investment-income component, we will pay GSVGC each quarter an incentive fee with respect to our pre-incentive fee net investment income. The investment-income component will be calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on the pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding fiscal quarter. Payments based on pre-incentive fee net investment income will be based on the pre-incentive fee net investment income earned for the quarter. For this purpose, “pre-incentive fee net investment income” means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees, such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence, managerial and consulting fees or other fees we receive from portfolio companies) we accrue during the fiscal quarter, minus our operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, expenses payable under the administration agreement with the Administrator (the “Administration Agreement”), and any dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee); provided however, that pre-incentive fee net investment income will be reduced by multiplying the pre-incentive fee net investment income earned for the quarter by a fraction, the numerator of which is our total assets minus average daily borrowings for the immediately preceding fiscal quarter, and the denominator of which is our total assets for the immediately preceding fiscal quarter. Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with pay in kind interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash; provided, however, that the portion of the investment-income component of the incentive fee attributable to deferred interest features will be paid, only if and to the extent received in cash, and any accrual thereof will be reversed if and to the extent such interest is reversed in connection with any write off or similar treatment of the investment giving rise to any deferred interest accrual, applied in each case in the order such interest was accrued. Such subsequent payments in respect of previously accrued income will not reduce the amounts payable for any quarter pursuant to the calculation of the investment-income component described above. Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation.

Pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets (defined as total assets less liabilities) at the end of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter, will be compared to a “hurdle rate” of 2.0% per quarter (8.0% annualized). We will pay GSVGC an investment-income incentive fee with respect to our pre-incentive fee net investment income in each calendar quarter as follows: (1) no investment-income incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which our pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the hurdle rate of 2.0%; (2) 80% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 2.667% in any calendar quarter (10.668% annualized) (the portion of our pre-incentive fee net investment income that exceeds the hurdle but is less than 2.667% is referred to as the “catch-up”; the “catch-up” is meant to provide GSVGC with 20.0% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income as if a hurdle did not apply if our pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds 2.667% in any calendar quarter (10.668% annualized)); and (3) 20.0% of the amount of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds 2.667% in any calendar quarter (10.668% annualized) payable to GSVGC (once the hurdle is reached and the catch-up is achieved, 20.0% of all pre-incentive fee net investment income thereafter is allocated to GSVGC).
 
Until the consummation of an IPO of the Public Fund in connection with a Spin-Off transaction, in the event that the sum of our cumulative net realized losses since the date of our election to be regulated as a BDC exceeds 2.0% of the total non-control/non-affiliate investments made by us since the date of our election to be regulated as a BDC as of the end of the quarter, the investment-income component of the incentive fee will not be payable for such quarter until the first subsequent quarter in which the sum of our cumulative net realized losses since the date of our election to be regulated as a BDC is less than 2.0% of the total non-control/non-affiliate investments made by us since the date of our election to be regulated as a BDC as of the end of such subsequent quarter; provided, however, that in no event will any investment-income component of the incentive fee be paid for any prior quarter after the three-year anniversary of the end of such quarter.
 
After the consummation of an IPO of the Public Fund in connection with a Spin-Off transaction, in the event that the sum of our cumulative net realized losses for the previous four fiscal quarters or, if fewer than four fiscal quarters have passed since such IPO, that number of fiscal quarters since such IPO (the “Look-Back Period”), exceeds 2.0% of the total non-control/non-affiliate investments (i) made by us during the Look-Back Period or (ii) transferred to the Public Fund in connection with a Spin-Off transaction during the Look-Back Period, the investment-income component of the incentive fee will not be payable for such quarter until the first subsequent quarter in which the sum of our cumulative net realized losses for the Look-Back Period is less than 2.0% of the total non-control/non-affiliate investments (i) made by us during the Look-Back Period or (ii) transferred to the Public Fund in connection with a Spin-Off transaction during the Look-Back Period; provided, however, that in no event will any investment-income component of the incentive fee be paid for any prior quarter after the three-year anniversary of the end of such quarter.
 
The following is a graphical representation of the calculation of the income-related portion of the incentive fee:
 
Pre-incentive fee net investment income (expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets)

Under the capital-gains component of the incentive fee, we will pay GSVGC as of the end of each calendar year 20.0% of our aggregate cumulative realized capital gains from the date of our election to be regulated as a BDC through the end of that year, computed net of our aggregate cumulative realized capital losses and aggregate cumulative unrealized depreciation through the end of such year, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital-gains incentive fee; provided, however, that we will not pay the capital-gains component of the incentive fee to GSVGC for any calendar year in which the sum of our (i) pre-incentive fee net investment income and (ii) realized gains less realized losses and unrealized capital depreciation from the date of our election to be regulated as a BDC through the end of such calendar year, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets (defined as total assets less liabilities) at the end of such calendar year is less than 8.0% until the first subsequent calendar quarter in which the sum of our (i) pre-incentive fee net investment income and (ii) realized gains less realized losses and unrealized capital depreciation from the date of our election to be regulated as a BDC through, and including, the end of such subsequent calendar quarter, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets (defined as total assets less liabilities) at the end of such calendar quarter is equal to or exceeds 8.0%; provided, further, that in no event will any capital-gains component of the incentive fee be paid for any prior year after the three-year anniversary of the end of such year. For the foregoing purpose, our “aggregate cumulative realized capital gains” will not include any unrealized appreciation.
 
Spin-Off Incentive Fee
 
In connection with a Spin-Off transaction as described in “— Investor Optionality; Potential Spin-Offs,” we expect that the investment-income component of the incentive fee will be payable in respect of the exchanged shares of our common stock (the “Spin-Off Income Incentive Fee”). The Spin-Off Income Incentive Fee will be calculated as of the date of the completion of each Spin-Off transaction and will equal the amount of the investment-income component of the incentive fee that would be payable to GSVGC if (1) all of our investments were liquidated for their current value, and any unamortized deferred portfolio investment-related fees would be deemed accelerated, (2) the proceeds from such liquidation were used to pay all of our outstanding liabilities, and (3) the remainder were distributed to our stockholders and paid as an incentive fee in accordance with the investment-income component of the incentive fee described above in (1) and (2) for determining the amount of the Spin-Off Income Incentive Fee; provided, however, that in no event will the Spin-Off Income Incentive Fee (a) include the portion of the investment-income component of incentive fee attributable to deferred interest features of a particular investment that is not transferred pursuant to a Spin-Off transaction until such time as the deferred interest is received in cash, or (b) exceed 20% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income accrued for the fiscal quarter as of the date of the completion of the Spin-Off transaction. We will make the Spin-Off Income Incentive Fee payment in cash on or immediately following the date of the completion of a Spin-Off transaction. After a Spin-Off transaction, all calculations relating to the incentive fee payable by us will be made without taking into account the exchanged shares of our common stock (or contributions, distributions or proceeds relating thereto).
 
In connection with a Spin-Off transaction, we expect that the capital-gains component of the incentive fee will be payable in respect of the exchanged shares of our common stock (the “Spin-Off Capital Gains Incentive Fee,” and together with the Spin-Off Income Incentive Fee, the “Spin-Off Incentive Fee”). We expect that the Spin-Off Capital Gains Incentive Fee would be calculated as of the date of the completion of a Spin-Off transaction as if such date were a calendar year-end for purposes of calculating and paying the Spin-Off Capital Gains Incentive Fee.
 
No Spin-Off Incentive Fee will be payable unless, on the date of the completion of a Spin-Off transaction, the sum of our (i) pre-incentive fee net investment income and (ii) realized capital gains less realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation from the date of our election to be regulated as a BDC through, and including, the date of the completion of such Spin-Off transaction, is greater than 8% of the cumulative net investments made by us since our election to be regulated as a BDC.
 
Payment of Our Expenses
 
All professionals of GSVGC, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory and management services to us, and the compensation and routine overhead expenses of personnel allocable to these services to us, will be provided and paid for by GSVGC and not by us. We will bear all other out-of-pocket costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including, without limitation, those relating to:

Duration and Termination
 
Unless terminated earlier as described below, the Advisory Agreement will continue in effect for a period of two years from its effective date of December 15, 2016. Thereafter, the Advisory Agreement will continue automatically for successive annual periods provided that such continuance is specifically approved at least annually by (i) (A) the affirmative vote of a majority of our Board of Directors or (B) the affirmative vote of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, and (ii) the affirmative vote of a majority of our directors who are not “interested persons,” as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act, of us, GSVGC or our respective affiliates. The Advisory Agreement automatically terminates in the event of its assignment, as defined in the 1940 Act, and may be terminated, without penalty, upon not more than 60 days’ written notice, by (i) the affirmative vote of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, (ii) the affirmative vote of a majority of our Board of Directors, including a majority of our directors who are not “interested persons,” as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act, of us, GSVGC or our respective affiliates, or (iii) GSVGC. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Business and Structure — GSVGC and our Administrator have the right to resign upon not more than 60 days’ notice, and we may not be able to find a suitable replacement for either within that time, or at all, resulting in a disruption in our operations that could adversely affect our financial condition, business and results of operations” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.

The Advisory Agreement provides that, absent criminal conduct, willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of its duties and obligations under the Advisory Agreement, GSVGC and its professionals and any other person or entity affiliated with it are entitled to indemnification from us for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of GSVGC’s services under the Advisory Agreement or otherwise as our investment adviser.
 
Investment Committee
 
GSVGC’s investment committee (the “Investment Committee”) consists of R. David Spreng, who is its chairman and our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors, Thomas B. Raterman, our Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary, Matthew Hanson, Head of Origination at GSVGC, Brian Laibow, OCM Growth Holdings, LLC’s appointee, and Michael Moe, Chief Executive Officer, President and Chief Investment Officer of GSV Asset Management, LLC (“GSV Asset Management”), a leading growth-investment manager and the investment adviser to GSV Capital Corp. (“GSV Capital”), a publicly traded BDC, and Chief Executive Officer of GSV Capital. The Investment Committee will meet regularly to consider our investments, review our strategic initiatives and supervise the actions taken by GSVGC on our behalf. In addition, the Investment Committee will review and monitor the performance of our investment portfolio. Each investment must be approved by a majority of the Investment Committee. In addition, Mr. Spreng, as chairman of the Investment Committee, has the right to veto the approval of any investment, and any investment by us that is outside of certain agreed upon investment criteria requires the affirmative vote of OCM Growth Holdings, LLC’s appointee to the Investment Committee. See “ – Oaktree Strategic Relationship” below for more information.
Board Approval of the Advisory Agreement
 
On November 29, 2016, at an in-person meeting, our Board of Directors, including a majority of the directors who were not “interested persons,” as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act, of the Company or GSVGC, approved the Advisory Agreement for an initial term of two years. The Advisory Agreement became effective on December 15, 2016.
 
In its consideration of the approval of the Advisory Agreement, our Board of Directors focused on information it had received relating to, among other things:
 

· | the nature, quality and extent of the advisory and other services to be provided to us by GSVGC over the term of the Advisory Agreement;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | comparative data with respect to advisory fees or similar expenses paid by other BDCs with similar investment objectives;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | our projected operating expenses and expense ratio compared to BDCs with similar investment objectives, including expenses related to investment due diligence, travel and investigating and monitoring investments;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | any existing and potential sources of indirect income to GSVGC or the Administrator from their relationships with us and the profitability of those relationships, including the Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | information about the services to be performed and the personnel performing such services under the Advisory Agreement;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-


· | the organizational capability and financial condition of GSVGC and its affiliates;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | GSVGC’s practices regarding the selection and compensation of brokers that may execute our portfolio transactions and the brokers’ provision of brokerage and research services to GSVGC; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the possibility of obtaining similar services from other third-party service providers or through an internally managed structure.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Based on the information reviewed and related discussions, our Board of Directors concluded that fees payable to GSVGC pursuant to the Advisory Agreement were reasonable in relation to the services to be provided. Our Board of Directors did not assign relative weights to the above factors or the other factors considered by it. In addition, our Board of Directors did not reach any specific conclusion on each factor considered, but conducted an overall analysis of these factors. Individual members of the Board of Directors may have given different weights to different factors.
 
About Our Administrator
 
We have entered into the Administration Agreement with our Administrator, a wholly-owned subsidiary of GSVGC, pursuant to which our Administrator is responsible for furnishing us with office facilities and equipment and provides us with clerical, bookkeeping, recordkeeping and other administrative services at such facilities. Pursuant to the Administration Agreement, we pay our Administrator an amount equal to our allocable portion (subject to the review of our Board of Directors) of our Administrator’s overhead resulting from its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and the allocable portion of the cost of our Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Financial Officer and their respective staffs associated with performing compliance functions. Pursuant to the terms of the Administration Agreement, the amounts payable to the Administrator from us in any fiscal year will not exceed the greater of (i) 0.75% of the aggregate capital commitments as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal year and (ii) $1 million. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Business and Structure — There are significant potential conflicts of interest which could impact our investment returns” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for more information.
Oaktree Strategic Relationship
 
In December 2016, GSVGC entered into a strategic relationship with Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. (“Oaktree”). Oaktree is a leading global alternative investment management firm with expertise in credit strategies. The firm was formed in 1995 by a group of individuals who had been investing together since the mid-1980s in high yield bonds, convertible securities, distressed debt, real estate, control investments and listed equities. As of December 31, 2016, Oaktree comprises over 900 employees in Los Angeles (headquarters), New York, Stamford, Houston, London, Paris, Frankfurt, Dubai, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Singapore, Seoul, Beijing, Shanghai and Sydney. Oaktree has 35 portfolio managers with average experience of 23 years and over 810 years of combined investment experience.
 
In connection with the strategic relationship, OCM Growth Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“OCM”) managed by Oaktree, made a $125 million capital commitment to us (the “OCM Commitment”). OCM has granted a proxy to us pursuant to which the shares held by OCM will be voted in the same manner as our other stockholders vote their shares.
 
In connection with the OCM Commitment, we entered into a stockholder agreement, dated December 15, 2016 (the “Stockholder Agreement”), with OCM pursuant to which OCM has a right to nominate a member of our Board of Directors for election. Brian Laibow was appointed to our Board of Directors, effective January 25, 2017, as OCM’s representative. OCM also holds an interest in GSVGC and has the right to appoint a member of GSVGC’s board of managers and a member of the Investment Committee. OCM’s initial appointee to GSVGC’s board of managers and Investment Committee is Brian Laibow.

We believe that our strategic relationship with Oaktree will provide us with access to additional resources and investment opportunities by expanding our network of relationships with venture backed companies. GSVGC expects to continue to draw upon Oaktree’s over 20-year history in the investment management business and to continue to benefit from Oaktree’s investment professionals’ significant credit expertise developed through investments in different industries and over numerous companies in the United States. In addition, we expect to utilize Oaktree’s relationships to gain better access to leverage facilities with better terms and provisions than we would otherwise be able to obtain. GSVGC also expects to be able to add additional origination personnel as a result of the strategic relationship with Oaktree.
 
Investor Optionality; Potential Spin-Offs
 
At any time after the third anniversary of the Initial Closing we will offer our stockholders the option to elect to either (i) retain their ownership of shares of our common stock; (ii) exchange their shares of our common stock for shares of common stock in a newly formed entity (the “Public Fund”) that will elect to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act and treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, and will use its commercially reasonable best efforts to complete an IPO of shares of its common stock not later than three years after the final closing of the Private Offering, which closing will occur no later than December 31, 2017; or (iii) exchange their shares of our common stock for interests of one or more newly formed entities (each, a “Liquidating Fund”) that will each be organized as a limited liability company, and which will, among other things, seek to complete an orderly wind down and/or liquidation of any such Liquidating Fund; provided, however, in no event will a stockholder be obligated to exchange his, her or its shares of our common stock for shares of common stock in the Public Fund or interests in a Liquidating Fund. Thereafter, subject to the requisite corporate and regulatory approvals, we will offer investors the option to elect to exchange their shares of our common stock for interests of a Liquidating Fund on an annual basis. In order to effectuate these options, we expect that we would need to, among other things, transfer to the Public Fund and the Liquidating Funds, in exchange for newly issued shares of the Public Fund and interests of the Liquidating Funds, respectively, a pro rata portion of our assets and liabilities attributable to the investors that have elected to invest in the Public Fund or Liquidating Funds, respectively (such transfer of assets and liabilities and the mechanics relating thereto are referred to herein as a “Spin-Off transaction”). Each Liquidating Fund and the Public Fund will have management fees and incentive fees equal to or less than those of the Company.
 
We may exclude any stockholder from participating in a Spin-Off transaction if, in our reasonable discretion, there is a substantial likelihood that such stockholder’s exchange of shares of our common stock at such time would cause us, the Public Fund or a Liquidating Fund to (i) be in violation of, or noncompliance with, any law or regulation to which such entity is or would be subject or (ii) be deemed to hold “plan assets” under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”) or Section 4975 of the Code because the investments of “benefit plan investors” (within the meaning of Section 3(42) of ERISA and certain Department of Labor (“DOL”) regulations (such investors referred to herein as “Benefit Plan Investors”)) are deemed to be significant.
 
Because GSVGC would be managing each of us, the Public Fund and any Liquidating Fund in connection with any Spin-Off transaction, and the 1940 Act prohibits entities under common control from engaging in certain transactions, we will likely be required to obtain exemptive and/or no-action relief from the SEC to permit us to transfer assets to a Public Fund and/or a Liquidating Fund, as well as with respect to other aspects relating to the Spin-Off transaction, including the calculation of incentive fee to be paid by us in connection with a Spin-Off transaction. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such exemptive and/or no-action relief from the SEC. If we are unable to do so, then we will continue our operations in the manner otherwise set forth in this annual report on Form 10-K and our public filings with the SEC.

Investment Strategy and Approach
 
We intend to typically invest in what we believe to be high growth-potential, private companies. We intend to primarily originate our own investments in the debt and, to a lesser extent, equity of our portfolio companies and utilize a multi-strategy approach to providing growth capital to these companies. The types of loans in which we intend to typically invest are senior secured and second lien secured loans, which generally fall into two strategies: Sponsored Growth Lending and Non-Sponsored Growth Lending.
Sponsored Growth Lending. We anticipate that our Sponsored Growth Lending will include loans to companies that are already backed by established venture capital and private equity firms. We also anticipate that our Sponsored Growth Lending will typically include the receipt of warrants and/or other equity from the venture-backed companies. We refer to these target borrowers as “venture-backed companies.” We target venture-backed companies at all stages of development, with a bias towards later-stage, including those that are pre-revenue. To a limited extent, we also intend to selectively lend to publicly traded companies with venture capital ownership. We focus on lending to companies focused in technology, life sciences, business services and other high growth industries. We believe that the Sponsored Growth Lending strategy we follow is particularly attractive because the loans have high yields and additional equity upside. Investors may receive significant current income while gaining access to equity upside in companies that are often backed by the nation’s top-tier venture capital investors. We believe our Sponsored Growth Lending strategy typically:

● | provides us access to many high-quality companies backed by top-tier investors;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | delivers consistent returns through double-digit loan yields; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | participates in equity upside via warrants.
--+--------------------------------------------

Non-Sponsored Growth Lending. We anticipate that our Non-Sponsored Growth Lending will include loans to fast-growing private companies that are not backed by a professional equity investor sponsor, a venture capital firm or a private equity firm. We refer to these target borrowers as “non-sponsored growth companies.” As opposed to Sponsored Growth Lending, in the case of Non-Sponsored Growth Lending, we generally intend to target companies with annual revenue of at least $20 million per year. To a limited extent, we also selectively provide non-sponsored growth loans to publicly traded companies.
 
We believe that our multi-strategy lending approach significantly reduces the volatility inherent in financing emerging-growth companies.
 
We believe the following attributes, which we expect to be included in most of the loans of our investment strategies, present an attractive risk profile:
 

● | meaningful amortization over the life of each loan and short to medium loan term;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a low ratio of leverage to enterprise value; and
--+-------------------------------------------------


● | a secured collateral position.
--+-------------------------------

 
We believe there are significant barriers to entry in providing sponsored growth lending and non-sponsored growth lending, which results in an environment with a limited number of competitors. In particular, we believe we will be able to capitalize on the following crucial elements for success in the private growth company lending market:
 

● | relationships with top-tier venture investors, growth company entrepreneurs, and other deal referral sources;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | reputation as a reliable, supportive, and value-added partner;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


9
-


● | ability to accurately determine credit risk and gauge warrant potential; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | experience in the unique aspects of growth company debt pricing, structure, portfolio construction and management.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The above attributes are not easily acquired and take years to establish. We believe GSVGC’s experienced, disciplined, and cohesive investment team possesses these necessary capabilities.
 
In addition to our core strategy of providing sponsored growth lending and non-sponsored growth lending, we may also opportunistically participate in the secondary markets for sponsored growth lending and non-sponsored growth lending.
 
Typical attributes of our Sponsored Growth Lending and Non-Sponsored Growth Lending are as follows:
 

● | loan-size ranges from $3 million to $15 million;
--+-------------------------------------------------


● | short total repayment periods: typically 36 to 60 months or less;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | may provide for interest only or moderate loan amortization in the early period of the loan;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | unlevered yield-to-maturity (i.e., the total return anticipated on a debt investment if it is held until maturity) generally ranging from 10% to 15%, which may include current interest payments, upfront and facility fees, an end-of-term payment and/or a payment-in-kind (“PIK”) interest payment;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | warrants to acquire preferred or common stock in the prospective borrower that allow us to participate in any equity appreciation and enhance our overall returns;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | senior secured lien on the borrower’s assets, including a pledge on or a promise by the borrower to not pledge the borrower’s intellectual property to another individual or lender; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | limited and/or flexible covenant structures and, with certain affirmative and negative covenants, default penalties, lien protection, investor abandonment provisions, material adverse change provisions, change-of-control provisions, restrictions on additional use of leverage, and reimbursement for upfront and regular internal and third-party expenses and prepayment penalties.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competition
 
Our primary competitors for investments include public and private funds, other BDCs, commercial and investment banks, commercial financing companies and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity and hedge funds. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, we believe some competitors may have access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC or to the distribution and other requirements we must satisfy to qualify and maintain our qualification as a RIC.
 
We use the expertise of the Investment Committee, to which we have access, to assess investment risks and determine appropriate pricing for our investments in portfolio companies. In addition, we expect that the relationships of GSVGC’s senior investment professionals will enable us to learn about, and compete effectively for, financing opportunities with attractive companies in the industries in which we seek to invest. For additional information concerning the competitive risks we face, see “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and Structure — We may face increasing competition for investment opportunities” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.

Managerial Assistance
 
As a BDC, we will offer, and must provide upon request, managerial assistance to our portfolio companies. This assistance could involve, among other things, monitoring the operations of our portfolio companies, participating in board and management meetings, consulting with and advising officers of portfolio companies and providing other organizational and financial guidance. We may also receive fees for these services. GSVGC will provide, or arrange for the provision of, such managerial assistance on our behalf to portfolio companies that request this assistance, subject to reimbursement of any fees or expenses incurred on our behalf by GSVGC in accordance with our Advisory Agreement.
Dividend Reinvestment Plan
 
We have adopted a dividend reinvestment plan that provides for reinvestment of our dividends and other distributions on behalf of our stockholders, unless a stockholder elects to receive cash as provided below. As a result of adopting such a plan, if our Board of Directors authorizes, and we declare, a cash dividend or distribution, our stockholders who have not opted out of our dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash dividends or distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, rather than receiving cash.
 
No action will be required on the part of a registered stockholder to have his or her cash dividends and distributions reinvested in shares of our common stock. A registered stockholder could instead elect to receive a dividend or distribution in cash by notifying GSVGC in writing, so that such notice is received by GSVGC no later than ten days prior to the record date for distributions to the stockholders. GSVGC will set up an account for shares of our common stock acquired through the plan for each stockholder who does not elect to receive dividends and distributions in cash and hold such shares in non-certificated form. Those stockholders whose shares are held by a broker or other financial intermediary could receive dividends and distributions in cash by notifying their broker or other financial intermediary of their election.
 
Stockholders who receive dividends and distributions in the form of stock are generally subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences as are stockholders who elect to receive their dividends and distributions in cash. However, since a participating stockholder’s cash dividends and distributions will be reinvested in our common stock, such stockholder will not receive cash with which to pay applicable taxes on reinvested dividends and distributions. A stockholder’s basis for determining gain or loss upon the sale of stock received in a dividend or distribution from us will generally be equal to the cash that would have been received if the stockholder had received the dividend or distribution in cash, unless we were to issue new shares that are trading at or above net asset value, in which case, the stockholder’s basis in the new shares will generally be equal to their fair market value. Any stock received in a dividend or distribution will have a new holding period for tax purposes commencing on the day following the day on which the shares are credited to the U.S. stockholder’s account.
 
Staffing
 
We do not currently have any employees. David Spreng, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors, is also the founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer of GSVGC. Thomas B. Raterman, our Chief Financial Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of GSVGC, also serves on the board of directors of GSV Financial Group LLC, the parent of GSV Equity LLC, which manages the day-to-day operations of GSV Ventures LLC, a specialized venture firm that leads or co-invests in mid- and late-stage financing for pre-IPO companies alongside well-known venture capital groups. Our Chief Financial Officer performs his functions for us under the terms of our Administration Agreement. We have also retained Carl Rizzo of Alaric Compliance Services LLC to serve as our Chief Compliance Officer pursuant to an agreement with Alaric Compliance Services LLC.
 
Our day-to-day investment and administrative operations are managed by GSVGC and our Administrator. The Investment Committee is supported by a team of additional experienced investment professionals. GSVGC and our Administrator may hire additional investment and administrative professionals in the future to provide services to us, based upon our needs.

In addition, we reimburse the Administrator for its costs and expenses and our allocable portion of overhead incurred by it in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including compensation paid to or compensatory distributions received by our officers (including our Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Financial Officer) and any of their respective staff who provide services to us, operations staff who provide services to us, and any internal audit staff, to the extent internal audit performs a role in our internal control assessment under Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”).
 
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations
 
The following discussion is a general summary of the material U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to us and to an investment in shares of our common stock. This discussion is based on the provisions of the Code and the regulations of the U.S. Department of Treasury promulgated thereunder, or “Treasury regulations,” each as in effect as of the date of this Form 10-K.
 
These provisions are subject to differing interpretations and change by legislative or administrative action, and any change may be retroactive. This discussion does not constitute a detailed explanation of all U.S. federal income tax aspects affecting us and our stockholders and does not purport to deal with the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be important to particular stockholders in light of their individual investment circumstances or to some types of stockholders subject to special tax rules, such as financial institutions, broker dealers, insurance companies, tax-exempt organizations, partnerships or other pass-through entities, persons holding our common stock in connection with a hedging, straddle, conversion or other integrated transaction, non-U.S. stockholders (as defined below) engaged in a trade or business in the United States, persons who have ceased to be U.S. citizens or to be taxed as resident aliens or individual non-U.S. stockholders present in the United States for 183 days or more during a taxable year. This discussion also does not address any aspects of U.S. estate or gift tax or foreign, state or local tax. This discussion assumes that our stockholders hold their shares of our common stock as capital assets for U.S. federal income tax purposes (generally, assets held for investment). No ruling has been or will be sought from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) regarding any matter discussed herein.
 
A “U.S. stockholder” is a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
 

● | an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


● | a corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state therein or the District of Columbia;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary jurisdiction over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
A “non-U.S. stockholder” means a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
 

● | a nonresident alien individual;
--+--------------------------------


● | a foreign corporation; or
--+--------------------------


● | a foreign estate or trust.
--+---------------------------

 
If a partnership or other entity classified as a partnership, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, holds our shares, the U.S. tax treatment of the partnership and each partner generally will depend on the status of the partner, the activities of the partnership and certain determinations made at the partner level. A partnership considering an investment in our common stock should consult its own tax advisers regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of shares by the partnership.

Taxation of the Company
 
We intend to elect to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code for 2016 and intend to qualify for treatment as a RIC annually thereafter. As a RIC, we generally will not pay corporate-level federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we timely distribute to our stockholders as dividends.
 
To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things:
 

● | derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities loans, gains from the sale or other disposition of stock, securities or foreign currencies, other income derived with respect to our business of investing in stock, securities or currencies, or net income derived from an interest in a “qualified publicly traded partnership,” or “QPTP,” hereinafter the “90% Gross Income Test;” and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | diversify our holdings so that, at the end of each quarter of each taxable year:
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


○ | at least 50% of the value of our total assets is represented by cash and cash items, U.S. Government securities, the securities of other RICs and other securities, with other securities limited, in respect of any one issuer, to an amount not greater than 5% of the value of our total assets and not more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer, and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


○ | not more than 25% of the value of our total assets is invested in the securities of any issuer (other than U.S. Government securities and the securities of other RICs), the securities of any two or more issuers that we control and that are determined to be engaged in the same business or similar or related trades or businesses, or the securities of one or more QPTPs, or the “Diversification Tests.”
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In the case of a RIC that furnishes capital to development corporations, there is an exception relating to the Diversification Tests described above. This exception is available only to RICs which the SEC determines to be principally engaged in the furnishing of capital to other corporations which are principally engaged in the development or exploitation of inventions, technological improvements, new processes, or products not previously generally available (“SEC Certification”). We have not sought SEC Certification, but it is possible that we will seek SEC Certification in future years. If we receive SEC Certification, we generally will be entitled to include, in the computation of the 50% value of our assets (described above), the value of any securities of an issuer, whether or not we own more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer, if the basis of the securities, when added to our basis of any other securities of the issuer that we own, does not exceed 5% of the value of our total assets.
 
As a RIC, we (but not our stockholders) are generally not subject to U.S. federal income tax on investment company taxable income and net capital gains that we distribute to our stockholders in any taxable year with respect to which we distribute an amount equal to at least 90% of the sum of our (i) investment company taxable income (which includes, among other items, dividends, interest and the excess of any net realized short-term capital gains over net realized long-term capital losses and other taxable income (other than any net capital gain), reduced by deductible expenses) determined without regard to the deduction for dividends and distributions paid and (ii) net tax-exempt interest income (which is the excess of our gross tax-exempt interest income over certain disallowed deductions), or the “Annual Distribution Requirement.” We intend to distribute annually all or substantially all of such income. Generally, if we fail to meet this Annual Distribution Requirement for any taxable year, we will fail to qualify as a RIC for such taxable year. To the extent we meet the Annual Distribution Requirement for a taxable year, but retain our net capital gains for investment or any investment company taxable income, we are subject to U.S. federal income tax on such retained capital gains and investment company taxable income. We may choose to retain our net capital gains for investment or any investment company taxable income, and pay the associated federal corporate income tax, including the 4% U.S. federal excise tax described below.
 

13
--

 

We are subject to a nondeductible 4% U.S. federal excise tax on certain of our undistributed income, unless we timely distribute (or are deemed to have timely distributed) an amount equal to the sum of:
 

● | at least 98% of our ordinary income (not taking into account any capital gains or losses) for the calendar year;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | at least 98.2% of the amount by which our capital gains exceed our capital losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for a one-year period generally ending on October 31 of the calendar year (unless an election is made by us to use our taxable year); and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | certain undistributed amounts from previous years on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
While we intend to distribute any income and capital gains in order to avoid imposition of this 4% U.S. federal excise tax, we may not be successful in avoiding entirely the imposition of this tax. In that case, we will be liable for the tax only on the amount by which we do not meet the foregoing distribution requirement.
 
We are authorized to borrow funds and to sell assets in order to satisfy distribution requirements. However, under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted to make distributions to our stockholders while any senior securities are outstanding unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios. See “—Regulation as a Business Development Company — Senior Securities.” Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to meet our distribution requirements may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating to our status as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or to avoid the 4% U.S. federal excise tax, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous.
 
A RIC is limited in its ability to deduct expenses in excess of its “investment company taxable income” (which is, generally, ordinary income plus the excess of net short-term capital gains over net long-term capital losses). If our expenses in a given year exceed investment company taxable income, we would experience a net operating loss for that year. However, a RIC is not permitted to carry forward net operating losses to subsequent years. In addition, expenses can be used only to offset investment company taxable income, not net capital gain. Due to these limits on the deductibility of expenses, we may, for tax purposes, have aggregate taxable income for several years that we are required to distribute and that is taxable to our stockholders even if such income is greater than the aggregate net income we actually earned during those years. Such required distributions may be made from our cash assets or by liquidation of investments, if necessary. We may realize gains or losses from such liquidations. In the event we realize net capital gains from such transactions, stockholders may receive a larger capital gain distribution than they would have received in the absence of such transactions.
 
Failure to Qualify as a RIC
 

While we intend to elect, and expect to qualify, to be treated as a RIC for 2016 and intend to qualify to be treated as a RIC annually thereafter, no assurance can be provided that we will qualify as a RIC for any taxable year. For example, we anticipate that we may have difficulty satisfying the Diversification Tests as we deploy initial capital and build our portfolio. In addition, we may have difficulty satisfying the diversification requirements after the consummation of the initial Spin-Off transaction if we decide to liquidate our portfolio since we will not be making additional investments. While we generally will not lose our status as a RIC as long as we do not acquire any non-qualifying securities or other property, under certain circumstances we may be deemed to have made an acquisition of non-qualifying securities or other property. If we have previously qualified as a RIC, but were subsequently unable to qualify for treatment as a RIC, and certain amelioration provisions are not applicable, we would be subject to tax on all of our taxable income (including our net capital gains) at regular corporate rates. We would not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders, nor would they be required to be made. Distributions, including distributions of net long-term capital gain, would generally be taxable to our stockholders as ordinary dividend income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate stockholders would be eligible to claim a dividend received deduction with respect to such dividend; non-corporate stockholders would generally be able to treat such dividends as “qualified dividend income,” which is subject to reduced rates of U.S. federal income tax. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder’s tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain. In order to requalify as a RIC, in addition to the other requirements discussed above, we would be required to distribute all of our previously undistributed earnings attributable to the period we failed to qualify as a RIC by the end of the first year that we intend to requalify as a RIC. If we fail to requalify as a RIC for a period greater than two taxable years, we may be subject to regular corporate tax on any net built-in gains with respect to certain of our assets (i.e., the excess of the aggregate gains, including items of income, over aggregate losses that would have been realized with respect to such assets if we had been liquidated) that we elect to recognize on requalification or when recognized over the next five years.

The remainder of this discussion assumes that we qualify as a RIC for each taxable year.
 
Company Investments
 
Certain of our investment practices are subject to special and complex U.S. federal income tax provisions that may, among other things, (i) disallow, suspend or otherwise limit the allowance of certain losses or deductions, including the dividends received deduction, (ii) convert lower taxed long-term capital gains and qualified dividend income into higher taxed short-term capital gains or ordinary income, (iii) convert ordinary loss or a deduction into capital loss (the deductibility of which is more limited), (iv) cause us to recognize income or gain without a corresponding receipt of cash, (v) adversely affect the time as to when a purchase or sale of stock or securities is deemed to occur, (vi) adversely alter the characterization of certain complex financial transactions and (vii) produce income that will not qualify as good income for purposes of the 90% Gross Income Test. We monitor our transactions and may make certain tax elections and may be required to borrow money or dispose of securities to mitigate the effect of these rules and to prevent disqualification of us as a RIC but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this regard.
Debt Instruments. In certain circumstances, we may be required to recognize taxable income prior to the time at which we receive cash. For example, if we hold debt instruments that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (such as debt instruments with an end-of-term payment and/or PIK interest payment or, in certain cases, increasing interest rates or issued with warrants), we must include in taxable income each year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. Because any original issue discount accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement and to avoid the 4% U.S. federal excise tax, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount.
Warrants. Gain or loss realized by us from the sale or exchange of warrants acquired by us as well as any loss attributable to the lapse of such warrants generally are treated as capital gain or loss. The treatment of such gain or loss as long-term or short-term generally depends on how long we held a particular warrant and on the nature of the disposition transaction.
Foreign Investments. In the event we invest in foreign securities, we may be subject to withholding and other foreign taxes with respect to those securities. We do not expect to satisfy the requirement to pass through to our stockholders their share of the foreign taxes paid by us.
Passive Foreign Investment Companies. We may invest in the stock of a foreign corporation which is classified as a “passive foreign investment company” (within the meaning of Section 1297 of the Code), or “PFIC.” In general, unless a special tax election has been made, we are required to pay tax at ordinary income rates on any gains and “excess distributions” with respect to PFIC stock as if such items had been realized ratably over the period during which we held the PFIC stock, plus an interest charge. Certain adverse tax consequences of a PFIC investment may be limited if we are eligible to elect alternative tax treatment with respect to such investment. No assurances can be given that any such election will be available or that, if available, we will make such an election.
Foreign Currency Transactions. Under the Code, gains or losses attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates which occur between the time we accrue income or other receivables or accrue expenses or other liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and the time we actually collect such receivables or pay such liabilities generally are treated as ordinary income or loss. Similarly, on disposition of debt instruments and certain other instruments denominated in a foreign currency, gains or losses attributable to fluctuations if the value of the foreign currency between the date of acquisition of the instrument and the date of disposition also are treated as ordinary gain or loss. These currency fluctuations related gains and losses may increase or decrease the amount of our investment company taxable income to be distributed to our stockholders as ordinary income.

Regulation as a Business Development Company
 
General
 
We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. A BDC must be organized in the United States for the purpose of investing in or lending to primarily private companies and making significant managerial assistance available to them. A BDC may use capital provided by stockholders and from other sources to make long-term, private investments in businesses. A BDC provides stockholders the ability to retain the liquidity of a publicly traded stock while sharing in the possible benefits, if any, of investing in primarily privately owned companies.
 
We may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or withdraw our election as, a BDC unless authorized by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities, as required by the 1940 Act. A majority of the outstanding voting securities of a company is defined under the 1940 Act as the lesser of: (a) 67% or more of such company’s voting securities present at a meeting if more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company are present or represented by proxy, or (b) more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company. We do not anticipate any substantial change in the nature of our business.
 
As with other companies regulated by the 1940 Act, a BDC must adhere to certain substantive regulatory requirements. A majority of our directors must be persons who are not interested persons, as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. Additionally, we are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect the BDC. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person’s office.
 
As a BDC, we are generally required to meet an asset coverage ratio, defined under the 1940 Act as the ratio of our gross assets (less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities) to our outstanding senior securities, of at least 200% after each issuance of senior securities. We may also be prohibited under the 1940 Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our directors who are not “interested persons,” as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act, of us, GSVGC or our respective affiliates and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC.
 
We do not intend to acquire securities issued by any investment company that exceed the limits imposed by the 1940 Act. Under these limits, except for registered money market funds, we generally cannot acquire more than 3% of the voting stock of any investment company, invest more than 5% of the value of our total assets in the securities of one investment company or invest more than 10% of the value of our total assets in the securities of investment companies in the aggregate. The portion of our portfolio invested in securities issued by investment companies ordinarily will subject our stockholders to additional indirect expenses. Our investment portfolio is also subject to diversification requirements by virtue of our intent to elect to be treated as a RIC for U.S. tax purposes and our intention to continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and Structure” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for more information.
 
We are generally not able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and Structure — Regulations governing our operation as a BDC affect our ability to raise additional capital and the way in which we do so. As a BDC, the necessity of raising additional capital may expose us to risks, including the typical risks associated with leverage.” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. We may, however, sell our common stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the then-current net asset value of our common stock if our Board of Directors determines that such sale is in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders, and our stockholders approve such sale. In addition, we may generally issue new shares of our common stock at a price below net asset value in rights offerings to existing stockholders, in payment of dividends and in certain other limited circumstances.

As a BDC, we are generally limited in our ability to invest in any portfolio company in which GSVGC or any of its affiliates currently has an investment or to make any co-investments with our investment adviser or its affiliates without an exemptive order from the SEC, subject to certain exceptions.
 
We are subject to periodic examination by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act.
 
As a BDC, we are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and Structure” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
 
Qualifying Assets
 
Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the BDC’s gross assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are the following:

(1) | Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer which:
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(a) | is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States;
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(b) | is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly owned by the BDC) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(c) | satisfies any of the following:
----+--------------------------------


(i) | does not have any class of securities that is traded on a national securities exchange;
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange, but has an aggregate market value of outstanding voting and non-voting common equity of less than $250 million;
-----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If at any time less than 70% of our gross assets are comprised of qualifying assets, including as a result of an increase in the value of any non-qualifying assets or decrease in the value of any qualifying assets, we would generally not be permitted to acquire any additional non-qualifying assets, other than office furniture and equipment, interests in real estate and leasehold improvements and facilities maintained to conduct the business operations of the BDC, deferred organization and operating expenses, and other non-investment assets necessary and appropriate to its operations as a BDC, until such time as 70% of our then current gross assets were comprised of qualifying assets. We would not be required, however, to dispose of any non-qualifying assets in such circumstances.
 
Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies
 
In addition, a BDC must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described above in Qualifying Assets categories (1), (2) or (3). However, in order to count portfolio securities as qualifying assets for the purpose of the 70% test, the BDC must either control the issuer of the securities or must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities (other than small and solvent companies described above in Qualifying Assets category (1)(c)(iv)) significant managerial assistance; except that, where the BDC purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, one of the other persons in the group may make available such managerial assistance. Making available managerial assistance means, among other things, any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its directors, officers or employees, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company.
Temporary Investments
 
Pending investment in other types of “qualifying assets,” as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets. Typically, we will invest in U.S. Treasury Bills or in repurchase agreements, provided that such agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price which is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25% of our gross assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we would not meet the diversification tests in order to qualify as a RIC for federal income tax purposes. Thus, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. GSVGC monitors the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions.
Senior Securities
 
We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 200% immediately after each such issuance. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our gross assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, see “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and Structure — We may borrow money, which would magnify the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and may increase the risk of investing in us.” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.

Compliance Policies and Procedures
 
We and GSVGC have adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to detect and prevent violation of the federal securities laws and are required to review these compliance policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation and designate a chief compliance officer to be responsible for administering the policies and procedures. Carl Rizzo currently serves as our Chief Compliance Officer.
 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on publicly held companies and their insiders. Many of these requirements affect us. For example:
 

● | pursuant to Rule 13a-14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the “Exchange Act”), our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer must certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | pursuant to Item 307 of Regulation S-K, our periodic reports must disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, our management must prepare an annual report regarding its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting starting with our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017 and, starting from the date on which we cease to be an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act, must obtain an audit of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting performed by our independent registered public accounting firm should we become an accelerated filer; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | pursuant to Item 308 of Regulation S-K and Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, our periodic reports must disclose whether there were significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to review our current policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. We will continue to monitor our compliance with all regulations that are adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and will take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance therewith.
 
Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
 
We have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to GSVGC. The Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures of GSVGC are set forth below. The guidelines will be reviewed periodically by GSVGC and our non-interested directors, and, accordingly, are subject to change. For purposes of the Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures described below, “we,” “our” and “us” refers to GSVGC.
 
An investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act has a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interests of its clients. As part of this duty, we recognize that we must vote client securities in a timely manner, free of conflicts of interest and in the best interests of our clients.
 
These policies and procedures for voting proxies for our investment advisory clients are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act.
 
Proxy Policies
 
We will vote proxies relating to our portfolio securities in what we perceive to be the best interest of our clients’ stockholders. We will review on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted to a stockholder vote to determine its impact on the portfolio securities held by our clients. Although we will generally vote against proposals that may have a negative impact on our clients’ portfolio securities, we may vote for such a proposal if there exist compelling long-term reasons to do so.

Our proxy-voting decisions will be made by the senior officers who are responsible for monitoring each of our clients’ investments. To ensure that our vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, we will require that: (1) anyone involved in the decision-making process disclose to our management any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote; and (2) employees involved in the decision-making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how we intend to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties.
 
Proxy Voting Records
 
You may obtain information about how we voted proxies by making a written request for proxy voting information to: GSV Growth Credit LLC, The Pioneer Building, 2925 Woodside Road, Woodside, CA 94062.
