Siberian Ginseng (Acanthopanax):
 
Acanthopanax, which is known in the United States as Siberian Ginseng, has been used for centuries in China.  According to Chinese Pharmacopoeia, it has numerous medical efficacies including, improving kidney and spleen function; tranquilizing the mind (anxiolytic effect), improving appetite; decreasing pain (analgesic effect); and improving sleep quality.  In addition, further pharmacologic studies and clinical trials conducted over the medical efficacies of Siberian Ginseng (Acanthopanax) have shown additional benefits, including:

Raw materials and Suppliers
 
The raw materials of Siberian Ginseng (Acanthopanax) based products are effective ingredients extracted from the Siberian Ginseng (Acanthopanax) plant.  In China, about 94% of the wild Siberian Ginseng (Acanthopanax) resources grow in the Heilongjiang Province (Source: Heilongjiang Dongbei net).  The company controlled over 75% of the wild Siberian Ginseng (Acanthopanax) resources production in China through exclusive purchase agreements with local governments.
 
On January 11, 2011, the Company through its wholly own subsidiary, CBP China, replaced and supplemented the July 8, 2010 Exclusive Purchase Agreement with Yichun Red Star Forestry Bureau of Heilongjiang Province (the “Forestry Bureau”) with the Exclusive Licensing Agreement for Harbin Renhuang Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. to Use Forest Resources under Yichun Red Star Forestry Bureau (the “Agreement”) which provides us with 30 years exclusive license right to use approximately 6,667 hectares of undergrowth resources including approximately 67 hectares of Siberian Ginseng GAP cultivation base in Heilongjiang Province. We will be responsible for continued maintenance and protection of wild resources to make this area a professional Siberian Ginseng base.
 
In addition, through the Exclusive Purchase Agreement with Dongfanghong Forestry Bureau, we also have the exclusive rights for an indefinite term to purchase the wild Siberian Ginseng (Acanthopanax) grown on 6,667 hectares of land in Dongfanghong, Heilongjiang Province.
 
Other raw materials and packaging materials are purchased from various independent suppliers, and we do not rely on any one supplier.  To ensure consistent quality, we have established long-term relationships with many of our suppliers, ensuring that we have at least ten different suppliers for each type of raw materials.  We chose our suppliers based on criteria such as quality, reputation, price, delivery capacity and GMP certification. In addition, we conduct stringent inspections on each batch of raw materials supplied, and perform a periodic review of supplier qualifications.
 
Manufacturing and production facilities
 
We had three production facilities:  Ah City Natural and Biopharmaceutical plant, Dongfanghong pharmaceutical plant and Qingyang natural extraction plant.  The facilities, with a total usable area of over 160 thousand square meters, are capable of producing more than 200 kinds of pharmaceuticals, health food, and functional food in 18 dosage forms, including tablets, capsules (hard and soft), granules, oral liquid, frozen powder injection, powder injection, liquid injection, dropping pills, and ointments.  We also have β-lactams and plant extraction lines and automatic packaging lines.
 
Our production is in strict compliance with “Good Manufacturing Practice”, or GMP, and Chinese standards of “Health Food Good Manufacturing Practice”, and “Sterile Product Quality Control Norms”. We have state of the art automated equipment, precise testing instruments, efficient air conditioning, cleaning systems and a modern logistic center for storage and distribution of products.
 
With the increasing demand of our products and further expansion of our business, we started Siberian Ginseng Depth Development and Industrialization Project (“Ah City Phase Two”) in the beginning of 2011. We have finished the architectural design of Ah City Phase Two project and are in the process of obtaining approval documents from relevant government authorities. We expect to receive all the documents by April, 2012 and will start the construction thereafter. As of October 31, 2011, we have incurred a total of $1,937,103 of construction-in-progress. The Ah City Phase Two project is expected to be completed in the year of 2013.

Quality Assurance
 
We are committed to delivering high-quality pharmaceutical products, and have set in place comprehensive testing and quality control measures. We have a quality control team that carries out quality control procedures in compliance with internal policies, GMP standards and State Food and Drug Administration, or SFDA, regulations.  There are quality checks at every stage of production, including testing the quality of raw materials throughout our manufacturing process, testing finished products against various criteria such as ingredient composition, weight and physical appearance, and testing sanitary conditions of the production line.  We also have a pre-arranged emergency plan in the case of adverse events such as emergency plans for operational accidents and force majeure.
 
Our production facilities comply with pharmaceutical GMP standards.  We employ automated processes and scientific parameters throughout the manufacturing process that are designed to ensure that all products meet our quality requirements. We believe that our rigorous testing and inspection procedures have been critical in ensuring that our products are quality products.
 
Marketing and Product Distribution 
 
We have entered into sales agency agreements with sales agents through which our products are sold to over 3,000 distributors and over 70 sales centers across 24 provinces in China. Our products are mainly sold by our distributors to pharmacies, medicine wholesale centers, hospitals and other medical agencies. No customer has contributed over 10% of our total revenue before sales rebate in fiscal year 2011 compared with one customer has contributed to 11.01% of our total revenue before sales rebate in fiscal year 2010.

Research and Development
 
We are committed to developing new products and improving our current products.  During the fiscal years ended October 31, 2011 and 2010, we spent $3,592,555 and $3,042,815, respectively, on research and development.
 
Aligned with our line of business, our research and development (“R&D”) activities are focused on the following:
 

● | Development of single-plant anti-depression & nerve regulation products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Extraction of certain components from Siberian Genseng 
● | Cultivation of Siberian Ginseng; and 
● | Development of OTC product upgrades. 

 
In 2011, we focused our research on cultivation techniques of Siberian Ginseng to solidify our future raw material supply. We are also researching on new drugs containing certain effective ingredients from Siberian Ginseng, which we expect to launch in the following years.
 
To further become an innovative enterprise, we continuously employ qualified talent to strengthen our research team.  Currently we have established an open and innovative R&D environment consisting of Proprietary R&D Centers, Cooperation R&D Centers and Post-doctoral Workstations.
 

● | Proprietary R&D Centers. These centers are responsible for initial research of potential products and development of existing product upgrades. We have comprehensive research and development facilities, including an innovative medicine division, a standard extractions division, a healthcare division, a comprehensive division, planning & registration division and a mid-phrase test division. In addition, our labs have received government and industry recognitions, namely: the “Key Lab on TCM Extractions’” from the Science and Technology Bureau of Heilongjiang Province and the “Innovative Medicine Lab” from the Industry Information Committee of Harbin.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Cooperation R&D Centers. These centers have established committees consisting of well-known medical professionals in China, who specialize in biopharmaceutical and botanical medicines. The committees guide and advise the execution and direction of R&D projects, as well as evaluating research findings. The Cooperation Centers also work closely with the academic agencies including the Institute of Biophysics and Ecological Centre of the Environment in the Chinese Academy of Science; the Medical Research Institute of National Navy; the Chinese Biochemical Medicine Research Center; the Second Army Medical University; the China Medicine University; the Beijing University of Traditional Chinese Medicine; the Heilongjiang Province Chinese Medicine University; the Northeast Forestry University and the Harbin Medical University.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Post-doctoral Workstations. The workstations allow post-doctoral studies on projects that are considered to be valuable to our development. 

 
R&D Strategy
 
Our strategy is to be the first brand and industry leader in single-plant drugs for the treatment of depression and nerve-regulation, mainly through the development of products from Siberian Ginseng (Acanthopanax) and Schisandra. Our goal is consistent with the following trends:
 

● | Development of single-plant medicines is one of the three main developments in the Chinese pharmaceutical industry; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Antidepressants are one of the best selling drugs in the world. 

 
To implement this strategy, we have established a cultivation base and are focusing our effects to set the industry standard for Siberian Ginseng (Acanthopanax) and Schisandra products.   This cultivation project has received significant support from various government departments, including the Ministry of Science and Technology, Development and Reform Commission.
 
Government Regulation
 
Our products are subject to regulatory controls governing pharmaceutical products. As a developer, manufacturer and distributor of pharmaceuticals, we are subject to regulation and oversight by different levels of the food and drug administration in China, in particular, the PRC State Food and Drug Administration, or SFDA. The “Law of the PRC on the Administration of Pharmaceuticals,” as amended on February 28, 2001, provides the basic legal framework for the administration of the production and sale of pharmaceuticals in China and covers the manufacturing, distributing, packaging, pricing and advertising of pharmaceutical products in China. Its implementing regulations set out detailed rules with respect to the administration of pharmaceuticals in China. We believe we are in compliance with these laws and regulations in all material aspects.

Regulations at the national, provincial and local levels in China are subject to change. To date, compliance with governmental regulations has not had a material impact on our earnings or competitive position, but, because of the evolving nature of such regulations, we are unable to predict the impact such regulation may have in the foreseeable future.
 
Employees
 
As of October 31, 2011, we have 83 full-time employees who have entered into labor contracts with our PRC subsidiary; we have approximately 485 employees dispatched from a labor dispatching company. We have approximately 142 employees in management positions, 30 in research and development, 474 in the production, storage and distribution, and 20 in the marketing and sales (excluding our 3,000 distributors in over 70 sales centers across 24 provinces in China). Our PRC subsidiary may not fully contribute the social insurance and housing fund for such 83 employees, and may not fully contribute the social insurance for the 459 dispatched employees as required by the agreement between our PRC subsidiary and the relevant employee dispatching agency.
Legal Proceedings
 
From time to time, we may be involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of its operations in the normal course of business. Any of these claims could subject us to costly litigation and, while we generally believe that we have adequate insurance to cover many different types of liabilities, our insurance carriers may deny coverage or our policy limits may be inadequate to fully satisfy any damage awards or settlements. If this were to happen, the payment of any such awards could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. Additionally, any such claims, whether or not successful, could damage our reputation and business. We are not a party to, or threatened by, any legal proceedings, the adverse outcome of which, in management’s opinion, individually or in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.
