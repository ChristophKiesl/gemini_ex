Item 1. Business
 
We are a pre-revenue company developing proprietary transparent electricity-generating coatings and methods for their application to various materials which we refer to as our “LiquidElectricity™ Coatings”. Our LiquidElectricity™ Coatings generate electricity by harvesting light energy from natural sun, artificial light, and low, shaded, or reflected light conditions. We apply ultra-thin layers of LiquidElectricity™ Coatings to rigid glass, and flexible glass and plastic surfaces where they transform otherwise ordinary surfaces into organic photovoltaic devices. Potential applications of our LiquidElectricity™ Coatings span multiple industries, including architectural, automotive, agrivoltaic (greenhouse agriculture), aerospace, commercial transportation and marine.
 
We have achieved important milestones and overcome major technical challenges in order to broaden the range of materials and products that we can coat to generate electricity. Our goals in developing electricity-generating products have included ensuring transparency and esthetics, optimizing power generation, and lowering the costs of our coating materials and their related application.

We first coated rigid flat glass with our LiquidElectricity™ Coatings to generate electricity. Numerous technological advancements over the past two years enabled us to fabricate panes of flat glass layered with LiquidElectricity™ coatings at room temperature and ambient pressure; this process represents a significant technical achievement which may provide manufacturing advantages over expensive and cumbersome high temperature and high positive or negative pressure-sensitive manufacturing methods common to conventional solar photovoltaic manufacturing.
 
Among important field tests, LiquidElectricity™ Coatings on flat glass have been successfully processed through the rigorous autoclave system for window glass lamination at a commercial fabricator. At the fabricator’s facilities, glass panes layered with LiquidElectricity™ Coatings were subjected to the extremely high heat and pressure of autoclave equipment used in commercial glass lamination. Subsequent performance testing confirmed that glass with LiquidElectricity™ Coatings continued to produce power.
 
LiquidElectricity™ Coatings on glass panes have also been subjected to more than 200 freeze/thaw cycles, yielding favorable performance. Our edge sealing processes and materials contributed to the prevention of moisture-related damage, an important feature.
 
In addition to flat glass, we have successfully applied our LiquidElectricity™ Coatings to generate electricity on flexible glass and plastics. On glass surfaces, our electricity-generating coatings could enable new and retrofit architectural applications such as windows for commercial towers, glass walls and curtain walls, room dividers, and other related products. On flexible surfaces, our electricity-generating products present applications in various industries, including: automotive, light and commercial trucks, recreational vehicles, marine, aerospace and defense, agrivoltaics, and others.
 
Among our near-term product iterations, is the electrification of glass surfaces. LiquidElectricity™ coatings could produce electricity-generating windows for potential use in new construction and retrofit applications in commercial buildings, when applied using our proprietary processes and subsequently fabricated into a window product.
 
In a July 2020 demonstration, LiquidElectricity™ Coatings applied to otherwise ordinary glass panes resulted in the fabrication of a 9 square-foot window array, our largest and most transparent array, which displayed voltage and successfully powered a series of LED lights. In October 2020, we released video footage of our electricity-generating coatings applied to glass, successfully powering LED lights while undergoing testing under various simulated light conditions. In February 2021, we achieved a 500% increase in prototyping and testing speed, 12-fold increase in testing capacity and output, and 20-times reduction in material costs using a newly developed high-out platform for lab-scale prototyping. In March 2021, using industry-standard single-cell patterning for performance testing, we successfully doubled our power conversion efficiency to 14.72% (+/- 0.29%), according to independent tests conducted by the Device Performance Measurement Laboratory (National Renewable Energy Laboratory).
 
Currently, our LiquidElectricity™ Coatings are under development with support from commercial contract firms who provide expertise in specialty chemistry and coatings processes, and at one of the most respected and advanced solar-photovoltaic research institutions in the world, the U.S. Department of Energy’s (“DOE”) National Renewable Energy Laboratory (“NREL”), through a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (“CRADA”).
 
Additionally, we work on specific advancements to various aspects of manufacturing-related processes with NREL and Argonne National Laboratory. This ongoing work was initiated after we were awarded a DOE Grant for Advanced Manufacturing. Specifically, our work was conducted through an Advanced Materials Manufacturing Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (“AMM CRADA”) from the DOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy’s Advanced Manufacturing Office, and the Roll-to-Roll Advanced Materials Manufacturing Consortium, led by Oak Ridge National Laboratory, partnering with Argonne National Laboratory, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and NREL. Work under the AMM CRADA was completed in April 2021.

Beyond research and development, our commercial strategy is to apply LiquidElectricity™ Coatings to existing third-party materials or product surfaces, to create electricity-generating products which could become self-powered, or colloquially, “self-charging”. In furtherance of our strategy, over the past year we have strengthened our management team, established the SolarWindow Innovation Group, and expanded our US operations to Asia.
 
In October 2020, we announced the opening of an office in Seoul, South Korea, and the appointment of management and operations personnel in the US and South Korea to pursue commercial partnerships for our Company so as to enable productization, manufacturing, and marketing of our technologies and products.
 
Our commercial development efforts in the US and Asia include seeking technology, product licensing and joint venture arrangements with research institutions, commercial partners, manufacturing and fabrication facilities, and organizations with established technical competencies, market reach, and distribution networks in targeted industries.
 
Our proprietary electricity-generating coatings and associated technologies are the subject of thirty-one (31) trademarks and seventy-one (71) U.S. and international patents, either granted or in-process. See “Intellectual Property,” below.
 
We believe that our efforts have already produced a basis for these applications. Our planned productization and commercialization of SolarWindowTM technologies will require significant further product development, fabrication, testing, and validation. In addition to our technology development CRADA and engagements with specialty contract groups, we anticipate the need for product development partnerships with commercial partners in order to ascertain the viability of our technologies and products, currently under development.
 
Our technologies and products, currently under development, use our proprietary chemistries and application processes in order to generate electricity on glass and plastics. Our ongoing research and product development requires the commitment of significant resources to support the extensive invention, design, engineering, testing, prototyping, and intellectual property initiatives carried-out by our contract engineers, scientists, and consultants.
 
We cannot accurately predict the amount of funding or the time required to successfully commercialize products. The actual cost and time required to commercialize our technology may vary significantly depending on, among other things, the results of our product development efforts; the cost of developing, acquiring, or licensing various enabling technologies; changes in the focus and direction of our business or product development plans; competitive and technological advances; the cost of patent filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing claims; demonstrating compliance with regulations and standards; and manufacturing, marketing and other costs that may be associated with product fabrication. Because of this uncertainty, even if financing is available to us, we may secure insufficient funding to effectuate our business and/or product development plans.
 
The Market Opportunity for our LiquidElectricity™ Coatings
 
Based on our market research, there are no commercially marketed electricity-generating products available for sale in the United States which provide the functionality, features, esthetics, and adaptability of LiquidElectricity™ Coatings. Our markets include building window and glass applications, referred to as “architectural flat glass” and “fabricated glass products.” Flat glass is extensively used in the architecture industry in applications such as windows, partitions, and facades. One third-party glass industry report, published in February 2020, by Grand View Research, Inc., projects that the global flat glass market is expected to reach $202.9 billion by 2027, growing at a revenue-based compounded annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 7.3%.
 
We are also targeting applications for our LiquidElectricity™ Coatings in automotive, light and commercial trucks, recreational vehicles, marine, and aerospace and defense sectors, among others. We believe that the rising demand for electric propulsion and autonomous piloting in these segments presents a timely opportunity for our electricity-generating technologies.
 
Additionally, the agrivoltaics market for our electricity-generating coatings includes the smart greenhouse market, valued at $1.37 billion in 2019 and projected to reach $3.23 billion by 2027, growing at a CAGR of 11.4% from 2020 to 2027. In addition to these smart greenhouses which monitor and control the growth condition of plants and optimize the growing process of the plants, we believe that conventional greenhouse structures, both new and existing, present commercial opportunities for the application of SolarWindow to these structures.

Such technologies include, but are not necessarily limited to, the use of organic materials, advanced crystalline silicon thin film concepts, amorphous silicon, cadmium telluride, copper-indium-gallium-selenide, titanium dioxide, and copper indium di-selenide, and others to generate electricity from sunlight. Given sufficient time, investment and advances in manufacturing technologies, any of these competing technologies may achieve lower manufacturing costs, superior performance, or greater market acceptance than our products, currently under development. Among the companies purporting to be developing such technologies, are ONYX Solar, Next Energy Technologies, Solarmer Energy, Ubiquitous Energy, Heliatek, Sunew and ARMOR (previously OPVIOUS, GmbH).
 
We face competition from many companies, major universities and research institutions in the United States and abroad. Many of these companies, universities and research institutions have substantially greater resources, experience in conducting research, experience in obtaining regulatory approvals for their products, operating experience, research and development and marketing capabilities name recognition and production capabilities. We will face competition from companies marketing existing products or developing new products which may render our technologies (and hence future products) obsolete.
 
These companies, universities and research institutions may have numerous competitive advantages, including:
 

• | Significantly greater name recognition;
--+----------------------------------------


• | established distribution networks;
--+-----------------------------------


• | more advanced technologies and product development;

--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
If our competitors were to:
 

· | succeed in developing products that are more effective in producing electrical energy at a lower cost than our technology, some or all of our products or our technology could be rendered obsolete and non-competitive;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | succeed in bringing their products or services to market earlier than ours, our revenues could be adversely affected. See “Risk Factors.”
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Accordingly, in addition to our research and development efforts, we have undertaken a public relations, advertising, and market access outreach programs designed to establish our “brand” name recognition early on in our corporate development; we intend to continue to develop and market our brand name pending commercialization of products, if any, we may derive from our research and development efforts. We believe our strategy ultimately will facilitate the marketing, distribution and public acceptance of any products we may derive from our research and development efforts, if and when any applicable regulatory approval is received.
 
Our commercial success will depend on our ability and the ability of our manufacturing partners, licensee or sub-licensees, if any, to compete effectively in product development areas such as, but not limited to: safety, reliability, availability, price, marketing, distribution and patent position.
 
Our competitive position in the market will also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, to obtain patent protection, develop proprietary products and processes, protect our intellectual property rights, and to secure sufficient capital resources required during the often-substantial period between technology development and commercial sales.
 
An important factor will be the timing of market introduction of any products utilizing our LiquidElectricity™ Coatings. Accordingly, the speed with which we can develop products, complete safety approvals and ultimately supply commercial quantities of any products we develop to the market is important.
