Overview 
 We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics designed to address the unmet needs of patients living with autoimmune diseases. We have combined a network-based conceptualization of the immune system with expertise in advanced protein engineering to develop our TALON (Therapeutic Autoimmune reguLatOry proteiN) drug design and discovery platform. Our TALON platform enables us to employ a modular approach to create a pipeline of product candidates using immunomodulatory effector modules that act at known control nodes within the immune network. We are also able to combine an effector module with a tissue-targeted tether module in a bifunctional format to guide delivery of the effector to a targeted tissue. Our lead product candidate, PT101, a combination of our interleukin-2, or IL-2, mutein effector module with a protein backbone, is designed to selectively expand regulatory T cells, or Treg cells, systemically, without activating proinflammatory cells, such as conventional T cells and natural killer, or NK, cells. We are initially developing PT101 for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis, or UC, and for the treatment of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, or SLE. We reported positive top-line data from a Phase 1a clinical trial of PT101 in healthy volunteers in January 2021. Leveraging our TALON platform, we continue to develop and expand our library of effector and tether modules as part of our early stage research and discovery pipeline. 
 We believe there is a need to fundamentally rethink the approaches historically utilized in autoimmune disease drug development. Current therapies for autoimmune disease based on broad immunosuppression or focused on inhibiting one pathway of the immune network often leave patients suffering from chronic residual disease or disease progression. We created our TALON platform to develop therapies that manipulate the immune system at its known control nodes, which we believe will enable us to design and develop treatments for autoimmune diseases that provide a durable clinical benefit. 
 Our TALON platform is based on the concept of modularity. We start with immune effector modules that we engineer to mimic the action of known control nodes. We can combine these effector modules with a protein backbone to create a portfolio of product candidates tailored to a given autoimmune disease. Specifically, we believe that we can design effectors to act systemically, or using a bifunctional format we can combine our effectors with antibody-based tissue-targeted tethers to concentrate the effector within the target organ. We believe that we have the potential to generate a diverse pipeline of next-generation product candidates to address significant unmet medical needs in autoimmune diseases. 
 Our lead product candidate, PT101, is an effector module comprised of an engineered variant of wild-type IL-2, or an IL-2 mutein, fused to a protein backbone. We engineered PT101 to confer a high degree of selectivity for Treg cell expansion without activating proinflammatory cells, such as conventional T cells and NK cells. We believe that preferential activation and expansion of Treg cells, a natural regulatory node of the immune system, will enable PT101 to rebalance a dysregulated immune network in the context of a wide variety of autoimmune diseases. Based on the dose-escalation data observed in our preclinical studies, PT101 has 
 1

shown a high degree of selectivity for Treg cells over other types of immune cells such as conventional proinflammatory T cells and NK cells. We plan to develop PT101 for subcutaneous administration for the systemic treatment of a variety of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, with an initial focus on the treatment of patients with UC and on the treatment of patients with SLE. We estimate UC will represent a worldwide market of over $7 billion by 2026 and SLE will represent a worldwide market of over $1.6 billion by 2028. In February 2020, we initiated a single-ascending dose Phase 1a clinical trial of PT101 in healthy volunteers in Canada, and we completed enrollment and dosing in October 2020. We reported top-line data from this trial in January 2021, in which PT101 was observed to be safe and well-tolerated, the primary objective of the trial. In the clinical trial, PT101 selectively expanded total Treg cells, with a mean maximal increase of up to 3.6-fold over baseline. PT101 also expanded a subset of activated Treg cells with high CD25 expression, known as CD25 bright Treg cells, with a mean maximal increase of up to 72.5-fold over baseline. CD25 bright Tregs may be a more active subset of Treg cells with enhanced immune regulatory function. There was no evidence of expansion of NK cells and conventional T cells at any dose studied. At doses of 3.5 mg and above, PT101 induced a two-fold or greater expansion of total Treg cells in more than 80% of subjects. Treg cells returned to baseline or near-baseline over the 28-day follow-up period, supporting our plan to utilize an every-four-weeks dosing regimen of PT101 in future clinical trials. 
 All adverse events observed in the trial were low grade (Grade 1 or 2) and self-limited. The most common adverse events were skin reactions of itching, redness or pain near or around the site of injection of PT101. In laboratory tests, some subjects showed transient elevations of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell, that were self-limited in nature and did not require medical treatment. We believe that the eosinophil elevation may be related to the IL-2 mechanism of PT101. 
 Based on these results and subject to regulatory feedback, we plan to submit an investigational new drug application, or IND, to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and an investigational medicinal product dossier, or IMPD, to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA and commence a global Phase 1b/2a trial in patients with UC in mid-2021. In addition, subject to further regulatory feedback, we plan to initiate a global Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with SLE in the second half of 2021. 
 We are also developing a suite of PD-1 agonists. PD-1 is an inhibitory receptor that is naturally expressed by T cells following their activation. Based on the understood biology of PD-1, we believe agonism of PD-1 is an approach to intervene in ongoing activated proinflammatory T cell responses to prevent excessive and uncontrolled reactivity that can result in damage to host tissues, as well as concurrently stimulate immunomodulatory Treg cells. We are currently in preclinical development of PD-1 agonist antibody-based effectors that mimic the inhibitory effects of PD-1 without blocking the natural interaction between PD-1 and its ligands. Our efforts have generated PT627, a PD-1 agonist that does not require surface binding and retains its function when free floating in solution. Given the potential of PT627 to inhibit PD-1 within tissues as well as in the bloodstream, we believe it represents a markedly differentiated approach to PD-1 agonism for the treatment of autoimmune disease. We initiated IND-enabling studies of PT627 in the fourth quarter of 2020 and plan to file an IND with the FDA and/or an IMPD with the EMA for PT627 in 2022. 
 For autoimmune diseases that exhibit local manifestations, it can be challenging to administer a drug systemically and achieve a sufficient concentration of the drug at the target tissue for optimal therapeutic benefit. We are leveraging our TALON platform to engineer bifunctional therapeutics that tether our immune effector payload to the specific location where the immunomodulator is most likely to interact with infiltrating or activated immune cells. We believe tissue tethering will allow us to deliver the effector directly to the localized site of the autoimmune attack, create a high local concentration of the effector and extend the residence time of the effector at the site of action to increase local exposure. 
 Our most advanced bifunctional program, PT001, tethers a PD-1 agonist effector to a tether module that binds to mucosal vascular addressing cell adhesion molecule, or MAdCAM, to drive tissue-selective immunomodulation in the gastrointestinal tract. MAdCAM is a protein that is expressed in the gastrointestinal tract and controls the selective migration of immune cells from circulation into the underlying tissues. We are advancing both programs through preclinical development and plan to begin IND-enabling studies of PT001 in the first half of 2021. 
 Our discovery efforts are focused on expanding our library of effectors and tether modules. We are currently developing a CD39 effector designed to manipulate the inflammatory microenvironment. We are also expanding our library of tethers with ongoing efforts for autoimmune diseases of the skin, kidney and pancreas. 
 We established a collaboration with Astellas Pharma Inc., or Astellas, in October 2019 to develop locally acting immunomodulators for autoimmune diseases of the pancreas. Under this agreement, we are responsible for the design and discovery of bifunctional product candidates based on our TALON platform, and Astellas will conduct preclinical, clinical and commercialization activities for any candidates developed in the collaboration. The initial research plan is focused on three tissue-selective tether targets in the pancreas. The primary indication for which we and Astellas will seek to develop product candidates is type 1 diabetes. We received an upfront payment of $10.0 million and have the right to receive research, development and regulatory milestone payments under the collaboration. We also have the right to receive tiered royalties on worldwide net sales of any commercial products developed under the collaboration.

Our Pipeline
 We are leveraging our modular TALON platform to discover and design product candidates for the treatment of a wide range of autoimmune diseases. Our lead therapeutic programs are summarized in the table below:
Strategy 
 Our goal is to transform the lives of patients living with autoimmune diseases by combining a network-based conceptualization of the immune system with our expertise in advanced protein engineering to design, develop and commercialize next-generation therapies. To achieve this goal, our strategy includes the following key components: 

• | Advance our lead product candidate, PT101, through clinical development in patients with UC and in patients with SLE. We are currently developing our lead product candidate, PT101, to treat a broad set of autoimmune diseases, initially targeting the treatment of patients with UC and the treatment of patients with SLE. Based on the dose-escalation observed in our preclinical studies, PT101 has shown a high degree of selectivity for Treg cells over conventional proinflammatory T cells and NK cells, even at high doses. We initiated a Phase 1a clinical trial of PT101 in healthy volunteers in Canada in February 2020 and completed enrollment and dosing in October 2020. We reported top-line data from this trial in January 2021, in which PT101 was observed to be safe and well-tolerated, the primary objective of the trial. In the clinical trial, PT101 selectively expanded Treg cells, with a mean maximal increase of up to 3.6-fold over baseline. There was no evidence of expansion of NK cells and conventional T cells at any dose level studied. Based on these results and subject to regulatory feedback, we plan to submit an IND to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and an IMPD to the EMA, and to commence a global Phase 1b/2a trial in patients with UC in mid-2021. In addition, subject to further regulatory feedback, we plan to initiate a global Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with SLE in the second half of 2021.

• | Progress our preclinical pipeline of additional product candidates for autoimmune diseases into clinical trials. We have discovered and engineered a library of modules that we believe can be combined to create therapeutics tailored to address autoimmune diseases. In addition to PT101, we have combined our IL-2 mutein effector with a MAdCAM-tether module to create PT002, a bifunctional MAdCAM-tethered IL-2 mutein, designed to address organ-specific inflammatory injury in the gastrointestinal tract. We are in preclinical development of PT627, a PD-1 agonist effector module combined with a protein backbone, that is designed to be active in a soluble manner. We have also combined our PD-1 agonist effector module with a MAdCAM-tether module to create PT001, a bifunctional MAdCAM-tethered PD-1 agonist. We initiated IND-enabling studies with PT627 in the fourth quarter of 2020. We plan to file an IND for PT627 with the FDA in 2022. We plan to begin IND-enabling studies for PT001 in the first half of 2021.

• | Leverage our proprietary TALON platform to expand our library of effector and tether modules. We continue to expand our earlier stage research and discovery pipeline. We are adding new effector modules to our effector library, such as a CD39 effector, and continuing to add new tissue-tether modules to our tissue-tether library to enable us to treat autoimmune diseases of the skin, kidney and pancreas. We believe that these efforts could result in significant new opportunities to treat autoimmune diseases with high unmet medical need.

• | Continue to selectively evaluate collaborations to maximize the reach of our proprietary TALON platform. Given the potential of our proprietary TALON platform to generate novel product candidates for the treatment of a wide variety of autoimmune diseases, we believe that we can maximize its potential by forming strategic collaborations with respect to certain targets, product candidates or disease areas that could benefit from the resources of either larger

Our Focus: A Network-Based Conceptualization of the Immune System 
 The immune system is a self-regulating, multi-scale network comprised of cellular nodes that recognizes and reacts to foreign pathogens while normally remaining unresponsive to host tissues. Normally, self-reactive T cells are eliminated during their development via thymic selection, a process referred to as central tolerance. However, even in healthy individuals, there are circulating T cells that evade central tolerance and are capable of mounting immune responses to host tissues. These T cells are generally kept under control by a variety of different mechanisms associated with known immune control nodes, a process referred to as peripheral tolerance. In autoimmune and inflammatory disease, the loss of control at one or more of these nodes leads to an unchecked immune response, where the immune system recognizes host proteins as foreign, and mounts an attack against the self. 
 Each of the immune control nodes described below has been identified by published literature through studies of human genetics, the genetic manipulation of preclinical models, studies of how cancers evade the immune system, and/or the adverse autoimmune effects of checkpoint inhibitors in oncology. 
  
• | Node: Regulatory cells (i.e. Treg cells)
--+-----------------------------------------


• | Mechanism: Regulation of Immune Over-Reactivity
--+------------------------------------------------


• | Description: a mechanism in which the responding cells of the immune system are monitored and controlled by immunoregulatory cells to prevent over-activation. Treg cells, for example, are naturally occurring immunoregulatory cells that express and secrete anti-inflammatory molecules creating a quiescent environment that tempers the potential responses of other nearby proinflammatory immune cells. The activation and expansion of Treg cells by its growth factor IL-2 increases the ratio of regulatory cells to proinflammatory cells and can prevent over-stimulation of activated cell responses.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Example diseases associated with a loss of control at this node: Inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD (including UC), Type I interferon-related diseases (including systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren’s Syndrome), autoimmune hepatitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, alopecia areata and inflammatory myopathies
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Node: Inhibitory Checkpoints (i.e. PD-1)
--+-----------------------------------------


• | Mechanism: Attenuation of Immune Activation
--+--------------------------------------------


• | Description: a mechanism in which engagement of co-inhibitory receptors on responding cells of the immune system work to slow down the immune response. PD-1, for example, is an inhibitory checkpoint receptor that is naturally expressed by T cells following their activation. Agonism of the PD-1 inhibitory receptor on an activated T cell by its natural ligands, PD-L1 or PD-L2, interrupts the intracellular signaling machinery within the T cell, arresting the response, and returning the T cell to a state of quiescence. Agonist antibodies to inhibitory checkpoint receptors such as PD-1 can mimic the natural ligands by interrupting cell signaling and attenuate ongoing activated immune responses.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Example diseases associated with a loss of control at this node: type 1 diabetes, vitiligo, IBD, rheumatoid arthritis, Type I interferon-related diseases, myasthenia gravis, scleroderma and myocarditis
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Node: Soluble Mediators (i.e. CD39)
--+------------------------------------


• | Mechanism: Microenvironment Immune Modulation
--+----------------------------------------------


• | Description: a mechanism in which local secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines and/or local expression of energy depleting enzymes create a microenvironment that prevents further escalation of the immune response and promotes a return to quiescence. CD39 is a regulatory enzyme that is expressed on many immune cell types, including Treg cells. CD39 functions to convert adenosine triphosphate, or ATP, into adenosine monophosphate, or AMP, which is then, in conjunction with CD73, a partner enzyme, degraded into adenosine, which is an anti-inflammatory mediator. This mechanism thereby modulates the duration, magnitude, and chemical nature of extracellular signals delivered to immune cells and drives a shift from an ATP-driven proinflammatory microenvironment to an anti-inflammatory microenvironment induced by adenosine.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Example diseases associated with a loss of control at this node: atopic dermatitis, IBD, rheumatoid arthritis, arterial vascular diseases and vasculidities, multiple sclerosis and type 1 diabetes

Dysregulation at immune control nodes can lead to a variety of autoimmune diseases as described above. Notably, these diseases can have systemic manifestations, local manifestations, or both. The systemic nature is evident for diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and systemic sclerosis, but is also more subtly evident for diseases such as IBD (of which UC is a subtype) and rheumatoid arthritis, whose prominent organ-based features rest on a variable multi-organ injury pattern. Other autoimmune diseases, such as autoimmune hepatitis, vitiligo and alopecia areata, have a dominant local manifestation. 
 Traditional therapies for the treatment of autoimmune disease rely on either broad, nonspecific immunosuppression, such as high-dose corticosteroids, or selective inhibition of a specific biologic pathway within the vast immune network, such as anti-cytokine monoclonal antibodies or anti-kinase small molecules. Despite successes of these treatments, the global dampening of immune network activity via systemic immunosuppression or targeted pathway inhibition can lead to intolerable long-term side effects or may not achieve an adequate or durable clinical response in some patients, and there are unmet medical needs for these patients. 
 Our Approach 
 We believe there is a need to fundamentally rethink the approaches historically utilized in autoimmune disease drug development. Current therapies for autoimmune disease based on broad immunosuppression or focused on inhibiting one pathway of the immune network often leave patients suffering from chronic residual disease or disease progression. We believe that broad immunosuppression and narrow pathway inhibition have shown limited clinical utility because the immune system is a self-recalibrating multi-scale network that is best addressed by treatments that mimic the action of known control nodes of the immune network. 
 Our approach leverages the natural regulatory mechanism of the immune system as the basis of novel immunoregulatory therapeutics, which was made possible in recent years due to the adoption of advanced protein engineering technology. We aim to re-balance the immune response from a state of activation to a state of ready quiescence by modulating known control nodes of the immune system network. We have combined our understanding of these nodes and advanced protein engineering techniques to create our TALON platform, which we are using to develop therapies to manipulate the immune system at its known control nodes. We believe this will enable us to design and develop treatments for autoimmune diseases that provide a durable clinical benefit. 
 Our TALON platform is based on the concept of modularity as indicated by the graphic below. We start with immune effector modules that we engineer to mimic the action of known immune control nodes. We can combine these effector modules with a protein backbone to create a portfolio of product candidates tailored to a given autoimmune disease. Specifically, we believe that we can design effectors to act systemically, or using a bifunctional format we can combine our effectors with antibody-based tissue-targeted tethers to concentrate the effector within the target organ. We believe that we have the potential to generate a diverse pipeline of next-generation product candidates to address significant unmet medical needs in autoimmune diseases. 
 


5

Our modular approach to treat autoimmunity includes three key steps: 
 Engineering of Immunomodulatory Effectors. We select known control nodes and then engineer effector modules to specifically activate the primary mechanisms of control of the immune network as follows: 
  
• | Regulation of Immune Over-Reactivity (e.g. IL-2 Mutein): We have engineered an IL-2 mutein effector to specifically expand the Treg cells in order to activate an inherent immunoregulatory mechanism.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Attenuation of Immune Activation (e.g. PD-1 Agonist): We have designed antibody-based effectors that stimulate a known inhibitory immune checkpoint, PD-1, in order to control an active T cell-based immune attack.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Microenvironment Immune Modulation (e.g. CD39): We have designed effectors that are designed to mimic the function of CD39, a native anti-inflammatory enzyme within an immune microenvironment to suppress an active immune response.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Discovery of Tissue Tethers. We engineer antibody fragments that bind to specific proteins whose expression is restricted to certain cells within specific target organs. By intersecting this expression pattern with the site of immune attack in an autoimmune disease, we can discover tissue-tethered modules that concentrate their payload where needed. We then engineer and screen these tethers iteratively until we achieve the desired tether-protein interaction behavior. We have an expanding library of tether modules that may enable us to localize our immune effectors to the gastrointestinal tract, skin, kidney and pancreas. 
 Combination of Modules for Tailored Therapeutic Design. Utilizing our modular approach, we have the ability to design therapeutics with systemic or tissue-targeted effect. We can couple our effectors to a protein backbone to confer desired drug-like properties (e.g. half-life extension), resulting in a systemically active effector product candidate. We can also add a tether module designed to target a specific tissue, which results in a bifunctional molecule tailored to concentrate the effector at the local site of autoimmune attack. We believe that our ability to mix and match our library of immune effectors with our library of tissue-selective tethers will enable us to rapidly create an array of bifunctional molecules for localized delivery of the effector payload. 
 The above approach is designed to enable us to empirically test the biology of an effector, in both systemic and bifunctional format, before we commit to a development candidate to enter IND-enabling studies. We use a combination of functional screening, structural modeling, extensive molecular characterization and future manufacturability assessments to select candidates to advance that have the desired biological properties and attractive manufacturability attributes. 
 We use a conceptual, practical and strategic approach to deploying our TALON platform to inform our autoimmune drug development effort, as follows: 
  
• | Conceptual: Our re-appraisal of the immune system as a self-regulating network of interrelated pathways rather than a set of vertical pathways, led us to consider use of the manipulation of known immune control nodes rather than global dampening or pathway-blockade approaches. We believe this novel approach has the potential to result in therapeutics that can achieve clinical response rates and durability of clinical efficacy beyond what has been achieved using traditional drug development approaches for the treatment of autoimmune disease.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Practical: Our TALON platform enables us to combine our immune effector modules, each of which utilizes a key yet distinct mechanism of immune system controls, with protein backbones to guide systemic delivery or tissue-selective delivery via creation of bifunctional molecules with tissue-tether selective modules. We believe that the flexibility of this modular approach allows us to efficiently match desired drug characteristics with the nuances of the disease we target. Specifically, we can choose which effector we wish to deploy, and the precise tissue in which we wish to deploy it, based on our understanding of how the immune attack of that disease unfolds in the body or in a specific organ.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strategic: We strategically select diseases of interest based on several factors guided by the conceptual and practical considerations noted above. Before we advance a program, we must have a baseline understanding of how that disease manifests: where in the body and within which organ it manifests, which immune control system is proving inadequate, and where current standards of care are inadequate. From that foundation, we consider diseases for which we may be able to ascertain evidence of clinical efficacy at an early stage of clinical development. These factors guide our strategic decisions regarding which programs to advance, for which disease(s) they may be ideally suited, and the line of sight to clinical proof-of-concept and regulatory review.

Our approach has led to the integrated drug development strategy depicted below. 
 

Tethering Technology 
 The immune system can act in either a systemic or local manner, or both. For some autoimmune diseases, intervention at the systemic level is most appropriate. However, for autoimmune diseases that exhibit local manifestations, it can be challenging to administer a drug systemically and achieve a sufficient concentration of the drug at the target tissue for optimal therapeutic benefit. 
 We are leveraging our TALON platform to engineer bifunctional therapeutics that tether our immune effector payload to the specific location where the immunomodulator is most likely to interact with infiltrating or activated immune cells. We believe tissue tethering may offer the following benefits: 
  
(1) | The ability to precisely localize the effector to the specific anatomical location within an organ where autoimmune attack is concentrated;
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | The ability to create a high local concentration of the desired immunomodulator in a specific anatomical region; and
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | An extended residence time of the effector at the site of action to increase the local pharmacokinetic exposure.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that our ability to increase local concentration of our effectors over extended periods of time has the potential to elicit profound and sustained regulation of the local tissue resident immune system and drive towards induction of local tissue tolerance. Furthermore, the extended local exposure should avoid the need for prolonged systemic exposure and may alleviate some of the potential toxicities associated with global chronic immunosuppressive therapies. 
 Our Programs 
 PT101 
 Our lead product candidate, PT101, is an effector module comprised of an engineered variant of wild-type IL-2 fused to a protein backbone. Unlike wild type IL-2, which activates a broad array of immune cells, including conventional proinflammatory T cells and NK cells, we engineered PT101 through modifications of its amino acid sequence to activate and expand Treg cells selectively over proinflammatory cells. We believe that preferential activation and expansion of Treg cells, a natural regulatory component of the cellular immune system, will enable PT101 to rebalance a dysregulated immune network in the context of a wide variety of autoimmune diseases. Based on the dose-escalation data observed in our preclinical studies, PT101 has shown a high degree of selectivity for Treg cells over conventional proinflammatory T cells and NK cells.

We are developing PT101 for subcutaneous administration for the systemic treatment of a variety of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, with an initial focus on the treatment of patients with UC and patients with SLE. We initiated a Phase 1a clinical trial of PT101 in healthy volunteers in Canada in February 2020, and we completed enrollment and dosing in October 2020. We reported top-line data from this trial in January 2021, in which PT101 was observed to be safe and well-tolerated, the primary objective of the trial. In the clinical trial, PT101 selectively expanded total Treg cells, with a mean maximal increase of up to 3.6-fold over baseline. PT101 also expanded a subset of activated Treg cells with high CD25 expression, known as CD25 bright Treg cells, with a mean maximal increase of up to 72.5-fold over baseline. CD25 bright Treg cells may be a more active subset of Treg cells with enhanced immune regulatory function. There was no evidence of expansion of NK cells and conventional T cells at any dose studied. At doses of 3.5 mg and above, PT101 induced a two-fold or greater expansion of total Treg cells in more than 80% of subjects. Treg cells returned to baseline or near-baseline over the 28-day follow-up period, supporting our plan to utilize an every-four-week dosing regimen of PT101 in future clinical trials. 
 All adverse events observed in the trial were low grade (Grade 1 or 2) and self-limited. The most common adverse events were skin reactions of itching, redness or pain near or around the site of injection of PT101. In laboratory tests, some subjects showed transient elevations of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell, that were self-limited in nature and did not require medical treatment. We believe that the eosinophil elevation may be related to the IL-2 mechanism of PT101. 
 Based on these results and subject to regulatory feedback, we plan to submit an IND to the FDA and an IMPD to the EMA and commence a global Phase 1b/2a trial in patients with UC in mid-2021. In addition, subject to further regulatory feedback, we plan to initiate a global Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with SLE in the second half of 2021. 
 Activating Treg Cells with IL-2 to Modulate Peripheral Tolerance 
 Treg cells are a specialized subpopulation of immune cells whose function is to regulate immune responses, maintaining equilibrium among immune cells and peripheral self-tolerance. Treg cells attenuate ongoing inflammatory processes by a variety of mechanisms that can suppress the activity of effector T cells. Deficiencies in the number or function of Treg cells, for example as seen in rare patient populations who have a genetic lack of Treg cells, are associated with a myriad of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including those affecting the intestine. We believe these observations suggest that Treg cells play a key role in maintaining balance in the immune system, self-tolerance, and guarding against autoimmune disease. 
 The generation, survival, and functional activity of various proinflammatory immune cells as well as immunomodulatory Treg cells are driven by IL-2. IL-2 has dual and opposing functions, specifically that of stimulating conventional T cells and NK cells to promote immune attack, as well as expanding and activating Treg cells to control those immune responses. For example, recombinant IL-2, or aldesleukin, has been utilized since its approval in 1998 for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and renal cell carcinoma. At recommended doses in the oncology setting, it acts by non-specifically expanding immune cells that express the IL-2 receptor. However, at low doses, aldesleukin has shown an ability to achieve selective Treg cell expansion with encouraging clinical efficacy in multiple autoimmune diseases. We believe that aldesleukin’s narrow therapeutic window of selectively expanding Treg cell without expanding selectivity for conventional T cells and NK cells, combined with the need for daily subcutaneous administration due to its short half-life, are hindrances to routine use of aldesleukin as a viable autoimmune therapy. At present, there are no approved treatments utilizing IL-2 for autoimmune disease. 
 We believe these observations present an opportunity for an engineered variant of IL-2 to selectively expand Treg cells. An engineered IL-2 could have the advantage of utilizing the immune system’s natural control mechanism (i.e., Treg cells) to stimulate self-tolerance, while minimizing proinflammatory immune responses (i.e., conventional T and NK cells). The expansion of proinflammatory immune cells detracts from that efficacy associated with the expansion of Treg cells in the context of autoimmunity. We believe a strategy by which to achieve such a Treg cell selective IL-2 mutein involves the engineering of a biased interaction of IL-2 with specific components of its receptor. 
 The IL-2 receptor, or IL-2R, is comprised of three subunits: α, ß and g. These subunits combine to form two receptor formats with varying affinity for IL-2, as follows: 
  
• | The low affinity format: IL-2Rß plus IL-2Rg as found on conventional T and NK cells; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The high affinity format: IL-2Rα, IL-2Rß and IL-2Rg, as found on Treg cells.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In order to engineer IL-2 for selective Treg cell expansion, IL-2 may be modified to preferentially engage with the high affinity format receptor. 
 8

There are two potential approaches to achieve this, with several active clinical-stage programs exploring both of these approaches, as follows: 
  
1. | Direct mutation of key amino acids of the IL-2 protein, referred to as an IL-2 mutein; and
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Pegylation, which involves the chemical addition of polyethylene glycol to IL-2
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe direct mutation of IL-2 is a preferable approach as it allows for more control over the engineering of IL-2 and activity of the molecule and increases the potential for greater selectivity for Treg cells expansion over other types of immune cells, such as conventional T cells and NK cells. This selectivity could translate into the desired outcome of a wide therapeutic margin, whereby the product candidate can selectively expand Treg cells to a desired level without expanding proinflammatory immune cells. 
 
In order to implement the direct mutations to create an IL-2 mutein, specific amino acid substitutions in wild type IL-2 are introduced to alter binding affinity to the different IL-2R subunits. IL-2 muteins that bind less favorably to IL-2Rß induce a signal only when IL-2Rα is expressed. As a result, these IL-2 muteins have the ability to preferentially activate Treg cells at concentrations that do not stimulate conventional T or NK cells. This biased binding away from IL-2Rß has been achieved by third parties by mutating the 88th amino acid in IL-2, or N88. Published literature suggests that N88 plays a role in creating Treg cell selectivity. The effect of the engineering of PT101 to increase IL-2Rα affinity and decrease IL-2Rß is shown in the graphic below. 
 


Although significant progress has been made in the development of IL-2 muteins, we believe that an optimal IL-2 mutein would be a molecule that achieves a high degree of selectivity for Treg cells over conventional proinflammatory T cells and NK cells, exhibits molecular stability to reduce manufacturing complexity and minimizes the potential for immunogenicity. We believe that our approach resulted in a modified variant of IL-2 with potentially enhanced Treg cell selectivity beyond IL-2 muteins that rely on N88 or similar mutations. Literature reports suggest other IL-2 mutein programs in development exhibited an eventual loss of selectivity resulting in expansion or activation of conventional proinflammatory T cells and/or NK cells at high concentrations in preclinical studies. However, to date, we have not observed such a loss of selectivity with PT101, our IL-2 mutein, in preclinical studies of non-human primates, or in a Phase 1a clinical trial in healthy volunteers. 
 Rationale for Systemic PT101 for the Treatment of Patients with UC 
 PT101 is our IL-2 mutein effector module fused to a protein backbone. We designed PT101 as a systemic treatment to selectively expand Treg cells without having a meaningful effect on other immune cell types, particularly proinflammatory conventional T and NK cells. We believe that PT101 has the potential to treat a broad array of autoimmune diseases. We are initially focusing clinical development of PT101 for the treatment of patients with UC. Our focus on PT101 as a systemic treatment for patients with UC derives from the three core tenets of our drug development approach: 
  
(1) | Conceptual Rationale (i.e. targeting the right immune control node): The prevailing hypothesis in UC is that the number and/or response of native Treg cells is inadequate. This hypothesis is supported by findings from a recently published open-label clinical trial of low-dose aldesleukin in patients with UC that was conducted by Dr. Scott Snapper, a member of our scientific advisory board. In this trial, 24 patients with moderate-to-severe drug-refractory UC were treated with aldesleukin at three low dose levels. The highest dose was abandoned due to loss of tolerability that was attributed to a loss of selectivity for Treg cells. The data from the trial showed evidence of approximately two-to-four

fold expansion of systemic Treg cell populations. After eight weeks of daily subcutaneous treatment, 10 of 24 patients achieved either a response or remission, with five of these patients achieving remission. In the lowest dose group, one of four patients achieved a remission and in the higher-dose group, nine of 15 patients achieved a response or remission. We believe that these data represent strong evidence that the Treg cellular pool can be expanded for clinical gain in the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe UC.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | Practical Rationale (i.e. tailoring systemic vs. local therapy): IBD, including UC, has both local (colonic) as well as extra-intestinal (arthritic, ocular and dermal) manifestations. The therapies currently approved for treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe UC are in general systemically active. The clinical evidence noted above that systemic Treg cell expansion can exert disease control in patients with UC further bolsters our view of treatment of IBD in a systemic manner. We believe these observations support the premise for PT101 as a systemic therapy for patients with moderate-to-severe UC.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | Strategic Rationale (i.e. establishing line of sight to clinical efficacy): The aldesleukin trial conducted by Dr. Snapper referenced above suggests that a treatment that promotes Treg cell expansion could achieve initial disease control in approximately eight weeks, which suggests that an IL-2-based therapy could establish proof-of-concept based on clinical parameters in Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials, rather than relying on biomarkers that suggest future clinical efficacy. We believe a strategy of achieving clinical proof-of-concept in early clinical trials affords the opportunity to reduce the risks associated with later-stage clinical development.

Ulcerative Colitis 
 UC is one of the principal sub-types of IBD, a chronic progressive autoimmune and inflammatory condition. In UC, the mucosal lining of the large intestine becomes inflamed, which results in the formation of ulcers. Patients with UC suffer from several gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea, rectal bleeding and weight loss, with risk of more severe complications, including colonic perforation and systemic toxicity. Although UC primarily involves the bowel, it is also associated with manifestations in other organ systems, including joints, eyes and skin. UC is characterized by a chronic course of remissions and exacerbations of various intensity and severity. 
 UC typically onsets during young adulthood and approximately 25% of UC cases are diagnosed before the age of 20. According to a report cited by the Crohn’s and Colitis Foundation, as of 2011, there were approximately 907,000 people with UC in the United States and the incidence of UC is estimated to be 12.2 per 100,000 people, or approximately 38,000 new cases per year in the United States. We estimate that, based on a report published by GlobalData, the worldwide market for UC treatments was over $5 billion in 2016 and will grow to over $7 billion by 2026. 
 Treatment Paradigm for UC
The current standard-of-care for the treatment of patients with UC is primarily immunosuppressive therapies. Treatment choices depend on the severity of the disease and a patient’s responsiveness to treatment. The medications commonly used to treat patients with moderate-to-severe UC have a higher risk of toxicity. Specifically, corticosteroids are generally used to induce clinical remission, but treatment with corticosteroids is associated with multiple adverse effects. Additionally, of the patients who initially respond to corticosteroids, approximately 28% become steroid-dependent and approximately 38% require surgical resection of the large intestine within a year of treatment. Approximately 20-30% require a colonic resection, which is curative but can result in debilitating complications. 
 Patients with moderate-to-severe UC who become nonresponsive or intolerant to corticosteroids are typically advanced to treatment with anti-TNF biologics, anti-integrin biologics, or a Janus kinase, or JAK, inhibitor. In general, these therapies have shown waning efficacy when comparing clinical response rates from 12 to 52 weeks. Some advanced therapies can have a delay in onset of up to three months, and can result in neutropenia, pancreatitis, nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity or thrombotic complications. Additional therapies for the treatment of UC are in clinical development, including oral sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-1, or S1P1, and oral integrin inhibitors, which focus on immunosuppression or interference in immune cell migration. 
 We believe that PT101 represents a novel approach to the treatment of UC and may enable us to address patients with moderate to severe UC by rebalancing the immune network via selective expansion of Treg cells and subsequent restoration of normal immune homeostasis in the intestine.

Rationale for Systemic PT101 for the Treatment of Patients with SLE 
 We are also planning to develop PT101 for the treatment of patients with SLE. Our focus on PT101 as a systemic treatment for patients with SLE derives from the three core tenets of our drug development approach: 
  
1. | Conceptual Rationale (i.e. targeting the right immune control node): The cause of SLE is unknown, however, we believe the inability of Treg cells to control conventional T cells and B cells either through Treg dysfunction or inadequate Treg levels contributes significantly to the disease pathology. We believe that selectively expanding Treg cells could be a viable treatment approach to rebalance the immune system. Our hypothesis is supported by findings from several clinical studies of IL-2. In one clinical study published in the Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases, a single patient with refractory SLE was treated with low-dose IL-2 and showed a reduction of disease activity, as measured by the systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index, corresponding with an expansion of Treg cells. Data from another clinical trial published in the Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases, in which five patients were given daily injections of subcutaneous low-dose IL-2 for five days and while clinical efficacy was not measured, these patients showed an expansion of Treg cells. In addition, the loss of CD25 expression seen in the patients’ Treg cells prior to treatment was corrected with low-dose IL-2 treatment. In a double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial of low-dose IL-2 published in Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases, 60 patients with active SLE were treated with low dose IL-2 or placebo for 12 weeks. 65.52% of patients treated with low-dose IL-2 vs. 36.67% of patients treated with placebo showed clinical response at 24 weeks as measured by the SLE responder index-4. Findings from a recently published open-label trial of low-dose IL-2 in 12 patients with SLE that were treated for five days showed that eight patients with SLE had a clinical response as measured by global clinical impression. Further evidence supporting a modified IL-2 therapy in SLE were presented at the American College of Rheumatology Annual Meeting in 2020, which showed preliminary evidence of dose dependent improvements in skin outcomes and an increase in Treg cells in patients with mild to moderate SLE in a Phase 1b clinical trial of a pegylated IL-2 product candidate. We believe these data provide a strong rationale that Treg expansion can provide clinical benefit for patients with SLE.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | Practical Rationale (i.e. tailoring systemic vs. local therapy): SLE is a prototypical systemic autoimmune disease, affecting many major organ systems. Therefore, we believe treatment with PT101 as a systemic therapy is most appropriate for SLE.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | Strategic Rationale (i.e. establishing line of sight to clinical efficacy): Data from the clinical trials mentioned above suggest that treatment that promotes an approximately two-fold expansion of Treg cells achieved disease control following 12-24 weeks of treatment. We believe that an IL-2-based therapy could suggest proof-of-concept based on clinical parameters in Phase 2 clinical trials, and a strategy of achieving clinical proof-of-concept in mid-stage clinical trials affords the opportunity to reduce the risks associated with later-stage clinical development.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Systemic Lupus Erythematosus
SLE is a chronic autoimmune disease. It typically affects the skin, joints and internal organs, including the kidneys, heart and brain. The severity of SLE can range from mild to life-threatening. Serious complications of SLE include inflammation of the kidneys, or lupus nephritis, which can lead to end stage kidney disease, which in turn often requires dialysis or kidney transplant; cerebritis, or inflammation of the brain which can lead to seizures, stroke or death; and hardening of the arteries, which can lead to a heart attack or heart failure. Overall, SLE increases the risk of death compared to healthy individuals. Most patients experience periods of disease activity, or flares, and periods of remission, which can occur frequently or years apart, regardless of whether the patient is on therapy. SLE often negatively impacts patients’ lives leading to impaired quality of life and increased work disability. 
 According to the Lupus Foundation of America, approximately one million people in the U.S. are living with SLE, with approximately 11,000 new cases reported each year. SLE most frequently affects women of childbearing age, with 90% of the cases being in women and most cases having developed between the ages of 15 and 44. We estimate that, based on a report published by GlobalData, the worldwide market for SLE treatments was over $935 million in 2018 and will grow to over $1.6 billion by 2028. 
 Treatment Paradigm for SLE
There is no cure for SLE. Current treatments focus on suppressing chronic inflammation and preventing the progressive organ damage. The treatments used vary depending on the severity and location of the disease manifestation. The current standard of care for the long-term treatment of SLE is hydroxychloroquine. Corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and immunosuppressive agents are also used in the treatment and management of SLE. We believe current treatments are only modestly effective and present safety and/or immune suppression concerns with prolonged use. 
 In 2011, the FDA approved the first drug for SLE in more than 50 years, belimumab, an antibody that targets B lymphocyte stimulator, in combination with standard therapy. However, the modest therapeutic benefit of belimumab and delayed onset of improvement in disease activity suggest the need for additional therapeutic strategies for patients with SLE. More recently, in randomized controlled clinical trials, anifrolumab, an antibody that binds to a subunit of the type I interferon receptor in development 
 11

by AstraZeneca, has shown to benefit patients with SLE in clinical trials and AstraZeneca has disclosed plans to submit to the FDA for approval. We believe, based on published anifrolumab data, that additional therapies for SLE will still be needed even if it is approved. 
 We believe that PT101 represents a novel approach to the treatment of SLE and has the potential to restore normal immune homeostasis throughout the organ systems involved in SLE in patients. 
 Clinical Development of Systemically Delivered PT101
Phase 1a Clinical Trial of PT101 in Healthy Volunteers
We filed a clinical trial application, or a CTA, with Health Canada in December 2019, and we commenced our Phase 1a clinical trial of PT101 in Canada in February 2020. We completed enrollment and dosing in October 2020 and reported positive top-line data in January 2021. 
 The Phase 1a clinical trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled single dose escalation trial in healthy adult subjects. The trial enrolled 56 healthy subjects across seven cohorts who each a received a subcutaneous fixed dose of placebo or PT101 ranging from 1.0 mg to 10.0 mg. Each cohort enrolled eight subjects who were randomized 3:1 (six active subjects and two placebo subjects). Subjects were followed for 28 days after dosing. The primary objective of the trial was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of PT101 following a single subcutaneous administration. The secondary objectives include evaluation of the drug-response (pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic) relationship, including the response of Treg cells as well as other types of immune cells, as an assessment of the selectivity of PT101 in order to establish proof of mechanism. 
 Prior to each dose escalation, there was a formal review by an independent, multi-disciplinary safety review committee, or SRC. The SRC was charged with reviewing in an unblinded manner the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) study data and making further dose recommendations for the trial. After three cohorts had been dosed, the SRC reported that PT101 elicited what we believe to be its maximum total Treg cell response without eliciting a loss of selectivity as characterized by an observation that levels of conventional T cells and NK cells did not significantly increase. Accordingly, we and the SRC believed the Phase 1a trial had explored the full dose range of PT101. We therefore dosed additional cohorts within the already tested range. Doses tested were as follows: placebo (n= 14 subjects), 1.0 mg (n=6 subjects), 3.5 mg (n=12 subjects), 5.0 mg (n=12 subjects), 7.5 mg (n=6 subjects) and 10.0 mg (n=6 subjects). 
 We observed the following results in our Phase 1a clinical trial. 
 PT101 was Observed to be Safe and Well-Tolerated. Safety and tolerability were the primary objective of the clinical trial. There were no serious adverse events or dose-limiting toxicities reported in the trial and no subject withdrew from the trial. We did not observe any clinically important changes in vital signs or electrocardiograms. All of the reported adverse events were low grade (Grade 1 or 2), self-limited, reversible, and monitorable. The most frequently reported adverse events were Grade 1 injection site reactions of itching, redness or pain. Self-limited skin reactions extending beyond the injection site occurred in some subjects at the 7.5 mg and 10.0 mg doses. Mild Grade 1 dyspnea was reported in three subjects with no physical exam findings, no limitation in activity, and no requirement for treatment. Grade 2 adverse events were only observed in the 10.0 mg cohort. In laboratory tests, some patients showed transient elevations in the number of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell, that were self-limited in nature and did not require medical treatment. We believe that the eosinophil elevation may be related to the IL-2 mechanism of PT101. These laboratory findings were self-limited, did not require medical treatment, and were not deemed adverse. Changes in eosinophil levels have been reported after treatment with both native IL-2 and other modified IL-2s. We believe changes in eosinophil levels may represent an on-mechanism effect for drugs that stimulate the CD25 receptor, such as PT101. We did not observe any induction of anti-drug antibodies. 
 The table below presents the number of adverse events at each dose level. 
 
 
 | Placebo(n=14) | 1.0 mg(n=6) | 3.5 mg(n=12) | 5.0 mg(n=12) | 7.5 mg(n=6) | 10 mg(n=6)
Number with any AE (%) | 3 (21%) | 2 (33%) | 3 (33%) | 4 (33%) | 4 (67%) | 4 (67%) 

 PT101 Selectively Expanded Total Treg Cells. PT101 expanded total Treg cells with a mean maximal increase of up to 3.6-fold over baseline as measured in serum, which was achieved in the 3.5 mg dose. Mean maximal increase in total Treg cells was 1.4-fold in placebo, 1.8-fold in subjects treated with 1.0 mg of PT101, 3.6-fold in subjects treated with 3.5 mg, 3.5-fold in subjects treated with 5 mg, 3.4-fold in subjects treated with 7.5 mg and 3.2-fold in subjects treated with 10 mg. At doses of 3.5 mg and above, PT101 induced a two-fold or greater expansion of total Treg cells in more than 80% of subjects. Treg cells returned to baseline or near baseline over the 28-day follow-up period, supporting our plan to utilize an every four week dosing regimen in future clinical trials. 
 12

PT101 Expanded CD25 Bright Treg Cells. PT101 expanded CD25 bright Treg cells with a mean maximal increase of up to 72.5-fold over baseline, which was achieved in the 3.5 mg dose. CD25 bright Treg cells are a subset of activated Treg cells with high expression of CD25, which is also known as the IL-2 receptor alpha subunit. CD25 bright Treg cells may be a more active subset of Treg cells with enhanced immune regulatory function. Mean maximal increase in the CD25 bright subset of Treg cells was 3.4-fold in placebo, 8.6-fold in subjects treated with 1.0 mg of PT101, 72.5-fold in subjects treated with 3.5 mg, 54.1-fold in subjects treated with 5 mg, 51.6-fold in subjects treated with 7.5 mg and 37.4-fold in subjects treated with 10 mg. 
 
 
 | Placebo(n=14) | 1.0 mg(n=6) | 3.5 mg(n=12) | 5.0 mg(n=12) | 7.5 mg(n=6) | 10 mg(n=6) 
Mean peak fold expansion of Total Treg cells (SEM) | 1.4 (±0.08) | 1.8 (±0.31) | 3.6 (±0.66) | 3.5 (±0.37) | 3.4 (±0.57) | 3.2 (±0.24) 
Mean peak fold expansion of CD25bright Treg Subset (SEM) | 3.4 (±0.49) | 8.6 (±3.33) | 72.5 (±26.39) | 54.1 (±8.89) | 51.6 (±17.17) | 37.4 (±6.93)

 SEM = standard error of the mean 
 
There was no Evidence of Expansion of NK Cells and Conventional T Cells. We did not observe evidence of expansion of NK cells and conventional T cells, which included both CD4 and CD8 T cells. Across all doses and at multiple timepoints post treatment with PT101, circulating levels of conventional T cells and NK cells remained within the normal baseline range. 
 In June 2020, we received written pre-IND feedback from the FDA regarding the design of our planned Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of PT101 in patients with UC. We plan to submit an IND in the first half of 2021 that will include data from the Phase 1a clinical trial and IND-enabling studies as well as manufacturing data. 
 Subject to regulatory feedback, we expect to commence a global Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of PT101 in adult patients with moderate-to-severe UC at multiple sites in the United States, Canada and Europe in mid-2021. The planned Phase 1b/2a trial design will incorporate key learnings from pivotal trials of drugs approved for the treatment of UC. The planned target patient population will include patients who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to prior therapies, including corticosteroids, biologics or JAK inhibitors. We anticipate that this trial will be a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial to further evaluate the safety and pharmacodynamics of PT101, and to assess its preliminary clinical efficacy, characterized by an improvement in clinical, histologic, and endoscopic disease activity. 
 In addition, and subject to further regulatory feedback, we plan to initiate a global Phase 2 clinical trial of PT101 in adult patients with SLE. We anticipate that this clinical trial will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety, pharmacodynamics and preliminary clinical efficacy of multiple doses PT101 in patients with SLE. We plan to initiate the trial in the second half of 2021. 
 Preclinical Studies of Systemically Delivered PT101 
 In our preclinical studies we have observed that PT101 selectively activated Treg cells in vitro and selectively expanded Treg cells in vivo. We have not observed significant activation or expansion of other types of immune cells, including conventional T cells or NK cells, at any investigated dose in non-human primates. 

 13

We conducted a preclinical study comparing the activity of wild-type IL-2 and PT101 on isolated human blood cells in vitro. We evaluated the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5, or STAT5, which is a molecule downstream of IL-2R signaling that is commonly used to assess cellular activation by IL-2. With increasing doses of wild-type IL-2, we observed evidence of activation (i.e. pSTAT5) in conventional T cells, Treg cells and NK cells. With increasing doses of PT101, we only observed evidence of activation in Treg cells. We did not observe evidence of cellular activation in conventional T cells (Tconv) or NK cells in response to PT101, even at high doses in the micromolar range, suggesting PT101 may have a high degree of Treg cell selectivity. 
 

We evaluated the in vivo activity of PT101 in cynomolgus monkeys in a time-course study. In this study, we administered a single subcutaneous injection of PT101 at day 0, and then evaluated the fold change in the number of Treg cells in the blood of individual monkeys at various timepoints over 28 days (n=24 monkeys, with six per group). As shown by the figure below, we observed an approximately 40-fold increase in the absolute Treg cell numbers in the higher dose group, which peaked after day six. The Treg cell numbers were approximately two-fold elevated at the end of the study. 
 

14

We also evaluated the cellular selectivity of PT101 in cynomolgus monkeys in the same time-course study described above. The figure below shows the fold-change over baseline in the number of Treg cells as compared to other immune cell types at day seven (n=6 monkeys, highest dose group). Other than the expansion of Treg cells, we observed minimal changes in other immune cell types, which suggests that administration of PT101 resulted in a high degree of Treg cell selectivity. 
 


In the same time-course study described above, we evaluated the magnitude of Treg cell expansion across the different dose levels of PT101. We compared Treg cell numbers seven days after a single subcutaneous administration of PT101 at three different dose levels (n=6 monkeys/group). The dose levels were selected to be approximately equivalent to 3, 10 and 30 times the minimum efficacious dose, or MED, which we defined as the lowest dose that elicited Treg cell expansion in other preclinical studies in humanized mice. We observed a dose-dependent increase in Treg cell numbers in response to increasing doses of PT101 in cynomolgus monkeys in vivo. 
 
In addition to the preclinical studies described above, we conducted a 28-day good laboratory practice, or GLP, toxicology study of PT101 in cynomolgus monkeys. We administered PT101 weekly for four weeks, at three different dose levels and evaluated safety, tolerability and cellular responses (during dosing and the four-week recovery period) in six monkeys. The three different dose levels were selected to be approximately 10, 60 and 300 times the MED. Across all dose levels, we did not observe any adverse events, setting our no-observed-adverse-effect-level at a dose level equivalent to approximately 300 times the MED. We observed increases in Treg cells at each dose level without an increase in other immune cell types, including conventional T cells and NK cells, suggesting that administration of PT101 resulted in a high degree of selectivity for Treg cells, including at doses approximately 300 times higher than the MED. 
 15

We conducted a six-month GLP toxicology study of PT101 in cynomolgus monkeys. In this study, we administered PT101 weekly for six months at three different dose levels, which were selected to be approximately 10, 60 and 300 times the MED. Within the first three months of treatment in this ongoing study, we observed progressive skin rash in two of 14 monkeys in the mid-dose group and ten of 18 monkeys in the high-dose group. The skin findings were considered monitorable and reversible. 
 Across our preclinical studies we have observed preferential selectivity of PT101 for activating and expanding Treg cells over other immune cell types such as conventional proinflammatory T cells and NK cells in vitro and in vivo, even at high doses. In dose response studies in vivo, we observed a predictable dose-responsive expansion of Treg cells, without loss of selectivity. We did not observe a loss of selectivity in in vitro or in vivo studies in cynomolgus monkeys with doses equivalent to approximately 300 times the MED. 
 Tethered IL-2 Mutein 
 For autoimmune diseases where local drug effect may be desirable, we employed the modularity of our TALON platform to design PT101 to expand Treg cells in precise regions of target organs. We engineered a bifunctional molecule with a tissue-selective tether designed to guide delivery of the IL-2 mutein effector module to a specific tissue and to drive high local concentrations of the effector with prolonged residence times within the organ of interest. 
 
To create a tethered IL-2 mutein, we set out to design a bifunctional molecule without altering the activity of the IL-2 mutein component, and to retain selectivity for expansion of Treg cells over conventional T cells and NK cells even at high local concentration. 
 PT002: MAdCAM-tethered-IL-2 mutein 
 PT002 is tethered bifunctional molecule that utilizes our IL-2 mutein effector module coupled with a MAdCAM-tether module. PT002 is designed to deliver the IL-2 mutein effector to the gastrointestinal tract where MAdCAM is expressed. MAdCAM is a protein that is expressed on specialized small blood vessels, known as high endothelial venules, or HEV, in the gastrointestinal tract. MAdCAM controls the selective migration of gut-homing immune cells from circulation into the underlying mucosal tissues of the gastrointestinal tract. MAdCAM expression is increased on the HEV in the gastrointestinal tract in response to inflammation. MAdCAM can also be induced under inflammatory conditions on the HEV in other organs, such as the liver and pancreas. 
 We designed PT002 to present a stimulatory signal for selective Treg cell expansion as these cells interact with MAdCAM to enter the wall of the gastrointestinal tract, or liver or pancreas. Published literature suggests immune cells must interact with MAdCAM for trafficking into the gut, and we believe that MAdCAM represents a compelling target to deliver a localized IL-2 mutein. We are currently conducting preclinical studies of PT002. 
 PD-1 Agonists 
 PD-1 is a protein natively expressed by activated T cells and serves as a checkpoint for the attenuation of immune activation. We have two research-stage PD-1 agonist programs: PT627 and PT001. PT627 is a systemic PD-1 agonist for which we initiated IND-enabling studies in the fourth quarter of 2020. PT001 is a PD-1 agonist effector module fused with a MAdCAM-selective tissue tether module to drive localization to the gastrointestinal tract, and we plan to initiate IND-enabling studies in the first half of 2021. 
Immune Checkpoints and Immune System Control with PD-1 Agonists 
 Immune cells patrolling the body can rapidly activate powerful cellular defense mechanisms in response to invading pathogens. Immune cell activity is controlled by many activating and inhibitory factors, including activating receptors and inhibitory receptors, or checkpoints, which are expressed at the surface of these cells. Checkpoint proteins function as important control nodes within the immune network and are critical for development of self-tolerance, in order to prevent the immune system from attacking a host’s own cells indiscriminately. 
 PD-1 is an inhibitory receptor that is naturally expressed by T cells following their activation. PD-1 responds to two primary ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. Stimulation of PD-1 on T cells suppresses the T cell receptor and costimulatory receptor signaling pathways, thereby promoting cellular exhaustion, functional inactivation, and programmed cell death. 
 Mutations and disruptions in the interactions between PD-1 and its ligands have been associated with numerous autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes. In oncology, blocking the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands using checkpoint inhibitors has been associated with autoimmune adverse events in clinical trials. These data provide evidence that checkpoints such as PD-1 play a fundamental role in regulating normal immune responses. We believe that 
 16

inducing signaling through these checkpoint receptors may switch off detrimental immune responses and drive the immune system back toward a state of tolerance after control has been lost in autoimmune disease. The stimulation of PD-1 may have the potential to benefit patients in a wide array of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. 
 
Systemic PD-1 Agonist: PT627 
 Based on the understood biology of PD-1, we believe agonism of PD-1 is an approach to intervene in ongoing activated T cell responses to prevent excessive and uncontrolled reactivity that can result in damage to host tissues. For a compound to act as a PD-1 agonist however, it must bind to, and be capable of delivering a signal through, the native PD-1 receptor. For most PD-1 agonists described to date, the delivery of that signal has required the agonist to be attached to a cell surface. 
 We are currently in preclinical development of PD-1 agonist antibody-based effectors that mimic the inhibitory effects of PD-1 without blocking the natural interaction between PD-1 and its ligands. Our efforts have generated PT627, a PD-1 agonist that does not require surface binding and retains its function when free floating in solution. Given the potential of PT627 to inhibit PD-1 within tissues as well as in the bloodstream, we believe it represents a markedly differentiated approach to PD-1 agonism. 
 We are currently conducting IND-enabling studies of PT627. We plan to file an IND with the FDA in 2022. 
 Tethered PD-1 Agonists: PT001 
 Published evidence suggests that PD-1 action is a local phenomenon, that is within restricted regions of organs where an active immune process is ongoing. Consistently, there is evidence from published clinical trials that treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint antagonists for oncology can induce organ-specific autoimmune injury, most prevalent in the intestine (autoimmune colitis), liver (an autoimmune-like hepatitis), skin (vitiligo and alopecia), and thyroid, and there is evidence that beta cell destruction may lead to type 1 diabetes. 
 Utilizing a PD-1 effector module fused to a tissue-tether module, we believe we can guide delivery of a PD-1 immune effector payload to the specific tissue location of immune attack for a given disease. PT001 is our bifunctional MAdCAM-tethered-PD-1 agonist utilizing the effector module of PT627. We designed the effector module to present both a systemic, as well as a concentrated local, PD-1 agonist signal. Specifically, we designed PT001 to concentrate its signal at the point of entry for inflammatory cells as these cells interact with MAdCAM as they migrate into the gastrointestinal tract wall, or liver or pancreas. Published literature suggests immune cells must interact with MAdCAM for trafficking into the gut, and we believe that MAdCAM represents a compelling target for localized PD-1 agonism presentation. We are currently conducting preclinical studies of PT001 and plan to begin IND-enabling studies in the first half of 2021. 
 Preclinical Studies of PT627 and PT001 
 In our preclinical studies we identified multiple PD-1 agonist antibodies that attenuate immune responses in vitro and in vivo. We conducted a series of in vitro functional screens to identify and prioritize antibodies with agonist, but not antagonist, activity for the PD-1 inhibitory receptor. In these discovery efforts, we prioritized antibodies that agonized PD-1 to attenuate immune activity without interfering with natural ligand binding. 
 We conducted three in vitro functional screening assays to prioritize our PD-1 antibodies. The first in vitro functional screen used a reporter cell line and was designed to identify, and then eliminate, any PD-1 antibodies that interfered with or blocked the natural ligand binding site. As shown in the left figure below, we used pembrolizumab, a checkpoint antagonist, as a positive control for identifying unwanted checkpoint antagonist activity. We screened a panel of PD-1 antibodies and selected only PD-1 antibodies, including PT627, that did not exhibit checkpoint antagonist activity when compared with pembrolizumab. 

 17

The second and third in vitro functional screens used the reporter cell line but were designed to identify, and then select for further study, PD-1 antibodies that could directly agonize PD-1. We screened our panel of PD-1 antibodies in a surface-bound assay format (middle figure below) and a soluble assay format (right figure below). We identified a number of PD-1 agonist antibodies, including PT627, that exhibited agonist activity when evaluated in this surface-bound assay format. However, we identified only one antibody, PT627, that additionally exhibited agonist activity in a soluble assay format. Each of the figures below shows the PD-1 signaling complex formation of the molecules being tested. The PD-1 signaling complex formation is measured using a light-based method in which a high value signals activity and a low value signals a lack of activity. 
 

Collectively, we believe these observations suggest PT627 may have a differentiated profile because of its ability to induce PD-1 agonism in a soluble format without requiring surface binding. We believe that PT627 may be a differentiated antibody in which PD-1 agonism may be achieved without requiring cell binding. 
 We evaluated the immunomodulatory activity of PT627 in a humanized mouse xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease, or xeno-GvHD, model, an aggressive model of multi-organ autoimmune injury. In this model, human blood cells are grafted into immunodeficient mice. The grafted immune cells reacted to the host mouse tissues causing wide-spread, multi-organ inflammation, and a rapid loss of life. We dosed xeno-GvHD mice with PT627 at weekly intervals beginning ten days after engraftment and continued through day 72. As show in the figure below, we observed a delayed onset of disease in xeno-GvHD mice treated with PT627 compared with vehicle treated mice (n=15 mice/group). These observations suggest PT627 may attenuate or delay the broad in vivo inflammatory responses associated with the xeno-GvHD model. 
 

18

We designed PT001 to guide and concentrate the PD-1 agonist component of the bifunctional molecule to the MAdCAM-expressing HEV in the gastrointestinal tract. We first evaluated the ability of PT001 to localize to the MAdCAM-expressing HEV in the gastrointestinal tract in vivo. We injected PT001, or the untethered-control test article, subcutaneously into mice with chemically induced intestinal inflammation. Seven days after dosing, we harvested the intestines and stained the tissues by immunohistochemistry. We detected PT001 as indicated by the brown staining in the image on the right below with the expected tissue distribution pattern in the gut, but we did not detect untethered control test article. These observations suggest that PT001, but not untethered-control molecules, is able to localize to the HEV in the gastrointestinal tract in vivo following subcutaneous dosing in mice. 
 


We next evaluated the in vivo immunomodulatory activity of PT001 in the humanized mouse xeno-GvHD model. We dosed xeno-GvHD mice with PT001 at weekly intervals beginning at day 10 after engraftment and continuing through day 72. We observed a distinct survival advantage in xeno-GvHD mice treated with PT001 compared to vehicle or control treated mice or mice treated with PT627 (n=15 mice/group). We observed that the survival advantage in mice treated with PT001 extended a number of weeks beyond the end of the dosing period. These studies suggest that tethering a PD-1 agonist can have a beneficial immunomodulatory effect that is differentiated from the beneficial immunomodulatory effect observed with a soluble PD-1 agonist. 
 


In February 2021, we presented preclinical data of PT001 at the Network for Pancreatic Organ Donors with Diabetes 13th Annual Scientific Meeting. The research, done in collaboration with St. Vincent’s Institute of Medical Research in Australia and funded by JDRF and the JDRF T1D Fund, showed that PT001 treatment delayed the onset of hyperglycemia in a mouse model of type 1 diabetes.
 In summary, observations from our preclinical studies suggest PD-1 agonist antibodies can attenuate immune responses in vitro and in vivo. Although PT627 and PT001 exhibited different activity profiles, we observed promising immunomodulatory effects with both PD-1 agonists in the xeno-GvHD mouse model. Preclinical data presented at the Annual FOCIS Meeting in 2020 showed that in cell-based assays, our PD-1 agonists suppressed the gene and protein expression of many known immune activation pathways, suggesting that these agonists could be a promising treatment approach for autoimmune diseases. 
 19


We believe that we can create a pipeline of molecules by mixing and matching our immunomodulatory immune effectors with different tissue-tether components from our library of tissue tethers to drive localization to different organs. By switching the MAdCAM tissue-tether component for a tissue-tether component that drives localization to a different organ, we believe that we have the ability to build a broad portfolio of tissue-tethered PD-1 agonists that can be deployed to deliver localized immunomodulatory therapy to different parts of the body for treating a wide array of other diseases. 
 The potential of our tissue-tethered PD-1 bifunctional molecules to localize to organs to contribute to the maintenance of normal immune homeostasis, contribute to the resolution of inflammation, and be associated with better disease prognosis affords us the opportunity to attenuate the local inflammatory response and restore tissue tolerance in a targeted manner while potentially sparing the systemic immune system. 
 Discovery Programs 
 Induction of local immunomodulation via bifunctional TALONs 
 Skin-Tethered CD39 
 CD39 is an extracellular enzyme that is expressed on the surface of numerous immune cells. It is regarded as an immune checkpoint in that it functions to inhibit the immune system by degrading ATP into AMP. Extracellular ATP acts as a danger signal, binding to cell surface receptors and activating a wide range of innate and adaptive immune responses such as those observed during chronic inflammation. CD39 removes this key danger signal and thereby dampens the resultant multi-cellular immune response. A partner enzyme to CD39, CD73, then degrades AMP into adenosine, which is an anti-inflammatory mediator. Together, CD39 and CD73 constitute a mechanism that the immune system uses to remove proinflammatory ATP and to generate anti-inflammatory adenosine. 
 Deficiencies in CD39 or CD73 can result in a diminished population of Treg cells and enhanced immune cell activity, leading to exacerbated inflammation in several preclinical mouse models of autoimmunity such as lupus, collagen-induced arthritis, and experimental autoimmune encephalopathy. Overexpression of CD39 has been shown to suppress disease in a model of type 1 diabetes. Third parties are currently evaluating approaches for overexpressing or delivering recombinant CD39 or CD73 in preclinical studies. 
 We created a mouse recombinant CD39 effector module that behaves similar to wild-type mouse CD39. Using our TALON platform, we coupled this CD39 effector module to a skin-tethered module designed to concentrate the CD39 payload at the dermal-epidermal interface. In order to test whether the concentration of CD39 at the skin barrier would have advantages over a systemically active CD39 molecule, we compared this skin-tethered-CD39 bifunctional module to CD39 on a systemically active backbone, as well as to a steroid positive control (dexamethasone) in a rodent model of contact hypersensitivity. In this model, the mouse is sensitized with antigen, and then a day after test article injection, the ear of the mouse is injected with that antigen, which induces a brisk contact hypersensitivity response characterized by ear swelling, which can be measured as ear thickness. Treating the animal with vehicle allowed the full response to manifest, evidence as marked ear thickening. Treating with the systemically active CD39 had no meaningful efficacy, however concentrating CD39 in the skin via the skin-tethered CD39 prototype abrogated the response to a degree akin to steroid (dexamethasone). The data observed in this study are shown in the figure below. 
 
20


Both modules of this molecule, CD39 effector and skin-tether, are currently undergoing iterative stages of protein engineering to refine their biological properties. 
 Skin-Tethered PD-1 Agonist 
 PD-1 is a protein natively expressed by activated T cells and serves as a checkpoint for the attenuation of immune activation. In addition to our two PD-1 agonist programs, PT627 and PT001, mentioned above, we have a discovery-stage program of a PD-1 agonist coupled with a skin-tethered module. We designed this molecule to concentrate the PD-1 agonist at the dermal-epidermal interface in the skin. 
 We tested this molecule in a mouse model of vitiligo, an autoimmune skin condition that leads to depigmentation of the skin. In this model, vitiligo was induced through adoptive transfer of melanocyte-specific T cells. We administered PD-1 agonists weekly for five weeks post disease induction and then, upon the conclusion of dosing, calculated a vitiligo score using a point scale based on the extent of depigmentation at different locations. We observed that treatment with the skin-tethered PD-1 agonist significantly reduced skin depigmentation as shown by the vitiligo scores. We also observed that this effect was tether-dependent, as mice treated with an untethered PD-1 agonist had scores that were similar to the vehicle-treated mice. These data are shown in the figure below. In addition, we observed that the skin-tethered PD-1 agonist selectively reduced the number of T cells found in the skin, but did not observe a reduction of systemic T cells. 
 

The skin-tethered PD-1 agonist is currently undergoing iterative stages of protein engineering to refine its biological and drug-like properties. 
 New Tissue Tether Modules 
 We are actively building a library to tether modules to target our immune effectors to various organs where autoimmune attack is known to occur. Beyond MAdCAM for gastrointestinal and hepatic autoimmunity, and our skin tethers as noted above, we have active programs for renal and pancreatic tether discovery. We are also expanding our library of tethers to other organ systems where autoimmune disease may manifest. 
 Our pancreatic program is partnered with Astellas. Under this collaboration to develop locally acting immunomodulators for autoimmune diseases of the pancreas, we are responsible for the design and discovery of bifunctional product candidates based on our TALON platform, and Astellas will conduct preclinical, clinical and commercialization activities for any candidates developed in the collaboration. Our initial focus for our activities under this collaboration is on type 1 diabetes.

Competition 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, expertise, scientific knowledge and intellectual property provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize may compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
 Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. 
 The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our product candidates that we develop for the treatment of autoimmune disease, if approved, are likely to be efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. 
 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products. If our product candidates achieve marketing approval, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products. 
 We are aware of several other companies developing programs that utilize IL-2 for the selective expansion of regulatory T cells, including Amgen Inc., Nektar Therapeutics (in partnership with Eli Lilly & Company), Roche Holding AG, or Roche, and Bristol-Myers Squibb, or BMS. We are also aware of other companies with research or preclinical-stage programs in this area, including Synthorx, Inc. (a subsidiary of Sanofi S.A.), Moderna, Inc. and Xencor, Inc. We are also aware of other companies with PD-1 agonist programs for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, including AnaptysBio, Inc., BMS, and Eli Lilly & Company, Janssen Pharmaceuticals and Ono Pharmaceuticals.

 Manufacturing 
 We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We rely on and expect to continue to rely on third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, for both drug substance and finished drug product. We have engaged third-party manufacturers to supply the drug substances for our product candidates and a third-party manufacturer to develop and manufacture finished drug product for PT101 that we plan to use in our Phase 1 clinical trials. We currently obtain our supplies from these manufacturers on a purchase order basis and do not have long-term supply arrangements in place. Should any of these manufacturers become unavailable to us for any reason, we believe that there are a number of potential replacements, although we may incur some delay in identifying and qualifying such replacements. 
 Our product candidates are manufactured using reliable processes from readily available starting materials. The approach is amenable to scale up and does not require unusual equipment in the manufacturing process. We expect to continue to develop product candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We strive to protect the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business, including pursuing and maintaining patent protection intended to cover the composition of matter of our product candidates, their methods of use, related technologies and other inventions that are important to our business. In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection, including certain aspects of our TALON platform. 
 Our commercial success depends in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technologies, inventions and know how related to our business, defend and enforce our intellectual property rights, in particular, our patent rights, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing valid and enforceable intellectual property rights of others. 
 The patent positions for biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies like ours are generally uncertain and can involve complex legal, scientific and factual issues. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before a patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted and even challenged after issuance. As a result, we cannot guarantee that any of our product candidates will be protected or remain protectable by enforceable patents. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties. 
 
As of December 31, 2020, our solely owned patent estate included three issued U.S. patents, six pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications, three pending U.S. provisional applications, three international PCT applications pending, and over 35 pending foreign patent application. 
 PT101 
 With regard to our PT101 product candidate, we solely own one issued U.S. patent with composition of matter claims covering PT101, which is expected to expire in 2038, without taking potential patent term extensions into account. In addition, we also own three pending U.S. patent applications with composition of matter and method of use claims covering PT101 and its use, and over 14 foreign patent applications pending in jurisdictions such as Europe, Japan, Australia, Canada, China, and Korea, which, if issued, are expected to expire in 2038, without taking potential patent term extensions into account. 
 23

We are aware of certain European and other foreign patents and applications owned by a third party with claims that are broadly directed methods of using IL-2 muteins to treat certain autoimmune disease indications, including, but not limited to, rheumatoid arthritis. The patents or patents issuing from these pending applications could be construed to cover PT101, as well as other products containing IL-2 muteins. We are not currently evaluating PT101 for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.

 With regard to our PT002 patent candidate, we own one issued U.S. patent with composition of matter claims covering PT002, which is expected to expire in 2038, without taking potential patent term extensions into account. We also own two U.S. provisional patent applications, eight pending U.S. non-provisional applications and over 35 foreign patent applications pending in jurisdictions such as Europe, Japan, Australia, Canada, China, and Korea, which, if issued, would be expected to expire from 2038 to 2041, without taking potential patent term extensions into account. 
 License and Collaboration Agreements 
 License and Collaboration Agreement with Astellas Pharma 
 In October 2019, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Astellas, or the Astellas agreement. The Astellas agreement is a research and development collaboration to discover and develop novel compounds for autoimmune diseases of the pancreas, including type 1 diabetes. Under the Astellas agreement, we are responsible for design and discovery of drug candidates and Astellas will be responsible for conducting preclinical, clinical and commercialization activities for candidates developed during the collaboration. 
 Under the Astellas agreement, we and Astellas will conduct a research collaboration program to discover, identify, characterize and optimize bifunctional antibodies or other biologics consisting of a tissue-selective tether and an effector, or Compounds. The Astellas agreement provides that the research term will end on the earlier of (a) the completion of the activities set forth in the research plan and (b) the fifth anniversary of the effective date of the Astellas agreement. We have estimated that our research and development commitments will be completed by the end of 2022. All research activities under the Astellas agreement are conducted according to a research plan. The initial research plan is focused on three tissue-selective tether targets in the pancreas. The primary indication for which we and Astellas will seek to develop Compounds is type 1 diabetes, including latent autoimmune diabetes in adults. Under the collaboration, we may also develop Compounds for the treatment of any human disease or condition, which we refer to as non-primary indications. 
 We are obligated to generate Compounds and to perform in vitro and in vivo characterization activities necessary or useful in support of the nomination of a Compound for consideration by the joint steering committee, or JSC, consisting of an equal number representatives from each party to coordinate, oversee and resolve disputes under the Astellas agreement. Either party may nominate a Compound to the JSC during the research term to be designated by the JSC as a Licensed Compound for development. Following the designation of a Licensed Compound, Astellas is solely responsible for, and has sole authority with respect to, at its own expense, all non-clinical and clinical development activities of the Licensed Compound, including all manufacturing. Astellas will also be solely responsible for, and have sole authority with respect to, at its own expense, all commercialization activities and all regulatory responsibilities, including preparing and filing INDs, marketing authorization applications and obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals for any product that contains a Licensed Compound as an active ingredient, referred to as a Licensed Product. Astellas is required to reimburse certain of our research costs for activities under the research plan. 
 24

Astellas paid us an upfront payment of $10.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. We have the right to receive, on a Licensed Compound-by-Licensed Compound basis, potential research and development milestone payments up to an aggregate of $43.0 million for the first Licensed Compound and $38.0 million for subsequent Licensed Compounds and regulatory milestones up to an aggregate of $105.0 million. If any Astellas Licensed Products are successfully commercialized, we would be eligible to receive, on a Licensed Compound-by-Licensed Compound basis, up to $150.0 million in potential commercial milestone payments based on the worldwide net sales of all Licensed Products containing the same Licensed Compound. 
 We are also eligible to receive from Astellas, on a Licensed Product-by-Licensed Product basis, tiered royalties at rates ranging from mid- to high-single digit percentages based on worldwide net sales by Astellas, its affiliates and sublicensees, subject to specified reductions. Any royalty payments owed to us are subject to reduction when there is no valid claim covering such product and regulatory exclusivity does not apply to such Licensed Product in such country or where one or more biosimilar products becomes commercially available in such country. Royalty payments under the Astellas agreement are payable beginning on the first commercial sale of the product in the country until the later of the expiration of the last valid claim covering such product, expiration of regulatory exclusivity or eleven years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country, but the royalty payments generally may not fall below our royalty obligations to third parties plus a royalty of a low single-digit percentage. 
 During the term of the Astellas agreement, we are not permitted to use tethers targeted at certain proteins expressed on pancreatic cells that are identified in the research plan, or develop, manufacture or commercialize any product directed toward tether targets that are identified in the research plan, or, in either case, grant a license to a third party or sublicense to enable any third party to do so. 
 
Any time after the first anniversary of the effective date of the Astellas agreement, Astellas may terminate the Astellas agreement for convenience upon advance prior written notice. Each party has the right to terminate the Astellas agreement due to the other party’s material breach if such breach remains uncured for a specified cure period or if the other party becomes bankrupt. We have the right to terminate the agreement under certain circumstances if Astellas or any of its sublicensees challenges the validity or enforceability of any of our patent rights. The Astellas agreement will automatically terminate if no Licensed Compound has been designated by the date that is six months after the expiration of the research period. 
 Distributed Bio 
 In October 2017, we entered into an antibody library subscription agreement with Distributed Bio, Inc., or Distributed Bio. We refer to this agreement as the Distributed Bio library agreement. Pursuant to the Distributed Bio library agreement, we obtained a non-exclusive license to use an antibody library of Distributed Bio, or the Antibody Library, anti-PD-1 antibodies isolated from the Antibody Library by Distributed Bio, or the Anti-PD-1 Antibodies, and certain software to conduct research and development related to the discovery of antibodies against biological targets of interest to us. We refer to the Antibody Library, the Anti-PD-1 Antibodies and the software collectively as the Deliverables. Distributed Bio has also agreed to assign to us and we own all rights in the sequences of any Anti-PD-1 Antibody and antibody sequences that we identify by panning the Antibody Library, or the Panned Antibodies, including any derivative sequences and any molecules or products containing or any method of manufacture or use of any of the foregoing, which we refer to collectively as the Assigned Antibody Rights. 
 We are required to make milestone payments to Distributed Bio upon achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones with respect to any antibody that has a target recognition site derived from an Anti-PD-1 Antibody, a Panned Antibody or an antibody provided by Distributed Bio under any other agreement with us, and that is included in the Assigned Antibody Rights, which we refer to as an Antibody Product. We may be required to pay up to $4.3 million in clinical milestones and $12.0 million in regulatory milestones for each Antibody Product. Each such milestone payment will be paid only once with respect to any set of targets to which any Antibody Product is directed. The milestone payments may be offset by up to 50% of any amount paid by us to any third party for the achievement of the same or similar milestones with respect to any Antibody Product. 
 The Distributed Bio library agreement had an initial term, on a Deliverable-by-Deliverable basis, of one year from receipt of the applicable Deliverable and automatically renews for additional one-year terms. We have the right to terminate the Distributed Bio library agreement at any time, in whole or with respect to any Deliverable. The Distributed Bio library agreement may also be terminated by either party with respect to any Deliverable for material breach by the other party. 
 We also pay Distributed Bio for antibody discovery services under a master services agreement that we entered into with Distributed Bio concurrently with the Distributed Bio library agreement, which we refer to as the Distributed Bio MSA. Pursuant to the Distributed Bio MSA, we are identifying antibodies, other than the Anti-PD-1 Antibodies described above, including antibodies that relate to our MAdCAM-tethering program. We own all antibody sequences and other deliverables provided to us and inventions developed under the Distributed Bio MSA. We pay fees to Distributed Bio under the Distributed Bio MSA. We are also required to make the same milestone payments to Distributed Bio upon achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones as described in the Distributed Bio library agreement for any Antibody Product, but we will not owe milestone payments more than once for the same 
 25

Antibody Product if such milestone is achieved under both of the Distributed Bio library agreement and the Distributed Bio MSA. The Distributed Bio MSA had an initial term of one year and automatically renews for additional one-year terms. Either party can terminate the Distributed Bio MSA at any time. 
 We paid an aggregate of approximately $2.2 million in subscription fees and other fees under the Distributed Bio library agreement and Distributed Bio MSA through December 31, 2020. Beginning in 2020, we ceased subscribing to the Distributed Bio antibody library, and as a result are no longer obligated to pay subscription fees under such agreement. We continue to engage Distributed Bio for antibody discovery services pursuant to the Distributed Bio MSA and we pay for such services on a service-by-service basis. 
 Government Regulation and Product Approvals
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, pricing, reimbursement, sales, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, record-keeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products, including biological products. The processes for obtaining marketing approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
 Licensure and Regulation of Biologics in the United States 
 In the United States, our product candidates are regulated as biological products, or biologics, under the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and their implementing regulations and guidances. The failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, including preclinical testing, clinical testing, the approval process, or post-approval process, may subject an applicant to delays in the conduct of the study, regulatory review, and approval, and/or administrative or judicial sanctions. 
 An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new biologic in the United States generally must satisfactorily complete each of the following steps: 
  
• | preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies all performed in accordance with the FDA’s GLP regulations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | completion of the manufacture, under current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, conditions, of the drug substance and drug product that the sponsor intends to use in human clinical trials along with required analytical and stability testing;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, potency, and purity of the product candidate for each proposed indication, in accordance with current Good Clinical Practices, or GCP;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation and submission to the FDA of a biologics license application, or BLA, for a biologic product candidate requesting marketing for one or more proposed indications, including submission of detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product candidate in clinical development and proposed labeling;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | review of the product candidate by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities, including those of third parties, at which the product candidate, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods, and controls are adequate to preserve the product candidate’s identity, strength, quality, and purity;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of any FDA audits of the preclinical studies and clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GLP, as applicable, and GCP, and the integrity of clinical data in support of the BLA;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and any post-approval studies or other post-marketing commitments required by the FDA.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies and Investigational New Drug Application 
 Before testing any biologic product candidate in humans, the product candidate must undergo preclinical testing. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate in animal studies the potential for efficacy and toxicity. 
 An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved product candidate to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer such investigational product to humans. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions about the product candidate or conduct of the proposed clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In that case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns before the clinical trials can begin or recommence. 
 As a result, submission of the IND may result in the FDA not allowing the trials to commence or not allowing the trial to commence on the terms originally specified by the sponsor in the IND. If the FDA raises concerns or questions either during this initial 30-day period, or at any time during the IND or clinical trial process, it may choose to impose a partial or complete clinical hold. Clinical holds may be imposed by the FDA when there is an important concern for patient safety and may be a result of new data, findings, or developments in clinical, preclinical, and/or chemistry, manufacturing, and controls. This order issued by the FDA would delay either a proposed clinical trial or cause suspension of an ongoing trial, until all outstanding concerns have been adequately addressed and the FDA has notified the company that investigations may proceed. This could cause significant delays or difficulties in completing our planned clinical trial or future clinical trials in a timely manner. 
 Expanded Access to an Investigational Product for Treatment Use 
 Expanded access, sometimes called “compassionate use,” is the use of investigational products outside of clinical trials to treat patients with serious or immediately life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no comparable or satisfactory alternative treatment options. The rules and regulations related to expanded access are intended to improve access to investigational products for patients who may benefit from investigational therapies. FDA regulations allow access to investigational products under an IND by the company or the treating physician for treatment purposes on a case-by-case basis for: individual patients (single-patient IND applications for treatment in emergency settings and non-emergency settings); intermediate-size patient populations; and larger populations for use of the investigational product under a treatment protocol or treatment IND application. 
 
When considering an IND application for expanded access to an investigational product with the purpose of treating a patient or a group of patients, the sponsor and treating physicians or investigators will determine suitability when all of the following criteria apply: patient(s) have a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition, and there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy to diagnose, monitor, or treat the disease or condition; the potential patient benefit justifies the potential risks of the treatment and the potential risks are not unreasonable in the context or condition to be treated; and the expanded use of the investigational drug for the requested treatment will not interfere with the initiation, conduct, or completion of clinical investigations that could support marketing approval of the product or otherwise compromise the potential development of the product. 
 There is no obligation for a sponsor to make its drug products available for expanded access; however, as required by the 21st Century Cures Act, or Cures Act, passed in 2016, if a sponsor has a policy regarding how it responds to expanded access requests, it must make that policy publicly available. Sponsors are required to make such policies publicly available upon the earlier of initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 trial; or 15 days after the investigational drug or biologic receives designation as a breakthrough therapy, fast track product, or regenerative medicine advanced therapy. 
 In addition, on May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a manufacturer to make its investigational products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act. 
 27

Human Clinical Trials in Support of a BLA 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients with the disease or condition to be treated under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator in accordance with GCP requirements. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, inclusion and exclusion criteria, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. 
 A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. When a foreign clinical trial is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived. When a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the trial complies with certain regulatory requirements of the FDA in order to use the trial as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. Specifically, the FDA requires that such trials be conducted in accordance with GCP, including review and approval by an independent ethics committee and informed consent from participants. The GCP requirements encompass both ethical and data integrity standards for clinical trials. The FDA’s regulations are intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical trials, as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data. They further help ensure that non-IND foreign trials are conducted in a manner comparable to that required for clinical trials in the United States. 
 Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB either centrally or individually at each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. The IRB will consider, among other things, clinical trial design, patient informed consent, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects, and the possible liability of the institution. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. The FDA, IRB, or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a finding that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or that the participants are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive GCP rules and the requirements for informed consent. 
 Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, or DSMB. This group may recommend continuation of the trial as planned, changes in trial conduct, or cessation of the trial at designated check points based on certain available data from the trial to which only the DSMB has access. 
 Clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. Additional studies may be required after approval. 
  
• | Phase 1 clinical trials are initially conducted in a limited population to test the product candidate for safety, including adverse effects, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion, and pharmacodynamics in healthy humans or, on occasion, in patients, such as cancer patients.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2 clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted indications and determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more costly Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3 clinical trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval and physician labeling.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In some cases, the FDA may approve a BLA for a product but require the sponsor to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the product’s safety and effectiveness after approval. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and to confirm a clinical benefit in the case of biologics approved under accelerated approval regulations. If the FDA approves a product while a company has ongoing clinical trials that were not necessary for approval, a company may be able to use the data from these clinical trials to meet all or part of any Phase 4 clinical trial requirement or to request a change in the product labeling. The failure to exercise due diligence with regard to conducting Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of approval for products. 
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, a BLA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. Sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests, and other information required by regulation. The 
 28

applicant, the FDA, and the FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other, and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time. 
 The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extension of deferrals are contained in the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA.  The FDA maintains a list of diseases that are exempt from PREA requirements due to low prevalence of disease in the pediatric population. In 2017, with passage of the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, or FDARA, Congress further modified these provisions.  Previously, drugs that had been granted orphan drug designation were exempt from the requirements of the Pediatric Research Equity Act.
 Information about applicable clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the NIH for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website. 
 Compliance with cGMP Requirements 
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in full compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products like biologics whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. 
 Manufacturers and others involved in the manufacture and distribution of products must also register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Both domestic and foreign manufacturing establishments must register and provide additional information to the FDA upon their initial participation in the manufacturing process. Any product manufactured by or imported from a facility that has not registered, whether foreign or domestic, is deemed misbranded under the FDCA. Establishments may be subject to periodic unannounced inspections by government authorities to ensure compliance with cGMPs and other laws. Inspections generally follow a “risk-based schedule” that may result in certain establishments being inspected more frequently. Manufacturers may also have to provide, on request, electronic or physical records regarding their establishments. Delaying, denying, limiting, or refusing inspection by the FDA may lead to a product being deemed to be adulterated. 
 Review and Approval of a BLA 
 The results of product candidate development, preclinical testing, and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting license to market the product. The BLA must contain extensive manufacturing information and detailed information on the composition of the product and proposed labeling as well as payment of a user fee and an annual program fee. Under federal law, the submission of most BLAs is subject to a substantial application user fee. The sponsor of a licensed BLA is also subject to an annual program fee. Certain exceptions and waivers are available for some of these fees, such as an exception from the application fee for products with orphan designation and a waiver for certain small businesses. 
 The FDA has 60 days after submission of the application to conduct an initial review to determine whether it is sufficient to accept for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the application. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the PDUFA, the FDA has ten months in which to complete its initial review of a standard application and respond to the applicant, and six months for a priority review of the application. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs. The review process may often be significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or if the applicant otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date. 
 Under the PHSA, the FDA may approve a BLA if it determines that the product is safe, pure, and potent, and the facility where the product will be manufactured meets standards designed to ensure that it continues to be safe, pure, and potent. On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the application and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities and any FDA audits of preclinical and clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter, or CRL. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. If the application is not approved, the CRL will contain the conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the application, and when possible will outline recommended actions the sponsor might take to obtain approval of the application. Sponsors that receive a CRL may submit to the FDA information that represents a complete response to the issues identified by the FDA. The FDA will not approve an application until issues identified in CRL have been addressed. 
 29

The FDA may also refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation, and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. In particular, the FDA may refer applications for novel biologic products or biologic products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates, and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 If the FDA approves a new product, it may limit the approved indication(s) for use of the product. It may also require that contraindications, warnings, or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may call for post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, to further assess the product’s efficacy and/or safety after approval. The agency may also require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 
 Expedited Review Designations
 The FDA is authorized to expedite the review of BLAs in several ways. Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a product candidate may request the FDA to designate the product for a specific indication as a Fast Track product concurrent with or after the filing of the IND.  Candidate products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. In addition to other benefits, such as the ability to have greater interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track application before the application is complete, a process known as rolling review. 
 Any product candidate submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval. 
 Breakthrough therapy designation. To qualify for the breakthrough therapy program, product candidates must be intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence must indicate that such product candidates may demonstrate substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over existing therapies. The FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a breakthrough therapy product candidate receives intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program, intensive involvement of senior managers and experienced staff on a proactive, collaborative and cross-disciplinary review and rolling review.
 Priority review. A product candidate is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious condition and, if approved, it would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis or prevention compared to marketed products. FDA aims to complete its review of priority review applications within six months as opposed to 10 months for standard review. 
 Accelerated approval. Drug or biologic products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval. Accelerated approval means that a product candidate may be approved on the basis of adequate and well controlled clinical trials establishing that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity and prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biologic product candidate receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials. 
 Regenerative advanced therapy. With passage of the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act, in December 2016, Congress authorized the FDA to accelerate review and approval of products designated as regenerative advanced therapies. A product is eligible for this designation if it is a regenerative medicine therapy that is intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. The benefits of a regenerative advanced therapy designation include early interactions with the 
 30

FDA to expedite development and review, benefits available to breakthrough therapies, potential eligibility for priority review and accelerated approval based on surrogate or intermediate endpoints.
 None of these expedited programs change the standards for approval but they may help expedite the development or approval process of product candidates.
 Post-Approval Regulation 
 If regulatory approval for marketing of a product or new indication for an existing product is obtained, the sponsor will be required to comply with all regular post-approval regulatory requirements as well as any post-approval requirements that the FDA have imposed as part of the approval process. The sponsor will be required to report certain adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling requirements. Manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP regulations, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon manufacturers. Accordingly, the sponsor and its third-party manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP regulations and other regulatory requirements. 
 A product may also be subject to official lot release, meaning that the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official lot release, the manufacturer must submit samples of each lot, together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot, to the FDA. The FDA may in addition perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution. Finally, the FDA will conduct laboratory research related to the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of pharmaceutical products. 
 
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of prescription drug products placed on the market. This regulation includes, among other things, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet and social media. Promotional claims about a drug’s safety or effectiveness are prohibited before the drug is approved. After approval, a drug product generally may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA, as reflected in the product’s prescribing information. In the United States, healthcare professionals are generally permitted to prescribe drugs for such uses not described in the drug’s labeling, known as off-label uses, because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. However, FDA regulations impose rigorous restrictions on manufacturers’ communications, prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. 
 If a company is found to have promoted off-label uses, it may become subject to adverse public relations and administrative and judicial enforcement by the FDA, the DOJ, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed.

Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
 Orphan drug designation in the United States is designed to encourage sponsors to develop products intended for rare diseases or conditions. In the United States, a rare disease or condition is statutorily defined as a condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or that affects 200,000 or more individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the biologic for the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product in the United States. 
 Orphan drug designation qualifies a company for tax credits and market exclusivity for seven years following the date of the product’s marketing approval if granted by the FDA. An application for designation as an orphan product can be made any time prior to the filing of an application for approval to market the product. A product candidate with orphan drug designation must then go through the review and approval process like any other product. 
 A sponsor may request orphan drug designation of a previously unapproved product or new orphan indication for an already marketed product. In addition, a sponsor of a product that is otherwise the same product as an already approved orphan drug may seek and obtain orphan drug designation for the subsequent product for the same rare disease or condition if it can present a plausible hypothesis that its product may be clinically superior to the first drug. More than one sponsor may receive orphan drug designation for the same product for the same rare disease or condition, but each sponsor seeking orphan drug designation must file a complete request for designation. 
 If a product with orphan designation receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will receive orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve another sponsor’s marketing application for the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. If a product designated as an orphan drug ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan drug application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity. 
 The period of exclusivity begins on the date that the marketing application is approved by the FDA and applies only to the indication for which the product has been designated. The FDA may approve a second application for the same product for a different use or a second application for a clinically superior version of the product for the same use. The FDA cannot, however, approve the same product made by another manufacturer for the same indication during the market exclusivity period unless it has the consent of the sponsor or the sponsor is unable to provide sufficient quantities. 
 Further, orphan drug exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand or the subsequent product with the same drug for the same condition is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care. This is the case despite an earlier court opinion holding that the Orphan Drug Act unambiguously required the FDA to recognize orphan drug exclusivity regardless of a showing of clinical superiority. Under Omnibus legislation signed by President Trump on December 27, 2020, the requirement for a product to show clinical superiority applies to drugs and biologics that received orphan drug designation before enactment of FDARA in 2017, but have not yet been approved or licensed by FDA. 
 Pediatric Exclusivity 
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent and orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if a BLA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity that cover the product are extended by six months. 
Biosimilars and Exclusivity 
 The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which was signed into law in March 2010, included a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA. The BPCIA established a regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve biosimilars and interchangeable biosimilars. A biosimilar is a biological product that is highly similar to an existing FDA-licensed “reference product.” The FDA has approved a number of biosimilar products for use in the United States. No interchangeable biosimilars, however, have been approved. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars. Additional guidances are expected to be finalized by the FDA in the near term.

Under the BPCIA, a manufacturer may submit an application for licensure of a biologic product that is “biosimilar to” or “interchangeable with” a previously approved biological product or “reference product.” In order for the FDA to approve a biosimilar product, it must find that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the reference product and proposed biosimilar product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. For the FDA to approve a biosimilar product as interchangeable with a reference product, the agency must find that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product, and (for products administered multiple times) that the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. 
 Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date of approval of the reference product. The FDA may not approve a biosimilar product until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was approved. Even if a product is considered to be a reference product eligible for exclusivity, another company could market a competing version of that product if the FDA approves a full BLA for such product containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity, and potency of their product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law. Since the passage of the BPCIA, many states have passed laws or amendments to laws, including laws governing pharmacy practices, which are state-regulated, to regulate the use of biosimilars. 
 Federal and State Data Privacy and Security Laws 
 Under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1966, or HIPAA, the HHS has issued regulations to protect the privacy and security of protected health information, or PHI, used or disclosed by covered entities including certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses. HIPAA also regulates standardization of data content, codes, and formats used in healthcare transactions and standardization of identifiers for health plans and providers. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their regulations, including the omnibus final rule published on January 25, 2013, also imposes certain obligations on the business associates of covered entities that obtain protected health information in providing services to or on behalf of covered entities. In addition to federal privacy regulations, there are a number of state laws governing confidentiality and security of health information that are applicable to our business. In addition to possible federal civil and criminal penalties for HIPAA violations, state attorneys general are authorized to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. Accordingly, state attorneys general (along with private plaintiffs) have brought civil actions seeking injunctions and damages resulting from alleged violations of HIPAA’s privacy and security rules. New laws and regulations governing privacy and security may be adopted in the future as well. Where state laws are more protective than HIPAA, we must comply with the state laws we are subject to, in addition to HIPAA. In certain cases, it may be necessary to modify our planned operations and procedures to comply with these more stringent state laws. Not only may some of these state laws impose fines and penalties upon violators, but also some, unlike HIPAA, may afford private rights of action to individuals who believe their personal information has been misused. 
 Additionally, California recently enacted legislation that has been dubbed the first “GDPR-like” law in the United States. Known as the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, it creates new individual privacy rights for consumers (as that word is broadly defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households. The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020 and requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, provide such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales of personal information, and allow for a new cause of action for data breaches. In March 2020, the California State Attorney General proposed varying versions of companion draft regulations which are not yet finalized. Despite the delay in adopting regulations, the California State Attorney General will commence enforcement actions against violators beginning July 1, 2020. The CCPA could impact our business activities depending on how it is interpreted and exemplifies the vulnerability of our business to not only cyber threats but also the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data and protected health information. 
 Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors available under such laws, it is possible that some of our current or future business activities, including certain clinical research, sales, and marketing practices and the provision of certain items and services to our customers, could be subject to challenge under one or more of such privacy and data security laws. The heightening compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and secure systems to comply with different privacy compliance and/or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions could increase the possibility that a healthcare company may fail to comply fully with one or more of these requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the privacy or data security laws or regulations described above that are applicable to us, or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal, civil, and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements, and/or oversight if we become subject to a consent decree or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our 
 33

business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our product candidates, once approved, are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws. 
 Patent Term Restoration and Extension 
 In the United States, a patent claiming a new biologic product, its method of use or its method of manufacture may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent extension of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review. Assuming grant of the patent for which the extension is sought, the restoration period for a patent covering a product is typically one-half the time between the effective date of IND and the submission date of the BLA, plus the time between the submission date of the BLA and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date in the United States. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent for which extension is sought. A patent that covers multiple products for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The USPTO reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension in consultation with the FDA. 
 FDA Approval of Companion Diagnostics 
 In August 2014, the FDA issued final guidance clarifying the requirements that will apply to approval of therapeutic products and in vitro companion diagnostics. According to the guidance, for novel drugs, a companion diagnostic device and its corresponding therapeutic should be approved or cleared contemporaneously by the FDA for the use indicated in the therapeutic product’s labeling. Approval or clearance of the companion diagnostic device will ensure that the device has been adequately evaluated and has adequate performance characteristics in the intended population. In July 2016, the FDA issued a draft guidance intended to assist sponsors of the drug therapeutic and in vitro companion diagnostic device on issues related to co-development of the products. 
 The 2014 guidance also explains that a companion diagnostic device used to make treatment decisions in clinical trials of a biologic product candidate generally will be considered an investigational device, unless it is employed for an intended use for which the device is already approved or cleared. If used to make critical treatment decisions, such as patient selection, the diagnostic device generally will be considered a significant risk device under the FDA’s Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, regulations. Thus, the sponsor of the diagnostic device will be required to comply with the IDE regulations. According to the guidance, if a diagnostic device and a product are to be studied together to support their respective approvals, both products can be studied in the same investigational study, if the study meets both the requirements of the IDE regulations and the IND regulations. The guidance provides that depending on the details of the study plan and subjects, a sponsor may seek to submit an IND alone, or both an IND and an IDE. 
 Under the FDCA, in vitro diagnostics, including companion diagnostics, are regulated as medical devices. In the United States, the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. 
 The FDA previously has required in vitro companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to the product candidate to obtain pre-market approval, or PMA, simultaneously with approval of the therapeutic product candidate. The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee. 
 Regulation and Procedures Governing Approval of Medicinal Products in the European Union 
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety, and efficacy, and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales, and distribution of products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, an applicant will need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. Specifically, the process governing approval of medicinal products in the European Union generally follows the same lines as in the United States. It entails satisfactory completion of preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each proposed indication. It also requires the submission to the relevant competent authorities of a marketing authorization application, or MAA, and granting of a marketing authorization by these authorities before the product can be marketed and sold in the European Union. 
 34

Clinical Trial Approval 
 Pursuant to the currently applicable Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and the Directive 2005/28/EC on GCP, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union has been implemented through national legislation of the member states. Under this system, an applicant must obtain approval from the competent national authority of a European Union member state in which the clinical trial is to be conducted, or in multiple member states if the clinical trial is to be conducted in a number of member states. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific site after the competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. The clinical trial application must be accompanied by an investigational medicinal product dossier with supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC and Directive 2005/28/EC and corresponding national laws of the member states and further detailed in applicable guidance documents. 
 In April 2014, the EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, which is set to replace the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. The new Clinical Trials Regulation will become directly applicable to and binding in all 28 EU Member States without the need for any national implementing legislation. It will overhaul the current system of approvals for clinical trials in the EU. Specifically, the new legislation aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical trials in the EU. Under the new coordinated procedure for the approval of clinical trials, the sponsor of a clinical trial will be required to submit a single application for approval of a clinical trial to a reporting EU Member State (RMS) through an EU Portal. The submission procedure will be the same irrespective of whether the clinical trial is to be conducted in a single EU Member State or in more than one EU Member State.  
 The Regulation was published on June 16, 2014 but has not yet become effective.  In January 2020, the website of the European Commission reported that the implementation of the Clinical Trials Regulation was dependent on the development of a fully functional clinical trials portal and database, which would be confirmed by an independent audit, and that the new legislation would come into effect six months after the European Commission publishes a notice of this confirmation. The website indicated that the audit was expected to commence in December 2020. In late 2020, the EMA indicated that it plans to focus on the findings of a system audit; improving the usability, quality and stability of the clinical trial information system; and knowledge transfer to prepare users and their organizations for the new clinical trial system.  The EMA has indicated that the system will go live in December 2021. 
 Parties conducting certain clinical trials must, as in the United States, post clinical trial information in the European Union at the EudraCT website: https://eudract.ema.europa.eu. 
  PRIME Designation in the EU 
 In March 2016, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, launched an initiative to facilitate development of product candidates in indications, often rare, for which few or no therapies currently exist. The PRIority Medicines, or PRIME, scheme is intended to encourage drug development in areas of unmet medical need and provides accelerated assessment of products representing substantial innovation reviewed under the centralized procedure. Products from small-and medium-sized enterprises may qualify for earlier entry into the PRIME scheme than larger companies. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and accelerated marketing authorization application assessment once a dossier has been submitted. Importantly, a dedicated EMA contact and rapporteur from the Committee for Human Medicinal Products, or CHMP, or Committee for Advanced Therapies are appointed early in the PRIME scheme facilitating increased understanding of the product at the EMA’s Committee level. A kick-off meeting initiates these relationships and includes a team of multidisciplinary experts at the EMA to provide guidance on the overall development and regulatory strategies. 
 Marketing Authorization 
 To obtain a marketing authorization for a product under the European Union regulatory system, an applicant must submit an MAA, either under a centralized procedure administered by the EMA or one of the procedures administered by competent authorities in European Union Member States (decentralized procedure, national procedure, or mutual recognition procedure). A marketing authorization may be granted only to an applicant established in the European Union. Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 provides that prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the European Union, an applicant must demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA-approved Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted a product-specific waiver, class waiver, or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. 
 The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid for all EU member states. Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004, the centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, including products for the treatment of cancer. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, the centralized procedure may be optional. Manufacturers 
 35

must demonstrate the quality, safety, and efficacy of their products to the EMA, which provides an opinion regarding the MAA. The European Commission grants or refuses marketing authorization in light of the opinion delivered by the EMA. 
 Specifically, the grant of marketing authorization in the European Union for products containing viable human tissues or cells such as gene therapy medicinal products is governed by Regulation 1394/2007/EC on advanced therapy medicinal products, read in combination with Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, commonly known as the Community code on medicinal products. 
 Regulation 1394/2007/EC lays down specific rules concerning the authorization, supervision, and pharmacovigilance of gene therapy medicinal products, somatic cell therapy medicinal products, and tissue engineered products. Manufacturers of advanced therapy medicinal products must demonstrate the quality, safety, and efficacy of their products to EMA which provides an opinion regarding the application for marketing authorization. The European Commission grants or refuses marketing authorization in light of the opinion delivered by EMA. 
 Under the centralized procedure, the CHMP established at the EMA is responsible for conducting an initial assessment of a product. Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions of the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation may be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and, in particular, from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. If the CHMP accepts such a request, the time limit of 210 days will be reduced to 150 days, but it is possible that the CHMP may revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it determines that it is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment. 
 Regulatory Data Protection in the European Union 
 In the European Union, new chemical entities approved on the basis of a complete independent data package qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, as amended, and Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended. Data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application for a period of eight years. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization application can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic medicinal product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to authorization, is held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity so that the innovator gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company may market another version of the product if such company obtained marketing authorization based on an MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials. 
Patent Term Extensions in the European Union and Other Jurisdictions 
 The European Union also provides for patent term extension through Supplementary Protection Certificates, or SPCs. The rules and requirements for obtaining a SPC are similar to those in the United States. An SPC may extend the term of a patent for up to five years after its originally scheduled expiration date and can provide up to a maximum of fifteen years of marketing exclusivity for a drug. In certain circumstances, these periods may be extended for six additional months if pediatric exclusivity is obtained, which is described in detail below. Although SPCs are available throughout the European Union, sponsors must apply on a country-by-country basis. Similar patent term extension rights exist in certain other foreign jurisdictions outside the European Union. 
 Periods of Authorization and Renewals 
 A marketing authorization is valid for five years, in principle, and it may be renewed after five years on the basis of a reevaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the authorizing member state. To that end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. Once renewed, the marketing authorization is valid for an unlimited period, unless the European Commission or the competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal period. Any authorization that is not followed by the placement of the drug on the EU market (in the case of the centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing member state within three years after authorization ceases to be valid. 
 36

Regulatory Requirements after Marketing Authorization 
 Following approval, the holder of the marketing authorization is required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of the medicinal product. These include compliance with the European Union’s stringent pharmacovigilance or safety reporting rules, pursuant to which post-authorization studies and additional monitoring obligations can be imposed. In addition, the manufacturing of authorized products, for which a separate manufacturer’s license is mandatory, must also be conducted in strict compliance with the EMA’s GMP requirements and comparable requirements of other regulatory bodies in the European Union, which mandate the methods, facilities, and controls used in manufacturing, processing and packing of drugs to assure their safety and identity. Finally, the marketing and promotion of authorized products, including industry-sponsored continuing medical education and advertising directed toward the prescribers of drugs and/or the general public, are strictly regulated in the European Union under Directive 2001/83EC, as amended. 
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity 
 Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 and Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000 provide that a product can be designated as an orphan drug by the European Commission if its sponsor can establish: that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of (1) a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the European Union when the application is made, or (2) a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the European Union and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the drug in the European Union would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment. For either of these conditions, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the European Union or, if such method exists, the drug will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition. 
 An orphan drug designation provides a number of benefits, including fee reductions, regulatory assistance, and the possibility to apply for a centralized European Union marketing authorization. Marketing authorization for an orphan drug leads to a ten-year period of market exclusivity. During this market exclusivity period, neither the EMA nor the European Commission or the member states can accept an application or grant a marketing authorization for a “similar medicinal product.” A “similar medicinal product” is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. The market exclusivity period for the authorized therapeutic indication may, however, be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation because, for example, the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify market exclusivity. 
 Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom 
 On June 23, 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom voted in favor of leaving the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit. Following protracted negotiations, the United Kingdom left the EU on January 31, 2020. Under the withdrawal agreement, there is a transitional period until December 31, 2020 (extendable by up to two years). On December 24, 2020, the United Kingdom and the European Union entered into a Trade and Cooperation Agreement. The agreement sets out certain procedures for approval and recognition of medical products in each jurisdiction. Since the regulatory framework for pharmaceutical products in the United Kingdom covering quality, safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from EU directives and regulations, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime which applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the UK, as the UK legislation now has the potential to diverge from EU legislation. It remains to be seen how Brexit will impact regulatory requirements for product candidates and products in the UK in the long-term. The MHRA has recently published detailed guidance for industry and organizations to follow from January 1, 2021 now the transition period is over, which will be updated as the UK’s regulatory position on medicinal products evolves over time.
 Furthermore, while the Data Protection Act of 2018 in the United Kingdom that “implements” and complements the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, has achieved Royal Assent on May 23, 2018 and is now effective in the United Kingdom, it is still unclear whether transfer of data from the European Economic Area, or EEA, to the United Kingdom will remain lawful under GDPR. The Trade and Cooperation Agreement provides for a transitional period during which the United Kingdom will be treated like an European Union member state in relation to processing and transfers of personal data for four months from January 1, 2021.  This may be extended by two further months. After such period, the United Kingdom will be a “third country” under the GDPR unless the European Commission adopts an adequacy decision in respect of transfers of personal data to the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom has already determined that it considers all of the EU 27 and EEA member states to be adequate for the purposes of data protection, ensuring that data flows from the United Kingdom to the EU/EEA remain unaffected. 
 37

General Data Protection Regulation 
 The collection, use, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data regarding individuals in the EU, including personal health data, is subject to the GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, including requirements relating to processing health and other sensitive data, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, providing notification of data breaches, and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the EU, including the U.S., and permits data protection authorities to impose large penalties for violations of the GDPR, including potential fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues, whichever is greater. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. Compliance with the GDPR will be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase the cost of doing business or require companies to change their business practices to ensure full compliance. 
Coverage, Pricing, and Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we may seek regulatory approval by the FDA or other government authorities. In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use any product candidates we may develop unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of such product candidates. Even if any product candidates we may develop are approved, sales of such product candidates will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers, and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, such product candidates. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. 
 In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable marketing approvals. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover any product candidates we may develop could reduce physician utilization of such product candidates once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. Third-party reimbursement and coverage may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. In addition, any companion diagnostic tests require coverage and reimbursement separate and apart from the coverage and reimbursement for their companion pharmaceutical or biological products. Similar challenges to obtaining coverage and reimbursement, applicable to pharmaceutical or biological products, will apply to any companion diagnostics. 
 The containment of healthcare costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of pharmaceuticals have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement, and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we or our collaborators receive marketing approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 Outside the United States, ensuring adequate coverage and payment for any product candidates we may develop will face challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require us to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of any product candidates we may develop to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in our commercialization efforts. 
 38

In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies (so called health technology assessments) in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for products but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the European Union have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the European Union. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic, and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various European Union member states, and parallel trade (arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states), can further reduce prices. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products, if approved in those countries. 
 Healthcare Law and Regulation 
 Health care providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims laws, patient privacy laws and regulations and other health care laws and regulations that may constrain business and/or financial arrangements. 
 Restrictions under applicable federal and state health care laws and regulations, include the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal health care program such as Medicare and Medicaid; the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false, fictitious or fraudulent or knowingly making, using or causing to made or used a false record or statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government; the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making, or offering or promising to make, improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or otherwise seeking favorable treatment; and the federal transparency requirements known as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, within the United States Department of Health and Human Services, information related to payments and other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
 Further, some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures. Additionally, some state and local laws require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives in the jurisdiction. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 Healthcare Reform 
 A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and other medical products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system in the United States. 
 By way of example, the United States and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare. In March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the ACA, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for products under government healthcare programs.

Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2030 under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act.  The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used.
 Since enactment of the ACA, there have been, and continue to be, numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the law. For example, with enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which was signed by President Trump on December 22, 2017, Congress repealed the “individual mandate.” The repeal of this provision, which requires most Americans to carry a minimal level of health insurance, became effective in 2019. Further, on December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate portion of the ACA is an essential and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore because the mandate was repealed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. On December 18, 2019, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit court affirmed the lower court’s ruling that the individual mandate portion of the ACA is unconstitutional and it remanded the case to the district court for reconsideration of the severability question and additional analysis of the provisions of the ACA.  Thereafter, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear this case. Oral argument in the case took place on November 10, 2020.  On February 10, 2021, the Biden Administration withdrew DOJ’s support for this lawsuit.  A ruling by the Court is expected sometime this year. Litigation and legislation over the ACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results.
 The Trump Administration also took executive actions to undermine or delay implementation of the ACA, including  directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices.  On January 28, 2021, however, President Biden rescinded those orders and issued a new Executive Order which directs federal agencies to reconsider rules and other policies that limit Americans’ access to health care, and consider actions that will protect and strengthen that access.  Under this Order, federal agencies are directed to re-examine: policies that undermine protections for people with pre-existing conditions, including complications related to COVID-19; demonstrations and waivers under Medicaid and the ACA that may reduce coverage or undermine the programs, including work requirements; policies that undermine the Health Insurance Marketplace or other markets for health insurance; policies that make it more difficult to enroll in Medicaid and the ACA; and policies that reduce affordability of coverage or financial assistance, including for dependents. 
 The costs of prescription pharmaceuticals have also been the subject of considerable discussion in the United States To date, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries, as well as proposed and enacted state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products.  To those ends, President Trump issued five executive orders intended to lower the costs of prescription drug products but it is unclear whether, and to what extent, these orders will remain in force under the Biden Administration.  Further, on September 24, 2020, the Trump Administration finalized a rulemaking allowing states or certain other non-federal government entities to submit importation program proposals to the FDA for review and approval. Applicants are required to demonstrate that their importation plans pose no additional risk to public health and safety and will result in significant cost savings for consumers.  The FDA has issued draft guidance that would allow manufacturers to import their own FDA-approved drugs that are authorized for sale in other countries (multi-market approved products). 
 At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional health care organizations and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.
