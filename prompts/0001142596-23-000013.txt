Item 1.    Business
Overview
We are a global medical technology company focused on developing, manufacturing, selling and providing procedural solutions for spine surgery, with a guiding purpose to transform surgery, advance care and change lives. We offer a comprehensive portfolio of procedurally integrated spine surgery solutions, including surgical access instruments, spinal implants, fixation systems, biologics, and enabling technologies, as well as systems and services for intraoperative neuromonitoring. In addition, we develop and sell magnetically adjustable implant systems for spine and specialized orthopedic procedures. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated net sales of $1.2 billion, including sales in more than 50 countries.
Since our incorporation in 1997, we have grown from a small developer of specialty spinal implants into a leading medical technology company delivering procedurally integrated solutions for spine surgery. A key driver of our growth has been our focus on innovative products and technologies that drive reproducible outcomes for patients, surgeons and providers. In 2003, we introduced the eXtreme Lateral Interbody Fusion procedure, or XLIF, a lateral access spine surgery technique that is less invasive than traditional, open surgical procedures and clinically proven to enable better patient outcomes. Building off the success of XLIF, we have continued to develop innovative, less-invasive techniques and technologies for spine surgery, and we have broadened our portfolio of solutions for traditional, open surgical procedures. Our comprehensive portfolio of solutions can be utilized in procedures for the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine, supporting surgical approaches from the anterior, including lateral, and posterior. Our solutions are used to treat degenerative conditions and for complex spinal surgery, including adult and pediatric deformities, as well as trauma and tumors.
Underlying our procedurally integrated solutions for spine surgery are innovative technologies designed to enable better clinical, financial, and operational outcomes, including:
•our differentiated surgical access instruments, including our integrated split-blade retractor system, designed to enable less-invasive surgical techniques by minimizing soft tissue disruption during spine surgery;
•our Advanced Materials Science portfolio of specialized spinal implants, designed to advance spinal fusion by enhancing the osseointegration and biomechanical properties of implant materials, including porous titanium and porous polyetheretherketone, or PEEK;
•our comprehensive fixation systems, designed to facilitate the preservation and restoration of patient alignment, while addressing a vast array of spinal pathologies from an open or less-invasive approach across all spinal procedures; 
•our cervical total disc replacement, or cTDR, technology, which complements our portfolio of products and services for cervical spinal fusion surgery and is designed to offer surgeons best-in-class capabilities across key performance functions—anatomic, physiologic motion, and radiologic design; 
•our neuromonitoring systems, which use proprietary software-driven nerve detection and avoidance technology, and our intraoperative neuromonitoring, or IONM, services and support; and
•our Pulse platform, a software ecosystem that integrates multiple hardware technologies into a single, condensed footprint in the operating room, including: radiation reduction, imaging enhancement, rod bending, navigation, IONM, and spinal alignment tools.
In addition, we also design and sell expandable growing rod implant systems for the treatment of early-onset scoliosis that can be non-invasively lengthened following implantation with precise, incremental adjustments via an external remote controller using magnetic technology called MAGnetic External Control, or MAGEC. This technology is also the basis for our Precice line of products, which are designed to support complex orthopedic reconstruction, such as trauma and limb length discrepancy. Precice is an intramedullary device that, once implanted, utilizes the MAGEC technology to non-invasively lengthen the femur and tibia. 
We intend to continue development on a wide variety of innovation projects to advance our leadership position in less-invasive spine surgery, increase our product offerings and solutions for traditional spine surgery procedures, and further our enabling technologies portfolio. We expect to continue to invest in the Pulse platform to support our global commercialization plan for the technology and build-out the platform to enable further improvement of the spine care pathway. Our goal is to use technology and data to make spine surgery more intelligent, and we are investing to develop and expand the Pulse platform to include applications and technologies designed to improve pre-operative treatment selection and planning and post-operative workflow and analytics, as well as intra-operative surgical automation and robotics. In addition, we expect to continue to pursue business and technology acquisition targets and strategic relationships to identify opportunities to broaden our participation along the spine care continuum, as well as opportunities outside of traditional spine. Top priorities include opportunities that complement our technology leadership position in spine, targeted geographic expansion, technology that makes procedures even safer, as well as opportunities which advance our strategy to make spine surgery more intelligent.
Our primary corporate offices are located in Broomfield, Colorado and San Diego, California. At our San Diego campus, we also maintain a state-of-the-art cadaver operating theatre and research and development labs designed to accommodate the training of spine surgeons through our Clinical Professional Development education programs. In addition, we have surgeon training and education facilities in the New York Metropolitan area, and internationally in Singapore and Amsterdam. Our location in Amsterdam also serves as our international headquarters. Our primary distribution and warehousing operations are located in our facility in Memphis, Tennessee, which due to its proximity to overnight third-party transporters, helps facilitate rapid delivery of our products and surgical instruments for surgeries. Additionally, our primary manufacturing facility, which produces spinal implants and fixation products, is located in West Carrollton, Ohio.
Proposed Merger with Globus Medical
On February 8, 2023, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Merger Agreement, with Globus Medical and Zebra Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Globus Medical, or Merger Sub. The Merger Agreement provides, among other things, that subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will merge with and into NuVasive, referred to as the Merger, with NuVasive surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Globus Medical, such transaction referred to as the Combination. 
The closing of the Combination is subject to certain customary conditions, including the approval of both parties’ stockholders and the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, or the HSR Act. For more information, see Note 12, Subsequent Events, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report. 
COVID-19 Impact on Our Business
The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted our business and results of operations in fiscal years 2020, 2021 and 2022. At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, governments implemented extraordinary measures to slow the spread of the virus, which included the mandatory closure of businesses, restrictions on travel and gatherings, quarantine and physical distancing requirements, and vaccine mandates. In addition, many government agencies in conjunction with hospitals and healthcare systems deferred, reduced, or suspended elective surgical procedures due to COVID-19. While certain spine surgeries are deemed essential and certain surgeries, like in cases of trauma, cannot be delayed, we experienced a significant reduction in procedural volumes as hospital systems and/or patients deferred spine surgery procedures. 
Despite the impact COVID-19 has had on our business, we continued to invest in research and development, invest in our people, improve operating processes, and take steps to position ourselves for long-term success. During 2020, we raised additional capital to solidify our financial foundation. Notwithstanding COVID-19, we continued to train and educate surgeons on our products and less-invasive surgical techniques through live and virtual settings. Further, we remained focused on developing innovative solutions and enabling technologies to drive increased adoption of less-invasive surgery, including the commercialization of the Simplify Cervical Disc for cTDR procedures and the Pulse platform in 2021. While many countries have removed or reduced the restrictions initially implemented in response to COVID-19, the pandemic continues to evolve, and its impact on our business will depend on several factors that are highly uncertain and unpredictable, including, the efficacy and adoption of vaccines and treatments, future resurgences of the virus and its variants, the imposition of government lockdowns, quarantine and physical distancing requirements, patient capacity at hospitals and healthcare systems, the duration and severity of healthcare worker shortages, and the willingness and ability of patients to seek care and treatment due to safety concerns or financial hardship. Further discussion of the potential impacts on our business from the COVID-19 pandemic is provided under Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors.
Our Strategy
We continue to pursue the following strategies in order to improve our competitive position and grow our business:
•Advance our Position in Less-Invasive Spine Surgery. We believe that surgeons, providers and patients will continue to recognize the benefits of less-invasive surgical techniques and our procedurally integrated solutions will promote better clinical, financial, and operational outcomes. It has been demonstrated clinically that XLIF and other less-invasive procedures facilitated by our procedurally integrated solutions decrease trauma and blood loss, and lead to faster overall patient recovery times compared to traditional, open spine surgery procedures. We believe our solutions have the potential to dramatically improve the clinical results of spine surgery and drive better reproducibility through enabling technologies. Because of this belief, we dedicate significant resources to researching clinical outcomes data as well as educating surgeons, providers and patients on the benefits of our products, and we intend to continue to capitalize on the growing demand for less-invasive surgical procedures. 
•Continue to Develop Innovative Solutions and Broaden our Portfolio of Offerings. One of our core competencies is our ability to rapidly develop and commercialize innovative spine surgery solutions to fulfill unmet clinical needs while improving clinical, financial, and operational outcomes. In the past several years, we have introduced a continual flow of new products and product enhancements for spinal fusion surgery, including a broader portfolio of offerings for traditional, open surgery procedures. Following our acquisition of Simplify Medical Pty Limited, or Simplify Medical, in February 2021, we also offer motion-preserving cervical artificial disc technology for cTDR procedures. With our comprehensive portfolio of product and service offerings, we can offer our customers procedural solutions for the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine, and for various surgical approaches that distinguishes us from traditional spine implant companies. As part of this strategy, we must continue to vigorously protect and defend the intellectual property related to our innovative products.
•Strengthen Proceduralization Supported by Enabling Technologies and Surgeon Education. We believe through continued innovation and a focus on providing comprehensive procedural solutions integrated with enabling technologies for our customers, we will simultaneously increase our market share and improve patient care. In 2019, we launched the X360 portfolio, a comprehensive lateral approach to single-position surgery that leverages advanced techniques and technologies to deliver patient specific-care while enhancing operating room workflow and efficiency. In 2020, we launched the C360 portfolio, a comprehensive procedurally integrated solution to anterior and posterior cervical spine surgery. In 2021, we acquired Simplify Medical and incorporated the Simplify Cervical Disc into our C360 portfolio. In addition, in the third quarter of 2021, we launched the Pulse platform, which together with other enabling technology, establishes the foundation for our strategy to use data and technology to make spine surgery more intelligent. The Pulse platform is a software ecosystem that integrates multiple hardware technologies, including: radiation reduction, imaging enhancement, rod bending, navigation, IONM, and spinal alignment tools. The Pulse platform provides surgeons with integrated technologies that can enable faster decision-making and streamline operating room workflow. In 2022, we launched the P360 portfolio, a comprehensive solution for surgery from the prone position, including the NuVasive Tube System. These and other launches of procedural systems and enhancements to existing solutions which integrate enabling technologies expand the ability of surgeons to use our products in a variety of surgical approaches and procedures for the spine. We believe that our surgeon education and training program is a strategic differentiator for us, and our Clinical Professional Development team has developed comprehensive, in-person training labs and virtual content to demonstrate the benefits of our innovative products and procedures. Education and training of surgeons will continue to be a focus as we advance our less-invasive solutions integrated with enabling technology.
•Expand the Reach of Our Sales Force and Drive Growth Globally. We believe there is significant opportunity for us to further penetrate existing markets and to enter new markets by increasing the size and geographic scope of our sales force, particularly in international markets. Our global sales force consists of a mix of directly employed and independent sales representatives who are responsible for particular geographic regions. Outside of the United States, or U.S., we also utilize third-party distributors. We expect to expand into new geographic territories and to deepen our penetration in existing territories in the U.S. Internationally, we intend to make investments in infrastructure in order to better support existing markets and to drive expansion into new markets. 
•Selectively License or Acquire Complementary Products and Technologies. In addition to building our company through internal product development and global expansion efforts, we intend to selectively license or acquire complementary products and technologies and enter into strategic relationships designed to keep us on the forefront of innovation and to pursue opportunities that allow us to expand our presence in international markets. Over the past several years, we have acquired companies and technologies to grow our product portfolio, enter new market segments, expand our international presence, and enhance our enabling technology platforms. In furtherance of our enabling technology strategy, we entered into a Spine Precision Partnership with Siemens Healthineers in 2018 to advance operating room workflow efficiency and provide increased precision in the delivery of minimally-disruptive spine surgery technologies through the integration of our Pulse platform with Siemens Healthineers’ mobile 3D C-arm, Cios Spin. In 2021, we expanded and differentiated our cervical portfolio through the acquisition of Simplify Medical, allowing us to address one- and two-level cTDR procedures with the Simplify Cervical Disc. By acquiring complementary products, entering into strategic relationships, and executing on domestic and international footprint expansion opportunities, we believe we can leverage our expertise of bringing new products to market that are intended to improve patient outcomes, simplify or better integrate techniques, reduce hospitalization and rehabilitation times across the globe, and, as a result, reduce overall costs to the healthcare system and continue to grow our global presence.
•Provide Intraoperative Neuromonitoring Capabilities. Monitoring the health of the nervous system during spinal surgery has been a key component of our strategy of product differentiation since early in our development. Over time, surgeon and hospital demand for neuromonitoring has increased along with the advancement of technologies and techniques used in IONM. We believe our proprietary neuromonitoring platform is a differentiator in the market and is unique in its ability to provide information about the directionality and proximity of nerves. Through our NuVasive Clinical Services, or NCS, subsidiary, we have expanded the scale of our IONM services business and solidified our position as one of the largest providers of outsourced IONM services and are driving increased utilization of our neuromonitoring platform.
Industry Background and Market
The spine is the core of the human skeleton and provides a crucial balance between structural support and flexibility. It consists of 33 separate bones called vertebrae that are connected together by connective tissue (defined as bone, muscle, or ligament) to form a column and to permit a normal range of motion. The spinal cord, the body’s central nerve system, is enclosed within the spinal column. Vertebrae are paired into what are called motion segments that move by means of three joints: two facet joints and one spine disc. The four major categories of spine disorders are degenerative conditions, deformities, trauma and tumors. The largest market and the focus of our business historically are degenerative conditions of the facet joints and the intervertebral disc space. These two conditions can result in instability and pressure on the nerve roots as they exit the spinal column, causing back or neck pain or radiating pain in the arms or legs.
The prescribed treatment for back or neck pain depends on the severity and duration of the disorder. Initially, physicians will prescribe non-operative, conservative procedures including bed rest, medication, lifestyle modification, exercise, physical therapy, chiropractic care and steroid injections. In many cases, non-operative treatment options are effective; however, some patients eventually require spine fusion surgery. The vast majority of spine fusion surgeries are performed using traditional open surgical techniques from either the anterior or posterior of the patient. These traditional open surgical approaches generally require a large incision in the patient’s abdomen or back in order to enable the surgeon to access and see the spine and surrounding area. These open procedures are invasive, lengthy and complex, and typically result in significant blood loss, extensive tissue damage and lengthy patient hospitalization and rehabilitation.
We believe the market for procedurally integrated spine surgery solutions will continue to grow over the long term, and we also believe our market share will increase, because of the following market dynamics:
•Demand for Surgical Alternatives with Less Tissue Disruption. As has been demonstrated in other surgical markets, we anticipate the broader acceptance of less-invasive surgical treatments with reduced tissue disruption and patient trauma will result in increased demand.
•U.S. Population Demographics. The population segment most likely to experience back pain is expected to increase as a result of aging “baby boomers” (people born between 1946 and 1965). This large population segment is expected to increasingly demand a quicker return to activities of daily living following surgery.
•Access to Care in Emerging Markets. Healthcare reforms in many emerging markets are expanding access to treatments to a greater proportion of their populations, which is expected to continue to drive strong increases in demand for healthcare-related product volumes. Increasing economic affluence in key developing regions will further drive demand for healthcare treatments.
•Vendor/Hospital Consolidation. Given the continued economic pressures facing hospitals and healthcare systems, we anticipate broader consolidation of vendors in the spine space. We believe we are well-positioned to benefit from this vendor consolidation given our size, scale and breadth of our portfolio.
Although the market for procedurally integrated spine surgery solutions should continue to grow over the long term, economic, political and regulatory influences are subjecting our industry to significant changes that may slow the growth rate of the spine surgery market.
Surgical Alternatives with Less Tissue Disruption
The benefits of less-invasive surgical procedures in other areas of orthopedics have significantly contributed to the strong and growing demand for surgical alternatives with less tissue disruption of the spine. Surgeons and hospitals seek spine procedures that result in fewer operative and postoperative complications and decreased patient hospitalization periods. Patients seek procedures that reduce trauma, allow for faster recovery times and result in more favorable and predictable clinical outcomes. Despite patient and doctor demands, the rate of adoption of alternative surgical procedures with less tissue disruption has been relatively slow with respect to the spine. Currently, the majority of spine surgery patients are treated with traditional open and invasive techniques.
A principal factor contributing to spine surgeons’ slow adoption of traditional “minimally invasive” spine procedure alternatives has been inconsistent outcomes driven by the limited or lack of direct access to and visibility of the surgical anatomy, and the associated complex instruments that have been required to perform these procedures. Most traditional minimally invasive spine surgery systems do not allow the surgeon to directly view the spine and the relevant pathology point and, as such, provide only restrictive visualization through a camera system or endoscope, while also requiring the use of complex surgical techniques. In addition, most traditional minimally invasive spine surgery systems use complex or highly customized surgical instruments that require special training and the completion of a large number of clinical cases before the surgeon becomes proficient using the system, which is an impediment and/or deterrent to their adoption.
Our Commercial Products
Our procedurally integrated spine surgery solutions are designed to allow surgeons to perform a wide range of less-invasive surgical procedures with less tissue disruption of the spine, in all regions of the spine and from various surgical approaches, while overcoming the shortcomings of traditional minimally invasive spine surgical techniques. Our solutions are designed to treat a wide range of spinal pathologies while accommodating a surgeon’s preferred surgical technique. We believe our solutions can improve clinical, financial, and operational outcomes of spine surgery and should continue to drive an expanded number of minimally disruptive procedures performed, and make less-invasive techniques the standard of care in spine fusion and non-fusion surgery.
Our products and technology facilitate less-invasive applications of the following spine surgery procedures, among others:
•Decompression, which is removal of a portion of bone or disc from over or under the nerve root to relieve impingement of the nerve; 
•Lumbar and thoracic fusion procedures in which the surgeon approaches the spine through the patient’s back (posterior), side (lateral) or abdomen (anterior);
•Cervical fusion procedures, for either the posterior occipito-cervico-thoracic region or the anterior cervical region, and motion-preserving cTDR procedures; and
•Complex cases involving adult and pediatric spinal deformity, trauma and tumor patients.
We offer a comprehensive portfolio of procedurally integrated spine surgery solutions, including surgical access instruments, spinal implants, fixation systems, biologics, and enabling technologies, as well as systems and services for IONM. In addition, we develop and sell magnetically adjustable implant systems for spine and specialized orthopedic procedures. 
Surgical Access Instruments
We have differentiated surgical access instruments that surgeons use to access the surgical site, including our Maxcess integrated split-blade retractor system, designed to minimize soft tissue disruption during spine surgery. Our Maxcess retractors have a split-blade design consisting of three blades that can be positioned to customize the surgical exposure in the shape and size specific to the surgical requirements rather than the more traditional fixed tube or two-blade designs of traditional minimally invasive spine surgical systems. This split-blade design also provides customizable access to the spine, which allows surgeons to perform surgical procedures using instruments that are similar to those used in open procedures but with a smaller incision and less tissue disruption. The ability to use familiar instruments reduces the learning curve for our procedures and facilitates the adoption of our products. Our system’s illumination of the operative corridor aids in providing surgeons with better direct visualization of the patient’s anatomy, without the need for additional technology or other special equipment such as endoscopes. Over the years, we have made improvements to our Maxcess systems, including incorporating enabling technologies and improving the blade systems. Our Maxcess products are used in the cervical spine for posterior application and anterior retraction, the lumbar spine for decompressions, transforaminal lumbar interbody fusions, or TLIFs, posterior lumbar interbody fusions, or PLIFs, the thoracolumbar spine for XLIFs, and the thoracic region for tumors and trauma, as well as in adult degenerative scoliosis procedures. Additionally, the Maxcess system is integrated into our X360 procedure which allows surgeons to conduct lateral single-position spine surgery without repositioning the patient, which enhances operating room workflow and efficiency and can reduce time under anesthesia and lower intraoperative risks for the patient.
Implants and Fixation Systems
We have many specialized implants and fixation products designed to be used as part of our procedurally integrated solutions. Our portfolio of spinal implants used for intervertebral disc height restoration include implants made from allograft, titanium, and PEEK. These spinal implants come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and lordosis options to accommodate specific approach, pathology, alignment restoration, and anatomical requirements of the patient and the particular fusion procedure. Our Advanced Materials Science portfolio of implants, designed to improve spinal fusion by enhancing the osseointegration and biomechanical properties of implant materials, includes our Modulus porous titanium implants and Cohere and Coalesce porous PEEK implants. Our implants are designed for insertion into the smallest possible space while maximizing surface area contact for fusion. Following our acquisition of Simplify Medical during the first quarter of 2021, we also offer cervical artificial disc technology for cTDR procedures. Our fixation products, including pedicle screws, rods and plates, have been uniquely designed and include a highly differentiated percutaneous minimally invasive solution with advanced guide technology, superior rod insertion options, and multiple reduction capabilities to be delivered through our procedures to provide stabilization of the spine. In particular, the Reline portfolio consists of innovative posterior fixation technology designed to preserve and restore spinal alignment, while addressing a wide range of spinal pathologies. Our Reline portfolio can be used in both traditional open procedures and less-invasive surgical procedures and includes fixation products for cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine, as well as Reline Trauma and Reline Small Stature for complex spinal surgery. 
Biologics
We offer a variety of biologics that are used to aid in the spinal fusion or bone healing process. The global biologics market in spine surgery consists of autograft (autologous human tissue), allograft (donated human tissue), and a varied offering of synthetic products and growth factors. Our allograft biologics product offerings include Osteocel Plus and Pro, a cellular bone matrix designed to mimic the biologic profile of autograft including mesenchymal stem cells and osteoprogenitor cells to aid in spinal fusion, and Propel DBM (highly moldable demineralized bone matrix putty and gel). Our synthetic biologics product offerings include Formagraft (collagen-based synthetic bone substitute) and AttraX (synthetic bone graft material delivered in putty and other forms).
Intraoperative Neuromonitoring Systems
Our IONM systems utilize proprietary software hunting algorithms and graphical user interfaces to provide surgeons with an enhanced and intuitive nerve avoidance system. Our systems function by monitoring changes in electrical signals across muscle groups, which allows us to detect underlying changes in nerve activity. Through our IONM platforms, we give surgeons the option to connect their instruments to a computer system that provides discrete, real-time, surgeon directed and surgeon controlled feedback about the directionality and relative proximity of nerves during surgery. We believe our proprietary IONM platforms are a differentiator in the market and are unique in their ability to provide information about the directionality and proximity of nerves. Our systems analyze and then translate complex neurophysiologic data into simple, useful information to assist the surgeon’s clinical decision-making process. Surgeons can connect certain instruments to our IONM systems, thus creating an interactive set of instruments that better enable the safe navigation through the body’s nerve anatomy during surgery. The connection is accomplished using a clip that is attached to the instrument, effectively providing the benefits of our IONM systems through an instrument already familiar to the surgeon. Our proprietary software and easy to use graphical user interfaces allow the surgeon to make critical decisions in real time to help enable safer, faster, and more reproducible procedures to achieve improved patient outcomes.
Intraoperative Neuromonitoring Services
Through our NCS subsidiary, we provide onsite and remote monitoring of the neurological systems of patients undergoing spinal and brain-related surgeries. Monitoring the health of the nervous system during spinal surgery has been a key component of our strategy of product differentiation since early in our development. Over time, surgeon and hospital demand for neuromonitoring has increased along with the advancement of technologies and techniques used in IONM. Our neurophysiologists are present in the operating room during procedures and work in partnership with supervising physicians who remotely oversee and interpret neurophysiological data gathered via broadband transmission over the internet. Through this service, data can be analyzed in real-time by healthcare professionals for additional interpretation of intraoperative information and oversight, which we believe further improves the safety and reproducibility of spine surgery procedures.
Enabling Technology
The integration of enabling technology into our procedural offerings is integral to our strategy. Our investment in enabling technology is focused on our Pulse platform which is designed to further improve clinical, financial, and operational outcomes of spine surgery. Pulse integrates multiple hardware technologies into a single unit of capital equipment with two fixed screens in the operating room. We have incorporated into the Pulse platform existing technologies in our portfolio, including IONM, rod bending, and Lessray image enhancement, which is designed to help surgeons and hospital staff manage radiation exposure by using digital imaging processing technology to generate high resolution images of the surgical field from low resolution images. Pulse also includes navigation, spinal alignment tools, and other features designed to improve operating room workflow for all spine cases. Pulse seeks to facilitate and optimize clinical decision making while maintaining surgeon control through integrated technologies that inform one another—producing a seamless and efficient workflow. Pulse is designed to increase safety, efficiency, and surgical procedure reproducibility, while addressing some of the most common clinical challenges in spine surgery. Pulse offers wireless device capabilities, allowing connectivity and control of the Pulse platform from all members of the surgical team in the operating room. Its extensible architecture can support future surgical applications as we continue to invest and develop this technology platform. Further, our goal is to use technology and data to make spine surgery more intelligent, and we are investing to develop and expand the Pulse platform to include applications and technologies designed to improve pre-operative treatment selection and planning and post-operative workflow and analytics, as well as intra-operative surgical automation and robotics.
Specialized Orthopedics
Through our NuVasive Specialized Orthopedics, or NSO, subsidiary, we develop and manufacture magnetically adjustable spine and orthopedics products using the MAGEC technology. Our MAGEC system is designed to overcome the limitations of conventional adjustable rod treatments for early onset scoliosis, or EOS, and reduce the number of surgical procedures required throughout childhood. EOS refers to severely deformed curvatures of the spine diagnosed before the age of ten. EOS is a challenging health issue and can lead to more severe progressive deformities. Surgical treatments for EOS include the use of surgically adjustable expandable rods to control the spine deformity while still allowing the spine to grow until a child reaches an appropriate size or age for a more permanent solution, such as spinal fusion. Surgeries to adjust traditional growing rods are typically performed every six to nine months and are associated with scarring, elevated infection rates, postoperative pain, and impaired mobility as the child heals from surgery. Additionally, these surgeries involve repetitive exposure to general anesthesia, which can delay development and impair long-term cognitive function. Once our magnetically adjustable MAGEC growing rods are surgically implanted in a patient, they can be adjusted non-invasively using an external remote controller. The ability to adjust growing rods without surgical intervention means that EOS patients can be treated with fewer planned surgeries. Our non-invasive adjustment technology enables physicians to perform more frequent adjustments in a non-surgical outpatient setting, thereby improving deformity correction and allowing for optimal spinal growth. 
The proprietary MAGEC technology is also the basis for the Precice system, which is designed to support complex orthopedic reconstruction, such as trauma and limb length discrepancy, or LLD. LLD is caused by congenital deformity or injury resulting in one leg being shorter than the other, and large LLDs often require complex treatments including limb lengthening surgery to create equal limb length. The traditional limb lengthening surgical procedure includes the creation of a gap in the bone, or osteotomy, the attachment of wires or pins to the fractured bones, and the passing of the wires or pins through the skin to an external fixator, a scaffold-like frame that surrounds the limb. The external fixator distracts the bone when the patient or a family member manually turns the knobs on the fixator. These adjustments must be performed several times each day such that the bone is lengthened approximately one millimeter per day. Adjustments of the external fixator are very painful and associated with soft tissue disruption, disturbance of the wound healing process of the skin and soft tissue and high rates of pin site infection. In addition, traditional external fixation can result in significant psychosocial comorbidities that reduce quality of life for patients undergoing treatment, including anxiety, social disengagement, sleep disorders, depression and addiction to pain medication. The Precice system uses a specialized intramedullary nail that, once surgically implanted, is lengthened using the MAGEC technology, which enables non-invasive and painless adjustments using a pre-programmed external remote controller. As a result, Precice enables physicians to customize therapy to the needs of the patient over time without the need for surgical re-intervention and provides improved quality of life and satisfaction for patients in need of surgical limb lengthening.
Research and Development
Our research and development efforts are primarily focused on developing new technology platforms and further enhancing our existing products to improve and further integrate procedural solutions to address unmet clinical needs while improving clinical, financial, and operational outcomes. Our research and development group has extensive experience in developing products to treat spine pathologies. This group continues to work closely with clinical advisors and spine surgeons to design products and procedural solutions designed to improve patient outcomes, simplify techniques, and reduce patient trauma including subsequent hospitalization and rehabilitation times; and as a result reduce overall costs to patients and the healthcare system.
International
As the spine market shifts towards less-invasive surgery and international access to healthcare increases, it should provide us with an opportunity for accelerated growth outside the U.S. Because our procedurally integrated solutions and technologies treat similar pathologies around the world, we are focused on expanding our operations in select international markets. We are investing to tailor our products and technologies to meet varying international patient, surgeon and market requirements. We are also investing in our global infrastructure to adapt alternative distribution channels, to support differing language and customer service requirements, and to provide training and surgeon education in our surgical techniques, instruments, products and technologies to our international customers. We intend to continue to make targeted investments in select international markets in order to increase our commercial reach outside of the U.S. Our international net sales, which exclude Puerto Rico, were $276.1 million, or 23%, of total net sales for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Sales and Marketing
In the U.S., we currently sell our procedurally integrated solutions through a combination of exclusive and non-exclusive independent sales representatives and directly-employed sales force. Each member of our U.S. sales force is responsible for a defined territory, with our exclusive independent sales representatives acting as our sole representative in their respective territories. The determination of whether to engage a directly-employed sales representative or an independent sales representative is made on a territory–by-territory basis, with a focus on aligning the sales team with the best skills and experience with local surgeons’ needs. Our international sales force is comprised of directly-employed sales representatives, as well as distributors and independent sales representatives. Directly-employed sales representatives make up the majority of our overall sales force. 
Surgeon Training and Education
We devote significant resources to training and educating surgeons regarding the safety and reproducibility of our surgical techniques and our procedurally integrated solutions. Our surgeon education and training program is led by our Clinical Professional Development team, and integrates surgical training with professional development and enables us to introduce surgeons to our less-invasive approaches to spine surgery. At our campus in San Diego, California, we maintain our West Coast Experience Center, including a state-of-the-art cadaver operating theatre and research and development labs to help educate and train surgeons. In September 2021, we expanded our Clinical Professional Development program with the opening of our East Coast Experience Center in Englewood, New Jersey. At this facility, we host competency-based courses and cadaveric trainings on our procedurally integrated solutions and maintain a dedicated demonstration lab to showcase our Pulse platform. Internationally, we provide surgeon training and education in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, to support surgeons primarily within the European region. In June 2022, we opened our Singapore Experience Center to support the Asia-Pacific region. Additionally, we offer educational and training courses globally through in-person formats and via virtual content, including through virtual conferences, video and social channels, to demonstrate the benefits of our innovative products and procedures.
Manufacturing and Supply
We manufacture a substantial portion of our implant products in our facility in West Carrollton, Ohio. We also maintain a network of third-party suppliers for certain implants and surgical instruments. Our outsourcing strategy is targeted at companies that meet U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, International Organization for Standardization, or ISO, and quality standards supported by internal policies and procedures. Supplier performance is maintained and managed through a supplier qualification, performance management and corrective action program intended to ensure that all of our product requirements are met or exceeded.
Our products are inspected, packaged and labeled, as needed, at our qualified suppliers or at our facilities in Memphis, Tennessee, West Carrollton, Ohio, and Aliso Viejo, California. Under our existing contracts with third-party manufacturers, we reserve the right to inspect and assure conformance of each product and product component to our specifications.
We currently rely on several tissue banks as our suppliers of allograft tissue implants, including for our Osteocel Plus and Osteocel Pro product lines. Like our relationships with our device manufacturing suppliers, we subject our tissue processing suppliers to the same quality criteria in terms of selection, qualification, and verification of processed tissue quality upon receipt of goods, as well as hold them accountable to compliance with FDA regulations, state requirements, and voluntary industry standards (such as those put forward by the American Association of Tissue Banks).
We rely on two suppliers for PEEK, which comprises many of our partial vertebral body replacement and interbody product lines. We also work with a limited number of suppliers for certain components of our enabling technology and IONM platforms and continue to develop redundancies for critical components within those supply chains.
We continue to experience global supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and other macroeconomic conditions. While we have largely been able to mitigate the impact, we have experienced challenges associated with material and component availability, longer shipping and delivery times, and in some cases, higher costs. In the event that we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of raw materials or components on commercially reasonable terms or in a timely manner, our ability to manufacture our products on a timely and cost-competitive basis may be compromised.
We, and our third-party manufacturers, are subject to the quality system regulations of the FDA, state regulations (such as the regulations promulgated by the California Department of Health Services), and regulations promulgated by foreign regulatory bodies (such as in the European Union). For tissue products, we are FDA registered and licensed in the States of California, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, New York, and Oregon. For our device implants and instruments, we are FDA registered, California licensed, CE marked and ISO certified. CE is an abbreviation for “Conformité Européenne” or European Conformity, and is the registration marking designating that a device can be commercially distributed throughout Europe. Our facilities and the facilities of our third-party manufacturers are subject to periodic announced and unannounced inspections by regulatory authorities, and may undergo compliance inspections conducted by the FDA, state, and/or international regulatory agencies for, among other things, conformance to Quality System Regulations and Current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements and other foreign or international standards.
Surgical Instrument, Implant Sets and Equipment Sales
For many of our customers, we provide surgical instrumentation sets, including both implants and instruments, as well as our IONM systems in a manner tailored to fulfill our customer’s obligations to meet surgery schedules. We do not generally receive separate economic value specific to the surgical instrument sets from the surgeons or hospitals that utilize them. In many cases, once the surgery is finished, the surgical instrument sets are returned to us, and we prepare them for shipment to meet future surgeries.
We complement this implant and instrument shipment model with field-based instrument assets. This hybrid strategy is designed to improve customer service, minimize backlogs, increase asset turns, optimize freight costs, and maximize cash flow. Our pool of surgical equipment we make available to hospitals continues to increase as we increase our product offering, expand our distribution channels and increase the market penetration of our products. These surgical instrumentation and implant sets are important to the growth of our business, and we anticipate additional investments in such assets going forward.
In certain cases, we will sell either surgical instruments, implant sets or both to our customers. While this does not constitute a material component of our business, as customer penetration and volume increases, these sales of sets allow our customers to increase the amount of surgical volume performed locally. Additionally, we offer flexibility to customers for our capital equipment by offering capital sales and leasing arrangements. We do not have a long history of selling, leasing or servicing capital equipment, and we have invested and intend to continue to invest in building resources and expertise in this area. Selling and leasing of capital equipment do not make up a material portion of our total net sales.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, nondisclosure agreements and other measures to protect our intellectual property rights. In order to have a competitive advantage, we must develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technologies. We require our employees, consultants and advisors to execute confidentiality agreements in connection with their employment, consulting or advisory relationships with us. We also require our employees, consultants and advisors who we expect to work on our products to agree to disclose and assign to us all inventions conceived using our property or which relate to our business. Despite any measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary.
Patents
As of December 31, 2022, we had over 1,500 issued patents and pending applications world-wide, including over 750 issued U.S. patents. Our issued patents and pending applications cover, among other things:
•Surgical access instrumentation and methodology, relating to our XLIF and X360 procedures and aspects thereof, as well as technologies and methods related to our C360 portfolio;
•Artificial discs, including the Simplify Cervical Disc and related instrumentation;
•Neurophysiology enabled instrumentation and methodology, including pedicle screw test systems, software hunting algorithms, navigated guidance, rod bending and surgical access systems;
•Spinal implants and related instrumentation and targeting systems;
•Biologics, including Osteocel Plus and Osteocel Pro, Formagraft and AttraX; 
•Magnetic technology for non-invasive distraction of an implanted device, including the MAGEC technology platform;
•Digital imaging processing technology that generates high resolution images of the surgical field from low resolution scans, including the Lessray technology platform;
•Porous PEEK technology, included in our Cohere and Coalesce spinal implants; and
•Surgical navigation and robotics technology.
Our issued patents began to expire in 2018. We do not believe that the expiration of any single patent is likely to significantly affect our intellectual property position.
The medical device industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement. Patent litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions, can be expensive, and its outcome is uncertain. Our success will depend in part on our not infringing patents issued to others, including our competitors and potential competitors. As the number of entrants into our market increases, the possibility of future patent infringement claims against us grows. While we make extensive efforts to ensure that our products do not infringe other parties’ patents and proprietary rights, our products and methods may be covered by patents held by our competitors. There are numerous risks associated with our intellectual property. For a complete discussion of these risks, please see the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report.
Trademarks
As of December 31, 2022, we had over 400 trademark registrations in both domestic and foreign regions.
Competition
Competition within the industry is primarily based on technology, innovation, quality, reputation and customer service. In our core spine business, our significant competitors are Medtronic, DePuy/Synthes, a Johnson & Johnson company, Stryker Spine, Globus Medical, and ZimVie, which together represent a significant portion of the spine market. We also face competition from a significant number of smaller spine companies with more limited product offerings and geographic reach than our larger competitors. These companies, who represent intense competition in specific markets, include Orthofix Medical, Alphatec Holdings and others. With respect to our neuromonitoring and other enabling technologies, we primarily compete with Medtronic and Globus Medical. Our NCS subsidiary competes with SpecialtyCare, numerous smaller and regional neuromonitoring companies as well as insourced neuromonitoring functions operated by hospitals. Our NSO subsidiary competes with divisions of traditional orthopedics companies, including Stryker Orthopedics and Smith & Nephew, as well as Orthofix Medical and other smaller companies that offer specialized orthopedics solutions. 
The U.S. Government Regulation
Our products are medical devices and human tissue products subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory bodies both inside and outside of the U.S. Each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, storage, labeling, marketing and distribution of our products.
FDA’s Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements
Unless an exemption applies, each medical device that we market and sell in the U.S. must first receive either 510(k) clearance (by submitting a premarket notification) or premarket approval (by filing a premarket approval application, or PMA) from the FDA. In addition, certain modifications to marketed devices may require 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA supplement. The FDA will clear marketing of a medical device through the 510(k) process if it is demonstrated that the new product is substantially equivalent to other 510(k)-cleared products (referred to as a predicate device). The FDA’s 510(k) review process usually takes between three and six months from the date the application is submitted, but may last longer. The process of obtaining PMA approval is much more costly, lengthy and difficult than the 510(k) clearance process and generally takes between one and three years, or even longer, from the time the application is submitted to the FDA until any approval is obtained. In addition, a clinical trial is almost always required to support a PMA application, while clinical trial data is less often required to support a 510(k) premarket notification.
In 2018, the FDA issued draft guidance and announced steps to modernize the 510(k) clearance pathway that, if finalized and implemented, could impact the ability of medical device manufacturers to obtain or maintain 510(k) clearance for devices. Among other initiatives, the FDA has proposed to “sunset” the use of older predicate devices for purposes of comparison in new device 510(k) clearance submissions. If we cannot establish that a new or modified product is substantially equivalent to a predicate device, we may be required to seek pre-market approval through the PMA process. There are numerous risks associated with the PMA process, which typically requires conducting clinical trials with high costs and uncertain outcomes. For a complete discussion of these risks, please see the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report.
Human Cell, Tissue, and Cellular and Tissue Based Products
Our allograft products, including our Triad and ExtenSure, and our Osteocel Plus, Osteocel Pro, and Propel products, are regulated by the FDA as Human Cell, Tissue, and Cellular and Tissue Based Products. FDA regulations do not currently require these minimally manipulated human tissue-based products to be subjected to a premarket approval or premarket notification process before they can be legally marketed if they are deemed to meet the requirements of a “361” product under the Public Health Safety Act.
We are required to register with the FDA as a provider of such products and to list these products with the FDA and comply with its Current Good Tissue Practices for Human Cell, Tissue, and Cellular- and Tissue-Based Product Establishments. The FDA periodically inspects tissue facilities to determine compliance with these requirements. Entities that provide us with allograft bone tissue are responsible for performing donor recovery, donor screening, donor testing, processing, and packaging and our compliance with those aspects of the Current Good Tissue Practices regulations that regulate those functions are dependent upon the actions of these independent entities.
The procurement and transplantation of allograft bone tissue is subject to U.S. federal law pursuant to the National Organ Transplant Act, or NOTA, a criminal statute that prohibits the purchase and sale of human organs used in human transplantation - including bone and related tissue - for “valuable consideration” (as defined in the NOTA). The NOTA permits reasonable payments associated with the removal, transportation, processing, preservation, quality control, implantation and storage of human bone tissue. With the exception of removal and implantation, we provide services, directly or indirectly, in all of these areas. We make payments to vendors in consideration for the services they provide in connection with the recovery and screening of donors. Failure to comply with the requirements of NOTA could result in enforcement action against us.
The procurement of human tissue is also subject to state anatomical gift acts and some states have statutes similar to NOTA. In addition, some states require that tissue processors be licensed by that state. Failure to comply with state laws could also result in enforcement action against us.
Continuing FDA Regulation
After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. These regulatory requirements could include, but are not limited to, the following:
•device listing and establishment registration;
•adherence to the Quality System Regulation which requires stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures;
•labeling requirements and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of off-label uses or indications;
•adverse event reporting;
•post-approval restrictions or conditions, which could include post-approval clinical trials or other required testing;
•post-market surveillance requirements;
•the FDA’s recall authority, whereby it can ask for, or require, the recall of products from the market; and
•requirements relating to voluntary corrections or removals.
Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in fines and other enforcement actions by the FDA, which could adversely impact our business.
We are also subject to announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA, the California Food and Drug Branch, American Association of Tissue Banks, as well as other regulatory agencies overseeing the implementation and adherence of applicable state and federal device and tissue licensing regulations. These inspections may include our manufacturing and subcontractors’ facilities.
Pursuant to FDA regulations, we can only market our products for cleared or approved uses. Although surgeons are permitted to use medical devices for indications other than those cleared or approved by the FDA based on their medical judgment, we are prohibited from marketing or promoting products for such “off-label” uses.
Healthcare Regulation and Commercial Compliance
The healthcare industry is highly regulated and changes in laws and regulations can be significant. The federal government and all states in which we currently operate regulate various aspects of our business. Changes in the law or new interpretation of existing laws can have a material effect on our permissible activities, the relative costs associated with doing business and the amount of reimbursement by government and other third-party payers.
Anti-Kickback Statute
We are subject to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute which, among other things, prohibits the knowing and willful solicitation, offer, payment or receipt of any remuneration, direct or indirect, in cash or in kind, in return for, or to induce the referral of patients for, items or services covered by Medicare, Medicaid and certain other governmental health programs. Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or ACA, neither knowledge of the Anti-Kickback Statute nor the specific intent to violate the law is a requirement for being found in violation of such laws. Violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute may result in civil or criminal penalties and exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, and now provides a basis for liability under the False Claims Act. Many states have enacted similar statutes, which are not limited to items and services paid for under Medicare or a federally funded healthcare program. We believe our operations materially comply with the anti-kickback laws; however, because these provisions are interpreted broadly by regulatory authorities, we cannot be assured that law enforcement officials or others will not challenge our operations under these statutes.
Federal False Claims Act
The Federal False Claims Act (in particular its “qui tam” or “whistleblower” provisions) allows private individuals to bring actions in the name of the U.S. government alleging that a defendant has made false claims for payment from federal funds. In addition, various states are considering enacting or have enacted laws modeled after the Federal False Claims Act, penalizing false claims against state funds. 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as was amended in 2005 and in 2009, or HIPAA, a Covered Entity is required to adhere to certain requirements regarding the use, disclosure and security of protected health information, or PHI. In the past, HIPAA has generally affected us indirectly, as NuVasive is generally neither a Covered Entity nor a Business Associate, as further defined under HIPAA, to Covered Entities, except that our provision of IONM services through various subsidiaries may create a Business Associate relationship; additionally, we treat our IONM service business and Puerto Rico subsidiary as a Covered Entity. Regardless of Covered Entity status under HIPAA, in those cases where patient data is received, NuVasive is committed to maintaining the security and privacy of PHI. The potential for enforcement action against us is now greater, as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, can take action directly against Business Associates. Thus, while we believe we are and will be in compliance with all required HIPAA standards, there is no guarantee that the government will agree. Enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt regular operations of our business.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The U.S. and foreign government regulators have increased regulation, enforcement, inspections and governmental investigations of the medical device industry, including increased U.S. government oversight and enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded U.S. corporations and their foreign affiliates, which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments. If the U.S. or another foreign governmental authority were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, such governmental authority can impose fines, delay or suspend regulatory clearances, institute proceedings to detain or seize our products, issue a recall, impose operating restrictions, enjoin future violations and assess civil penalties against us or our officers or employees, and can recommend criminal prosecution to the U.S. Department of Justice. Moreover, governmental authorities can ban or request the recall, repair, replacement or refund of the cost of any device or product we manufacture or distribute. We are also potentially subject to the UK Bribery Act, which would also subject us to the imposition of civil and criminal fines. Any of the foregoing actions could result in decreased sales as a result of negative publicity and product liability claims, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Physician Payments Sunshine Act of 2009 (Sunshine Act)
The Sunshine Act was enacted into law in 2010 and requires public disclosure to the U.S. government of payments to physicians and teaching hospitals, including in-kind transfers of value such as free gifts or meals. The Act also provides penalties for non-compliance. The Sunshine Act requires that we file an annual report on March 31 of a calendar year for the transfers of value incurred for the prior calendar year. This law, along with various international and individual state reporting requirements, such as in Massachusetts and Vermont, increases the possibility that a healthcare company may run afoul of one or more of the requirements.
Compliance Program
A compliance program is a set of internal controls established by a company to prevent and/or detect any non-compliant activities and to address properly those issues that may be discovered. The U.S. government has recommended that healthcare companies, among others, develop and maintain an effective compliance program to reduce the likelihood of any such non-compliance by the company, its employees, agents and contractors. In addition, some states, such as Massachusetts and California, now require certain healthcare companies to have a formal compliance program in place in order to do business within the state. For years, we have maintained a compliance program structured to meet the requirements of the federal sentencing guidelines for an effective compliance program and the model compliance program guidance promulgated by HHS over the years. Our program includes, but is not limited to, a Code of Conduct, designation of a compliance officer, oversight by a designated committee of our Board of Directors, policies and procedures, a confidential disclosure method (a hotline), and conducting periodic compliance audits.
Foreign Government Regulation
Sales of medical devices outside the U.S. are subject to foreign government regulations, which vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain clearance or approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that of the FDA, and the requirements may differ.
The European Union requires that manufacturers of medical devices obtain the right to bear the CE marking which designates compliance with existing directives and standards regulating the design, manufacture, and distribution of medical devices in member countries of the European Union. The method of assessing conformity varies depending on the classification of the product, but typically involves a combination of self-assessment by the manufacturer and a third-party assessment by an accredited “Notified Body”. This third-party assessment consists of an audit of the manufacturer’s quality system and technical review of the manufacturer’s product. We have now successfully passed several Notified Body audits since our original certification in 2001, granting us ISO certification and allowing the CE conformity marking to be applied to certain of our devices. 
The European Union has also adopted the EU Medical Device Regulation, or MDR, which replaced existing directives and imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices, including new clinical evaluation, quality system, and post-market surveillance requirements. Effective May 2021, medical devices marketed in the European Union require certification according to these new requirements, except that devices with valid CE certificates, issued pursuant to the Medical Device Directive, or MDD, before May 2021, may be placed on the market until May 2024. In February 2023, the European Parliament approved a proposal by the European Commission which further extends the transition period from May 2024 to December 2027 or December 2028, depending on the device classification. Complying with this new regulation will require us to incur significant costs and failure to meet the requirements of the regulation could adversely impact our business in the European Union and other countries that utilize or rely on European Union requirements for medical device registrations.
Following a national referendum and enactment of legislation by the government of the United Kingdom, or the UK, the UK formally withdrew from the European Union and ratified a trade and cooperation agreement governing its future relationship with the European Union. The agreement addresses trade, economic arrangements, law enforcement, judicial cooperation, and a governance framework, including procedures for dispute resolution, among other things. Because the agreement merely sets forth a framework in many respects and will require complex additional bilateral negotiations between the UK and the European Union, significant political and economic uncertainty remains about how the precise terms of the relationship between the parties will differ from the terms before withdrawal. Further, pursuant to guidance issued by the UK Government, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, became the standalone medicines and medical devices regulator for the UK as of January 1, 2021. A new mark referred to as UKCA, or UK Conformity Assessed, has also been introduced and will replace the CE conformity mark in the UK. UK Approved Bodies designated by the MHRA will conduct conformity assessments against applicable requirements of the UKCA mark. Obtaining the UKCA conformity mark is optional from January 2021 and will have rolling requirements for MDD/MDR certified devices through 2027. Although CE conformity marking and certificates issued by Notified Bodies will continue to be recognized in the UK through 2027, all medical devices were required to be registered with the MHRA as of January 1, 2021 in accordance with the provided grace period depending on the product risk classification. Additionally, for manufacturers based outside of the UK, a single UK Responsible Person with a place of business in the UK must be established. Complying with this new regulatory framework will require us to invest in additional resources and could be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to our existing operations in the UK.
In 2014, the Japanese government made revisions to the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law (now called PMD Act) that made significant changes to the preapproval regulatory systems. These changes have - in part - stipulated that, in addition to obtaining a manufacturing or import approval from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, certain low-risk medical devices can now be evaluated by third-party organizations. Based on the risk-based classification, manufacturers are provided three procedures for satisfying the PMD Act requirements prior to placing products on the market: Pre-market Submission, or Todokede; Pre-market Certification, or Ninsho; and Pre-market Approval, or Shonin. NuVasive markets devices in Japan that are assessed by both government entities and third-party organizations using all three procedures in place for manufacturers. The level of review and time line for medical device approval depends on the risk-based classification and subsequent regulatory procedure that the medical device is aligned based on assessment against the current PMD Act. Manufacturers must also obtain a manufacturing or import license from the prefectural government prior to importing medical devices. We also pursue authorizations required by the prefectural government as required.
Device and tissue premarket approval and/or registration and/or facility licensing requirements also exist in other markets where international NuVasive facilities are established and/or where we may conduct business, including, but not limited to, Southeast Asia, Australia, and Latin America. Such requirements vary by country and NuVasive has established procedures to drive its compliance with these requirements.
Data protection laws, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, also apply to our international operations. The GDPR requires, among other things, obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer EU personal data and the prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances. These data protection regulations create a range of compliance obligations and permit substantial fines for noncompliance.
Third-Party Reimbursement
Broadly speaking, payer pushback on spine surgery and IONM services in the U.S. has increased in the recent past, and we believe this has had an overall dampening effect on spine procedure volumes and prices.
We expect that sales volumes and prices of our products and services will continue to be largely dependent on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payers, such as governmental programs, for example, Medicare and Medicaid, private insurance plans, accountable care organizations and managed care programs. Reimbursement is contingent on established coding for a given procedure, coverage of the codes by the third-party payers, and adequate payment for the resources used.
Physician coding for procedures is established by the American Medical Association, or AMA. For coding related to spine surgery, the North American Spine Society, or NASS, is the primary liaison to the AMA. In July of 2006, NASS established the proper physician coding for the XLIF procedure by declaring it to be encompassed in existing codes that describe an anterolateral approach to the spine. This position was confirmed in a formal statement by NASS in January 2010. Hospital coding is established by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. XLIF is included in the nomenclature for hospital codes as an additional descriptor under long standing codes. All physician and hospital coding is subject to change which could impact reimbursement and physician practice behavior.
Independent of the coding status, third-party payers may deny coverage based on their own criteria, including if they feel that a device or procedure is not well established clinically, is not the most cost-effective treatment available, or is used for an unapproved indication. At various times in the past, certain insurance providers have adopted policies of not providing reimbursement for the XLIF procedure. We have worked with our surgeon customers and NASS who, in turn, have worked with these insurance providers to supply the information, explanation and clinical data they require to categorize the XLIF procedure as a procedure entitled to reimbursement under their policies. At present, most major health insurance companies in the U.S. provide reimbursement for XLIF procedures.
However, certain carriers, large and small, may have policies significantly limiting coverage of XLIF, Interlaminar Lumbar Interbody Fusion, or ILIF, Osteocel Plus and Osteocel Pro, cervical interbody implants, and/or other procedures, products or services that we offer. We will continue to provide resources to patients, surgeons, hospitals, and insurers in order to ensure optimum patient care and clarity regarding reimbursement and work to remove any and all non-coverage policies. National and regional coverage policy decisions are subject to unforeseeable change and have the potential to impact physician behavior and reimbursement for physician services. We cannot offer definitive time frames or final outcomes regarding reversal of the coverage-limiting policies, as the process is dictated by the third-party insurance providers. For a discussion of these risks, please see the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report.
Payment amounts are established by government and private payer programs and are subject to fluctuations, which could impact physician practice behavior. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for a wide range of medical products and services, including those in spine and IONM where we participate.
In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific product lines. There can be no assurance that our products will be accepted by third-party payers, that reimbursement will be available, and/or that the third-party payers’ reimbursement policies (if available) will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably.
In the U.S., as a result of healthcare reform, third-party payers are increasingly required to demonstrate they can improve quality and reduce costs; we accordingly see an increase in pre-approval/prior authorizations and non-coverage policies citing higher levels of evidence required for medical therapies and technologies. In addition, insured individuals are facing increased premiums and higher out–of-pocket costs for medical coverage, which can lead a patient to delay medical treatment. An increasing number of insured individuals receive their medical care through managed care programs, which monitor and often require pre-approval of the services that a member will receive. The percentage of individuals covered by managed care programs is expected to grow in the U.S. over the next decade.
Overall escalating costs of medical products and services has led to, and is expected to continue to lead to, increased pressures on the healthcare industry to reduce the costs of products and services. There can be no assurance that third-party reimbursement and coverage will be available or adequate, or that future legislation, regulation, or reimbursement policies of third-party payers will not adversely affect the demand for our products and services or our ability to sell these products and services on a profitable basis. The unavailability or inadequacy of third-party payer coverage or reimbursement could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. For a discussion of these risks, please see the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report.
Human Capital Resources
Workforce Composition
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 3,000 employees worldwide. Approximately 2,500 employees were located within the U.S. and 500 employees were located outside of the U.S., primarily throughout Europe and Asia. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. Employees of our wholly-owned subsidiary, NuVasive Netherlands B.V., based in the Netherlands, are covered by a Works Council. In addition to our employees, we partner with independent sales representatives and independent distributors who sell our products in the U.S. and internationally. 
In the U.S., our sales force consists of directly employed sales representatives and independent sales representatives who are responsible for particular geographic regions of the country. Outside of the U.S., our sales force consists of directly employed sales representatives, independent sales representatives and independent territory-based distributors. We operate in a highly competitive industry and it is essential that we attract and retain qualified personnel through competitive compensation and benefits and a rewarding work environment in order to achieve our strategic business objectives. In particular, competition for sales talent in the spine industry is significant. Our sales force provides a delivery and consultative service to our surgeon and hospital customers, and our sales representatives often develop long-lasting relationships with the customers they serve. Accordingly, recruiting sales representatives with appropriate expertise, retaining our talent, and incentivizing our sales force is important to our success. We also believe we attract and retain sales talent based on the breadth of our spine product and service offerings, our enabling technologies, our commitment to investing in research and development and our new product innovation pipeline, as well our world-class surgeon training and education program, all of which we believe makes NuVasive a destination of choice for top sales talent. 
Compensation and Benefits
We offer competitive benefit packages, supporting our employees as they help to transform spine surgery. This includes encouraging a culture of health by providing wellness programs to best serve our employees and their family members. Our comprehensive benefits package may include competitive pay, annual incentive awards and bonus opportunities, healthcare and retirement benefits, an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, paid time off and sick leave, flexible work arrangements and a wellness program. 
Talent Development
We believe that success comes from investing in our people and ensuring our work force is aligned with our cultural mindset—The Cheetah Way. The Cheetah Way is the foundation of our culture that aligns our beliefs, actions, and how we work to fulfill our commitments. The Cheetah Way is how we deliver on our vision to change a patient’s life every minute. To achieve this goal, we devote time and resources to ensure that throughout our organization, employees are familiar with our business, industry and product offerings. Training is offered to new employees which teaches the anatomy and pathologies of the spine and our surgical procedures, and our sales representatives receive additional comprehensive training on our various product offerings. In addition, a key driver of our future growth is our ability to develop leaders. Employees are encouraged to partner with their manager to create individual plans to guide their development path and to incorporate training offerings and resources to support their growth and drive their continued success. Additionally, we regularly conduct talent reviews and succession planning to identify and develop our current and future leaders. We are committed to identifying and developing talent to help those employees accelerate their growth and achieve their career goals.
Employee Engagement and Communication
Our success depends on our employees understanding our vision as well as our strategic goals. This is accomplished through a number of channels, including a global intranet and sales enablement platform, regional and functional meetings, and quarterly updates in global Town Halls with leadership on our progress.
We value open and direct communication with our employees about their experiences. We use a variety of channels to obtain employee feedback, including employee surveys, open forums with leadership, and employee resource groups. Our annual employee engagement survey provides us with actionable data for the overall company and each department and also provides managers with upward feedback on how they are progressing against expectations. Each year, the input received through these mechanisms is used to help evolve our working environment and strengthen our culture. 
Diversity and Inclusion
We recognize the value associated with fostering a work environment that is culturally diverse and inclusive and believe that diverse teams stimulate innovation, enhance our understanding of the needs of our customers, and ultimately deliver better results for our stakeholders. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 59% of our total employees were male and approximately 41% were female, and women comprised approximately 33% of our roles at the manager level and above. In addition, as of December 31, 2022, our Board of Directors consisted of nine members, three of whom identified as female and one who identified as having a racial and ethnic background other than white. Our goal is to cultivate a respectful and professional environment where all voices are heard and valued, which is reflected in one of our competencies - leveraging differences. We have dedicated personnel focused on our diversity and inclusion vision and have established a framework for employee resource groups, which aim to highlight the value of diversity, inclusion and engagement, while providing professional development opportunities for employees of all genders, ethnicities and minority groups, backgrounds, experience levels, and locations. As we seek to create a more diverse and inclusive workforce, we have begun to monitor voluntarily disclosed diversity data to review hiring, promotion and attrition overall at the company and at the department level. We also review performance data and promotion and compensation information to ensure fair and objective decision-making. We believe that building diverse teams and leveraging broad perspectives will empower our employees and strengthen our ability to meet the needs of our customers, patients, and communities we serve.
Community
Our employees and sales representatives have a long history of providing support and care to our communities, donating time, resources and funds to local causes. Since 2009, we have leveraged our expertise in spine care to give back to local and global communities through the NuVasive Spine Foundation, or NSF, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. NSF supports life-changing spine surgery for individuals around the world with limited access to high quality medical treatment by working with surgeons to advance the quality of spine care in disadvantaged communities. In addition, through our grants program, we support medical research and education, charitable and philanthropic endeavors. We believe in giving back, and we also believe it is important to operate our company in a socially responsible manner.
Health, Safety, and Wellness 
We are committed to the protection of our employees, customers, communities and the environment. Our operations require the use of hazardous materials that subject us to various federal, state, and local environmental and safety laws and regulations. Our key areas of focus include corporate compliance with responsible hazardous waste management, recycling, emergency preparedness, as well as various initiatives to improve our health and safety programs with the goal of reducing and ultimately eliminating serious injuries. Our Environmental, Health & Safety personnel develop global safety practices and procedures, train employees, host annual safety campaigns, and monitor compliance with safety procedures. We have also taken additional measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including remote work arrangements for employees who are able to do so and implementing safety protocols and guidelines as recommended or required by federal, state, local and foreign governments.
We also provide well-being programs that support our employees and their families. For example, we offer an employee assistance program (EAP) to support emotional well-being and a wellness technology platform to help employees stay healthy and productive through virtual fitness classes and recognition awards to promote an active lifestyle. 
Human Capital Governance
Our Board of Directors receives regular updates on topics related to talent development, retention and recruiting initiatives, our diversity and inclusion program, succession planning, employee engagement and the results from our annual employee survey. Management also works closely with the Compensation Committee to establish goals and objectives and metrics in connection with the design and funding of the annual bonus opportunity for our employees. Additionally, the Nominating, Corporate Governance and Compliance Committee and the Audit Committee share oversight responsibilities related to the Company’s Code of Conduct which establishes policies pertaining to, among other things, employee conduct in the workplace, workplace safety, confidentiality, conflicts of interest, accuracy of books, records and financial statements, securities trading, anti-corruption, competition laws, interactions with health care professionals and political and charitable activities.
