All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this report, including statements regarding our future financial position, liquidity, business strategy and plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements.

Important factors, uncertainties and risks that may cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements include those summarized below in “Summary of Risk Factors,” as more particularly described in Item 1A. – Risk Factors. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as the result of new information, future events or otherwise.
 
Summary of Risk Factors
 
Our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that you should consider before investing in our common stock. Some of the principal risk factors that make an investment in the Company speculative or risky are summarized as follows:

● | We are still in the process of searching for an operating business to acquire, and if we fail to acquire a target business on favorable terms, within a reasonable timeframe or at all your investment in us could become worthless. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | We have a limited amount of time in which to acquire an operating business or sell a sufficient amount of securities we hold in order to no longer qualify as an “investment company” under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”). 
● | We have no operations and our likelihood of success is contingent upon the problems, expenses, and complications frequently encountered by companies in their infancy stage. 
● | We face intense competition in our search for an operating business to acquire, and many of our competitors have significantly greater resources than we do. 
● | Even if we are able to acquire an operating business, we will need to manage our growth effectively to become profitable and there can be no assurance we will have the resources to do so. 
● | We have limited capital and may need to raise additional capital in the future by issuing debt or equity securities, the terms of which may dilute our current investors and/or reduce or limit their liquidation or other rights. 
● | Our common stock is a “penny stock” under the Rules of the SEC, as defined, which reduces its liquidity. There is currently no active market for our securities, there can be no assurance that such a market will ever develop, and the future prices and liquidity of our securities could be unpredictable and volatile. 

 
These and other material risks we face are described more fully in Item 1A. – Risk Factors, which investors should carefully review prior to making an investment decision with respect to the Company or its securities.


Description of Business
 
The Company was incorporated in Nevada in November 2011 under the name TabacaleraYsidron, Inc. On December 9, 2019, the Company changed its name to “Banner Energy Services Corp.” by filing a certificate of amendment to its Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of Nevada. This name change became effective with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority as of February 11, 2020. On January 7, 2021, shareholders of the Company representing approximately 57% of the outstanding common shares, acted by written consent in lieu of a meeting to approve an amendment to the Company’s Articles of Incorporation to change the name of the Company to Fortium Holdings Corp. (the “Amendment”). The Amendment will be effective upon the Company’s filing of a Certificate of Amendment to the Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada.
 
On March 27, 2020, the Company sold Banner Midstream Corp., its former wholly-owned subsidiary, along with its four operating subsidiaries, Pinnacle Frac Transport LLC, Capstone Equipment Leasing LLC, White River Holdings Corp., and Shamrock Upstream Energy LLC, through which the Company formerly operated in the oil and gas industry, to Ecoark Holdings, Inc. (“Ecoark”). In consideration for the sale of its assets, the Company received 1,789,041 shares of Ecoark common stock (after giving effect to Ecoark’s subsequent one-for-five reverse stock split which was effective on December 17, 2020) in addition to Ecoark assuming all of the debt of Banner Midstream Corp. The majority of the shares of Ecoark common stock received by the Company in the transaction were used to pay the Company’s creditors and eliminate its liabilities on its balance sheet. As a result of these developments, the Company’s primary asset is currently 175,295 shares of Ecoark common stock post-reverse stock split as of December 31, 2020 and 167,508 as of January 26, 2021. Because the Company holds these shares and has no other assets, we are currently an “investment company” as such term is defined under the 1940 Act. The Company intends to sell a sufficient number of these shares for cash in fiscal year 2021 to terminate its status as an investment company under the 1940 Act. If we are unable to do so prior to March 27, 2021 we could become subject to the 1940 Act’s requirements. See Item 1A. – Risk Factors for more information. The Company is currently considering the subsequent use of the cash proceeds resulting from the proposed sale of the shares, including potentially making a cash distribution to its shareholders.
 
On July 31, 2020, Mr. Jay Puchir notified our Board of Directors (the “Board”) that he was resigning as the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. On July 31, 2020, the Board appointed Mr. Richard Horgan, as the Chief Executive Officer, and as our sole director and Chairman of the Board, effective August 1, 2020. Mr. Puchir was appointed Chief Accounting Officer of Ecoark as of March 27, 2020.

The Company currently has no operations and is seeking to acquire a new business in the United States, including potentially by means of a reverse merger with an operating entity. We have not generated revenues since we divested our operating subsidiaries and do not expect to do so in the short-term due to the early stage nature of our Company.
 
The evaluation and selection of a business opportunity is a complex and uncertain process, and we have not yet identified a target operating business for acquisition. Business opportunities that we believe are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders may be scarce, or we may be unable to obtain the businesses we identify as viable for our objectives, including due to competitive forces in the marketplace beyond our control. There can be no assurance that we will be able to locate compatible business opportunities for the Company. See Item 1A - Risk Factors.
 
Competition and Market Conditions
 
We will face substantial competition in our efforts to identify and pursue a business venture. The primary source of competition is expected to be from other companies organized and funded for similar purposes, including small venture capital firms, blank check companies, and wealthy investors, many of which may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. In light of our limited financial and human resources, we are at a competitive disadvantage compared to many of our competitors in our efforts to obtain an operating business or assets necessary to commence our operations in a new field. Additionally, with the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic, many venture capital firms and similar firms and individuals have been seeking to acquire businesses at discounted rates, and we therefore currently face additional competition and resultant difficulty obtaining a business. We expect these conditions to persist at least until such time as the economy recovers. This disadvantage may also be heightened by the reality that our primary asset is less liquid than cash, and many of our competitors have greater amounts of cash on hand for the purpose of making offers to purchase operating businesses. While we commenced selling our Ecoark common stock in October, 2020, we still have a substantial number of these shares remaining. Further, even if we are successful in obtaining a business or assets for new operations, we expect there to be enhanced barriers to entry in the marketplace in which we decide to operate as a result of reduced demand and/or increased raw material costs caused by the pandemic and other economic forces that are beyond our control.
