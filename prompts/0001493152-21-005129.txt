Item 1. Business.
 
We were incorporated in 1989 in the state of New Jersey under the name “A.R.C. Enterprises, Inc,” which was changed to “Akers Research Corporation” on September 28, 1990 and “Akers Laboratories, Inc.” on February 24, 1996. Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation filed on March 26, 2002, the corporation’s name was changed to “Akers Biosciences, Inc.”
 
We were historically a developer of rapid health information technologies. On March 23, 2020, we entered into that certain membership interest purchase agreement (the “Original MIPA” and, as subsequently amended by Amendment No, 1 on May 14, 2020, the “MIPA”) with the members of Cystron (the “Cystron Sellers”), pursuant to which we acquired 100% of the membership interests of Cystron (the “Cystron Membership Interests”). Cystron was incorporated on March 10, 2020 and is a party to a license agreement with Premas whereby Premas granted Cystron, among other things, an exclusive license with respect to Premas’ genetically engineered yeast (S. cerevisiae)-based vaccine platform, D-Crypt™, for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 and other coronavirus infections. Since our entry into the MIPA, we have been primarily focused on the rapid development and manufacturing of a COVID-19 vaccine candidate (the “COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate”), in collaboration with Premas.
 
Proposed Merger
 
On November 11, 2020, we entered into the Merger Agreement, pursuant to which, among other things, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into MYMD, with MYMD being the surviving corporation and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Merger”). The Merger is intended to qualify for federal income tax purposes as a tax-free reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). In addition, in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Akers agreed to advance a bridge loan of up to $3,000,000 to MYMD pursuant to a secured promissory note (the “Note”). Upon completion of the merger, the combined company is expected to be renamed MyMD Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
 
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, upon the effectiveness of the Merger, (i) holders of outstanding shares of MYMD common stock (“ MYMD stockholders”) will be entitled to receive (x) the number of shares of Akers common stock equal to an exchange ratio as described in the Merger Agreement (the “Exchange Ratio”) per share of MYMD common stock they hold, prior to giving effect to the proposed reverse stock split discussed below, (y) an amount in cash, on a pro rata basis, equal to the aggregate cash proceeds received by Akers from the exercise of any options to purchase shares of MYMD common stock assumed by Akers upon closing of the merger prior to the second-year anniversary of the closing of the merger (the “Option Exercise Period”), such payment (the “Additional Consideration”) to occur not later than 30 days after the last day of the Option Exercise Period, up to the maximum amount of cash consideration that may be received by MYMD stockholders without affecting the intended tax consequences of the merger, and (z) potential milestone payments (“Milestone Shares”) of up to the number of shares of Akers common stock issued to MYMD stockholders at closing of the Merger (“Milestone Payments”) payable upon achievement of certain market capitalization milestone events during the 36-month period immediately following the closing of the merger (the “Milestone Period”); and (ii) each outstanding option to purchase MYMD common stock granted under the Second Amendment to Amended & Restated 2016 Stock Incentive Plan with an effective date of July 1, 2019, as established and maintained by MYMD (and, as amended and restated from time to time, the “MyMD Incentive Plan”) that has not previously been exercised prior to the closing of the Merger, whether or not vested, will be assumed by Akers subject to certain terms contained in the Merger Agreement, and become an option to purchase a number of shares of the Akers common stock equal to the number of shares of MYMD common stock underlying such option multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, which options to purchase MYMD common stock shall be amended to expire on the second-year anniversary of the closing of the Merger, and the exercise price for each share of Akers common stock underlying an assumed option to purchase MYMD common stock will be equal to the exercise price per share of the option to purchase MYMD common stock in effect immediately prior to the completion of the merger divided by the Exchange Ratio. Assuming the exercise in full of the outstanding pre-funded warrants to purchase 1,040,540 shares of our common stock (“Pre-Funded Warrants”) issued in connection with the private placement between Akers and certain institutional and accredited investors that closed on November 17, 2020 (the “Private Placement”) and the exercise in full of additional pre-funded warrants to purchase 932,432 shares of common stock issued certain investors in February 2021 upon cancellation of shares of common stock purchased in the Private Placement and including 9,979,664 shares of combined company common stock underlying options to purchase shares of MYMD common stock to be assumed at the closing of the Merger, (i) MYMD stockholders and optionholders will own approximately 80% of the equity of the combined company; and (ii) our current stockholders, holders of certain outstanding of our options and warrants (excluding shares issuable upon exercise of options and warrants having an exercise price in excess of $1.72, prior to giving effect to any such stock splits, combinations, reorganizations and the like with respect to the Akers common stock between the announcement of the Merger and the closing of the Merger) and holders of our outstanding restricted stock units (“RSUs”) immediately prior to the Merger will own approximately 20% of the equity of the combined company.

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, on January 15, 2020, we and MYMD filed an initial Registration Statement on Form S-4 (Registration No. 333-252181) (together with the joint proxy and consent solicitation/prospectus included therein, the “S-4 Registration Statement”) describing the Merger and other related matters. Consummation of the Merger is conditioned upon, among other things, approval of the Merger by the stockholders of Akers (including (i) approval, for purposes of complying with Nasdaq Listing rule 5635(a), the issuance of shares of Akers common stock to MYMD stockholders and other parties in connection with the Merger, the Merger Agreement, and the transactions contemplated thereby or in connection therewith (the “Share Issuance Proposal”), (ii) approval of an amendment to the amended and restated certificate of incorporation of the combined company, which will be in effect at the effective time of the merger (the “A&R Charter”) to effect a reverse stock split, if applicable, at a reverse stock split ratio mutually agreed by the Company and MYMD and within the range approved by our stockholders immediately prior to the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement), which range shall be sufficient to cause the price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market following the reverse stock split and the Effective Time to be no less than $5.00 per share with respect to the issued and outstanding common stock of the combined company immediately following the merger (the “Reverse Stock Split Proposal”), and (iii) approval of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation of Akers which will be in effect upon consummation of the Merger (the “A&R Charter Proposal”), among others), approval of the Merger by the stockholders of MYMD, the continued listing of Akers’ common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market after the Merger and satisfaction of a minimum cash threshold by Akers. In addition, the Merger Agreement requires that MYMD consummate the purchase of substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of Supera Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Florida corporation (“Supera”) pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement pursuant to which MYMD agreed to acquire from Supera, immediately prior to the completion of the Merger, substantially all of its assets (the “Supera Purchase”). After closing of the Merger, the operations of MYMD’s business will comprise substantially all of the combined company’s operations. There is no assurance when or if the Merger will be completed. Any delay in completing the Merger may substantially reduce the potential benefits that we expect to obtain from the Merger. Furthermore, the intended benefits of the Merger may not be realized.
 
Coronavirus and COVID-19 Pandemic
 
In December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China, and on March 12, 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) declared the global outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, to be a pandemic. In an effort to contain and mitigate the spread of COVID-19, many countries, including the United States, Canada, China, and India, have imposed unprecedented restrictions on travel, quarantines, and other public health safety measures. According to the WHO situation report, dated as of February 16, 2021, approximately 108.2 million cases were reported globally and 2.4 million of these were deadly, making the development of effective vaccines to prevent this disease a major global priority. Multiple vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 are under development, and in December 2020, certain large, multinational pharmaceutical companies were granted authorizations for emergency use by the FDA. Widespread distribution of the currently-available vaccines has begun pursuant to Operation Warp Speed, a partnership among components of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, and the Department of Defense, as well as certain private firms and other federal agencies. The treatments for COVID-19, including symptomatic and supportive therapies, among other things, continue to be updated on a rolling basis by healthcare authorities and agencies.

Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Our Business
 
The ultimate impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to future developments. These include but are not limited to the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, and any additional preventative and protective actions that regulators, or our board of directors or management, may determine are needed. We do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, our vaccine development efforts, healthcare systems or the global economy as a whole. However, the effects are likely to have a material impact on our operations, liquidity and capital resources, and we will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely.
 
In response to public health directives and orders, we have implemented work-from-home policies for many of our employees and temporarily modified our operations to comply with applicable social distancing recommendations. The effects of the orders and our related adjustments in our business are likely to negatively impact productivity, disrupt our business and delay our timelines, the magnitude of which will depend, in part, on the length and severity of the restrictions and other limitations on our ability to conduct our business in the ordinary course. Similar health directives and orders are affecting third parties with whom we do business, including Premas, whose operations are located in India. Further, restrictions on our ability to travel, stay-at-home orders and other similar restrictions on our business have limited our ability to support our operations.
 
Severe and/or long-term disruptions in our operations will negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition in other ways, as well. Specifically, we anticipate that the stress of COVID-19 on healthcare systems generally around the globe will negatively impact regulatory authorities and the third parties that we and Premas may engage in connection with the development and testing of our COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate.
 
In addition, while the potential economic impact brought by, and the duration of, COVID-19 may be difficult to assess or predict, it has significantly disrupted global financial markets, and may limit our ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity. A recession or market correction resulting from the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic could materially affect our business and the value of our common stock.
 
Coronavirus Vaccine Development
 
We have partnered with Premas on the development of the COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate as we seek to advance such candidate through the regulatory process, both with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and the office of the drug controller in India. Premas is primarily responsible for the development of the COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate through proof of concept and is entitled to receive milestone payments upon achievement of certain development milestones through proof of concept.
 
Premas’ D-Crypt platform has been developed to express proteins that are difficult to clone, express and manufacture and are a key component in vaccine development. Premas has identified three major structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 as antigens for potential vaccine candidates for COVID-19: spike protein or S protein, envelope protein or E protein, and membrane protein or M protein. In April 2020, Premas used its D-Crypt platform to recombinantly express all three of such antigens, which we considered a significant milestone for development of a triple antigen vaccine. We believe including a combination of all three antigens will provide advantages against the likelihood of protein mutation, in which case a single-protein vaccine can be rendered non-efficacious, and therefore, enhance efficacy of our vaccine candidates. We believe the D-Crypt provides us advantages in vaccine production and manufacturing, as the technology platform is highly scalable with a robust process, which we expect will ultimately result in significant cost savings compared to other similar vaccine platforms. Based on genetically engineered baker’s yeast S. cerevisiae, the platform is highly scalable into commercial production quantities and has been previously utilized for the production of multiple human and animal health vaccines candidates during its 10-year development track record. Yeast has a large endoplasmic reticulum, or (“ER”), which is a desirable attribute for expressing membrane protein. In complex cells, ER is where the protein is formed. The larger the surface, the more membrane protein that can attach to the ER inside the cell. Yeast is also generally believed to be easily manipulated and allow for results to be gathered quickly. Yeast multiplies faster than mammalian cells and is cheaper to work with than mammalian systems, which are much more complex and slower to grow comparatively. Yeast has received “Generally Recommended as Safe” status from the FDA.

As of May 14, 2020, Premas successfully completed its vaccine prototype and obtained transmission electron microscopic (“TEM”) images of the recombinant virus like particle (“VLP”) assembled in yeast. A manufacturing protocol has also been established and large-scale production studies have been initiated for our COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate. Though the prototype is complete, the COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate is still in early stages of development, and, accordingly, must undergo pre-clinical testing and all phases of clinical trials before we can submit a marketing application (in this case, a Biologics License Application, or “BLA”) to the FDA. The BLA must be approved by the FDA before any biological product, including vaccines, may be lawfully marketed in the United States. We believe the most pivotal, yet difficult, stage in our anticipated development of the contemplated COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate is the requisite conduct of extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate. Additionally, after we complete the necessary pre-clinical testing, but before we may begin any clinical studies in the United States, we must submit an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application to the FDA, as this is required before any clinical studies may be conducted in the United States. In some cases, clinical studies may be conducted in other countries; however, the FDA may not accept data from foreign clinical studies in connection with a BLA (or other marketing application) submission.
 
In July 2020, animal studies for our COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate were initiated in India. In addition, we announced that Premas has successfully completed the manufacturing process for the VLP vaccine candidate. On August 27, 2020, we announced with Premas positive proof of concept results from the animal studies conducted during a four-week test of the COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate in mice. The test had two primary endpoints, safety and immune responses, both of which were met. The study consisted of 50 mice, divided into 10 cohorts dosed with 5, 10 and 20 micrograms of the COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate. The COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate was generally well tolerated and safe at all doses, with no adverse events reported. The COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate was safe even at higher doses and generated a robust immune response against the three SARS-Cov2 antigens, S, E, and M. The COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate elicited neutralizing antibody titers levels in all the dose cohorts starting from 5 microgram to 20 microgram dose regimens. After three doses in mice, all the groups’ cohorts showed binding antibody levels similar to convalescent patients’ levels. Clinical testing is expensive, time consuming, and uncertain as to outcome. We cannot guarantee that any clinical trials will be conducted as planned or completed in a timely manner, if at all. Failures in connection with one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing.
 

Premas owns, and has exclusively licensed rights to us to, two provisional Indian patent applications filed in January and March 2020. The scope of these Indian provisional patent applications is directed, respectively, to (i) a platform for the expression of difficult to express proteins (“DTE-Ps”), which might provide coverage for a method of making the to-be-developed vaccine; and (ii) an expression platform for SARS-CoV-2-like virus proteins, methods relevant thereto, and a relevant vaccine. If non-provisional patent rights are pursued claiming priority to each of these two provisional applications, any resulting patent rights that issue might not expire until approximately January 20, 2041 and March 4, 2041, if all annuities and maintenance fees are timely paid. The expiration dates may be extendable beyond these dates depending on the jurisdiction and the vaccine development process. As we do not own the patents or patent applications that we license, we may need to rely upon Premas to properly prosecute and maintain those patent applications and prevent infringement of those patents.
 
Competition
 
We face, and will continue to face, intense competition from large pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as well as academic and research institutions pursing research and development of technologies, drugs or other therapies that would compete with our products or product candidates. The pharmaceutical market is highly competitive, subject to rapid technological change and significantly affected by existing rival drugs and medical procedures, new product introductions and the market activities of other participants. Our competitors may develop products more rapidly or more effectively than us. If our competitors are more successful in commercializing their products than us, their success could adversely affect our competitive position and harm our business prospects.

Specifically, the competitive landscape of potential COVID-19 vaccines and treatment therapies has been rapidly developing since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, with several hundreds of companies claiming to be investigating possible candidates and approximately 4,800 studies registered worldwide as investigating COVID-19 (source: clinicaltrials.gov). Given the global footprint and the widespread media attention on the COVID-19 pandemic, there are efforts by public and private entities to develop a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as possible, including large, multinational pharmaceutical companies such as AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Pfizer, and Sanofi. In December 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorizations for vaccines developed by certain of these large, multinational pharmaceutical companies and it is possible that additional vaccines developed by such large, multinational pharmaceutical companies may receive further approvals and authorizations in the near term. Those other entities have vaccine candidates that are currently at a more advanced stage of development than our COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate and may develop COVID-19 vaccines that are more effective than any vaccine we may develop, may develop a COVID-19 vaccine that becomes the standard of care, may develop a COVID-19 vaccine at a lower cost or earlier than we are able to jointly develop any COVID-19 vaccine, or may be more successful at commercializing a COVID-19 vaccine. Many of these other organizations are much larger than we are and have access to larger pools of capital, and as such, are able to fund and carry on larger research and development initiatives. Such other entities may have greater development capabilities than we do and have substantially greater experience in undertaking nonclinical and clinical testing of vaccine candidates, obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products. Our competitors may also have greater name recognition and better access to customers. In addition, based on the competitive landscape, additional COVID-19 vaccines or therapeutics may continue be approved to be marketed. Should another party be successful in producing a more efficacious vaccine for COVID-19, such success could reduce the commercial opportunity for our COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. Moreover, if we experience delayed regulatory approvals or disputed clinical claims, we may not have the commercial or clinical advantage over competitors’ products that we believe we currently possess. The success or failure of other entities, or perceived success or failure, may adversely impact our ability to obtain any future funding for our vaccine development efforts or for us to ultimately commercialize and market any vaccine candidate, if approved. In addition, we may not be able to compete effectively if our product candidates do not satisfy government procurement requirements with respect to biodefense products.
 
Acquisition and License Agreements
 
On March 23, 2020, we acquired Cystron pursuant to the MIPA. As consideration for the Cystron Membership Interests, we delivered to the Cystron Sellers: (1) that number of newly issued shares of our common stock equal to 19.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock and pre-funded warrants as of the date of the MIPA, but, to the extent that the issuance of our common stock would have resulted in any Seller owning in excess of 4.9% of our outstanding common stock, then, at such Seller’s election, such Seller received “common stock equivalent” preferred shares with a customary 4.9% blocker (with such common stock and preferred stock collectively referred to as “Common Stock Consideration”), and (2) $1,000,000 in cash. On March 24, 2020, we paid $1,000,000 to the Cystron Sellers and delivered 411,403 shares of common stock and 211,353 shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock with a customary 4.9% blocker, with an aggregate fair market value of $1,233,057. 
 
Additionally, we are required to (A) make an initial payment to the Cystron Sellers of up to $1,000,000 upon its receipt of cumulative gross proceeds from the consummation of an initial equity offering after the date of the MIPA of $8,000,000, and (B) pay to the Cystron Sellers an amount in cash equal to 10% of the gross proceeds in excess of $8,000,000 raised from future equity offerings after the date of the MIPA until the Cystron Sellers have received an aggregate additional cash consideration equal to $10,000,000 (collectively, the “Equity Offering Payments”). On May 14, 2020, we entered into an Amendment No. 1 to the MIPA with the Cystron Sellers, which provided that any Equity Offering Payments in respect of an equity offering that is consummated prior to September 23, 2020, shall be accrued, but shall not be due and payable until September 24, 2020. The other provisions of the MIPA remained unmodified and in full force and effect. Upon the achievement of certain milestones, including the completion of a Phase 2 study for a COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate that meets its primary endpoints, the Cystron Sellers are entitled to receive an additional 750,000 shares of our common stock or, in the event we are unable to obtain stockholder approval for the issuance of such shares, 750,000 shares of non-voting preferred stock that are valued following the achievement of such milestones and shall bear a 10% annual dividend (the “Cystron Milestone Shares”). At the 2020 annual meeting of our stockholders, held on August 27, 2020, pursuant to Nasdaq listing rule 5635(a), our stockholders approved of the issuance of Common Stock Consideration (as defined in the MIPA) and the potential future issuance of Cystron Milestone Shares in excess of 20% of our common stock outstanding prior to the closing of the Cystron acquisition. 
 
Pursuant to the MIPA, the Company shall make contingent payments for the achievement of certain development and commercial milestones as follows; (i) $250,000 upon the dosing of the first patient in a Phase I Clinical Trial, (ii) $500,000 upon the dosing of the first patient in a Phase II Clinical Trial, (iii) $5,000,000 upon the dosing of the first patient in a Phase III Clinical Trial, and (iv) $15,000,000 upon approval by the FDA of the NDA for the COVID-19 vaccine.

Pursuant to the Original MIPA, upon our consummation of the registered direct equity offering closed on April 8, 2020, we paid the Cystron Sellers $250,000 on April 20, 2020 (the “April Payment”). On April 30, 2020, Premas, one of the Cystron Sellers, returned to us $83,334, representing their portion of the $250,000 amount paid to the Cystron Sellers on April 20, 2020. Premas advised us that these funds were returned temporarily for Premas to meet certain regulatory requirements in India. We recorded liabilities of $892,500 (the “May Payment”) and $684,790 (the “August Payment”) to the Cystron Sellers upon the consummation of the registered direct equity offerings that closed on May 18, 2020 and August 13, 2020, respectively. These funds (including funds of $299,074 representing Premas’ portion of the cash purchase price and $83,334 representing Premas’ portion of the April Payment temporarily returned to us in April 2020) due the sellers under the MIPA were disbursed on September 25, 2020. On October 13, 2020, Premas returned $908,117 representing Premas’ portion of the initial cash component for the purchase of Cystron and Premas’ portion of the April Payment, May Payment and August Payment under the MIPA. Premas is working with the Reserve Bank of India to comply with regulations related to its ownership in a foreign entity and its ability to receive funds for the sale of that entity. The Company believes that (i) Premas will be successful in its efforts to resolve such regulatory matters with the Reserve Bank of India, (ii) the Company will disburse the amounts due to Premas under the MIPA, and (iii) the Company maintains a 100% membership interest in Cystron.
 
Upon the consummation of the Private Placement, the Company paid $1,204,525 of the proceeds from the Private Placement to three of the four former members of Cystron and recorded a liability of $602,172 to the fourth former member of Cystron pursuant to the MIPA.
 
We shall also make quarterly royalty payments to the Cystron Sellers equal to 5% of the net sales of a COVID-19 vaccine or combination product by us for a period of five (5) years following the first commercial sale of the COVID-19 vaccine; provided, that such payment shall be reduced to 3% for any net sales of the COVID-19 vaccine above $500 million.
 
In addition, the Cystron Sellers shall be entitled to receive 12.5% of the transaction value, as defined in the MIPA, of any change of control transaction, as defined in the MIPA, that occurs prior to the fifth (5th) anniversary of the closing date of the MIPA, provided that we are still developing the COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate at that time. Following the consummation of any change of control transaction, the Cystron Sellers shall not be entitled to any payments as described above under the MIPA.
 
Support Agreement
 
On March 23, 2020, as an inducement to enter into the MIPA, and as one of the conditions to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the MIPA, the Cystron Sellers entered into a shareholder voting agreement with us, pursuant to which each Cystron Seller agreed to vote their shares of our common stock or preferred stock in favor of each matter proposed and recommended for approval by our management at every meeting of the stockholders and on any action or approval by written consent of the stockholders.
Registration Rights Agreement
 
To induce the Cystron Sellers to enter into the MIPA, on March 23, 2020, we entered into a registration rights agreement with the Cystron Sellers, pursuant to which we filed with the SEC a Registration Statement on Form S-3, as amended, covering resale of the Common Stock Consideration, which was declared effective on June 12, 2020. We also agreed to subsequently register Cystron Milestone Shares, if such securities are issued in the future.

License Agreement
 
Cystron is a party to the License Agreement with Premas. As a condition to our entry into the MIPA, Cystron amended and restated the Initial License Agreement on March 19, 2020. Pursuant to the License Agreement, Premas granted Cystron, amongst other things, an exclusive license with respect to Premas’ vaccine platform for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 and other coronavirus infections.
 
Upon the achievement of certain developmental milestones by Cystron, Cystron shall pay to Premas a total of up to $2,000,000. On April 16, 2020, we paid Premas $500,000 for the achievement of the first two development milestones. On May 18, 2020, we paid Premas $500,000 for the achievement of the third development milestone. On July 7, 2020, we agreed with Premas that the fourth milestone under the License Agreement had been satisfied. Due to the achievement of this milestone on July 7, 2020, Premas was paid $1,000,000 on August 4, 2020.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We have exclusive rights in-licensed from Premas (as discussed above) to certain know-how and two provisional Indian patent applications filed in January and March 2020. The following table summarizes the two provisional Indian patent applications.

Description | Jurisdiction | Application No. | Expiration Date 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------+---------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Platform for the expression of difficult to express proteins (DTE-Ps) | India | 202011002479 | If a nonprovisional application is filed within one year of the provisional application, any resulting patent would expire on January 20, 2041. 
Expression platform for SARS-Co-V-like virus proteins, methods relevant thereto, and relevant vaccine | India | 202011009383 | If a nonprovisional application is filed within one year of the provisional application, any resulting patent would expire on March 4, 2041. 

 
As we do not own the patent applications that we in-license, we may need to rely upon Premas to properly prosecute and maintain those and additional related patent applications, and to prevent infringement of any resulting patents.
 
We have two U.S. registered trademarks for “Akers Bio.”
 
Government Regulation and Product Approval
 
Federal, state, and local government authorities in the United States and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of biological and pharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. Our prospective vaccine candidate(s) must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the United States and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agency before they may be legally marketed in foreign countries. Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the United States. The process for obtaining regulatory marketing approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.

U.S. Product Development Process
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceutical and biological products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FD&C Act”), the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”), and their respective implementing regulations. Products are also subject to other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA sanctions could include, among other actions, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a drug or biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

● | completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to FDA’s Good Laboratory Practices (“GLPs”), and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practice, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended use; 
● | submission to the FDA of a BLA for marketing approval that meets applicable requirements to ensure the continued safety, purity, and potency of the product that is the subject of the BLA based on results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials; 
● | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced, to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMPs”), to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
● | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical study and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and 
● | FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA. 

 
Before testing any biological vaccine candidate in humans, the vaccine candidate enters the pre-clinical testing stage. Pre-clinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the vaccine candidate. The conduct of the pre-clinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. The clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some pre-clinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trials and places the trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trials.

Clinical trials involve the administration of the biological product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations composing the Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”) requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, (“IRB”), at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 

● | Phase 1. The biological product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in subjects having the specific disease. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Phase 2. The biological product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule. 
● | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk to benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. 

 
Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up.
 
During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to subjects.
 
Concurrently with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other criteria, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

U.S. Review and Approval Processes
 
After the completion of clinical trials of a biological product, FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the biological product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human trials, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data, or full or partial waivers. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, as amended (“PDUFA”), each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for biological products. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business.
 
Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, potent, and/or effective for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve a BLA without a REMS, if required.
 
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial requirements and GCP requirements. To assure cGMP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control.
 
Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. If the agency decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, seeing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.
 
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product.

Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescription, or dispensation in the form of a risk management plan, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biological product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
 
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers.
 
Post-Approval Requirements
 
Any products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved uses, known as “off-label” use, limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, if the physicians deem to be appropriate in their professional medical judgment, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses.
 
In addition, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to applicable manufacturing requirements after approval to ensure the long-term stability of the product. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. Other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
 
Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our prospective vaccine candidate(s).
 
Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 
In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), for instance the Office of Inspector General, the U.S. Department of Justice, or (“DOJ”), and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the false claims laws, the physician payment transparency laws, the privacy and security provisions of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health or “HITECH” Act, and similar state laws, each as amended.

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute (“AKS”) prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The AKS has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor, however, does not make the conduct per se illegal under the AKS. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances.
 
Additionally, the intent standard under the AKS was amended by the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) to a stricter standard, such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the AKS constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act, or (“FCA”), as discussed below.
 
The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
 
The federal FCA prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses.
 
HIPAA created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the AKS, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 
Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.

We may be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the HITECH Act, imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates, independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 
Additionally, the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act of 2010 (“PPSA”) under the ACA, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with certain exceptions, to report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately, and completely the required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for “knowing failures”. Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on pharmaceutical manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare providers and entities.
 
In order to distribute products commercially, we must also comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
 
U.S. Healthcare Reform
 
We anticipate that current and future U.S. legislative healthcare reforms may result in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product, if covered, and could seriously harm our business. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our prospective vaccine candidate(s). In addition, it is possible that there will be further legislation or regulation that could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
