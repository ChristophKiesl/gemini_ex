Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

Company Overview 
 We are a blank check company incorporated on March 31, 2021 as a Cayman Islands exempted company incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to throughout this Annual Report as our initial business combination. Our Sponsor is Jaguar Global Growth Partners I, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company. 
 The registration statement for our initial public offering (the Initial Public Offering) was declared effective on February 10, 2022. On February 15, 2022, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 23,000,000 units (Units and, with respect to the Class A ordinary shares included in the Units being offered, the Class A Ordinary Shares), at $10.00 per Unit, which includes the exercise in full of the underwriters option to purchase an additional 3,000,000 Units at the initial public offering price to cover over-allotments, generating gross proceeds of $230.0 million, and incurring offering costs of approximately $12.65 million, inclusive of $8.05 million in deferred underwriting commissions. Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share, $0.0001 par value per share, one right to receive one-twelfth (1/12) of one Class A Ordinary Share and one-half of one redeemable warrant (the Public Warrants), each whole Public Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Class A Ordinary Share at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. 
 Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the private placement (Private Placement) of 12,450,000 warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant (Private Placement Warrants) to the Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of $12.45 million. 
 Upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement on February 15, 2022, $234.6 million ($10.20 per Unit) of the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement were placed in a non-interest bearing trust account (Trust Account) located in the United States with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee. Since the Initial Public Offering, the proceeds have been and will only be invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act), having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act, which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a business combination and (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account as described below. 
 If we have not completed our initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, or August 15, 2023, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, if any (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses and which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of the then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. 
 Our Partnership 
 We are a partnership between Gary R. Garrabrant and Thomas J. McDonald (the Jaguar Founders), who are experienced executives with extensive deal-making and investment management experience, most recently through their partnership, Jaguar Growth Partners Group, LLC (Jaguar), a holding company for a differentiated, global investment management firm focused on real estate private and public equity in developing and developed markets, and Hennessy Capital Group LLC (Hennessy Capital Group), a leading independent SPAC sponsor. We seek to leverage the global industry relationships and extensive SPAC experience of our officers, directors and advisors with founders, venture capitalists and growth equity managers to identify, screen, select, and partner with a high growth, cutting-edge real estate operating, or PropTech business. Our management team believes that its unique access to global real estate operating and PropTech companies, coupled with a demonstrable SPAC track record, will be central to its differentiated investment strategy.

 About Jaguar Growth Partners Group, LLC 
 Jaguar is a holding company formed by the Jaguar Founders for the purpose of holding the controlling interest in other entities such as Jaguar Growth Partners, LLC (JGP), an institutional investment management firm focused on real estate companies, operating in compelling growth markets globally. Founded in 2013, Jaguar is privately held by the Jaguar Founders. Over their careers, the Jaguar Founders have deployed more than $1.4 billion of capital and managed over $3 billion of assets in more than 20 portfolio companies across 12 countries in Asia, Europe and Latin America. We will leverage the Jaguar Founders capabilities, relationships, networks, third-party investment support functions and deal pipeline to support us in the identification and diligence of potential targets for the initial business combination. 
 The Jaguar Founders approach to investing has been developed and refined over 20 years, using their long-standing experience, global presence and extensive networks to formulate differentiated investment themes across core industry sectors and geographies. The Jaguar Founders utilize thesis-driven investment strategies informed by deep sector knowledge, experience and proprietary research and networks to identify differentiated, typically off-market investment opportunities. In addition to a core focus on backing talented entrepreneurs and management teams, the broader investment strategy hinges on the development of specific industry theses and seeking to combine the right management teams with these theses to create successful portfolio companies. As part of the differentiated approach to investing, the Jaguars Founders global formal and informal network of professionals work collaboratively across geographies and sectors to ensure that the right people with the right experience are able to assist in achieving investment objectives. Jaguars investment approach emphasizes the importance of local teams and advisors spanning North America, Latin America, Europe and Asia. The Jaguar Founders bring a distinguished reputation that is characterized by a (i) partner-centric highly active approach to investing in privately-held and publicly-held real estate operating platforms and companies in developing and developed markets; and (ii) history at the vanguard of growth markets with a proven track record implementing innovative solutions and technologies which include the implementation of omni-channel/e-commerce solutions in the Brazil retail sectors and incorporating mobility analytics to support reservation, pricing and yield management in the Mexican hospitality sector. 
 The Jaguar Founders have also demonstrated success across investment segments including retail, logistics, homebuilding, hospitality, healthcare, specialty finance, real estate and technology. Within each sector, Jaguars network is further organized by deep subsector specialization. 
 The Jaguar Founders current investments are centered in JGP. JGPs current discretionary funds, which are managed by Jaguar Growth Asset Management, LLC, an SEC-registered investment advisor, include: (i) Jaguar Real Estate Partners I and II, LP, which are exclusively focused on Latin America and diversified by multiple geographies, sectors and company stages; and (ii) Jaguar Partners Asia L.P., the inaugural fund in an anticipated series of funds dedicated to scalable real estate opportunities across Asia, inclusive of sectors such as warehouse, distribution and logistics, cold storage, data infrastructure and housing. None of JGP, Jaguar Real Estate Partners I and II, LP, and Jaguar Partners Asia L.P.s investment teams were involved in or will be involved in the formation and/or management of the Company. 
 We believe that the Jaguar Founders long history, industry and geographic knowledge and extensive and long-established relationships provide a significant advantage in sourcing new transactions. Jaguars transactions are principally sourced through Jaguars relationships with entrepreneurs, industry contacts, institutional investors and outside advisors rather than through intermediated and competitive auctions. To illustrate these deal sourcing capabilities, since 2013, Jaguar has sourced 100% of its deals through Jaguars relationships rather than through competitive auctions. We believe that Jaguars expansive network, composed of current and former portfolio company executives and board members as well as long-standing industry relationships, serves as a distinct competitive advantage in the identification, evaluation, execution and management of the target company. 
 The Jaguar Founders bring over two decades of experience and an extensive track record of investing in diversified sectors such as retail, logistics, homebuilding, hospitality, healthcare, specialty finance, real estate and technology. For example, in 2020, Jaguar, in partnership with the founders of one of Asias premier real estate private equity platforms, jointly acquired an established, asset-light, vertically integrated logistics operator and developer. Jaguar identified several drivers leading to the opportunity in the Asia logistics sector such as demand for modern warehouses driven by domestic consumption growth and e-commerce penetration and the limited quality site availability and access. Jaguar partnered with operating executives who have deployed $2 billion over the past 16 years on behalf of global institutional limited partners. Jaguar was able to capitalize on long-term secular trends by leveraging Jaguars history, track record and extensive relationships in the region to invest in operating platforms and properties across traditional and alternative real estate sectors throughout Asia.

 The Jaguar Founders, while at a prior prominent investment management real estate firm, recorded a notable success following an invitation to transform a regional, affordable entry-level homebuilder into an institutional quality national leader. Homex, a Mexican homebuilder, incorporated innovative propriety technology such that we believe it may be considered one of the first PropTech businesses. Recognized as singular, the Homex technology effectively integrated and monitored every aspect of operations, including land acquisition, construction, payroll, purchasing, sales, quality control, financing, delivery, and maintenance. The technology resulted in lowered construction costs, controlled payroll costs, administered client relations, and propelled growth, with plans to implement this technology to large-scale home building ventures in various growth markets including China, India and the Persian Gulf. The Homex platform investment is a good example of the Jaguar Founders ability to optimize their investment strategy to construct a business platform and exit the platform at the most opportune time so as to maximize their investment return and minimize their investment risk profile. The Jaguar Founders strategic direction and development of domestic and international growth initiatives led to highly successful NYSE and Mexican Bolsa public offerings and a 16.8x gross multiple / 81% gross IRR on investment. 
 In 2000, after two years of deep market diligence and with the tailwinds of NAFTA and its impact on regional free trade, the Jaguar Founders invested in Corporate Properties of Americas. Working with founding partners of Black Creek Group, the Jaguar Founders transformed a limited scope development platform into an institutional industrial property owner and operator. A transformational capitalization of $250 million, a first by a major U.S. state pension fund, an innovative $300 million portfolio debt financing with Met Life and GE Capital and growing the national portfolio to over 10 million square feet are among the attributes that lead to a 3.0x gross multiple on invested capital and a 25% gross IRR on investment. 
 In 2011, following years of evaluating prospective partners and investment opportunities in India, the Jaguar Founders made an investment in early-stage hotel company SAMHI. Headquartered in Gurgaon, SAMHI was founded and led by a local entrepreneur who previously established the Indian presence of a publicly traded hotel company with a global presence. SAMHI was and is distinguished by its management team, focus on high-growth markets, and the first investment in India by the Jaguar Founders. 
 In 2018, Jaguar invested in Bresco Growth Fundo de Investimento Imobiliário (Bresco), an established, logistics real estate platform that capitalizes on strong demand from multinational corporations seeking Class A, institutional quality space in Brazil. Brescos portfolio of R$2.3 billion of net asset value (USD$442 million), 594,000 square meters of gross leasable area, or GLA, and 21 assets with total expansion plans expected to reach 1.5 million square meters of combined GLA by 2023. In December 2019, Bresco created a publicly listed yield fund (FII Bresco Logistica) to serve as an acquirer of Brescos developments and increase competitiveness in sale/leaseback purchases. 
 Jaguar has also demonstrated success in the retail industry which has generated significant return on investment. As an example, in 2016, Jaguar invested in AliansceSonae, a leading publicly-held Brazilian shopping center owner-operator and led the company in whats believed to be the first public-to-public merger within the Brazilian shopping mall sector. AliansceSonae is the largest shopping mall by number of properties comprising 39 shopping malls and approximately 1.4 million meters of GLA. 
 About Hennessy Capital Group 
 Hennessy Capital Group is a Wilson, Wyoming and Los Angeles, California based alternative investment firm founded in 2013 by Daniel J. Hennessy. Since its founding, Hennessy Capital Group has been one of the leading independent SPAC sponsors, having raised, together with its managing partners, a total of eight SPACs since 2013 aggregating over $1.8 billion of equity. Hennessy Capital Groups mission is to be a strategic growth partner for founders, management, employees and shareholders. 
 The Hennessy Capital Group team is led by Daniel J. Hennessy, Thomas D. Hennessy and M. Joseph Beck. Mr. Daniel J. Hennessy, the Founder and Managing Member of Hennessy Capital Group, is one of the longest tenured and most experienced independent SPAC sponsors. He has served as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp., Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. II, Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. III, Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV, Hennessy Capital Investment Corp. V (NASDAQ: HCIC) and Hennessy Capital Investment Corp. VI (NASDAQ: HCVI). Mr. Hennessy has successfully orchestrated four successful business combinations with Blue Bird Corporation (NASDAQ: BLBD), Daseke, Inc. (NASDAQ: DSKE), NRC Group Holdings Corp. (NYSE American: NRCG, acquired by NASDAQ: ECOL) and Canoo Holdings Ltd (NASDAQ: GOEV). In addition, Mr. Hennessy was a senior advisor to PropTech Acquisition Corporation, or PTAC, a special purpose acquisition company which announced its business combination with Porch.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: PRCH), or Porch, in July 2020 and is currently a senior advisor to each of PropTech Investment Corporation II (NASDAQ: PTIC), or PTIC, a special purpose acquisition company which conducted an initial public offering in December 2020, and 7GC & Co. Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: VII), or VII, a special purpose acquisition company which conducted an initial public offering in December 2020.

 With a combined 27 years of real estate experience, Mr. Thomas D. Hennessy and Mr. Beck bring a unique track record, proprietary relationships and deep expertise that is suited to take advantage of the growing set of investment opportunities in the PropTech space and to create shareholder value. Since 2019, Mr. Hennessy and Mr. Beck have served as the Managing Partners of Growth Strategies of Hennessy Capital Group. Mr. Hennessy and Mr. Beck were formerly senior investment professionals of Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, or ADIA, the worlds largest institutional real estate investor. While at ADIA, Mr. Hennessy conceived and led ADIAs PropTech initiative and investment mandate, which included extensive due diligence on every major U.S. PropTech venture capital fund as well as meetings with numerous PropTech founders and companies. Mr. Hennessys PropTech efforts at ADIA resulted in assembling a global team of investment professionals, creating a network and establishing relationships with the major global PropTech participants and ultimately making a significant investment into PropTech. 
 Since November 2019, Mr. Hennessy and Mr. Beck were Co-CEOs of PTAC, the first SPAC to target businesses in PropTech, and in July 2020 announced its entry into a definitive agreement for an initial business combination with Porch, a leading software and services platform for the home inspection and home service industries that provides ERP and CRM software to inspection, moving and adjacent home services companies, gaining access to a proprietary and reoccurring sales funnel which includes a majority of homebuyers in the U.S. annually. The transaction included a $150,000,000 fully committed common stock private investment at $10.00 per share led by Wellington Management Company, LLP. Since December 2020, Mr. Hennessy and Mr. Beck serve as Co-CEOs of PTIC and directors of VII. 
 Hennessy Capital Groups contacts and relationships are extensive across both the real estate and the property technology landscape, providing superior access to PropTech. Its network includes partners at venture capital, private equity funds, strategic PropTech investors and founders of real estate technology companies. We intend to leverage this network to gain exclusive access to and identify attractive target businesses in PropTech. 
 Since its founding, Hennessy Capital Group has developed proprietary SPAC execution expertise and built a network of top-tier third-party advisors and relationships to assist with target company origination, evaluation, due diligence, and merger execution. This network of advisors has supported Hennessy Capital Group in various roles for its various SPACs and is deeply integrated within Hennessy Capital Groups SPAC execution framework. 
 We believe Hennessy Capital Groups proven SPAC track record supports our investment thesis and strategy, and that potential sellers of target businesses will view our execution capabilities with a vehicle similar to our company as a positive factor in considering whether or not to enter into a business combination with us. 
 Business Combination Criteria 
 Our strategy is to identify and acquire later-stage real estate technology businesses, with a focus on high-growth fundamentals, whose pace of growth can benefit from our operational prowess, capital markets experience and global connectivity. We intend to leverage our sponsors extensive expertise and broad network of strategic LPs, portfolio companies, real estate relationships and reputation in the real estate and related technology sectors to identify investment opportunities with meaningful near term growth potential that can generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. 
 Consistent with this strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We will use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. 
 

 | Target Business Size. Businesses with an aggregate enterprise value of $500 million or greater, determined in the sole discretion of our management team.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | High Growth Global Operating Platform. Innovative, high growth, demand-driven businesses in the global real estate sector (e.g. warehouse, cold storage, distribution and / or logistics) with the ability to capitalize on demographic-fueled growth in emerging markets, and / or the rapid transition from conventional to e-commerce markets further accelerated with the onset of COVID-19.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Real Estate Technology. Businesses in the Tech sector or subsector, with particular emphasis on targets with the potential to disrupt the PropTech, construction technology, sharing economy, smart cities and energy spaces in a high-growth global geographical market through digital transformation and innovation seeking to replace established incumbents still relying on legacy technologies and business practices.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Target Secular Demographic Trends. Compelling businesses at the cusp of transforming rapidly growing consumption driven sectors, such as healthcare, education or data infrastructure in global emerging, developing or developed markets, benefiting from positive secular demographic and economic tailwinds.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
4 


 
 | Proven Unit Economics and Growing Companies. Established businesses with proven business models that we believe are poised for a period of high growth with capable management teams, attractive gross margins, strong unit economics and a demonstrated path to EBITDA profitability, but potentially in need of financial, operational, strategic or managerial support which our sponsors are uniquely positioned to deliver.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Leverage our sponsors Global Relationships, Experiences and Networks. Close to our proximal co-invest networks of founders, operators, investors, and advisors.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Benefit From Being a Public Company. Management, founders and shareholders with a desire to go public, to unlock growth capital for organic and / or merger and acquisition driven growth.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Focused Investment Criteria. We do not intend to invest in start-up companies, companies with speculative business plans, or companies that are excessively leveraged.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general criteria and guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our shareholder communications related to our initial business combination, which, as discussed in this Annual Report, would be in the form of proxy solicitation or tender offer materials that we would file with the SEC. 
 Acquisition Process 
 In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a disciplined due diligence review of issues that we deem important to validating our investment thesis and assessing a companys business quality and value creation opportunities, allowing our management team to price returns relative to potential risks appropriately. This review may encompass, among other things, review of financial information and key documents of the target business, research related to the target companys industry, markets, products, services and competitors, meetings with incumbent management and employees, on-site visits and a review of other information which will be made available to us. Our approach to the acquisition process will be centered on utilizing the existing networks and knowledge bases of Jaguar and Hennessy Capital Group, relying on outside resources where appropriate. In addition, we will seek to leverage our management teams operational and capital allocation expertise to target high-quality, scalable businesses with significant proof of concept where we see multiple opportunities for continued organic and strategic growth. 
 We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or an independent accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. 
 Jaguar, Hennessy Capital Group and members of our management team may directly or indirectly own founder shares and/or private placement warrants and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. In particular, because the founder shares were purchased at a purchase price of approximately $0.004 per share, the holders of our founder shares (including certain of our directors and officers that directly or indirectly own founder shares) could make a substantial profit after our initial business combination even if our public shareholders lose money on their investment as a result of a decrease in the post-business combination value of their Class A ordinary shares (after accounting for any adjustments in connection with an exchange or other transaction contemplated by the business combination). Further, each of our partners, employees, officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such partners, employees, officers and directors will be included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination. 
 
5 


 Jaguar, Hennessy Capital Group and our management team are continuously made aware of potential business opportunities, one or more of which we may desire to pursue for a business combination, but we have not (nor has anyone on our behalf) contacted any prospective target business or had any discussions, formal or otherwise, with respect to a business combination transaction with us. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association waives the corporate opportunities doctrine in effect by providing that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law: (i) no individual serving as a director or an officer shall have any duty, except and to the extent expressly assumed by contract, to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us; and (ii) we renounce any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for any director or officer, on the one hand, and us, on the other unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the company and it is an opportunity that we are able to complete on a reasonable basis. See the section in this report entitled Item 1A. Risk FactorsRisks Relating To Our Sponsor And Management TeamOur Officers And Directors Presently Have, And Any Of Them In The Future May Have, Additional Fiduciary, Contractual Or Other Obligations To Other Entities, Including Another Blank Check Company, And, Accordingly, May Have Conflicts Of Interest In Determining To Which Entity A Particular Business Opportunity Should Be Presented. Additionally, we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, taken any measure, directly or indirectly, to identify or locate any suitable acquisition candidate for the company, nor have we engaged or retained any agent or other representative to identify or locate any such acquisition candidate. 
 We may enter into one or more forward purchase agreements, including potentially with affiliates of Jaguar and Hennessy Capital Group, to provide for financing of our initial business combination. 
 Corporate Information 
 We are a Cayman Islands exempted company. Exempted companies are Cayman Islands companies conducting business mainly outside the Cayman Islands and, as such, are exempted from complying with certain provisions of the Companies Act. As an exempted company, we have applied for and received a tax exemption undertaking from the Cayman Islands government that, in accordance with Section 6 of the Tax Concessions Act (As Revised) of the Cayman Islands, for a period of 20 years from the date of the undertaking, no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations will apply to us or our operations and, in addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations or which is in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax will be payable (i) on or in respect of our shares, debentures or other obligations or (ii) by way of the withholding in whole or in part of a payment of dividend or other distribution of income or capital by us to our shareholders or a payment of principal or interest or other sums due under a debenture or other obligation of us. 
 We are an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. 
 In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 
 We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of the Initial Public Offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to emerging growth company have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act. 
 Additionally, we are a smaller reporting company as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements, and, if their revenues are less than $100 million, not providing an independent registered public accounting firm attestation on internal control over financial reporting. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30.

 Financial Position 
 With funds available for a business combination initially in the amount of $226,550,000, after payment of the estimated expenses of the Initial Public Offering and $8,050,000 of deferred underwriting fees and full spend of the working capital held outside the trust account, we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to complete our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third-party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us. 
Effecting our Initial Business Combination 
 We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the placement of the private placement warrants, the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection with our initial business combination (pursuant to any forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements we may enter into), shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing or other sources. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses. 
 If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemptions of our Class A ordinary shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-business combination company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital. 
 We may need to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination, either because the transaction requires more cash than is available from the proceeds held in our trust account, or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of the business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. There are no prohibitions on our ability to issue securities or incur debt in connection with our initial business combination. We are not currently a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities, the incurrence of debt or otherwise. 
 Sources of Target Businesses
We anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various affiliated and unaffiliated sources, including, investment market participants, private equity groups, investment banking firms, consultants, accounting firms and large business enterprises. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since some of these sources will have read our registration statement and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors and Jaguar and Hennessy Capital Group, as well as their affiliates and other affiliated sources may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition, we expect to receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the business relationships of our officers and directors. While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, we may engage these firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finders fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arms length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will engage a finder only to the extent our management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of finders fees is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the trust account. In no event, however, will our sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or their respective affiliates be paid by us any finders fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). We have agreed to pay our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space, secretarial and administrative services, research and other services provided to us and to reimburse our sponsor for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating and completing an initial business combination. Some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the post-business combination company following our initial business combination. The presence or absence of any such fees or arrangements will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an acquisition candidate.

 We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor or any of our officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that such initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context. 
 Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have, additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities, including other entities that are affiliates of our sponsor, pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, subject to their fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law. 
 Evaluation of a Target Business And Structuring of our Initial Business Combination
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct an extensive due diligence review which may encompass, as applicable and among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities and a review of financial and other information about the target and its industry. We will also utilize our management teams operational, transactional, and capital planning experience. If we determine to move forward with a particular target, we will proceed to structure and negotiate the terms of the business combination transaction. 
 The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. The company will not pay any consulting fees to members of our management team, or their respective affiliates, for services rendered to or in connection with our initial business combination. In addition, we have agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination without the prior consent of our sponsor. 
 Lack of Business Diversification
For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination; and cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services. 
 Limited Ability to Evaluate the Targets Management Team
Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with that business, our assessment of the target businesss management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. The determination as to whether any of the members of our management team will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our initial business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our initial business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business. 
 We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. 
 
8 


 Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management. 
 Shareholders may not Have the Ability to Approve our Initial Business Combination
We may conduct redemptions without a shareholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC subject to the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. However, we will seek shareholder approval if it is required by applicable law or stock exchange rule, or we may decide to seek shareholder approval for business or other reasons. 
 Under Nasdaqs listing rules, shareholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example: 
 

 | we issue Class A ordinary shares that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of Class A ordinary shares then outstanding (other than in a public offering);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | any of our directors, officers or substantial security holders (as defined by Nasdaq rules) has a 5% or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10% or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of ordinary shares could result in an increase in issued and outstanding ordinary shares or voting power of 5% or more; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the issuance or potential issuance of ordinary shares will result in our undergoing a change of control.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Companies Law and Cayman Islands law do not currently require, and we are not aware of any other applicable law that will require, shareholder approval of our initial business combination. 
 The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination in those instances in which shareholder approval is not required by law will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on business and legal reasons, which include a variety of factors, including, but not limited to: 
 

 | the timing of the transaction, including in the event we determine shareholder approval would require additional time and there is either not enough time to seek shareholder approval or doing so would place the company at a disadvantage in the transaction or result in other additional burdens on the company;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the expected cost of holding a shareholder vote;
--+-------------------------------------------------


 | the risk that the shareholders would fail to approve the proposed business combination;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | other time and budget constraints of the company; and
--+------------------------------------------------------


 | additional legal complexities of a proposed business combination that would be time-consuming and burdensome to present to shareholders.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Permitted Purchases And Other Transactions With Respect To Our Securities 
 If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase public shares, rights or warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. Additionally, at any time at or prior to our initial business combination, subject to applicable securities laws (including with respect to material nonpublic information), our sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may enter into transactions with investors and others to provide them with incentives to acquire public shares, vote their public shares in favor of our initial business combination or not redeem their public shares. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. 
 None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase public shares, rights or warrants in such transactions. 
 
9 


 If they engage in such transactions, they will be restricted from making any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. 
 In the event that our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights or submitted a proxy to vote against our initial business combination, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares and any proxy to vote against our initial business combination. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will be required to comply with such rules. 
 The purpose of any such transaction could be to (i) vote in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination, (ii) reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination, (iii) reduce the number of rights outstanding or vote such rights on any matters submitted to the rights holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination or (iv) satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. 
 In addition, if such purchases are made, the public float of our securities may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange. 
 Our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors and/or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the shareholders with whom our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated transactions by either the shareholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by shareholders (in the case of Class A ordinary shares) following our mailing of tender offer or proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates enter into a private transaction, they would identify and contact only potential selling or redeeming shareholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against our initial business combination, whether or not such shareholder has already submitted a proxy with respect to our initial business combination but only if such shares have not already been voted at the general meeting related to our initial business combination. Our sponsor, executive officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates will select which shareholders to purchase shares from based on the negotiated price and number of shares and any other factors that they may deem relevant, and will be restricted from purchasing shares if such purchases do not comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws. 
 Our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors and/or their affiliates will be restricted from making purchases of shares if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. We expect any such purchases would be reported by such person pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements. 
 Redemption Rights for Public Shareholders upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination 
 We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, if any, divided by the number of then-outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be $10.20 per public share. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. The redemption rights will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our initial business combination with respect to our rights or warrants. Further, we will not proceed with redeeming our public shares, even if a public shareholder has properly elected to redeem its shares, if a business combination does not close. Our sponsor and each member of our management team have entered into an agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and public shares held by them in connection with (i) the completion of our initial business combination and (ii) a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within the completion window or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares. 
 
10 


 Limitations on Redemptions
Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we do not then become subject to the SECs penny stock rules). However, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all Class A ordinary shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceeds the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all Class A ordinary shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof. 
 Manner of Conducting Redemptions
We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a general meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek shareholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement or whether we were deemed to be a foreign private issuer (which would require a tender offer rather than seeking shareholder approval under SEC rules). Asset acquisitions and share purchases would not typically require shareholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares or seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association would typically require shareholder approval. We currently intend to conduct redemptions in connection with a shareholder vote unless shareholder approval is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement or we choose to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC for business or other reasons. So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on the Nasdaq, we will be required to comply with the Nasdaq rules. 
 If we hold a shareholder vote to approve our initial business combination, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association: 
 

 | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------

 In the event that we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination. 
 If we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if we obtain the approval of an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which in respect of our company, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares represented in person or by proxy and voted at a general meeting of the company. A quorum for such meeting will be present if holders of one-third of the issued and outstanding shares entitled to vote at the meeting are represented in person or by proxy. In such case, our sponsor and each member of our management team have agreed to vote their founder shares and public shares in favor of our initial business combination. As a result, in addition to our initial purchasers founder shares, we would need 7,666,668, or 33.3% (assuming all issued and outstanding shares are voted), or none (assuming only the minimum number of shares representing a quorum are voted), of the 23,000,000 public shares outstanding to be voted in favor of an initial business combination in order to have our initial business combination approved. Each public shareholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or vote at all. In addition, our sponsor and each member of our management team have entered into an agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and public shares held by them in connection with (i) the completion of a business combination and (ii) a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within the completion window or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares. 
 
11 


 If we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association: 
 

 | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Upon the public announcement of our initial business combination, if we elect to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, we and our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase Class A ordinary shares in the open market, in order to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act. 
 In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public shareholders not tendering more than the number of public shares we are permitted to redeem. If public shareholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete such initial business combination. 
 Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination If We Seek Shareholder Approval
If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering, which we refer to as Excess Shares, without our prior consent. We believe this restriction will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holders shares are not purchased by us, our sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. 
 Tendering Share Certificates in Connection with a Tender Offer or the Exercise of Redemption Rights
Public shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in street name, will be required to either tender their certificates (if any) to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, mailed to such holders, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Companys Deposit/ Withdrawal At Custodian (DWAC) System, at the holders option, in each case up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote to approve the business combination. The proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate the applicable delivery requirements, which will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Accordingly, a public shareholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short period in which to exercise redemption rights, it is advisable for shareholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares. 
 
12 


 There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a fee of approximately $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. 
 In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the shareholders vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such shareholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the shareholder then had an option window after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the companys shares in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which shareholders were aware they needed to commit before the general meeting, would become option rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming shareholders election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved. 
 Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the business combination, unless otherwise agreed to by us. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination. 
 If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares. 
 If our initial proposed business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a business combination with a different target until the expiration of the completion window. 
 Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if no Initial Business Combination
Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that we will have only the completion window to consummate our initial business combination. If we have not completed our initial business combination within the completion window, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, if any (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the number of the then-outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our rights or warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the completion window. 
Competition 
 In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies, operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.

 We currently have three executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination.
