ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Business Overview
 
Algae Dynamics Corp (ADYNF) is focused on the development of proprietary research and products utilizing cannabis oil and algae oil. The original core of our product development strategy is the extraction of Omega-3 fatty acids from certain strains of algae with high concentrations of DHA to create various nutraceutical products. As a result of the many demonstrated health benefits of other botanical oils, most notably cannabis oil, we have developed a strategy aimed at developing products that combined the health benefits of algae and cannabis oils. Capitalizing on the burgeoning demand for cannabis oil and other smoke-free alternatives to marijuana consumption will help support ongoing initiatives to create and market research-driven product formulations.
 
Collaborating with prominent Canadian universities is a core part of our plan to bolster cannabis extraction expertise, develop premium products and add to our portfolio of intellectual property. Through our agreements with the University of Waterloo and the University of Western Ontario, the Company is focusing primarily on the use of extracts from cannabis oil and algae oil in the context of cancer as well as the development of new pharmacotherapies for mental health.
 Near-term goals include expanding research and development work with existing and new Canadian universities, securing supply/service agreements with licensed producers, and submitting an application to Health Canada to become a licensed producer of medical marijuana and ultimately have a license to sell products derived from cannabinoids. The Company also owns a proprietary technology for the cultivation of low cost, highly pure algae biomass, which will be developed as a vertical integration strategy in the future to support the need to source algae oil for research-driven product formulations. The management team leading these initiatives has relevant experience ranging from public company management and process experience to successful fund raising and commercialization.
 The Company has also formed a strong team of scientific and strategic advisors that complement ongoing R&D relationships and initiatives. With this strong foundation, we are positioned to execute on our plan to build a revenue-generating, sustainable opportunity in a rapidly expanding market.
 Sponsored Research Programs
 
In order to support our new mission, we engaged two prominent Canadian universities to provide research and product development in the use of extracts from cannabis oil and algae oil in the context of cancer, and the development of novel pharmacotherapies for mental health, as follows:

1. | Dr. Jonathan Blay, PhD, FRSB, FIBMS, Csci, CBiol (Professor of Pharmacy, University of Waterloo, Professor of Pathology, Dalhousie University), the University of Waterloo – to perform research and product development on cannabis oil and its constituents in the context of the development and treatment of the colorectum, pancreas, breast and prostate cancers. 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Dr. Steven Laviolette, BSc, PhD (Addiction Research Group, Dept. of Anatomy & Cell Biology, Dept. of Psychiatry, Canadian Institute for Military and Veterans Health Research), University of Western Ontario - to perform research and product development on cannabis oil and its constituents in the context of depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and schizophrenia.

Each research program is a sponsored research program in which the Company pays an agreed amount to each university and in return receives the benefits of the research and the right to acquire the associated intellectual property, based on an agreed fixed payment with no ongoing royalties. The sponsored programs run for three years at the University of Waterloo, at a cost of C$600,000 over the three-year life, and for four years at University of Western Ontario, at a cost of C$1,000,000 over the life of the program.
 
Collaboration and Supply Agreement
 
We have entered into a letter of intent with 6779264 Manitoba Ltd dba Bonify (“Bonify”) that will provide the Company with several important benefits. We and Bonify have agreed to work together in good faith to finalize definitive documents by September 30, 2017. Bonify currently holds a Cultivation License pursuant to the Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations (“ACMPR”) in Canada with the capability to grow multiple strains of cannabis in its state of the art 320,000 square foot facility. In the letter of intent, we and Bonify agree as follows:

1. | The Company will purchase cannabis oil extraction equipment for installation at Bonify’s facility; 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Bonify will supply raw cannabis material and will extract cannabis oil from the raw material; 
3. | Upon receiving its Sales License, Bonify will ship cannabis oil to our research universities and to our end customers; 
4. | The Company may also purchase raw material from other Licensed Producers for processing by Bonify; and 
5. | The Company and Bonify will split revenues and operating costs equally after Bonify deducts the market value of cannabis material that it supplies. 



We believe that this relationship is the fastest and surest path to revenues and profits for the Company. The term of the agreement is for 3 years from commencement of operations and may be extended by mutual agreement. Should the agreement not be extended we agree to transfer title to the equipment to Bonify. Bonify is currently in the process of obtaining its Sales License to sell cannabis-related products such as cannabis oil. The key benefits of the agreement to the Company are 1) the ability to supply cannabis oil to The University of Waterloo and University of Western Ontario for research purposes, and 2) the potential for a pathway to revenues much faster than if we simply applied for our own licenses. Our current target for commencement of operations is the second quarter after completion of necessary financing.
 
Licensing under ACPMR
 
While we believe that our agreement with Bonify, when fully operational, provides us with a pathway to revenues in the near-term, we also intend to apply for our own licenses – both a Cultivation License and a Sales License.
 
The Cultivation License allows the holder to:
 

possess, produce, provide, ship, deliver, transport and destroy dried cannabis or cannabis oil; 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
possess, produce, and destroy cannabis in its natural form, other than marijuana or cannabis oil, for the purpose of producing cannabis oil; and 
possess and destroy cannabis, other than marijuana or cannabis oil, for the purpose of conducting in vitro testing that is necessary to determine the cannabinoid content of marijuana or cannabis oil.

-


The Sales License allows the holder to sell dried marijuana and cannabis oil to:
 

a client of the Company or an individual who is responsible for the client; 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
a hospital employee, if the purpose is in connection with their employment; 
another Licensed Producer; 
a Licensed Dealer; 
the Minister of Health; and 
a person to whom an exemption relating to the substance has been granted under section 56 of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA). 



We have included a full description of the cannabis-related licensing process at the end of this Business Description section for further information and disclosure.
 
We do not require similar special licensing with respect to the extraction of Omega-3 oils from algae biomass and related sales.
 
Capital Requirement
 
In order to execute on our strategy as described above, we estimate an initial capital requirement of US$1.6 million to support activities over the following twelve months, including the following:

1. | Payment to the universities to support the sponsored research programs; 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Application to Health Canada for licensing under the ACPMR; 
3. | Purchase and installation of oil extraction equipment at Bonify’s facility; and 
4. | Working capital to support ongoing operations. 

 
We have engaged investment bankers to assist with raising the required capital.
 
Legal and Business Context
 
The Company’s business of the development of unique health products and pharmaceuticals that utilize hemp and cannabis oils is rigorously regulated.

Legal access to medicinal cannabis or medical marihuana has been a gradual and regulated process in Canada, which started as early as 1999 with the granting of exemptions under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (Canada). Following successful court actions in which patients reliant on medical marihuana won legal recognition of their rights to access marihuana as a medicine, the Federal Government implemented the Marihuana Medical Access Regulations (MMAR) in 2001. The MMAR created an initial regime for individuals with a prescription from their health care practitioner in the required form, to possess and use medical marihuana which they grew themselves, or which they purchased from designated producers or a Health Canada supplier.
 
In general, this regime of supply was restrictive, and faced continuing court challenges from users, eventually leading to the implementation of the Marihuana for Medical Purposes Regulations (MMPR) in June 2013, providing for an expansion of supply based on a regulated private industry of licensed producers of medical marihuana.
 
Over time, court challenges were also mounted to the restrictions in the MMPR, which initially restricted the products made available by Licensed Producers to only dried marihuana. In 2015, the Supreme Court of Canada held that the restriction making only dried medicinal marihuana available to patients was unconstitutional. In response, the Federal Government broadened the scope of available licenses for Licensed Producers to include the production and sale of cannabis oils as well as fresh marihuana leaves and buds.
 
The current ACMPR provides a more advanced and rigorous regulatory regime for the production, distribution and sale of medical marihuana in Canada, and regulates and contemplates the sale of medical marihuana by Licensed Producers to jurisdictions outside of Canada where the use and sale of medical marihuana and derivatives thereof are legally sanctioned.
 
Liberalizing Regulatory Environment and Competitive Conditions
 
The ACMPR, like prior regulations, requires patients seeking medical marihuana to obtain medical approval from their health care practitioner and to provide a medical document to a Licensed Producer. However, the ACMPR provisions have simplified the requirements of the MMPR, offering easier access to medical marihuana in Canada.
 
According to Health Canada, more than 98,000 patients had enrolled with Licensed Producers under the ACMPR regime by September 30, 2016. Health Canada also indicates that, as of September 30, 2016, the average amount of dried marihuana for medical purposes authorized per client was 2.6 grams per day. For further information, see the Health Canada website at:
 
http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhpmps/marihuana/info/market-marche-eng.php.
 
Further information has recently been released by Canada’s Parliamentary Budget Officer (the “PBO”) in its November 1, 2016 report, which estimates that, in 2018, an estimated 4.6 million individuals aged 15 and over will use cannabis at least once, representing 655 metric tons of cannabis. This number could rise to 5.2 million individuals by 2021, representing 734 metric tons of cannabis. The PBO stated that the pre-tax price of legal cannabis is projected to be between $6.67 and $8.33 per gram, with a mid-point estimate of $7.50. For further information, see “Legalized Cannabis: Fiscal Considerations”, authored by the Office of the PBO and dated November 1, 2016.
 
Recent Developments
 
The Task Force on Cannabis Legalization and Regulation (the “Task Force”) appointed by the Federal Government recently released its report entitled “A Framework for the Legalization and Regulation of Cannabis”, dated November 30, 2016 (the “Report”). The Task Force makes a number of recommendations in the Report that are relevant to the market for recreational marihuana and, in particular, recommends that the legislation and regulations ultimately put in place by the Federal Government, among other things, do the following:

● | set a national minimum age of purchase of 18; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | apply comprehensive restrictions to the advertising and promotion of cannabis and related merchandise; 
● | allow limited promotion in areas accessible by adults, similar to those restrictions under the Tobacco Act (Canada); 
● | require plain packaging for cannabis products that only display the producer company name, strain name, price, amounts of THC and cannabidiol (CBD), and warnings and other labelling requirements; 
● | impose strict sanctions on false or misleading promotion as well as promotion that encourages excessive consumption, where promotion is allowed; 
● | impose requirements to protect children; 
● | impose a price and tax scheme based on potency to discourage purchase of high-potency products; 
● | prohibit mixed products, for example cannabis-infused alcoholic beverages or cannabis products with tobacco, nicotine or caffeine; and 
● | allow for personal cultivation for non-medicinal purposes of up to four plants per residence subject to additional local and safety requirements.

Of particular importance, the Task Force recommended that the Federal Government:
 

● | continue to regulate the production of cannabis and its derivatives, drawing on the current medicinal marihuana production regime; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | use licensing and production controls to encourage a competitive market; and 
● | implement a tracking system to prevent diversion and to allow for product recalls.

Markets
 
We believe that our focus on development of product formulations that utilize both cannabis oil and algae is a niche strategy that will give us a unique market position. While we believe that this strategy is a natural extension of existing, rapidly growing markets, there is limited data available to measure the market opportunity. With that in mind, what follows is a discussion about the cannabis oil market and the algae oil market.
Market for Cannabis Oil
 
The Canadian oil extraction marketplace is forecast to grow from C$1 million in 2015 to C$1.7 billion in 2020, assuming full legalization in 2018. In terms of conversion from dried marijuana to extracts/oil, due diligence has been conducted on the Colorado market, finding that 45% of dried marijuana users would eventually convert to marijuana extracts/oil. The Company assumes the market would gradually reach an approximate 45% conversion rate by 2018. Source: Mackie Research Capital Corporation, April 8, 2016 – MRCC Estimates
 
CIBC World Markets issued a report in January 2016 that provided some early estimates of the size of the Canadian recreational marihuana market (to be legalized by July 1, 2018). Using the legalized markets in the States of Colorado and Washington as a comparison, it estimated the Canadian recreational marihuana market is in the broad range of $5 billion to $10 billion per year. This compares with estimated annual Canadian liquor sales of between $5 billion and 8.7 billion according to Deloittes. Canaccord Genuity estimates that the number of marihuana users in the first year following the legalization of marihuana will be approximately 4,000,000. Even as an early estimate, this indicates a recreational market size in the order of 4 to 8 times the size of the medical marihuana market in Canada. (please, see the link for complete report)

Market for Algae Oil
 
The market data for algae oil presented below is brief since our plan is to utilize algae oil in our products largely to the extent that it complements our products that contain cannabis oil. Whereas until recently, our intention was to commercialize our BioSilo® algae cultivation system for the purpose of selling bulk algae oil, as well as algae biomass, to global markets, our current intention is to utilize the BioSilo system to the extent required to support our internal needs for cannabis/algae oil blends. Any algae oil that is surplus to our mission would be made available to other markets.

EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) are long-chain omega-3 fatty acids. Studies have shown that EPA and DHA are important for proper fetal development, including neuronal, retinal, and immune function. EPA and DHA may affect many aspects of cardiovascular function including inflammation, peripheral artery disease, major coronary events, and anticoagulation. EPA and DHA have been linked to promising results in prevention, weight management, and cognitive function in those with very mild Alzheimer’s disease. Source: Advances in Nutrition -An International Review Journal January 2012.
 
(DHA) Algae oil prices currently trade in the range of $60 to $90 per kilogram today depending on DHA concentration and country of origin, however, algae oil typically sells for $70 to $75 per kilogram. (source: F & S May 24th. 2016).
 
The opportunity in the global algae market stood at US$608.0 million in 2015 and is projected to be worth US$1.1 billion by 2024, growing at an annual rate of 7.39% therein. By volume, the market is poised to expand at a 5.32% CAGR between 2016 and 2024. Source: Transparency Market Research (TMR) Sept 20, 2016
 
Algae Used Extensively for DHA Production in Healthcare and F&B Sectors
 
Based on application, DHA production takes the lead in the global algae market and is expected to retain its lead throughout the forecast period. Algal biomass is most extensively used in the production of DHA, which is used in the healthcare, pharmaceutical, and food and beverages sectors. Within this segment, the pharmaceutical application sub-segment held a larger share of just under 28% in 2016, which is expected to decline over the coming years to make room for the protein sales sub-segment.
 
Sales and Distribution
 
We intend to develop marketing channels including but not limited to website promotion, medical doctors, product distributors, as appropriate and in compliance with the regulatory requirements.
 
Initially, we intend to sell our product formulations mainly through Bonify, our collaboration and raw material supply partner. When we have received our Sales License from Health Canada, we expect to broaden our sales and distribution channels to include patients, medical doctors, and product distributors.
 
The Company intends to build brand awareness by working with brand/marketing management professionals, specializing in the medical health market, to have packaged products available for sale to customers.
 
Marketing Strategies and Competition
 
Advertising and marketing of medical marihuana in Canada is regulated by the Food and Drugs Act (Canada) and the Narcotic Control Regulations issued under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (Canada). Licensed Producers are strictly prohibited from advertising marihuana products or promoting their use.
 
Our marketing activities will be focused on the promotion of the Company and increasing its visibility within the marketplace. Those efforts will include working with numerous client education centers (patient aggregators), which will review the available research data provided by the universities on medical cannabis oils and products available to clients. We believe this scientific data will help clients make educated decisions.
 
We believe we will have significant advantages in the market that will include multiple strain selection and consistently-produced cannabis oil products backed by scientific research that supports the improved effectiveness of each treatment.
 
We are actively preparing to respond to increased market demand that is expected to occur following the coming into force of proposed legislation to legalize and regulate recreational marihuana. We intend to participate fully in the legalized recreational marihuana marketplace, subject to compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.
 
According to Health Canada, there are currently 45 Licensed Producers in total and of these, just over 30 hold Sales Licenses. For further information, see the Health Canada website at: http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/marihuana/info/list-eng.php
 
Cannabinoids and Omega-3
 
Cannabis by itself has long been used for medical purposes and in recent decades has gained significant traction in becoming a common and preferred treatment for specific ailments. Cannabis is one of the fastest growing industries in North America. The Company’s new strategic initiative will seek product development and formulation opportunities that combine the benefits of algae and cannabis oils.

-


The Company’s core product development strategy has been the production of high volume specific algae species and extraction of Essential Fatty Acids (EFAs) which is the foundation of the endocannabinoid system (ECS). The ECS is a group of endogenous cannabinoid receptors located in the mammalian brain and throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems, consisting of neuromodulatory lipids and their receptors. The extracted algae Omega 3 oil with high concentrations of DHA is used as a health supplement product. In light of the potential synergies, the Company has developed its strategy which is aimed at developing new products and formulations that combine the health benefits of algae and cannabis oils.
 
Health Benefits of Algae Omega-3 and Cannabis
 
The following are some of the health benefits of algae and cannabis that the Company intends to research further to potentially combine into synergistic products:
 

Algae Omega-3 | Cannabis 
------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------
Detoxes heavy metals and toxins | Reduces stress and anxiety 
Supports immune system | Reduces glaucoma and prevents macular degeneration

Research/Expertise:
 
Dr. Laviolette’s research interests explore the interface between neurobiology, psychology and emotion by using an integrative combination of in vivo neuronal electrophysiology and behavioral neuropharmacology. At the general level, Dr. Laviolette is interested in exploring the neurobiological mechanisms that control how the brain processes emotionally salient information and how disturbances in these basic neural processes may lead to disorders such as addiction and schizophrenia.
Dr. Laviolette’s investigations into the neurobiology of addiction have focused on nicotine and opiates, both of which represent highly addictive substances and act on pathways in the brain that control reward, motivation and learning. Dr. Laviolette’s research group has characterized and identified specific regions in the mammalian brain that control the ‘switch’ from the non-addicted state, to the addicted state following exposure to drugs of abuse. Their ongoing research seeks to precisely define and identify the neurobiological mechanisms that control the addiction process at the behavioral, molecular and single neuron levels of analysis.
In addition, Dr. Laviolette’s research group is interested in exploring the neuronal mechanisms of emotional associative learning both in single neurons and in specific brain circuits. They have focused on the roles of the endocannabinoid system and specific dopamine receptor populations in the processing of emotionally salient information. Their ongoing research seeks to examine how disturbances in these brain receptor substrates may underlie the distorted sensory processing and emotional associative learning observed in individuals with schizophrenia.

Currently Associate Professor at the University of Waterloo and Associate Director of the Canadian Phycology Culture Centre (CPCC), which is housed within her laboratory at the University of Waterloo (500 species). She has authored over 25 papers in leading phycology journals and has received many national and international research awards. Dr. Muller won The Luigi Provasoli Award in recognition of authoring the outstanding paper published in the Journal of Phycology (Phycological Society of America) during 2011.
Dr. Brendan McConkey (PhD) – Oil Analysis
 
Over 7 years’ research experience as Associate Professor at the University of Waterloo. His areas of expertise include proteomics, biochemistry, toxicology, and computational biology. Research emphasis has been on interdisciplinary approaches that combine biology, chemical engineering, and computational research.
 
BioSilo®
 
Algae Dynamics has engineered a proprietary algae production technology, the Algae Dynamics BioSilo®, which maximizes growth and purity, while minimizing its footprint through a modular design. It allows us to cultivate a wide variety of algae species tailored to the nutrient and purity requirements of our prospective customers. BioSilo® is a novel method of cultivating algae that combines the positive features of open pond systems with those of enclosed photobioreactor algae production systems. The system produces a continuous supply of ultra-pure algae biomass in high volumes. The design’s small footprint and scalability results in very low maintenance cost. The BioSilo ® is capable of producing a variety of species, including Chlorella and algae suited for Omega-3 rich Algae oil.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our intellectual property currently pertains to the legacy business plan of commercialization of our BioSilo algae cultivation system. The development of BioSilo is commercially relevant in the context of our missions of developing unique products that contain cannabis and algae oils.


The following is our approach to intellectual property protection historically. Firstly, a United States Patent (US 8,800,202 B2) Bioreactor was issued August 12, 2014, a second US patent (US 14/334,909) has been filed and a Patent Application (CA 2,735,635) on the same claims as the U.S. patent has been filed for Canada.
 
The patent abstract is: “Biomass production apparatus is disclosed and comprises a stack of trays, each tray, in use, being in receipt of a respective layer of liquid, the layers being spaced apart from one another such that each layer has associated therewith a respective headspace. Light sources are provided for each layer and are disposed in the headspace associated with said each layer, to illuminate, at least in part, said each layer”.

Secondly, significant know-how and proprietary in-house knowledge were acquired during development at the University of Waterloo, with the result that the engineering component of intellectual property related to the BioSilo® is a significant part of the “secret sauce”. As well, the Company has identified proprietary algae species isolated by phycology (the study of algae) scientists at the University of Waterloo, Drs. K. Muller and B. McConkey. Algae Dynamics has exclusive access to these species. These species which are not genetically modified have been selected for their high nutrient values.


History of Algae Dynamics
 
During 2008 and 2009, we developed the BioSilo® design. In 2010, we partnered with phycology experts Dr. Muller and Dr. McConkey at the University of Waterloo. This partnership provided us with exclusive access to proprietary algae species along with phycology expertise. Through this arrangement, we operated our laboratory and advanced from bench scale algae experiments to operating a one meter BioSilo® installation. We successfully completed the R&D validating key data points allowing the Company to deploy its technology at commercial scale, producing algae biomass of the highest quality at significantly reduced costs. We received funding in part from Ontario Power Authority “OPA” for the design and construction of the one meter BioSilo® system.
 
The following summarizes sources of funding to date:
 

 | Amount ($) | 
----------------------------------------------------------------+----------------+----------
Ontario Power Authority (Grant) | $ | 250,000 
Scientific Research and Experimental Development Tax Credit | | 72,400 
Common stock issued and fully paid at March 31, 2017 | | 4,313,931
Additional paid in capital | | 1,000,214
Total | $ | 5,636,545



On the basis of technology, open ponds cultivation technology held the dominant share in the algae market, while the closed photo bioreactors segment is projected to witness strong growth by 2024, in terms of both demand and sales. Geographically, Asia Pacific will emerge as one of the most attractive segments, registering a value-based CAGR of 8.0% during the forecast period. In terms of percentage share, North America dominates the algae market and is expected to generate US$344.49 million by 2024. Source: Transparency Market Research (TMR) Sept 20, 2016

According to a new report published by Coherent Market Insights. Omega 3 ingredients are naturally-occurring polyunsaturated fatty acids and nutrients that are essential for human health. There are three types of omega 3 ingredients, namely alpha-linoleic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).
 
Increasing cardiovascular disease and growing demand for supplements, especially in North America and Europe is surging demand for DHA and EPA. Consumers are increasingly inclined towards food rich in omega 3 fatty and also supplements containing the acid, due to increasing awareness about the various health benefits associated with the same. Cold water fish are the primary source of omega 3 fatty acids and have various health benefits such effective treatment of hypertriglyceridemia and other cardiovascular diseases. This in turn creates a highly conducive environment for growth of the global omega-3 market.
 
https://www.coherentmarketinsights.com/insight/request-sample/370
 
Average life expectancy worldwide during 2010–2013, was pegged at 71.0 years. Increasing life expectancy, in turn increases incidence of lifestyle and age-related diseases and conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, and cholesterol. Consumers across the world are looking to follow healthy lifestyles to ensure optimum calorie intake and nutrition to keep diseases at bay. This change in consumer lifestyle is characterized by increasing demand for omega 3 ingredients.
 
The U.S. and Japan are the largest markets for omega 3 ingredients. This is mainly attributed to high discretionary income and relatively high health awareness among the populace in these countries. China, India and Brazil are emerging economies that offer major potential for the omega 3 ingredients market. Germany and Israel have emerged as the key innovation hubs of the omega 3 ingredients industry. In Germany, the industry is driven by the joint venture of Royal DSM and Evonik in March 8, 2017, for omega 3 fatty acid products from natural marine algae for animal nutrition. This innovation will enable the production of omega 3 fatty acids for animal nutrition without using fish oil. Also, in May 6, 2014, AstraZeneca got approval of Epanova (omega 3 carboxylic acid), from U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) which is used to lower the triglyceride level with severe hypertriglyceridemia.

The Company has entered into a five year operating lease, expiring November 2018, for Unit 37-4120 Ridgeway Drive in Mississauga, Ontario, which consists of 2,224 square feet of office and production facilities. The current space is adequate for the purpose of constructing an initial production system. The monthly base rental of the current facility is $1,362 plus the Company’s estimated portion of property taxes and operating expenses which are currently $810 per month.
Regulatory Risks
 
Algae Dynamics will be subject to various US, federal, provincial, and local environmental laws and regulations including the health and safety of employees, and manufacturing practices. In addition, some of these laws and regulations require contemplated facilities to operate under permits that are subject to renewal or modification. A violation of these laws and regulations or permit conditions can result in substantial fines, natural resource damages, criminal sanctions, permit revocations and/or facility shutdowns.
 
The Company does not intend to conduct any cannabis related business in the United States due to the uncertain regulatory environment. However, it may distribute its algae produced products to the United States nutraceutical market.


United States
 
The processing, formulation, safety, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, and distribution of food supplement products are subject to regulation by one or more federal agencies, including the FDA, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), the Consumer Product Safety Commission (“CPSC”), the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”), and the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), and by various agencies of the states and localities in which the products are sold. The area of business that these and other authorities regulate include, among others:

● | claims and advertising; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | labels; 
● | ingredients; and 
● | manufacturing, distributing, importing, selling and storing of products. 

 
In particular, the FDA regulates the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, storage, labeling, promotion, importation, and distribution and sale of dietary supplements and food ingredients in the United States, while the FTC regulates marketing and advertising claims.
 
Some of our potential products may be packaged and sold directly to retailers and consumers, and therefore are subject to greater oversight and enforcement action by the FTC. In recent years, the FTC has instituted numerous enforcement actions against consumer packaged goods companies for failure to have adequate substantiation for claims made in advertising or for use of false or misleading advertising claims.

The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (“DSHEA”), an amendment to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDC Act”), established a framework governing the composition safety, labeling, manufacturing and marketing of dietary supplements. Generally, under DSHEA, dietary ingredients that were marketed in the United States prior to October 15, 1994 may be used in dietary supplements without notifying the FDA. “New” dietary ingredients (i.e., dietary ingredients that were “not marketed in the United States before October 15, 1994”) must be the subject of a new dietary ingredient notification submitted to the FDA unless the ingredient has been “present in the food supply as an article used for food” without being “chemically altered”. A new dietary ingredient notification must provide the FDA evidence of a “history of use or other evidence of safety” establishing that use of the dietary ingredient “will reasonably be expected to be safe”. A new dietary ingredient notification must be submitted to the FDA at least 75 days before the initial marketing of the new dietary ingredient. The FDA may determine that a new dietary ingredient notification does not provide an adequate basis to conclude that a dietary ingredient is reasonably expected to be safe. Such a determination could prevent the marketing of such dietary ingredient.
 
The FDA has issued a draft guidance governing notification of new dietary ingredients. While it is not mandatory to comply with FDA guidance, it is a strong indication of the FDA’s current views on the topic of the guidance, including the agency’s position on enforcement. Depending on the recommendations made in the guidance, if and when it is finalized, particularly those relating to animal or human testing, such guidance could make it more difficult for Algae Dynamics to successfully provide notification of new dietary ingredients. Moreover, such guidance could change the status of ingredients that the industry has viewed as “old” dietary ingredients to “new” dietary ingredients that may require submission of a new dietary ingredient notification.
 
The FDA or other agencies could take actions against products or product ingredients that in its determination present an unreasonable health risk to consumers which would make it illegal for us to sell such products. In addition, the FDA could issue consumer warnings with respect to the products or ingredients that Algae Dynamics sells. Such information could be based on information received through reporting of serious adverse events mandated by the FDC Act.
 
DSHEA permits “structure/function claims” to be included in labeling for dietary supplements without FDA pre-market approval. Such statements must be submitted to the FDA within 30 days of marketing. Such statements may describe how a particular dietary ingredient affects the structure, function, or general well-being of the body, or the mechanism of action by which a dietary ingredient may affect body structure, function, or well- being, but may not expressly or implicitly represent that a dietary supplement will diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent a disease. A company that uses a structure/function claim in labeling must possess scientific evidence substantiating that the statement is truthful and not misleading. If the FDA determines that a particular structure/function claim is an unacceptable drug claim or an unauthorized version of a “health claim”, or, if the FDA determines that a particular claim is not adequately supported by existing scientific data or is false or misleading, we would be prevented from using the claim.

In addition, DSHEA provides that so-called “third-party literature”, e.g., a reprint of a peer-reviewed scientific publication linking a particular dietary ingredient with health benefits, may be used “in connection with the sale of a dietary supplement to consumers” without the literature being subject to regulation as labeling. The literature: (1) must not be false or misleading; (2) may not “promote” a particular manufacturer or brand of dietary supplement; (3) must present a balanced view of the available scientific information on the subject matter; (4) if displayed in an establishment, must be physically separate from the dietary supplements; and (5) should not have appended to it any information by sticker or any other method. If the literature fails to satisfy each of these requirements, the Company may be prevented from disseminating such literature in connection with Algae Dynamics products, and any dissemination could subject our products to regulatory action as an illegal drug.
 
In June 2007, pursuant to the authority granted to the FDA by DSHEA, the FDA published detailed Current Good Manufacturing Practice (“GMP”) regulations that govern the manufacturing, packaging, labeling and holding operations of dietary supplement manufacturers. The GMP regulations, among other things, impose significant recordkeeping requirements on manufacturers. The GMP requirements are in effect for all manufacturers, and the FDA is conducting inspections of dietary supplement manufacturers pursuant to these requirements. There remains considerable uncertainty with respect to the FDA’s interpretation of the regulations and their actual implementation in manufacturing facilities. In addition, the FDA’s interpretation of the regulations will likely change over time as the agency becomes more familiar with the industry and the regulations. The failure of a manufacturing facility to comply with the GMP regulations renders products manufactured in such facility “adulterated,” and subjects such products and the manufacturer to a variety of potential FDA enforcement actions.
 
In addition, under the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (“FSMA”), which was enacted on January 4, 2011, the manufacturing of dietary ingredients contained in dietary supplements will be subject to similar or even more burdensome requirements, which will likely increase the costs of dietary ingredients and will subject suppliers of such ingredients to more rigorous inspections and enforcement. The FSMA will also require importers to take measures to ensure that the foods they import, including dietary supplements and dietary ingredients, meet domestic requirements. This could increase the cost of those articles, subject their importation to greater scrutiny, and potentially restrict their availability.
 
The FDA has broad authority to enforce the provisions of federal law applicable to dietary supplements, including powers to issue a public warning or notice of violation letter to a company, publicize information about illegal products, detain products intended for import, request a recall of illegal products from the market, and request the Department of Justice to initiate a seizure action, an injunction action, or a criminal prosecution in the U.S. courts. The FSMA expands the reach and regulatory powers of the FDA with respect to the production of food, including dietary supplements. The expanded reach and regulatory powers include the FDA’s ability to order mandatory recalls, administratively detain domestic products and administratively revoke manufacturing facility registrations, thereby effectively enjoining manufacturing of dietary ingredients and dietary supplements without judicial process. The regulation of dietary supplements may increase or become more restrictive in the future.

The FTC exercises jurisdiction over the advertising of dietary supplements. In recent years, the FTC has instituted numerous enforcement actions against dietary supplement companies for failure to have adequate substantiation for claims made in advertising or for the use of false or misleading advertising claims. Such actions could result in substantial financial penalties and significantly restrict the marketing of a dietary supplement.
 
Legislation or regulations may be introduced which, if passed, would impose substantial new regulatory requirements on the manufacture, packaging, labeling, advertising and distribution and sale of our products. In March 2009, the General Accounting Office (the “GAO”) issued a report that made four recommendations to enhance the FDA’s oversight of dietary supplements. The GAO recommended that the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services direct the Commissioner of the FDA to: (1) request authority to require dietary supplement companies to identify themselves as a dietary supplement company and update this information annually, provide a list of all dietary supplement products they sell and a copy of the labels and update this information annually, and report all adverse events related to dietary supplements; (2) issue guidance to clarify when an ingredient is considered a new dietary ingredient, the evidence needed to document the safety of new dietary ingredients, and appropriate methods for establishing ingredient identity; (3) provide guidance to industry to clarify when products should be marketed as either dietary supplements or conventional foods formulated with added dietary ingredients; and (4) coordinate with stakeholder groups involved in consumer outreach to identify additional mechanisms for educating consumers about the safety, efficacy, and labeling of dietary supplements, implement these mechanisms, and assess their effectiveness. These recommendations could lead to increased regulation by the FDA or future legislation concerning dietary supplements.
 
International
 
In Canada and foreign markets, prior to commencing operations and prior to making or permitting sales of our products in the market, we may be required to obtain an approval, license or certification from the relevant country’s ministry of health or comparable agency. Where a formal approval, license or certification is not required, we nonetheless seek a favorable opinion of counsel regarding our compliance with applicable laws. Prior to entering a new market in which a formal approval, license or certificate is required, we work extensively with local authorities in order to obtain the requisite approvals. The approval process generally requires us to present each product and product ingredient to appropriate regulators and, in some instances, arrange for testing of products by local technicians for ingredient analysis. The approvals may be conditioned on reformulation of our products, or may be unavailable with respect to some products or some ingredients. Product reformulation or the inability to introduce some products or ingredients into a particular market may have an adverse effect on sales. We must also comply with product labeling and packaging regulations that vary from country to country. Our failure to comply with these regulations can result in a product being removed from sale in a particular market, either temporarily or permanently.
 
The Company cannot determine what effect additional domestic or international governmental legislation, regulations, or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, would have on Company’s business in the future. New legislation or regulations may require the reformulation, elimination, or relabeling of certain products to meet new standards and revisions to certain sales and marketing materials, and it is possible that the costs of complying with these new regulatory requirements could be material.

The ACMPR Licensing Process
 
The market for cannabis (including Medical Marijuana) in Canada is regulated by the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA), the ACMPR, the Narcotic Control Regulations, and other applicable law. Health Canada is the primary regulator of the industry as a whole. The ACMPR aims to treat cannabis like any other narcotic used for medical purposes by creating conditions for a new commercial industry that is responsible for its production and distribution.
 
The table below provides a general overview of the licensing process as described by Health Canada:
 

 | Summary 
------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1 | Preliminary Screening: When Health Canada receives an application, preliminary screening is conducted to ensure that the application is complete. Any incomplete applications will be returned to the applicant, and complete applications are assigned an application numbers. The assignment of an application number indicates that the application has completed the preliminary screening stage. 
Step 2 | Enhanced Screening: After being assigned an application number, a more thorough review of the application is conducted to ensure that there is sufficient information to assess whether the requirement of the regulations are met. Specific elements given initial consideration include: the location of the proposed site; risks to public health, safety and security; the proposed security measures; and the credentials of the proposed quality assurance person to meet the good production requirements outlined in Subdivision D of the ACMPR. Health Canada will verify that the applicant has provided notice of the application to the senior official with the local government in the jurisdiction of the proposed site. The applicant is responsible for ensuring that they are in compliance with all applicable provincial, territorial, and municipal legislation, regulations, and bylaws, including zoning restrictions, fire and electrical safety requirements, and waste management requirements. At this step, Health Canada may request additional information that is relevant to the application. 
Step 3 | Security Clearance: Once the screening of an application is complete, the security clearance forms for key personnel will be sent for processing. At this point, the Minister for Health will conduct criminal record checks and will review the relevant background of key personnel to assess whether the applicant poses a risk to the integrity of the control of the production and distribution of cannabis under the CDSA. The amount of time required to conduct mandatory security checks varies with each application. 
Step 4 | Review: Once all security clearances are obtained, an application will be thoroughly reviewed to validate the information provided. Given the extensive review process, applicants are generally required to communicate with Health Canada multiple times to clarify elements of their application. Health Canada may also request additional information. A detailed review and assessment of physical security plans will be conducted at this stage. Applicants must meet a minimum of a level 7 (as defined in the Directive on Physical Security Requirements for Controlled Substances - Licensed Dealers Security Requirements for the Storage Of Controlled Substances) to be considered for a licence. It is a requirement that physical security comply with the Directive.

 | Once Health Canada is satisfied that an application is ready for a pre-licence inspection, they will contact the applicant and identify information that needs to be confirmed before a pre- licence inspection can be scheduled. This includes, but may not be limited to, confirming how the applicant has indicated in their application that they would comply with Part 1, Division 1, Subdivision C (Security Measures) of the ACMPR. 
------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 5 | Pre-Licence Inspection: When Health Canada is satisfied of the prior steps and when the applicant has confirmed that the site has been fully built and security measures are in place, a Pre-Licence Inspection will be scheduled. The inspection may cover, but is not limited to: Security Measures, Good Production Practices, Packaging, Labelling and Shipping, Registration, and Record Keeping. The purpose of the inspection is to verify that the information submitted to Health Canada is accurate and to assess compliance with the applicable sections of the ACMPR prior to licence approval. Any identified deficiencies will be communicated to the applicant and must be addressed prior to a licence being issued. 
Step 6 | Licensing: Next, the results of the Pre-Licence Inspection are reviewed along with all of the information submitted by the applicant and any other additional relevant information. If it is determined that the issuance of the licence is not likely to create risks to public health, safety or security, including the risk of cannabis being diverted to an illicit market or use, and there are no other grounds for refusing the application, a licence will be issued. Health Canada has introduced a graduated licensing process. Upon approval, applicants will first be issued a production licence. This will enable Health Canada inspectors to confirm that the first batch of marijuana produced meets the production standards and requirements outlined in the ACMPR. The Licensed Producer’s first crop of marijuana will be inspected to establish whether the marijuana meets the Licensed Producer's specified quality control standards and the Good Production Practices set out in Subdivision D of the ACMPR. Only once Health Canada is satisfied the Licensed Producer meets the requirements of the ACMPR will a licence be amended to allow sale to the public. 

 
ACMPR Licences
 
The Cultivation Licence, if received, will allow the Company to:
 

● | possess, produce, provide, ship, deliver, transport and destroy dried cannabis or cannabis oil 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | possess, produce, and destroy cannabis in its natural form, other than marijuana or cannabis oil, for the purpose of producing cannabis oil

that is necessary to determine the cannabinoid content of marijuana or cannabis oil. Last, the Cultivation Licence will allow the Company to ship dried marijuana or cannabis oil to a health care practitioner in the case referred to in subparagraph 130(1)(f)(iii) of the ACMPR.
 
The ACMPR also provide for licenses and import permits relating to fresh marijuana. The Licences, if received, will not include this permission until applied for separately and approved by Health Canada.
 
The ACMPR provides that cannabis in its natural form, other than marijuana or cannabis oil, for the purpose of producing cannabis oil, may be provided, shipped, delivered or transported if it was obtained or produced for that purpose.
 
Statutory Reporting Requirements
 
With respect to the management and administration of the Company, the ACMPR will require that:
 

(a) | In order to confirm any information submitted in support of an application for a licence or an amendment or renewal of a licence, an inspector may, at a time during normal business hours and with the reasonable assistance of the Company, inspect the site in respect of which the application was made. 
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) | If the Company experiences a theft of cannabis or an unusual waste or disappearance of cannabis that cannot be explained on the basis of normally accepted business activities, the Company must report the occurrence to a member of a police force within 24 hours after becoming aware of it and provide a written report to the Minister within 10 days after becoming aware of the occurrence.
