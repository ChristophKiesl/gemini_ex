ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview

Frontdoor is the leading provider of home service plans in the United States, as measured by revenue, and operates under the American Home Shield, HSA, OneGuard and Landmark brands. Our customizable home service plans help customers protect and maintain their homes, typically their most valuable asset, from costly and unplanned breakdowns of essential home systems and appliances. We maintain close and frequent contact with our customers as we handle over four million service requests annually utilizing our nationwide network of approximately 17,500 pre-qualified professional contractor firms in a wide range of trades and with diverse skills and capabilities. Our value proposition to our professional contractor network is equally compelling as we provide them access to our significant work volume, thus increasing their business activity while enhancing their ability to manage their financial and human capital resources. We realize significant economies of scale as a result of our volume of service requests, and we intend to leverage our enhanced customer- and contractor-centric technology platform, robust independent contractor network, existing customer base, purchasing volume for parts, appliances and home systems, and extensive history and deep understanding of the home services industry to generate sustained growth of our core home service plan business. We also plan to continue to leverage these unique attributes to expand our ProConnect on-demand home services business, which we launched in 2019, and to continuously develop and refine our advanced customer- and contractor-centric Streem technology platform to enhance the experience for our customers, our contractors and our partner real estate brokers and agents. Our Streem technology platform uses augmented reality, computer vision and machine learning to, among other things, help home service professionals more quickly and accurately diagnose breakdowns and complete repairs and is extensible to many industries to help them better serve their customers virtually.

At December 31, 2020, we had over two million active home service plans across all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Our home service plan customers subscribe to an annual service plan agreement that covers the repair or replacement of major components of more than 20 home systems and appliances, including electrical, plumbing, central HVAC systems, water heaters, refrigerators, dishwashers and ranges/ovens/cooktops, as well as optional coverages for electronics, pools, spas and pumps. Given the potentially high cost of a major appliance or home system breakdown, the cumbersome process of vetting and hiring a qualified repair professional and, typically, the lack of a formal guarantee for services performed, our customers place high value on the budget protection, peace of mind, convenience, repair expertise and service guarantee our home service plans deliver. As homes become increasingly complex and connected, and the needs of our customers continue to expand, we believe our ability to innovate through upgraded product offerings, differentiated service offerings and channel diversification will continue to drive customer growth and retention. The expansion of our home service plan offerings and the utilization of dynamic pricing algorithms, as well as our investments in our nascent Streem platform business and our ProConnect on-demand business, well position us to capture this growth.

Our multi-faceted value proposition resonates with a broad customer demographic, regardless of home price, income level, geographic location or age. We acquire our customers through our partner real estate brokers and directly by advertising and marketing through our direct-to-consumer (“DTC”) channel. As a result of our strong customer value proposition, 69 percent of our revenue in 2020 was recurring, in line with historical averages, driving consistency and predictability in our revenues. In addition, a significant majority of our home service plan customers automatically renew on an annual basis.

As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 17,500 pre-qualified professional contractor firms in our nationwide network in a wide range of trades and with diverse skills and capabilities. We are highly selective with onboarding new contractor firms into our service network and continuously monitor service quality through a set of rigorous performance measures, relying heavily on direct customer feedback. We classify a subset of our independent contractor network as “preferred,” representing firms that meet our highest quality standards and are often long-tenured providers with us. Approximately 82 percent of service requests were completed by our preferred contractor network in 2020, driving higher customer satisfaction and retention rates, as well as delivering lower costs. We intend to leverage our leading contractor base to expand into home improvement and maintenance services through both our home service plans and on-demand services.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated revenue, net income and Adjusted EBITDA of $1,474 million, $112 million and $270 million, respectively. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, see "Item 6. Selected Financial Data."



Our Opportunity 

Frontdoor operates within the $400 billion revenue U.S. home services industry, of which the U.S. home service plan category currently represents approximately $3 billion. We view increased penetration of the U.S. home service plan category as a long-term growth opportunity. This category is currently characterized by low household penetration with approximately five million of 127 million U.S. households (owner-occupied homes and rentals), or approximately four percent, covered by a home service plan. In addition, we believe that increasingly complex home systems and appliances, as well as consumer preference for budget protection and convenience, will emphasize the value proposition of pre-qualified professional repair services and, accordingly, the coverage benefits offered by a home service plan.

We also believe that we are well-positioned to capitalize on our leading position in the home service plan category to provide services to consumers in the broader home services industry. As consumer demand shifts toward more convenient, outsourced services, and as demand for homes continues to be fueled by low interest rates and families leaving urban centers in favor of more suburban areas, we believe we have an opportunity as a reliable, scaled service provider with a national, pre-qualified professional service provider network to expand further into on-demand services through our ProConnect offering. We expect ProConnect to leverage the quality, trust and brand awareness of American Home Shield to dramatically scale our on-demand offering, allowing us to maximize existing traffic and improve search result ratings for ProConnect. Many of the unique visitors to our website do not purchase a home service plan, and we believe ProConnect may capture some of those prospective customers who might still need home maintenance and repair services.

Our marketplace-based approach to home service delivery requires us to continue to grow our supply side, and we remain committed to attracting high-quality independent contractors to our network of professional service providers. As we continue to scale our contractor network, we in turn expand our breadth of potential services and enhance our ability to further execute our on-demand service delivery model.

Our Competitive Strengths

We believe the following competitive strengths have been instrumental to our success and position us for future growth:

Leader in Large, Fragmented and Growing Category. We are the leader in the U.S. home service plan category. Over the past five decades, we have developed a marketplace reputation built on the strength of our brands, our customer and contractor value proposition and our service quality. As a result, we enjoy industry-leading brand awareness and offer high-quality customer service, both of which are key drivers of the success of our customer acquisition and retention efforts. Our size and scale help facilitate contractor selection and purchasing volume for parts, appliances and home systems, as well as the ability to realize marketing and operating efficiencies.

High-Value Service Offerings. We provide our customers with a compelling value proposition by offering financial protection against unplanned and expensive home repairs, coupled with the convenience of having repairs completed by experienced professionals whose quality levels are continuously monitored and guaranteed by us. In contrast with insurance products that have low frequency of use, we pay claims on behalf of our home service plan customers more than once per year, on average. We believe this high level of engagement reinforces our customer value proposition and leads to improved retention rates. We believe our customer retention rate is further evidence of the value our customers place on our service and the quality of execution that we provide.

Technology-Enabled Platform Drives Efficiency and Quality of Service. We are focused on constantly improving the customer and contractor experience. We continuously develop and refine our advanced customer- and contractor-centric technology platform to enhance the experience for our customers, our contractors and our partner real estate brokers and agents. Our platform allows customers to purchase and utilize a home service plan, electronically chat with a representative, pay bills and track the progress of their service requests, all from their smartphone or other device. Our contractors use this platform to interact with us and to more efficiently and effectively serve our customers, and real estate brokers utilize our platform to facilitate the purchase of home service plans.

Our technological capabilities are enhanced by our Streem technology platform, which uses augmented reality, computer vision and machine learning to help home service professionals more quickly and accurately diagnose breakdowns and complete repairs. In addition, Streem enables homeowners to use their smartphone cameras to instantly connect with a service professional who can remotely see the item that needs attention and capture a variety of important details about the item, potentially helping to reduce the time required for completing repairs and even eliminating the need for a technician to visit the home by offering a simple do-it-yourself solution. For real estate professionals, an agent can connect remotely with a home seller, lead a virtual tour and guide the owner to areas that need closer inspection, all while allowing the creation of high-definition digital assets that future buyers can view remotely without ever entering the home. In 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we provided this technology to our strategic real estate brokerage partners free of charge to enable them to safely serve their customers, which we expect will deepen these relationships and increase long-term growth in our real estate channel.



We believe our technology-enabled platform provides a foundation for operational and customer service excellence, ultimately driving customer and contractor retention and growth.

Multi-Channel Sales and Marketing Approach Supported by Sophisticated Customer Analytics. Our multi-channel sales and marketing approach is designed to understand our customers’ key decision points during the purchase of home services to generate revenue and build brand value.

In the real estate channel, we leverage marketing and information service arrangements and a team of field-based sales associates and leaders to train, educate and market our plans through real estate brokers and agents at both a local and national level. We have strategic relationships with each of the top ten real estate brokers in the United States, and we view these strategic relationships as a valuable aspect of our sales model.

In the DTC channel, lead generation has benefited from increased and more efficient marketing spending as well as improved digital marketing. We increasingly utilize sophisticated consumer analytics and testing models that allow us to more effectively segment our prospective customers and deliver tailored marketing campaigns. In addition, we have deployed more sophisticated marketing tools to attract customers, including content marketing, online reputation management and social media channels. The efficacy of our marketing efforts is demonstrated by our ability to cost-effectively generate quality leads and online sales.

Diverse, Recurring and Stable Revenue Streams. We acquire new customers through two channels, real estate and DTC, and we have sales in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. We believe our ability to acquire customers through the DTC channel helps to mitigate the effect of potential cyclicality in the home resale market and our nationwide presence limits the impact of poor economic conditions or adverse weather conditions in any particular geography. We also benefit from predictable and recurring revenue as our customers typically sign annual contracts and 69 percent of our revenue was generated through existing customer renewals in 2020, in line with historical averages. Additionally, approximately 72 percent of our customers are on a monthly auto-pay program. Auto-pay customers historically have been more likely to renew than non-auto-pay customers. Our business model continues to prove resilient through various business cycles as evidenced by our eight percent annual revenue growth from 2019 to 2020, during which time the COVID-19 pandemic had an adverse impact on U.S. existing home sales during the second quarter of 2020 and on the broader economy throughout 2020. In comparison, our annual revenue growth during the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 and 2009 was four percent and two percent, respectively.

Capital-Light Business Model. Our business model generates strong Adjusted EBITDA margins and favorable working capital and requires limited capital expenditures. As such, we have a capital-light business model that drives potential for strong cash flow generation. We may, from time to time, make more significant investments in capability-expanding technology, including continued investments in our technology-enabled platform to drive efficiency and quality of service. Net cash provided from operating activities was $207 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $200 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and $189 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Free Cash Flow was $175 million, $178 million and $163 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. For a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow to net cash provided from operating activities, see “Item 6. Selected Financial Data.”

Experienced Management Team. We have a management team of highly experienced leaders who have strong track records in a wide variety of industries and economic conditions. Our management team is highly focused on execution and driving growth and profitability, and, as such, our compensation structure is tied to key performance metrics that are designed to incentivize senior management to drive the long-term success of our business. Our chief executive officer brings direct experience from industry-leading companies like Lyft and Amazon. He is well versed in scaling large businesses, leveraging technology to innovate and grow and building on-demand marketplaces. Our chief financial officer has over 20 years as a finance executive and eight years with our core business, bringing deep industry insights, continuity and financial acumen. Since the Spin-off, we have continued to build a senior management team composed of individuals with significant expertise and experience building and scaling technology-enabled businesses. Our senior leaders also possess significant experience in consumer discretionary businesses and industry insights, which we believe will help drive growth and innovation across our organization. We believe our management team has the vision and experience to position us for continued success and to implement and execute our business strategies over the long term.

Our Business Strategies

We intend to profitably grow our business by:

Increasing Our Home Service Plan Penetration. We intend to further increase our home service plan penetration by making strategic investments to educate consumers on our compelling value proposition, targeting homeowners more effectively, further improving the customer experience and attracting new real estate brokers and contractors. In addition, we see an opportunity to expand our repair services to property managers who currently use our services through individual home service plans by helping them aggregate such plans and better manage their utilization of our services. Further, we believe our ProConnect business provides us more opportunities to introduce customers to our overall home service plan value proposition.



Delivering Superior Customer Experience. We will continue to improve the customer experience by investing in our integrated technology platform, self-service capabilities, business intelligence platforms, customer care center operations and contractor management systems. These targeted investments are expected to result in an enhanced customer experience by providing a more convenient service and improving contractor efficiencies and engagement. We believe these initiatives will lead to improved retention rates, cost-savings, more grassroots marketing and the opportunity to deliver additional services to satisfied customers.

Growing Our Supply Network of Independent Contractors. We will continue to grow our high-quality network of pre-qualified professional contractor firms in a wide range of trades and with diverse skills and capabilities. Our contractor relations team utilizes a highly selective process to choose new contractor firms and continuously monitors their service quality. We believe growing our contractor base within existing service locations and in new geographies, while maintaining service excellence, will drive further penetration of our home service plans and ProConnect business and differentiate our product offering relative to competitors.

Continuing Digital Innovation. We are continuing to invest in digital innovation to further increase the ease-of-use of our technology platform for customers, contractors and realtors. In recent years, we have developed a robust customer technology platform, which makes it easy for customers to purchase from us, request service and manage their account from the convenience of a smartphone or other device. Our contractor technology platform makes it easier for contractors to work with us and improves communication between contractors and our customers. Our realtor technology platform makes it easier for realtors to work with us and, therefore, recommend our products to their clients. As we continue to make investments in digital innovation, these enhanced digital platforms will be the foundation of both our home service plan business and our new ProConnect on-demand business.

In addition, our advanced customer- and contractor-centric Streem technology platform enhances the experience for our customers, our contractors and our partner real estate brokers and agents. Our Streem technology platform uses augmented reality, computer vision and machine learning to, among other things, help home service professionals more quickly and accurately diagnose breakdowns and complete repairs. Streem’s interactive digital features enable home service professionals to more efficiently interact with customers and complete repairs and to help real estate professionals consult with and provide virtual tours to potential buyers and agents. Streem also provides software development kits that allow our partners to customize the platform’s functionality for their specific needs. We plan to leverage Streem’s capabilities to improve upfront diagnostics of home repairs, which we believe will drive an increase in the number of jobs completed in the first visit. We also believe the use of Streem will reduce the time required to complete the repair or provide a replacement for our customers, limit contractor and prospective buyer face-to-face interaction in the COVID-19 environment and reduce carbon emissions related to contractor and prospective buyer home visits. We further believe Streem has the potential to become a significant new revenue channel for us and is extensible to many industries to help them better serve their customers virtually.

Leveraging Dynamic Pricing. We have implemented dynamic pricing into our renewal and DTC channels, which allows us to leverage our proprietary data platform to adjust our plan prices based on factors such as the strength of our contractor network or characteristics of homes in a market. As of December 31, 2020, we are now able to use dynamic pricing to update prices for the majority of our renewal and DTC customers. We expect to utilize these capabilities to offer more attractive pricing overall, enabling us to expand our potential customer base to those previously priced out of the market due to the industry's historical practice of state-level pricing. We will continue to test and expand our dynamic pricing capabilities in 2021 and beyond.

Providing Customers Access to Our High-Quality, Pre-Qualified Network of Contractors for On-Demand Home Services. In 2019, we expanded our business through the launch of our on-demand home services business, recently rebranded as ProConnect. As part of its membership, ProConnect offers access to home systems repair and diagnostic services from highly-rated service professionals. ProConnect offers convenient scheduling, upfront pricing on select services and a “ProConnect Low Price Guarantee.” For consumers, ProConnect allows them to easily obtain the help they need from pre-qualified professionals. Consumers simply go online and select the service they need, then choose a two-hour window for the work to be done. Same-day and next-day appointments are also available. ProConnect offers simplicity, transparency and peace of mind to consumers with its upfront pricing, online scheduling, ongoing support, trusted professionals and 30-day guarantee. For contractors, ProConnect provides actual revenue opportunities (not just leads), as well as access to our scheduling services. We believe that our on-demand services offering will strengthen our core home service plan business by highlighting the value proposition of our services and the convenience of our vast pre-qualified service provider network to new customers.

We intend to continue to leverage our existing sales channels and service platform to deliver additional value-added services to our ProConnect customers by expanding beyond repair services to offer home maintenance and improvement services. Our product development teams draw upon the experience of our home service plan business to both create innovative customer solutions for the existing product suite and identify service and category adjacencies. For example, we offer existing customers pre-season central HVAC checkups, and, in the real estate channel, a lock re-keying service for recent home buyers with a home service plan. We also offer add-on warranties, covering items such as home electronics, which we believe add value to our plans and result in improved retention rates. We believe these new service offerings will lead to higher customer engagement, ultimately leading to stronger customer loyalty.



We see a significant opportunity to leverage our existing contractor base to expand home repair and maintenance services through ProConnect, which we believe will increase our customer satisfaction and contractor value proposition and provide us with additional revenue opportunities. By offering on-demand services, we can provide additional services to our existing home service plan customers and reach new customers, including those not currently interested in home service plans. We are evolving with our customers’ ever-changing preferences, including demand for new services and how those services are solicited and procured.

Developing a World-Class Data Platform. We believe we have the opportunity to become the authoritative source of home service information. Since the founding of our core home service plan business in 1971, we have amassed a significant amount of aggregate data on historic maintenance trends, recall and repair history, and parts and labor pricing for most home repairs. We are constantly analyzing and using this aggregated data to make better business decisions and improve visibility on future costs. We also intend to identify additional opportunities to use technology to capture valuable home data, making it easier for customers and contractors to interact and ultimately enable us to anticipate repair needs. We intend for this aggregated data platform to be the definitive source of information for the home that enables both customers and contractors to make informed decisions. We believe these investments will both improve the customer experience and reduce our operating expenses. We also believe this aggregated data platform will provide additional revenue opportunities as real estate companies, manufacturers and other companies recognize the benefit of this aggregated data.

Pursuing Selective Acquisitions. We anticipate that the highly fragmented nature of the home service plan category will continue to create strategic opportunities for acquisitions. In particular, we intend to focus strategically on underserved regions where we can enhance and expand service capabilities. Historically, we have used acquisitions to cost-effectively grow our customer base in high-growth geographies, and we intend to continue to do so. We may also explore opportunities to make strategic acquisitions that will expand our service offering in the broader home services industry. We have also used acquisitions to enhance our technological capabilities. In 2019, we acquired Streem to support the service experience for our customers, reduce costs and create potential new revenue opportunities across a variety of channels. We expect to use Streem’s services in our core home service plan business and in ProConnect’s on-demand business to deliver a superior service experience and reduce our costs. In 2020, we acquired a business to expand our ProConnect on-demand offering via their intellectual capital and know-how, technology platform capabilities and geographic presence.

Sales and Marketing

We market our services to homeowners on a national and local level through various means, including marketing partnerships, search engine marketing, content marketing, social media, direct mail, television and radio, print advertisements and telemarketing. We partner with various participants in the residential real estate marketplace, such as real estate brokers and insurance carriers, to market and sell our home service plans. In addition, we sell through our customer care centers, mobile-optimized e-commerce platform and national sales teams. We utilize the following customer acquisition channels:

Real estate channel. Our plans have historically been used to provide peace of mind to home buyers by protecting them from large, unanticipated out-of-pocket expenses related to the breakdown of major home systems and appliances during the first year after an existing home purchase. We leverage marketing and information service arrangements and a team of field-based sales associates and leaders who focus on defined geographic areas to train and educate real estate brokers and agents within their territory about the benefits of a home service plan by working directly with real estate offices and participating in broker meetings and national sales events. Those brokers and agents then market our home service plans to home buyers.

 In 2020, we estimate approximately 1.4 million homes were sold with a home service plan out of the approximately 5.6 million homes sold. In 2020, customers in our real estate channel renewed at 27 percent after the first contract year. Revenue from this channel, including associated renewals, was $636 million, $610 million and $578 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 

Direct-to-consumer channel. Leveraging our experience in the real estate channel, we have previously invested significant resources to develop the DTC channel to broaden our reach beyond home resale transactions. Our value proposition resonates with a wide demographic of homeowners who find security in a plan protecting against expensive and unplanned breakdowns in the home. This strong value proposition is promoted to our potential customers through search engine marketing, content marketing, social media, direct mail, television and radio, print advertisements and telemarketing, and sold through our customer care centers and mobile-optimized e-commerce platform. Over the past decade, we have strategically invested to expand the DTC channel given its high customer retention rates and customer lifetime value. Our research indicates a relatively low home service plan penetration rate of four percent of U.S. households. We believe that penetration rates will increase over time as consumers become more aware of, and educated about, the value of home service plans.

In 2020, we estimate approximately four million of the 121 million U.S. households (excluding home resales) had a home service plan. In 2020, customers in our DTC channel renewed at 76 percent after the first contract year. Revenue from this channel, including associated renewals, was $822 million, $746 million and $674 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

 


Customer renewals. We generated 69 percent of our revenue through existing customer renewals for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 68 and 66 percent for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our customer retention rate has grown from 73 percent in 2010 to 76 percent in 2020. We have made significant investments in our integrated technology platform, self-service capabilities, business intelligence platforms, customer care center operations and contractor management systems, which we believe position us to further improve our customer retention rate.

Customers, Contractors, Suppliers and Geographies

Customers. As our customers are predominantly owners of single-family residences, we do not have significant customer concentration. We had 2.2 million, 2.2 million and 2.1 million customers as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 

Contractors. We have a network of approximately 17,500 high-quality, pre-qualified professional contractor firms in a wide range of trades and with diverse skills and capabilities that employ an estimated 62,000 technicians. The qualification process for a contractor includes assessing their online presence and customer reviews, gathering public information about the company, reviewing references from customers and other contractors, and confirming they meet insurance and licensing standards. In addition, contractors must agree to our service requirements, such as timely appointments and follow-ups with all customers, guaranteed workmanship, professionalism and availability. Our contractors are supported by a designated contractor relations representative who guides them through the process of working with us, from on-boarding to the first service call and to continuous monitoring and training. No contractor accounted for more than five percent of our cost of services rendered in 2020. Our contractor surveys indicate that approximately 95 percent of our contractor base plans to maintain or expand their relationship with us over the next two years.

Suppliers. We are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for various key components used in the services and products we offer to customers, and the cost, quality and availability of these components are essential to our services. Direct supplier spend, which excludes purchases made by our contractors, made up approximately 20 percent of our cost of services rendered in 2020, and we have multiple national supplier agreements in place. We have six national suppliers of parts, appliances and home systems that each account for more than five percent of our supplier spend. In 2020, we experienced an elevated level of appliance service requests as customers spent more time at home in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to industry-wide availability challenges for appliances and appliance parts as demand has outpaced production. As a result, we have deepened and expanded our supplier relationships, improved access to the fastest moving appliances, increased speed of parts acquisition and expanded our service provider network.

Geographies. A significant percentage of our revenue is concentrated in the western and southern regions of the United States, including Arizona, California, Florida and Texas.

Technology

We are continuing to invest in digital innovation to further increase the ease-of-use of our technology platform for customers, contractors and realtors.

Customers. In recent years, we have developed a robust customer technology platform, which makes it easy for customers to purchase from us, request service and manage their account from the convenience of a smartphone or other device. Approximately 40 percent of our DTC sales in 2020 were entered online, and more than 50 percent of our total service request volume was entered online or through our interactive voice response system. Our customer MyAccount platform had over one million active users at the end of 2020, allowing customers to pay bills, request service, review account information or chat with a representative online without having to call our customer care centers. Our Streem technology platform enables homeowners to use their smartphone cameras to instantly connect with a service professional who can remotely see the item that needs attention and capture a variety of important details about the item, potentially helping to reduce the time required for completing repairs and even eliminating the need for a technician to visit the home by offering a simple do-it-yourself solution.

Contractors. Our contractor technology platform makes it easier for contractors to work with us and improves communication between contractors and our customers. Our contractor portal had over 8,000 active users at the end of 2020, and our platform sent nearly 1.5 million “On-My-Way” notifications to customers, letting them know their contractor was en route to their home.

Realtors. Our realtor technology platform makes it easier for realtors to work with us and, therefore, recommend our products to their clients. Approximately 65 percent of real estate channel orders were placed online in 2020. Our realtor portal had over 100,000 active users at the end of 2020, allowing realtors to: enter, edit and pay for orders; view or print order confirmations, invoices and contracts for active customers; request service on behalf of their clients; and view and manage expiring orders. Our Streem technology enables an agent to connect remotely with a home seller, lead a virtual tour and guide the owner to areas that need closer inspection, all while allowing the creation of high-definition digital assets that future buyers can view remotely without ever entering the home.

 


Competition

We compete in the U.S. home service plan category and the broader U.S. home services industry. The home service plan category is highly competitive. The principal methods of competition, and by which we differentiate ourselves from our competitors, are quality and speed of service, contract offerings, brand awareness and reputation, customer satisfaction, pricing and promotions, contractor network and referrals. While we have a broad range of competitors in each locality and region, we are the only home service plan company providing home service plans in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. We believe our network of approximately 17,500 pre-qualified professional contractor firms, in combination with our large base of contracted customers, differentiate us from other platforms in the home services industry.
Human Capital Management

As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 2,190 employees, none of whom is represented by a labor union. Approximately 2,140 employees were employed in the United States, and approximately 50 employees were employed in foreign countries, primarily in India where they provided technology services for our business. We believe our overall relations with our workforce are good.

Health and Safety. We maintain a safety culture grounded on the premise of eliminating workplace incidents, risks and hazards. During 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we fully transitioned all of our customer care center agents to work remotely from their homes, ensuring uninterrupted customer service. All other employees, including those at our Memphis corporate headquarters, Denver and India engineering and technology campuses, and our offices in Seattle and Portland, are also working remotely.

Inclusion and Diversity. We embrace the diversity of our employees, contractors, customers and other stakeholders. Everyone is valued and appreciated for their distinct contributions to the growth and sustainability of our business. We strive to cultivate a culture and vision that supports and enhances our ability to recruit, develop and retain diverse talent at every level, and in 2020, we appointed our first senior director of diversity and inclusion.

Employee Benefits and Talent Development. In 2020, we engaged in a comprehensive review of our employee benefits and vacation programs and updated several programs to: improve our health care coverage; assist our employees with balancing family and personal priorities with work and planning for retirement; and support diversity across our employee population. We have sponsored development programs and implemented a broadly available executive coaching program to support development for our diverse employee population. We also regularly monitor employee satisfaction through formal processes and informal surveys and conversations.

Seasonality

The demand for our services, and our results of operations, are affected by weather conditions and seasonality. Such seasonality causes our results of operations to vary considerably from quarter to quarter. Accordingly, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year. Extreme temperatures, typically in the winter and summer months, can lead to an increase in service requests related to home systems, particularly central HVAC systems, resulting in higher claim frequency and costs and lower profitability, while mild temperatures in the winter or summer months can lead to lower home systems claim frequency. For example, seasonally mild temperatures were a factor throughout 2019, leading to a decrease in contract claims costs. In addition, favorable weather trends positively impacted contract claims costs in 2020. In 2020, additional variations were experienced as the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an elevated level of service requests, primarily in the appliance and plumbing trades, as our customers spent more time at home. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors and Trends Affecting Our Results of Operations—Seasonality” in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Intellectual Property

We hold various service marks, trademarks and trade names, such as Frontdoor, American Home Shield, HSA, OneGuard, Landmark Home Warranty, ProConnect and Streem, that we deem particularly important to our advertising and marketing activities. We develop the substantial majority of our product and service offerings internally and have extended our product and service offerings and intellectual property through acquisitions of businesses and technologies. We also license intellectual property rights in certain circumstances. We have a number of U.S. patents and U.S. and foreign pending applications that relate to various aspects of our Streem technology. While we believe that our patents have value, no single patent is essential to us or to any of our principal businesses. Rapid technological advances in cloud, software and hardware development, evolving standards in computer hardware and software technology, changing customer needs and frequent new product introductions, offerings and enhancements characterize the markets in which we compete. We plan to continue to dedicate resources to research and development efforts to maintain and improve our current products and services offerings.

Insurance

We maintain insurance coverage that we believe is appropriate for our business, including workers’ compensation, auto liability, general liability, umbrella, cybersecurity and property insurance. In addition, we provide insurance for our home service plan claims in Texas via our wholly-owned captive insurance company, which is domiciled in Houston, Texas.
Regulatory Compliance

We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations, compliance with which increases our operating costs, limits or restricts the services we provide or the methods by which we may offer, sell and fulfill those services or conduct our business, or subjects us to the possibility of regulatory actions or proceedings. Noncompliance with these laws and regulations can subject us to fines, loss of licenses or registrations or various forms of civil or criminal prosecution, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

These federal, state and local laws and regulations include laws relating to consumer protection, deceptive trade practices, home service plans, real estate settlement, wage and hour requirements, state contractor laws, the employment of immigrants, labor relations, licensing, building code requirements, workers’ safety, environmental, privacy and data protection, securities, insurance coverages, sales tax collection and remittance, healthcare reforms, employee benefits, marketing (including, without limitation, telemarketing) and advertising. In addition, we are regulated in certain states by the applicable state insurance regulatory authority and by other regulatory bodies, such as the Virginia Department of Agriculture.

We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations designed to protect consumers, including laws governing consumer privacy and fraud, the collection and use of consumer data, telemarketing and other forms of solicitation. The telemarketing rules adopted by the Federal Communications Commission pursuant to the Federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act and the Federal Telemarketing Sales Rule issued by the Federal Trade Commission govern our telephone sales practices. In addition, some states and local governing bodies have adopted laws and regulations targeted at direct telephone sales, i.e., “do-not-call” regulations. The implementation of these marketing regulations requires us to rely more extensively on other marketing methods and channels. In addition, if we were to fail to comply with any applicable law or regulation, we could be subject to substantial fines or damages, be involved in lawsuits, enforcement actions and other claims by third parties or governmental authorities, suffer losses to our reputation and our business or suffer the loss of licenses or registrations or incur penalties that may affect how the business is operated, any of which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
