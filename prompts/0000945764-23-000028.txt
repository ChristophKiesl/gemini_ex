Item 1. Business and Properties
GENERAL
Denbury Inc., a Delaware corporation, is an independent energy company with operations focused in the Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States.  Our corporate headquarters is located at 5851 Legacy Circle, Plano, Texas 75024, and our phone number is 972-673-2000. The Company is differentiated by its focus on CO2 EOR and the emerging CCUS industry, supported by the Company’s CO2 EOR technical and operational expertise and its extensive CO2 pipeline infrastructure. The utilization of captured industrial-sourced CO2 in EOR significantly reduces the carbon footprint of the oil that Denbury produces, making the Company’s Scope 1 and 2 CO2e emissions negative today, with a goal to reach Net Zero for our Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 CO2e emissions within this decade, primarily through increasing the amount of captured industrial-sourced CO2 used in its operations. Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Form 10-K”) we use the terms “Denbury,” “Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” to refer to Denbury Inc. and, as the context may require, its subsidiaries.
Our CO2 EOR oil recovery operations result in the associated underground storage of CO2. This means that Denbury’s activities are supporting and advancing the national energy transition today through the increasing use of industrially sourced CO2 in EOR operations, as well as building out a dedicated CCUS platform for long-term carbon management for third parties at scale.
As part of our corporate strategy, we are committed to creating long-term value for our shareholders through the following key principles:
•leveraging our extensive CO2 pipeline assets and CO2 EOR expertise to expand our operations and leadership position in the emerging CCUS industry;
•seeking to expand the use of industrial-sourced CO2 in our tertiary recovery operations, with an ultimate objective of producing oil with a negative carbon footprint;
•increasing the value of our assets by applying our technical expertise in CO2 tertiary recovery, together with a combination of other exploration, development, exploitation and marketing skills and practices; 
•managing a disciplined capital allocation process to maximize the rates of return on our investments and organically fund growth while balancing with the return of capital to shareholders when generating free cash; and
•operating a growing, profitable and sustainable company that is dedicated to bettering our employees, our environment and our communities. 
As further described in Note 1, Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - 2020 Emergence from Voluntary Reorganization Under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, Denbury Inc. became the successor reporting company (the “Successor”) of Denbury Resources Inc. (the “Predecessor”) upon the Predecessor’s emergence from bankruptcy on September 18, 2020. As part of the plan of reorganization, upon emergence from bankruptcy, all of the Predecessor’s previously authorized and/or issued common stock or stock equivalents were cancelled, and new common stock was issued to the Predecessor’s debt holders and equity holders upon cancellation of approximately $2.1 billion principal amount of debt and all of the Predecessor’s equity instruments. On September 21, 2020, the Successor’s new common stock commenced trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol DEN, as distinguished from, Denbury Resources Inc.’s common stock having been publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange since 1997.

under Regulation FD. The information disclosed on our website under “Investor Relations” should be reviewed by investors and other members of the public in order to fully understand our financial and operating results.
BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND 2022 DEVELOPMENTS
Since our production is 97% oil, oil prices generally constitute the single largest variable in our operating results. Since 2020, oil prices have increased, largely due to increased demand since the height of the COVID-19 coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic in 2020 and 2021, plus the effect on energy markets and prices since the Russian attacks on Ukraine, with NYMEX WTI oil prices averaging approximately $94 per barrel in 2022, $68 per barrel in 2021, and $39 per barrel in 2020. The Company’s financial results improved from 2021 to 2022 due to higher oil prices, although the positive oil price impact was offset in part by the commodity hedges we were obligated to put in place through mid-2022 under the one-time requirement of our bank credit facility shortly after we emerged from bankruptcy in September 2020. Our financial results in 2022 were further impacted by inflationary pressures, primarily increasing our power costs, service costs and labor costs, caused in part by worldwide and U.S. supply chain issues. During 2022, we utilized our cash flow to primarily fund our oil and gas development and to secure CO2 storage capacity for future CCUS activities, and with the excess cash flow resulting from higher oil prices, we returned capital to shareholders through a share repurchase program.
The following include some of our key 2022 business developments:
•Continued development of our Cedar Creek Anticline (“CCA”) EOR project in Montana and North Dakota, a carbon-negative CO2 EOR project, with CO2 injection commencing in early 2022 and initial production response anticipated in the second half of 2023.
•Progressed the expansion of CO2 EOR developments at several fields, including Beaver Creek, Soso, Heidelberg and Cranfield.
•Utilized excess cash flow to repurchase 1.6 million shares of Denbury common stock for approximately $100 million at an average price of $61.92 per share, leaving $250 million remaining authorized for future repurchases under our share repurchase program.
•Amended the Company’s senior secured bank credit facility, increasing the borrowing base and lender commitments to $750 million, extending the maturity to 2027, and relaxing various covenants.
•Executed six agreements with customers for the potential future transportation and/or storage of industrial-sourced CO2 covering approximately 18 Mmtpa, raising our cumulative total of CO2 covered under future transportation/storage agreements to approximately 20 Mmtpa.
•Expanded our dedicated CO2 storage portfolio to a total of seven contracted sites with estimated storage potential of approximately 2 billion metric tons, with planned sites in Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas.
•Invested $10 million in the project development company of a planned blue hydrogen/ammonia facility.
•Submitted our first Class VI well permits for injecting CO2 into permanent geologic storage.
CARBON CAPTURE, UTILIZATION AND STORAGE
CCUS is a process that captures CO2 from industrial sources and either reuses or stores the CO2 in geologic formations in order to prevent its release into the atmosphere. We utilize CO2 from industrial sources in our EOR operations, and our extensive CO2 pipeline infrastructure and operations, particularly in the Gulf Coast, are strategically located in close proximity to both large sources of industrial emissions and geological formations well-suited for permanent storage. In the Rocky Mountain region, all of the CO2 we utilize in our EOR operations is from industrial sources and is transported through our extensive CO2 pipeline system. While industrial CO2 emissions in the Rocky Mountain region are not as significant as in the Gulf Coast, we believe the Rocky Mountain region also holds great potential for CCUS. We believe that the assets and technical expertise required for CCUS are highly aligned with our existing CO2 EOR operations. For more than 20 years, Denbury has been transporting and utilizing CO2 in association with its EOR operations, and the cumulative associated storage of CO2 underground through its EOR operations totals more than 240 million metric tons to date.
Supportive U.S. government policy and public pressure on industrial CO2 emitters provide strong incentives for them to capture their CO2 emissions; for example, in January 2021, the IRS issued final regulations under Section 45Q of the Internal Revenue Code (“Section 45Q”) on the expanded carbon capture tax credit, implementing a number of changes and clarifications to previous regulations which provided a tax incentive of $35 per ton for CO2 used in enhanced oil recovery and $50 per ton for CO2 permanently sequestered in geologic formations outside of EOR. In August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act was passed and increased the value of the tax credits from $50 per ton of sequestered CO2 to $85 per ton (subject to certain 
6


Denbury Inc.

qualifications and adjustments), and from $35 per ton of CO2 used for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) to $60 per ton (subject to certain qualifications and adjustments). The tax credit is available on volumes of permanently sequestered CO2 to the owner of the capture facilities for a 12-year period for qualifying facilities that begin construction before January 1, 2033. In addition to the Section 45Q tax credits, some entities may be eligible for other financial incentives or benefits for products that are created through CCUS.
We believe the incentives offered under Section 45Q will drive demand for CCUS and will allow us to collect a fee for the transportation and storage of captured industrial-sourced CO2, and further expand its utilization in our EOR operations. While a portion of the CO2 we currently utilize in our EOR operations is captured from industrial sources and qualifies as CCUS, we have historically paid a fee for that CO2 as those arrangements were entered into many years ago. As the enhanced Section 45Q regulations are relatively new, it will likely take several years for new capture facilities to be built and for dedicated storage sites to be developed.
As we seek to grow our CCUS business and pursue new CCUS opportunities, we have focused on the following strategic priorities:
•securing transportation and storage agreements with industrial emitters;
•adding safe, reliable, uninterruptible and secure permanent storage capacity through development of a diverse portfolio of subsurface storage sites;
•increasing our carbon-negative oil production by seeking to replace the use of naturally-sourced CO2 in our EOR operations;
•preparing for a capital efficient expansion of our Green Pipeline capacity to meet expected rapid growth in demand from Gulf Coast industrial facility owners; and
•pursuing strategic partnerships throughout the CCUS value chain.
Transportation and Storage
As of December 31, 2022, we had agreements with eight customers for the future transportation and/or storage of CO2 from industrial sources covering 20 Mmtpa, 18 Mmtpa of which was added during 2022. Our largest agreement is with a planned clean hydrogen-ammonia complex called Ascension Clean Energy (“ACE”). During 2022, we invested $10 million in the project development company of ACE, (Clean Hydrogen Works), while also signing a definitive agreement for the transportation and storage of CO2 for the first two blocks of the proposed plant. We have committed to investing another $10 million when certain milestones are achieved, which is expected in 2023. The planned clean hydrogen-ammonia complex is targeting a final investment decision in 2024 and is expected to include two ammonia blocks with estimated CO2 capture of up to 12 Mmtpa, with ammonia production from the first block expected to commence in 2027. Our agreements today are largely supported by planned ammonia/hydrogen plants, but also include plants proposing to produce biofuels, low carbon fuels, and methanol. Our agreements are with customers ranging from large international companies, such as Nutrien and Mitsubishi, to companies that are in the project development stage. We are working with many additional companies and projects on proposed future capture projects and expect to continue to add to our future business opportunities during 2023. We currently expect initial transportation and/or storage volumes associated with CCUS in 2025. 
Storage Sites
At December 31, 2022, the Company had seven planned storage sites under contract with estimated potential permanent storage of approximately 2 billion metric tons. The Company’s storage portfolio spans the U.S. Gulf Coast, including planned sequestration sites in Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas. Most of these sites are located in close proximity to our Gulf Coast CO2 pipeline system. We are progressing development at these sites and submitted our first Class VI well permits for injecting CO2 into permanent geologic storage in late 2022. We anticipate additional submittals during 2023, expect to drill test wells in 2023, and estimate first injection to begin in 2025. We are also evaluating potential CO2 storage sites in the Rocky Mountain region in close proximity to our extensive CO2 pipeline system.
OIL AND NATURAL GAS OPERATIONS
Our oil and natural gas properties are concentrated in the Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States.  Currently our properties with proved and producing reserves in the Gulf Coast region are situated in Mississippi, Texas, and Louisiana, and in the Rocky Mountain region are situated in Montana, Wyoming and North Dakota. Approximately 97%

Denbury Inc.

of our production is oil, and over two-thirds of our production is from CO2 EOR. Over time, we have grown primarily through the acquisition of mature oil fields, where we focus on increasing the value of those properties through a combination of exploitation, drilling and proven engineering extraction processes, with our most significant emphasis relating to CO2 EOR operations. Our current portfolio of CO2 EOR projects provides us with significant oil production and reserve growth potential, assuming crude oil prices are at levels that support the development of those projects.
We own and operate more than 1,300 miles of CO2 transportation pipelines. Our extensive CO2 pipeline infrastructure in the Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain regions gives us the ability to deliver CO2 from our natural and industrial CO2 sources for use in our CO2 EOR fields, as well as to deliver CO2 to our customers who are industrial end-users of CO2 or EOR customers. In the future, we plan to utilize these same pipelines for the transportation and storage of CO2 in our emerging CCUS business. Our Green Pipeline currently has ample capacity to handle additional volumes, and we can further expand capacity by adding pump stations or looping sections of the pipeline.
Oil and Natural Gas Reserve Estimates
DeGolyer and MacNaughton (“D&M”) prepared estimates of our net proved oil and natural gas reserves as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 (see the summary of D&M’s report as of December 31, 2022 included as an exhibit to this Form 10-K). These estimates of reserves were prepared using an average price equal to the unweighted arithmetic average of hydrocarbon prices on the first day of each month within the 12-month period in each year in accordance with rules and regulations of the SEC.  These oil and natural gas reserve estimates do not include any value for probable or possible reserves that may exist, nor do they include any value for undeveloped acreage.  The reserve estimates represent our net revenue interest in our properties.
The following table provides estimated proved reserve information prepared by D&M as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, as well as PV-10 Values and Standardized Measures for each period. The Company’s December 31, 2022 proved oil and natural gas reserve quantities and PV-10 Values increased from December 31, 2021 due largely to the increase in oil prices used in preparing the December 31, 2021 and 2022 reserve information. The average NYMEX oil price used in estimating our proved reserves increased from $66.56 per Bbl at December 31, 2021, to $93.67 per Bbl at December 31, 2022. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves and their values, including many factors beyond our control, which are further discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors – Estimating our reserves, production and future net cash flows is difficult to do with any certainty.

(1)The reference prices were based on the arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month NYMEX commodity prices for each month during the respective year. These prices do not reflect adjustments for market differentials and transportation expenses by field that are utilized in the preparation of our reserve report to arrive at the appropriate net price we receive. Further, we do not designate our oil and natural gas derivative contracts as hedging instruments for accounting purposes under the Derivatives and Hedging topic of the FASC, and as a result, the impact of these contracts is not included in the prices used in determining our reserve quantities or values. See Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations – Financial and Operating Results Tables for details of oil and natural gas prices received, both including and excluding the impact of derivative settlements.
(2)Determined based on the average first-day-of-the-month prices for each month, adjusted to prices received by the field in accordance with standards set forth in the FASC. PV-10 Values and the Standardized Measure are significantly impacted by the oil prices we receive relative to NYMEX oil prices (our NYMEX oil price differential). The weighted average oil price differentials utilized were $0.65 per Bbl below representative NYMEX oil prices as of December 31, 2022, compared to $2.70 per Bbl below NYMEX oil prices as of December 31, 2021, and $3.73 per Bbl below NYMEX oil prices as of December 31, 2020.
Denbury Inc.

(3)PV-10 Value is a non-GAAP measure and is different from the Standardized Measure in that PV-10 Value is a pre-tax number and the Standardized Measure is an after-tax number.  The information used to calculate PV-10 Value is derived directly from data determined in accordance with FASC Topic 932.  We believe that PV-10 Value is a useful supplemental disclosure to the Standardized Measure because the Standardized Measure can be impacted by a company’s unique tax situation, and it is not practical to calculate the Standardized Measure on a property-by-property basis.  Because of this, PV-10 Value is a widely used measure within the industry and is commonly used by securities analysts, banks and credit rating agencies to evaluate the estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves on a comparative basis across companies or specific properties.  PV-10 Value is commonly used by us and others in our industry to evaluate properties that are bought and sold, to assess the potential return on investment in our oil and natural gas properties, and to perform our impairment testing of oil and natural gas properties. PV-10 Value is not a measure of financial or operating performance under GAAP, nor should it be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the Standardized Measure.  Our PV-10 Value and the Standardized Measure do not purport to represent the fair value of our oil and natural gas reserves. See also Glossary and Selected Abbreviations for the definition of “PV-10 Value” and Supplemental Oil and Natural Gas Disclosures (Unaudited) to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures about the Standardized Measure.
Our proved developed non-producing reserves primarily consist of (1) reserves within a proved tertiary flood in areas that have not yet experienced a response from CO2 injection, (2) reserves that will be recovered from currently productive zones utilizing minor modifications to manage the flow of CO2 or water within the reservoir, and (3) reserves that will be recovered through recompletions to other intervals above or below the currently producing interval.
As of December 31, 2022, our estimated proved undeveloped reserves totaled approximately 3.9 MMBOE, or approximately 2% of our estimated total proved reserves.  Our proved undeveloped reserves were 5.9 MMBOE (60%) lower than at December 31, 2021.  During 2022, we spent approximately $53.2 million to convert 5.3 MMBOE of proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves, primarily related to non-tertiary development activities at Heidelberg and Beaver Creek. During 2022, we added an additional 1.1 MMBOE of estimated proved undeveloped reserves primarily related to tertiary operations at Hastings and Beaver Creek fields, and recognized net downward revisions of our proved undeveloped reserves of 1.7 MMBOE.
During 2022, we provided oil and natural gas reserve estimates for 2021 to the United States Energy Information Agency that were substantially the same as the reserve estimates included in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Internal Controls Over Reserve Estimates
Reserve information in this report is based on estimates prepared by D&M, independent petroleum engineers located in Dallas, Texas, utilizing data provided by our internal reservoir engineering team and is the responsibility of management. We rely on D&M’s expertise to ensure that our reserve estimates are prepared in compliance with SEC rules and regulations and that appropriate geologic, petroleum engineering, and evaluation principles and techniques are applied in accordance with practices generally recognized by the petroleum industry as presented in the publication of the Society of Petroleum Engineers entitled “Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information (Revision as of June 2019)”.  The person responsible for the preparation of the reserve report is a Senior Vice President and Division Manager of North America at D&M. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering in 2003 from Istanbul Technical University and a Master’s degree and Doctorate in Petroleum Engineering in 2005 and 2010, respectively, from Texas A&M University, and he has in excess of 12 years of experience in oil and gas reservoir studies and evaluations.  Our Senior Vice President – Business Development and Technology is primarily responsible for overseeing the independent petroleum engineers during the process.  Our Senior Vice President – Business Development and Technology has a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering from the Colorado School of Mines and over 35 years of industry experience working with petroleum engineering and reserve estimates.  D&M relies on various data provided by our internal reservoir engineering team in preparing its reserve estimates, including such items as oil and natural gas prices, ownership interests, production information, operating costs, planned capital expenditures and other technical data. Our internal reservoir engineering team consists of qualified petroleum engineers who maintain the Company’s internal evaluation of reserves and compare the Company’s information to the reserves prepared by D&M. Management is responsible for designing the internal control procedures used in the preparation of our oil and gas reserves, which include verification of data input into reserve forecasting and economics evaluation software, as well as multi-discipline management reviews.  The internal reservoir engineering team reports directly to our Senior Vice President – Business Development and Technology.  In addition, our Audit Committee of the Board of Directors oversees the qualifications, independence, performance and hiring of our independent petroleum engineers and 
Denbury Inc.

reviews the final report and subsequent reporting of our oil and natural gas reserve estimates, a member of which is the Chairman of our Board, who holds a Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and bachelor’s degrees in Chemistry and Mathematics from Capital University in Ohio. He has more than 40 years of industry experience, with responsibilities including reserves preparation and approval.

Enhanced Oil Recovery. EOR using CO2 is one of the most efficient tertiary recovery mechanisms for producing crude oil. When injected under pressure into underground, oil-bearing rock formations, CO2 acts somewhat like a solvent as it travels through the reservoir rock, mixing with and modifying the characteristics of the oil so it can be produced and sold. The terms “tertiary flood,” “CO2 flood” and “CO2 EOR” are used interchangeably throughout this document.
While enhanced oil recovery projects utilizing CO2 have been successfully performed by numerous oil and gas companies in a wide range of oil-bearing reservoirs in different oil-producing basins, we believe our investments, experience and acquired knowledge give us a strategic and competitive advantage in the areas in which we operate. We apply what we have learned and developed over the years to improve and increase sweep efficiency within the CO2 EOR projects we operate.
We began our CO2 operations in August 1999, when we acquired Little Creek Field, followed by our acquisition of Jackson Dome CO2 reserves and the NEJD pipeline in 2001. Based upon our success at Little Creek and the ownership of the CO2 reserves, we began to transition our capital spending and acquisition efforts to focus more heavily on CO2 EOR and, over time, transformed our strategy to focus primarily on owning and operating oil fields that are well suited for CO2 EOR projects. Prior to tertiary flooding, we strive to maximize the currently sizeable primary and secondary production from our prospective tertiary fields and from fields in which tertiary floods have commenced but still contain significant non-tertiary production. Our asset base today almost entirely consists of, or otherwise relates to, oil fields that we are currently flooding with CO2 or plan to flood with CO2 in the future, or assets that produce CO2. During the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 40% of the CO2 utilized in our operated oil and gas operations was industrial-sourced CO2 and approximately 28% of our production for 2022 was carbon-negative, meaning the total amount of industrial-sourced CO2 injected more than offset Scope 1, 2, and 3 CO2e emissions (see Climate Change and Environmental Considerations below). 
Although the up-front cost of tertiary production infrastructure and time to construct pipelines and production facilities is greater than in primary oil recovery in most circumstances, we believe tertiary recovery has several favorable, offsetting and unique attributes, including:
•a lower exploration risk, as we are operating oil fields that have significant historical production and reservoir and geological data;
•lower production decline rates than unconventional development;
•reasonable return metrics at currently anticipated long-term prices;
•limited competition for this recovery method in our geographic regions and a strategic advantage due to our ownership of the CO2 reserves and CO2 pipeline infrastructure;
•being generally less disruptive to new habitats in comparison to other oil and natural gas development because we further develop existing (as opposed to new) oil fields; and
•allowing us to concurrently store CO2 captured from industrial sources in the same underground formations that previously trapped and stored oil and natural gas.
Our tertiary operations represent 68% of our 2022 total production (on a BOE basis). At year-end 2022, the proved oil reserves in our tertiary recovery oil fields had an estimated PV-10 Value of approximately $2.9 billion, or 64% of our total PV-10 Value, and represented 60% of our total proved reserves. In addition, there are significant probable and possible reserves at several other fields for which tertiary operations are underway or planned.
Gulf Coast Region Assets
Gulf Coast Oil Fields
Our CO2 EOR operations began in August 1999 with the acquisition of Little Creek Field, which is our longest-producing CO2 EOR flood. Our most mature CO2 EOR properties are generally located along our NEJD CO2 pipeline in southwest Mississippi and Louisiana and our Free State Pipeline in east Mississippi. These properties include Brookhaven, Cranfield, Eucutta, Little Creek, Mallalieu, Martinville, McComb and Soso fields, which have been producing under CO2 EOR for some time, and their production is generally declining. We commenced tertiary floods at both Tinsley and Heidelberg fields in Mississippi during 2008, and at Delhi Field in Louisiana in 2009. Many of our Mississippi fields contain multiple reservoirs 
12


Denbury Inc.

that are amenable to CO2 EOR. Accordingly, we often find opportunities to expand the floods to new development areas over many years or even decades.
We further expanded tertiary operations to Texas with the acquisitions of interests in Oyster Bayou and Hastings fields in 2007 and 2009, respectively. Oyster Bayou is located in southeast Texas, east of Galveston Bay and Hastings Field is located south of Houston, Texas. Concurrent with the completion of the Green Pipeline in 2010, we initiated tertiary floods at these fields in 2010. We began producing oil from our tertiary operations at Oyster Bayou Field in 2011 and Hastings Field in 2012. Incremental development efforts continue at both fields today. These fields accounted for 35% of our Gulf Coast tertiary production in 2022.
In addition to our tertiary operations in the Gulf Coast region, we currently own interests in several properties that are currently not under CO2 flood, the most significant of which are Conroe, Thompson and Webster fields in Texas. We continue to evaluate the potential to progress CO2 EOR development in these fields, the development of which is primarily dependent upon capital availability and priorities, future oil prices and in some cases pipeline construction.
CO2 Sources
Natural CO2 Sources
Our primary Gulf Coast CO2 source, Jackson Dome, is a large and relatively pure source of naturally occurring CO2 (98% CO2) and, to our knowledge, the only significant underground deposit of CO2 in the United States east of the Mississippi River. Jackson Dome provides us a significant competitive advantage in the acquisition and development of properties in Mississippi, Louisiana and southeastern Texas that are well suited for CO2 EOR. We have drilled numerous CO2-producing wells in Jackson Dome over the years. As of December 31, 2022, we have estimated proved CO2 reserves in Jackson Dome of 3.8 Tcf.  The proved CO2 reserve estimates are based on a gross (8/8ths) basis, of which our net revenue interest is approximately 3.0 Tcf, and is included in the evaluation of proved CO2 reserves prepared by D&M, independent petroleum engineers.  In discussing our available CO2 reserves, we make reference to the gross amount of proved and probable reserves, as this is the amount that is available both for our own tertiary recovery programs and for our customers who are industrial end-users of CO2 or EOR customers, as we are responsible for distributing the entire CO2 production stream.
In addition to our proved reserves, we estimate that we have 1.4 Tcf, on a gross (8/8ths) basis, of probable CO2 reserves at Jackson Dome. While the majority of these probable reserves are located in structures that have been drilled and tested, such reserves are still considered probable reserves because (1) the original well is plugged; (2) they are located in fault blocks that are immediately adjacent to fault blocks with proved reserves; or (3) they are reserves associated with increasing the ultimate recovery factor from our existing reservoirs with proved reserves. In addition, a significant portion of these probable reserves at Jackson Dome are located in undrilled structures where we have sufficient subsurface and seismic data indicating geophysical attributes that, coupled with our historically high drilling success rate, provide a reasonably high degree of certainty that CO2 is present.
Industrial-sourced CO2
In addition to our naturally occurring CO2 source at Jackson Dome, in our tertiary operations we utilize CO2 captured from industrial sources which would otherwise be released into the atmosphere. Industrial sources of CO2 help us recover additional oil from mature oil fields and, we believe, also provide an economical way to reduce CO2 emissions through the associated underground storage of CO2 which occurs as part of our oil-producing EOR operations (see Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage above). In the Gulf Coast, we are currently party to two long-term contracts to purchase CO2: an industrial facility in Port Arthur, Texas and an industrial facility in Geismar, Louisiana, which combined supplied an average of approximately 55 MMcf/d of CO2 to our EOR operations during 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 14% of the CO2 utilized in our Gulf Coast EOR operations was industrial-sourced CO2.
In the Gulf Coast region, approximately 76% of our average daily CO2 produced from Jackson Dome or captured from industrial sources in 2022 was used in our operated tertiary recovery operations, compared to 76% in 2021 and 77% in 2020, with the balance delivered to third-party industrial end-users or EOR customers. During 2022, we used an average of 400 MMcf/d of CO2 (including CO2 captured from industrial sources) for our tertiary activities.

CO2 Pipelines
We own nearly 925 miles of CO2 pipelines in the Gulf Coast region, which gives us the ability to deliver CO2 throughout the region. At the present time, most of the CO2 flowing in the Green Pipeline is delivered from the Jackson Dome area, but also includes the CO2 we are receiving from the industrial facilities in Port Arthur, Texas and Geismar, Louisiana, and we are currently transporting a third party’s CO2 for a fee to the sales point at Hastings Field. We currently have ample capacity within the Green Pipeline to handle additional volumes that may be required to develop our inventory of CO2 EOR projects in this area, as well as to support the transportation of CO2 for the emerging CCUS business. The following table summarizes our most significant CO2 pipelines owned and operated in the Gulf Coast region as of December 31, 2022:

CO2 pipelines(1) | Completion Date | Pipeline Diameter(in inches) | Pipeline Mileage | Service Area 
Green Pipeline | 2010 | 24” | 320 | Gulf Coast corridor from near Donaldsonville, Louisiana to Hastings Field in Texas; including connections to 2 industrial-source CO2 providers
NEJD Pipeline | 1986 | 20” | 183 | Jackson Dome CO2 source to Green Pipeline connection 
Delta Pipeline | 2009 | 24” | 111 | Jackson Dome CO2 source to Delhi Field in Louisiana 
Free State Pipeline | 2005 | 20” | 91 | Jackson Dome CO2 source to West Yellow Creek in Mississippi 
West Gwinville | 1959/2008(2) | 18” | 51 | NEJD Pipeline to Cranfield Field 

(1)The Company has other intrafield CO2 pipelines in the Gulf Coast region that total approximately 168 miles.
(2)Repurposed from a natural gas pipeline to a CO2 pipeline in 2008.
Rocky Mountain Region Assets
Rocky Mountain Oil Fields
We began operations in the Rocky Mountain region in 2010 with the acquisition of Encore Acquisition Company. Bell Creek Field was the first CO2 EOR flood we developed in this region which began tertiary production in 2013. We have added several properties to our portfolio in the Rocky Mountain region over time, including Grieve Field in 2011, Hartzog Draw Field in 2012, and the acquisition of additional interests at CCA in 2013. In March 2021, we acquired a nearly 100% working interest (83% net revenue interest) in the Big Sand Draw and Beaver Creek EOR fields in Wyoming, including surface facilities and a 46-mile CO2 transportation pipeline to the acquired fields.
CCA is the largest property that we own and currently our largest producing property, contributing approximately 21% of our 2022 total sales volumes. Historical production from the property has primarily been from the Red River interval. CCA is primarily located in Montana but extends over such a large area (approximately 126 miles) that it also extends into North Dakota. CCA is a series of 13 different operating areas on a common geological trend, each of which could be considered a field by itself.
In early-February 2022, we commenced CO2 injection in the first phase of our CCA EOR project, and currently expect tertiary oil production response from CCA in the second half of 2023. In addition, drilling and facility construction at the Company’s Pennel CO2 pilot, in advance of Phase 2 development of CCA, commenced during the third quarter of 2022. In addition to these oil fields, we continue to evaluate tertiary potential in Hartzog Draw Field located in the Powder River Basin of northeastern Wyoming, the development of which is primarily dependent upon capital availability and priorities and future oil prices. The field is located approximately 12 miles from our Greencore Pipeline.
CO2 Sources
All CO2 used in our Rocky Mountain tertiary operations is captured from industrial sources. We own an overriding royalty interest equivalent to an approximate one-third ownership interest in ExxonMobil’s CO2 reserves in LaBarge Field. LaBarge Field is located in southwestern Wyoming, and as of December 31, 2022, our interest in LaBarge Field held approximately 1.0 Tcf of proved CO2 reserves. During 2022, we received an average of approximately 151 MMcf/d of CO2 from the Shute Creek 
14


Denbury Inc.

gas processing plant at LaBarge Field that we used in our Rocky Mountain region CO2 floods or sold to another third-party operator. Based on current capacity, and subject to availability of CO2, we currently expect our CO2 volumes from Shute Creek to increase in future years. We pay ExxonMobil a fee to process and deliver the CO2, which we use in our Rocky Mountain region CO2 floods.
We also have a contract in place to receive all of the CO2 from the Lost Cabin gas plant in central Wyoming, which we estimate has the capability to provide us as much as 30 MMcf/d of CO2 for use in our Rocky Mountain region CO2 floods. We received 24 MMcf/d of CO2 volumes from this source in 2022. We currently estimate that our existing CO2 sources, plus additional CO2 from those or other CO2 sources in the region, are sufficient to carry out our Rocky Mountain region EOR development plans.
CO2 Pipelines
The 20-inch Greencore Pipeline in Wyoming is the first CO2 pipeline we constructed in the Rocky Mountain region. The 232-mile pipeline begins at the Lost Cabin gas plant in Wyoming and terminates at Bell Creek Field in Montana. In 2021, we completed construction of the CCA CO2 pipeline, which delivers CO2 to our new tertiary development project at CCA. The following table summarizes our most significant CO2 pipelines owned and operated in the Rocky Mountain region as of December 31, 2022:

CO2 pipelines(1) | Completion Date | Pipeline Diameter(in inches) | Pipeline Mileage | Service Area 
Greencore Pipeline | 2012 | 20” | 232 | Lost Cabin gas plant in Wyoming to Bell Creek Field in Montana
CCA Pipeline | 2021 | 16” | 105 | Bell Creek Field in Montana to CCA 
Beaver Creek Pipeline | 2008 | 8” | 46 | Wyoming Wind River Basin properties 

(1) The Company has other intrafield CO2 pipelines in the Rocky Mountain region that total approximately 22 miles.

(1)An exploratory well is a well drilled to find a new field or to find a new reservoir in a field previously found to be productive of oil or natural gas in another reservoir.  Generally, an exploratory well is any well that is not a development well, an extension well, a service well or a stratigraphic test well.  A development well is a well drilled within the proved area of an oil or gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive.
(2)A productive well is an exploratory or development well drilled and completed during the year and found to be capable of producing either oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to justify completion as an oil or natural gas well.
(3)A non-productive well is an exploratory or development well that is not a productive well.
(4)Includes 8 productive gross wells and 1 non-productive gross well during 2021, and 2 productive gross wells during 2020, in which we incurred no cost but have an overriding royalty interest prior to the combined payout of the wells. Subsequent to payout, Denbury will hold and bear the cost of its working interest in each well.
(5)During 2022, an additional 7 wells were drilled for water or CO2 injection purposes. There were no wells drilled during 2021 or 2020 for water or CO2 injection purposes

TITLE TO PROPERTIES
As is customary in the oil and natural gas industry, Denbury conducts a limited title examination at the time of its acquisition of properties or leasehold interests targeted for enhanced recovery, and curative work is performed with respect to significant defects on higher-value properties of the greatest significance. We believe that title to our oil and natural gas properties is good and defensible, subject only to such exceptions that we believe do not materially interfere with the use of such properties, including encumbrances, easements, restrictions and royalty, overriding royalty and other similar interests.
SIGNIFICANT OIL AND GAS PURCHASERS AND PRODUCT MARKETING
Oil and natural gas sales are made on a day-to-day basis or under short-term contracts at the current area market price. We would not expect the loss of any single purchaser to have a material adverse effect upon our operations; however, the loss of a large single purchaser could potentially reduce the competition for our oil and natural gas production, which in turn could negatively impact the prices we receive.  For the year ended December 31, 2022, two purchasers each accounted for 10% or more of our oil and natural gas revenues: Plains Marketing LP (27%) and Hunt Crude Oil Supply Company (11%).
Our ability to market oil and natural gas depends on many factors beyond our control, including the extent of domestic production and imports of oil and natural gas, available oil storage at Cushing, Oklahoma, and other inventory hubs, the proximity of our oil and natural gas production to pipelines and corresponding markets, the available capacity in such pipelines, the demand for oil and natural gas, the effects of weather, and the effects of state and federal regulation.  While we have not experienced significant difficulty in finding a market for our production as it becomes available or in transporting our production to those markets, there is no assurance that we will always be able to market all of our production or obtain favorable prices.
Oil Marketing and Differentials
Prices received in a regional market fluctuate frequently and can differ from NYMEX pricing due to a variety of reasons, including supply and/or demand factors, crude oil quality and location differentials. Our crude oil prices in the Gulf Coast region have historically been highly correlated to the changes in prices of crude oil sold under the Light Louisiana Sweet (“LLS”) index. Our current markets at various sales points along the Gulf Coast have sufficient demand to accommodate our production, but there can be no assurance of future demand.
The marketing of our Rocky Mountain region oil production is dependent on transportation through local pipelines to our primary market centers in Guernsey and Casper, Wyoming, although some of our production may ultimately be transported by third parties to Cushing, Oklahoma and Wood River, Illinois.  Shipments on some of the pipelines are at or near capacity and may be subject to apportionment.  We currently have access to, or have contracted for, sufficient pipeline capacity to move our oil production; however, there can be no assurance that we will be allocated sufficient pipeline capacity to move all of our oil production in the future.  Because local demand for production is small in comparison to current production levels, much of the production in the Rocky Mountain region is transported to markets outside of the region. Therefore, prices in the Rocky Mountain region are further influenced by fluctuations in prices (primarily Brent and LLS) in coastal markets and by available pipeline capacity in the Midwest and Cushing markets.
COMPETITION AND MARKETS
We face competition from other oil and natural gas companies in all aspects of our business, including acquisition of producing properties, oil and gas leases, drilling rights, and CO2 properties; marketing of oil and natural gas; and obtaining and maintaining goods, services and labor.  Many of our competitors have substantially larger financial and other resources.  Factors that affect our ability to acquire producing properties include available liquidity, available information about prospective properties and our expectations for earning a minimum projected return on our investments.  Because of the primary nature of our core assets (our tertiary operations) and our ownership of relatively uncommon significant natural sources of CO2 in the Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain regions, we believe that we are effective in competing in the market and have less competition than our peers in certain aspects of our business.

CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS
Climate change, which is a specifically identified part of our broader efforts to operate in a manner consonant with ESG standards and goals, is a continuing global concern for governments, businesses, and society. The reduction of GHG emissions is important, and we take the responsibility of protecting our environment seriously. Part of our obligation is to report GHG emissions and develop procedures and methods to collect data critical for calculating these emissions. In addition, our operating strategy, which focuses on CO2 EOR and CCUS, has measurable environmental benefits. We are committed to utilizing emerging technologies, where feasible, to capture or reduce emissions and to lower our GHG intensity. 
We strive to be environmentally responsible in all aspects of our operations. Our operations have been subject to federal, state and local environmental compliance for many years, the costs of which are well integrated into our budgeting and our operating results. With our focus on CO2 EOR, we offer environmental benefits not generally associated with oil and gas operations. We utilize technology and techniques that reduce the risks to, and impacts on, the environment. Our programs include measures to prevent spills and releases and to quickly respond to incidents if they do occur; efforts to manage, minimize and remediate our environmental impacts; and an operating strategy that is directly focused on our carbon footprint. 
As the world demands energy to fuel tomorrow’s economy and provide a better quality of life, we must meet the demand with a focus on reducing GHG emissions. The Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (“Greenhouse Gas Protocol”) classifies a company’s GHG emissions into three scopes: Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions from owned or controlled sources; Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions from the generation of purchased energy; and Scope 3 emissions are all indirect emissions (not included in Scope 2) that occur in the value chain of the reporting company, including both upstream and downstream emissions. The utilization of industrial-sourced CO2 in EOR significantly reduces the carbon footprint of our oil production, making our Scope 1 and 2 CO2e emissions negative today. We have set a target, within this decade, to reach Net Zero for our Scope 1, Scope 2 and those Scope 3 emissions that result from a consumer’s use of the oil and natural gas we sell (defined as Category 11 emissions by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol).
In our Corporate Responsibility Report, which is published on our website, we report in detail our direct GHG emissions resulting from our operations, as well as indirect GHG emissions associated with the consumption of electricity.
In addition, we are committed to engaging with stakeholders, policy makers, regulators, and our industry on climate change and ESG issues and to addressing our impact on the environment. The Sustainability and Governance Committee of the Board of Directors oversees our overall ESG strategy including health and safety, climate change, environmental, social and community policies, practices and procedures. The Committee focuses upon climate change risk management and strategy, CCUS activities, sustainability targets, and operating efficiencies, along with broader climate change concerns.
HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES
Our employees are Denbury’s greatest resource, and each individual helps shape Denbury into a unique and exceptional place to work. Our employees’ ideas, passion and collective efforts are what produce winning results for our Company. We support a talented and diverse workforce that lives our key values and embodies our culture. We inspire each other to make Denbury better. As of December 31, 2022, we had 765 employees, of whom 414 were employed in our field operations or at our field offices and 351 were employed at our headquarters in Plano, TX, none of whom are currently covered by a labor union or other collective bargaining arrangement.
Workforce Health and Safety
Emphasizing workforce health and safety is not only a critical element of our ESG strategy, but it has also been a central part of our practices and standards over the years. We continuously seek to improve our health and safety performance by fostering a culture that prioritizes safe work, then ensuring that this culture is exemplified in all levels of leadership. We provide our employees with tools to succeed, including relevant and timely training, and we monitor our performance using established measurement statistics. With oversight from the Sustainability and Governance Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors, each year, Denbury establishes corporate goals specifically related to employee and contractor safety performance and monitors progress toward those goals throughout the year using performance metrics. Results are regularly reported to our Board of Directors, senior management and all employees to ensure accountability and to reinforce their 
Denbury Inc.

importance. Two safety performance metrics Denbury closely monitors are the Total Recordable Incident Rate (“TRIR”) and the Significant Injury or Fatality Rate (“SIFR”), which also captures near misses that may not have resulted in an injury. 
Compensation and Benefits
As part of our compensation philosophy, we believe that we must offer and maintain competitive compensation and benefit programs for our employees in order to attract and retain outstanding talent. In addition to competitive base wages, other benefit programs include an annual bonus plan, an employee stock purchase plan, a long-term incentive plan, Company matched 401(k) plan, competitive healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts and employee assistance programs.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
At Denbury, we strive to make diversity, equity and inclusion a part of our culture. Our management is responsible for implementing our diversity initiatives, including targeted recruitment of underrepresented populations, diversity training, and development of our diverse workforce. The Sustainability and Governance Committee of our Board of Directors provides our management with oversight and advice with respect to our practices, strategies and initiatives related to human capital management, such as diversity, equity and inclusion matters, workplace culture and talent development. We recognize the benefits we all share as a result of a diverse culture and are continually looking for ways to foster a diverse and inclusive work environment. In 2022, women and minorities accounted for 21% and 17% of our workforce, respectively, 25% and 32% of our new hires, respectively, and 25% and 13% of our Board of Directors, respectively.
Our diversity, equity and inclusion principles are also reflected in our employee training and policies. To foster a diverse and collaborative workplace, Denbury requires all employees to complete annual training to raise awareness and encourage diversity and inclusion. Each year, our employee training program includes courses related to diversity, anti-discrimination, and anti-harassment to help employees better appreciate diversity, cultural differences, recognize unconscious biases, and increase collaboration. For 2022, our training completion rate was 96%. We continue to enhance our diversity, equity and inclusion policies which are guided by our Board of Directors and executive leadership team.
Talent Acquisition, Retention and Development
Our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to hire, develop, and retain highly skilled and experienced personnel, including our executive officers as well as other key management and technical specialists, such as geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other oil and gas industry professionals. Denbury provides employees with many ways to expand their skills and advance their careers through training and development initiatives. We believe this is critical to each employee’s professional growth and success, as well as to our success as a company.
Denbury aims to ensure equal opportunity in recruitment. We broaden our pool of diverse candidates by utilizing a digital recruiting program which posts available employment opportunities to websites worldwide, some of which are dedicated to diverse candidate pools, as well as by recruiting at local career workshops, several of which are specifically targeted at diverse candidates, veterans and other underrepresented groups.

FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATIONS
Numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the oil and gas industry.  Additions or changes to these laws and regulations are often made in response to the current political or economic environment. Compliance with the evolving regulatory landscape can be challenging, and noncompliance can result in substantial penalties or the potential shutdown of operations. Compliance has also been complicated by an increasing trend for litigation challenging policy and regulatory changes, with judicial decisions increasing regulatory uncertainty, often delaying necessary approvals from agencies that may be the subject of conflicting injunctions, rulings or appeals. Additionally, the future annual cost of complying with all laws and regulations applicable to our operations is uncertain and will be ultimately determined by several factors, including future changes to legal and regulatory requirements. Management believes that continued compliance with existing laws and regulations applicable to our operations and future compliance therewith will not have a materially adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, although such laws and regulations, and compliance therewith, could cause significant delays or otherwise impede operations, which may, among other things, cause our expected production rates and cash flows to be less than anticipated.
The following sections describe some specific laws and regulations that may affect us.  We cannot predict the cost or impact of these or other future legislative or regulatory initiatives.
Regulation of Oil and Gas Exploration and Production
Our operations are subject to various types of laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels.  Such regulation includes requiring sometimes lengthy environmental review prior to approval of potential leasing, drilling, or other development projects; permits for drilling wells; maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells and regulating the location of wells; the method of drilling and casing wells; the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled; the compensation due to surface, and potentially pore space, owners for mineral development, enhanced oil recovery, and fluid disposal activities; the plugging and abandoning of wells; and the composition or disposal of chemicals and fluids used in connection with operations.  Our operations are also subject to various environmental and conservation laws and regulations.  These include regulation of the size of drilling, spacing or proration units and the density of wells that may be drilled in those units, and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties.  In addition, federal and state environmental and 
Denbury Inc.

conservation laws, which establish maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells, generally prohibit or restrict the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability of production.  The effect of these laws and regulations may delay proposed development projects, limit the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and may limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill.  Regulatory requirements and compliance relative to the oil and gas industry increase our costs of doing business and, consequently, affect our profitability.
Federal Energy Pipeline and Climate Change Legislation and Regulation
The Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty and Job Creation Act of 2011, among other things, updated federal pipeline safety standards, increased penalties for violations of such standards, gave the Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (the “PHMSA”) authority for new damage prevention and incident notification, and directed PHMSA to prescribe new minimum safety standards for CO2 pipelines. In mid-2022, PHMSA announced its intention to initiate a new rulemaking to update standards for CO2 pipelines, including requirements related to emergency preparedness and response, which new rulemaking had not occurred as of February 2023.
Both federal and state authorities have in recent years proposed and enacted new regulations and policies to limit the emission of pollutants, including GHG emissions, as part of climate change initiatives and the Clean Air Act.  During the last ten years, both the EPA and Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) have proposed and issued such regulations and policies for the oil and gas industry. Those proposed and final regulations and policies were the subject of extensive administrative, judicial, and Congressional consideration during the Obama and Trump Administrations, which caused significant difficulty in determining which regulations were in force at any given time. The Biden Administration, through various executive orders and other policy statements, has made climate change a primary priority. On January 20, 2021, the Biden Administration issued Executive Order 13990, directing agencies to review all agency actions related to emissions and climate change taken under the Trump Administration. On June 30, 2021, President Biden signed into law a joint Congressional resolution disapproving the EPA’s 2020 policy rules related to GHG emissions from oil and gas industry activities under the Clean Air Act. On November 2, 2021, the EPA proposed new regulations for GHG emissions. In November 2022, the EPA proposed to update, strengthen and expand its November 2021 proposed regulations to include more comprehensive emission reductions from oil and gas facilities. Public hearings on the new proposed regulations were held in January 2023, with a potential final rule to be published thereafter. In November 2022, BLM proposed new rules regulating the venting, flaring and leaks of natural gas during oil and gas production activities on federal and Indian lands. The comment period for the new proposed rules ended January 30, 2023. While BLM’s proposal is listed on its regulatory agenda, the agency has not yet issued a proposed rule. Any resulting regulations adopted by the EPA or BLM could possibly be similar to, or even more stringent than, those promulgated by the agencies under the Obama Administration. Enforcement of such regulations may impose additional costs related to compliance with these new emission limits, as well as inspections and maintenance of several types of equipment used in our operations.
CCUS Regulation
The Biden Administration has previously announced a domestic climate goal of net-zero emissions economy-wide by 2050, and committed to supporting the responsible development and deployment of CCUS technologies to make it a widely available, increasingly cost-effective, and rapidly scalable climate solution across all industrial sectors.
On February 16, 2022, pursuant to the Utilizing Significant Emissions with Innovative Technologies Act, the White House’s Council on Environmental Quality (“CEQ”) issued guidance for Federal agencies on the facilitation of reviews associated with the deployment of CCUS projects and carbon dioxide pipelines, and to support the efficient, orderly, and responsible deployment of CCUS projects and carbon dioxide pipelines, where appropriate. This guidance was consistent with the CEQ’s report, “Council on Environmental Quality Report to Congress on Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Sequestration” issued in June 2021, which identified numerous permits and/or reviews that may be required during the development of a CCUS project, some examples of which are:
•Clean Air Act New Source Review preconstruction permit;
•Clean Air Act Title V operating permit;
•Underground Injection Control (“UIC”) permit;
•Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement under National Environmental Policy Act;
•Consultations with Fish and Wildlife Service pursuant to Endangered Species Act;
22

•Compliance with Mineral Leasing Act for geologic sequestration; and
•Compliance with PHMSA standards and regulations.
On July 27, 2022, the CEQ also established a task force to provide recommendations to the Federal government on how to ensure CCUS projects, such as carbon dioxide pipelines, are permitted in an efficient manner. The final recommendations of the CEQ on permitting, and any resultant regulatory schemes established by the Biden Administration and/or Congress, may impose additional costs related to compliance.
The Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has a regulatory framework under the authorities of the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Clean Air Act that regulates UIC programs and ensures the long-term, safe geologic sequestration of CO2. The EPA also provides guidance to support state program implementation of UIC programs. This includes minimum requirements for state UIC programs and permitting for injection wells. These requirements include performance standards for well construction, operation and maintenance, monitoring and testing, reporting and recordkeeping, site closure, financial responsibility, and post injection site care. The EPA has issued regulations for six classes of underground injection wells based on type and depth of fluids injected and potential for endangerment of underground sources of drinking water. Class II wells are used to inject fluids relating to oil and gas operations, including with respect to the injection of CO2 for EOR, while Class VI wells are used for the express purpose of injecting CO2 for geologic storage.
Our carbon transportation and storage operations are also subject to state regulations. Numerous state legislatures have passed legislation specifically pertaining to carbon storage projects and addressing issues such as: (1) pre-requisites for obtaining a permit to drill and/or establish a carbon storage facility; (2) pore space ownership, (3) mineral rights primacy, (4) carbon dioxide ownership, and (5) long-term liability associated with carbon storage facilities. In 2022, numerous states passed new laws addressing one or more of these issues, including Mississippi and Wyoming. Management believes that we are currently in compliance with all state regulations pertaining to the development and/or operation of carbon transportation and storage projects. However, the regulatory environment around CCUS projects is in a state of rapid evolution and we anticipate that further state regulations applicable to our operations may be passed in the coming years, including within Texas and/or Louisiana.
Federal, State or Indian Leases
As of December 31, 2022, approximately 30% of our net developed acreage and 27% of our December 2022 production related to oil and natural gas operations performed on federal acreage, including portions of CCA. Our operations on federal, state or Indian oil and gas leases, especially those in the Rocky Mountain region, are subject to numerous restrictions, including nondiscrimination statutes. Such operations must be conducted pursuant to certain on-site security regulations and other permits and authorizations issued by the BLM, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and other federal and state stakeholder agencies.
New federal oil and gas leasing has resumed, although at a slower pace, after various executive orders, secretarial orders, and related litigation caused significant delay in 2021 and 2022. Recent federal oil and gas leasing and permitting decisions, however, remain subject to pending litigation in several federal courts throughout the country, and consequently the current litigation environment implies that nearly all new federal leasing and permitting decisions are likely to be subject to judicial challenge.
BLM has also announced plans to introduce a new proposed rule to update its oil and gas leasing process. The proposed rule may include increases to the fees, rents, royalty rates, bonding requirements, and updated procedures for ensuring environmental stewardship and climate change analysis for new federal oil and gas leases. While BLM’s proposal is listed on its regulatory agenda and has been the subject of scoping meetings, the agency has not yet issued a proposed rule. If such a rule is finalized, any increase in the fees related to oil and gas development on federal lands will increase our costs of doing business and, consequently, affect our profitability.
Environmental Regulations
Our oil and natural gas production, saltwater disposal operations, injection of CO2, and the processing, handling and disposal of materials such as hydrocarbons and naturally occurring radioactive materials (“NORM”) are subject to stringent regulation.  We could incur significant costs, including cleanup costs resulting from a release of product, third-party claims for property damage and personal injuries, or penalties and other sanctions as a result of any violations or liabilities under 
23


Denbury Inc.

environmental laws and regulations or other laws and regulations applicable to our operations.  Changes in, or more stringent enforcement of, environmental laws and other laws applicable to our operations could also result in delays or additional operating costs and capital expenditures.
Various federal, state and local laws and regulations controlling the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment and human health, directly impact our oil and gas exploration, development and production operations.  These include, among others, (1) regulations adopted by the EPA and various state agencies regarding approved methods of disposal for certain hazardous and nonhazardous wastes; (2) the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act and analogous state laws that regulate the removal or remediation of previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), property contamination (including groundwater contamination), and remedial plugging operations to prevent future contamination; (3) the Clean Air Act and comparable state and local requirements already applicable to our operations and new restrictions on air emissions from our operations, including GHG emissions and those that could discourage the production of fossil fuels that, when used, ultimately release CO2; (4) the Clean Water Act and comparable state and local requirements already applicable to our operations and new restrictions on wastewater discharges from our operations; (5) the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, which contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of, and response to, oil spills into waters of the United States; (6) the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which is the principal federal statute governing the treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous wastes; (7) the Endangered Species Act and counterpart state legislation, which protects certain species (and their related habitats), including certain species that could be present on our leases, as threatened or endangered; (8) the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, which protects certain bird species, including certain species that could be present on our leases, from intentional and unintentional killing and other disturbances; and (9) state regulations and statutes governing the handling, treatment, storage and disposal of NORM and other wastes.
In the Rocky Mountain region, federal agencies’ actions based upon their environmental review responsibilities under the National Environmental Policy Act can significantly impact the scope and timing of hydrocarbon development by slowing the timing of individual applications for permits to drill and requests for rights-of-way and delaying large scale planning associated with region-level resource management plans, oil and gas lease sales, and project-level master development plans. On April 20, 2022 the Council on Environmental Quality issued a final rule that updates National Environmental Policy Act regulations to remove consideration of the applicant’s goals, to allow agencies greater flexibility in developing applicable review procedures, and to revise the definition of “effects” to be considered to include direct, indirect, and cumulative effects. With implementation of the new rule, the federal environmental review process is expected to continue or even increase delay in federal decision making related to oil and gas development.
Management believes that we are currently in substantial compliance with existing applicable environmental laws and regulations, and does not currently anticipate that future compliance will have a materially adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, although such laws and regulations, and compliance therewith, could cause significant delays or otherwise impede operations, which may, among other things, cause our expected production rates and cash flows to be less than anticipated.
