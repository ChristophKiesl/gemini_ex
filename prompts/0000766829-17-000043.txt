General Development of Business
SJW Corp. was incorporated in California on February 8, 1985. On November 15, 2016, SJW Corp. changed its state of incorporation from the state of California to the state of Delaware and changed its name to SJW Group. The reincorporation was effected by means of a merger pursuant to the terms of the agreement and plan of merger, dated November 14, 2016, between SJW Corp. and SJW Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of SJW Corp., which was formed solely for the purpose of effecting the reincorporation. Under the Merger Agreement, SJW Corp. merged with and into SJW Group, Inc., and SJW Corp. ceased to exist and SJW Group, Inc. became the surviving entity following the effectiveness of the merger. Concurrently with the consummation of the merger, SJW Group, Inc. changed its name to SJW Group. SJW Group is a holding company with five subsidiaries:

• | San Jose Water Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of SJW Group, with its headquarters located at 110 West Taylor Street in San Jose, California 95110, was originally incorporated under the laws of the State of California in 1866. As part of a reorganization on February 8, 1985, San Jose Water Company became a wholly owned subsidiary of SJW Corp. and subsequently SJW Group on November 15, 2016. San Jose Water Company is a public utility in the business of providing water service to approximately 229,000 connections that serve a population of approximately one million people in an area comprising approximately 138 square miles in the metropolitan San Jose, California area. 


• | SJWTX, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of SJW Group, was incorporated in the State of Texas in 2005. SJWTX, Inc. is doing business as Canyon Lake Water Service Company (“CLWSC”). CLWSC is a public utility in the business of providing water service to approximately 13,000 connections that serve approximately 39,000 people. CLWSC’s service area comprises more than 244 square miles in western Comal County and southern Blanco County in the growing region between San Antonio and Austin, Texas. SJWTX, Inc. has a 25% interest in Acequia Water Supply Corporation (“Acequia”). The water supply corporation has been determined to be a variable interest entity within the scope of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) Topic 810, “Consolidation” with SJWTX, Inc. as the primary beneficiary. As a result, Acequia has been consolidated with SJWTX, Inc. 


• | SJW Land Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of SJW Group, was incorporated in 1985. SJW Land Company owns undeveloped land in the states of California and Tennessee, owns and operates commercial buildings in the states of California and Tennessee, and has a 70% limited partnership interest in 444 West Santa Clara Street, L.P. 


• | Texas Water Alliance Limited (“TWA”), a wholly owned subsidiary of SJW Group, is undertaking activities that are necessary to develop a water supply project in Texas. On February 22, 2016, SJW Group entered into an agreement with the Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority (“GBRA”), pursuant to which SJW Group agreed to sell all of its equity interest in TWA to GBRA for $31.0 million in cash (the “TWA Agreement”). The TWA Agreement is subject to specified closing conditions, including the completion of a financing by GBRA to fund the purchase price. Please also see Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” and Note 1 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”

Together, San Jose Water Company, CLWSC and TWA are referred to as “Water Utility Services.”
SJW Land Company and its consolidated variable interest entity, 444 West Santa Clara Street, L.P., which operates commercial building rentals, are collectively referred to as “Real Estate Services.”
Regulation and Rates
San Jose Water Company’s rates, service and other matters affecting its business are subject to regulation by the California Public Utilities Commission (“CPUC”).
Generally, there are three types of rate adjustments that affect San Jose Water Company’s revenue collection: general rate adjustments, cost of capital adjustments, and offset rate adjustments. General rate adjustments are authorized in general rate case decisions, which usually authorize an initial rate adjustment followed by two annual escalation adjustments. General rate applications are normally filed and processed during the last year covered by the most recent general rate case as required by the CPUC in order to avoid any gaps in regulatory decisions on general rate adjustments.
Cost of capital adjustments are rate adjustments resulting from the CPUC’s usual tri-annual establishment of a reasonable rate of return for San Jose Water Company’s capital investments.
The purpose of an offset rate adjustment is to compensate utilities for changes in specific pre-authorized offsettable capital investments or expenses, primarily for purchased water, groundwater extraction charges, purchased power and pension. Pursuant to Section 792.5 of the California Public Utilities Code, a balancing account must be maintained for each expense item for which such revenue offsets have been authorized. The purpose of a balancing account is to track the under-collection or over-collection associated with such expense changes.
On January 5, 2015, San Jose Water Company filed General Rate Case Application No. 15-01-002 requesting authority for an increase of revenue of $34.9 million, or 12.22%, in 2016, $10 million, or 3.11%, in 2017 and $17.6 million, or 5.36%, in 2018. On June 9, 2016, the CPUC issued Decision 16-06-004 approving two partial settlements, resolving disputed issues and adopting revenue requirements for San Jose Water Company. The decision authorizes an increase of 8.6% in authorized revenue requirement effective January 1, 2016. Updated rates were implemented on June 14, 2016. Rates and revenue for 2017 and 2018 are determined based on the forecasted change in the consumer price index from the preceding year. The decision also approved the requested recovery of the net under-collected balance of $3.8 million accumulated in various balancing and memorandum accounts. This balance was previously recorded by the Company as revenue through the balancing and memorandum accounts in prior periods in accordance with San Jose Water Company’s revenue recognition policy. Since a decision was not reached by the end of 2015, the CPUC authorized San Jose Water Company to implement a surcharge to true-up the difference between interim rates for the period January 1, 2016 to the implementation date of updated rates on June 14, 2016. On June 28, 2016, San Jose Water Company filed Advice Letter 492 seeking recovery of $8.8 million which was not collected over the period January 1, 2016 through June 13, 2016 due to the delayed decision. Subsequently, under the CPUC staff’s direction, this filing was amended to include previously uncollected revenue from the prior general rate case in the amount of $524 thousand, for a total recovery of $9.291 million. San Jose Water Company’s request was approved and a surcharge of $0.1832 per centum cubic-feet (“CCF”) was implemented effective July 9, 2016 to recover this balance.
On July 30, 2015, San Jose Water Company filed Application No. 15-07-027 with the CPUC seeking the authorization to change the state of incorporation of SJW Group, the parent holding company of San Jose Water Company, from California to Delaware. On May 26, 2016, the CPUC issued Decision 16-05-037 authorizing the reincorporation.
On December 15, 2015, San Jose Water Company filed Advice Letter No. 481 with the CPUC requesting authorization to re-implement a previously existing surcharge of $0.0492 per CCF to amortize the remaining uncollected balancing account recovery authorized in General Rate Case Decision 14-08-006. In Decision No. 14-08-006 the CPUC authorized San Jose Water Company to recover the $2.6 million under-collection in various balancing accounts over a 12-month period beginning in August of 2014. However, at the end of the 12-month period $590 thousand of the originally authorized $2.6 million remained uncollected. This under-collection is due primarily to actual sales being substantially lower than the commission authorized sales estimate which was used to calculate the surcharge level. The advice letter was approved and effective on January 15, 2016.
On February 5, 2016, San Jose Water Company filed Advice Letter No. 482 with the CPUC. With this advice letter, San Jose Water Company requested authorization to recover the $7.7 million balance accumulated in the Water Conservation Memorandum Account (“WCMA”) during the period January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015.  The WCMA is used to track the revenue impact of mandatory conservation upon San Jose Water Company’s quantity revenue resulting from mandatory conservation instituted by the State of California and the SCVWD.  The requested $7.7 million recovery is the net amount of the total drought related revenue reduction calculated in the WCMA offset by the drought surcharges collected during 2015. On April 21, 2016, the CPUC passed Resolution W-5095 approving San Jose Water Company’s requested 
 4

recovery. The under-collection is being recovered via a surcharge of $0.1441 per CCF on the existing quantity rate for a period of 12 months from the date of CPUC approval.
On February 25, 2016, the CPUC passed Resolution W-5074 which affirmed San Jose Water Company’s Water Shortage Contingency Plan in Schedule 14.1 with water allocations and drought surcharges. Schedule 14.1 is the tariff that includes the drought allocations and drought surcharges for residential customers and for dedicated landscape services. San Jose Water Company originally implemented Schedule 14.1 in June 2015 in response to the Governor’s Executive Order B-29-15, and by orders of the State Water Board and the CPUC. Subsequently, with the current improved water supply outlook, the allocation and drought surcharge program was suspended effective February 1, 2017.
On February 29, 2016, San Jose Water Company filed Advice Letter No. 483 with the CPUC. This advice letter requested authorization to increase the revenue requirement by $1.7 million via a rate base offset for 2015 calendar year plant additions related to the Montevina Water Treatment Plant Upgrade Project. With this increase, the bill for a residential customer using 15 CCF per month increased by $0.46, or 0.55% per month. This requested increase was approved and became effective March 30, 2016.
On June 10, 2016, San Jose Water Company filed Advice Letter No. 490 with the CPUC requesting authorization to increase revenues by $21.4 million, or approximately 6.72%. This increase is intended to recover increased costs for purchased water and ground water production charged by the SCVWD. As directed by the CPUC’s Water Division, the revenue increase recovered via surcharges on the existing quantity rate. The request was authorized and effective on July 1, 2016.
San Jose Water Company filed Advice Letters 491 and 493 on June 24, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively, with the CPUC to revise the existing Tariff Rule 14.1 which is a water shortage contingency plan with mandatory water usage reductions and drought surcharges. The applicable tariffs were revised to reflect SCVWD conservation standard of a 20% reduction from 2013 usage levels. With these advice letters, San Jose Water Company proposed to ease the existing drought allocations and existing drought rules. San Jose Water Company’s requested changes were approved by the CPUC with an effective date of July 1, 2016. Subsequently, with the current improved water supply outlook, the allocation and drought surcharge program was suspended effective February 1, 2017.
Effective September 15, 2016, the Cupertino City Council authorized San Jose Water Company to implement a 8.6% general rate increase and a 2016 Interim Rate True-Up Surcharge of $0.1832 per CCF to be collected over a 12-month period from customers in the Cupertino leased water system San Jose Water Company operates. The new rates match those previously approved by the CPUC in San Jose Water Company’s most recent General Rate Case Decision effective January 1, 2016. 
On November 15, 2016, San Jose Water Company filed Advice Letter No. 498 with the CPUC requesting a revenue increase of $13.2 million, or 3.8%, for the 2017 escalation year.  This request was approved and the new rates became effective on January 1, 2017. 
On January 6, 2017, San Jose Water Company filed Advice Letter No. 501 with the CPUC requesting authorization to implement a sales reconciliation mechanism to conform water forecasts authorized in the last general rate case to recorded consumption for the period of October 2015 through September 2016. The CPUC has ordered all Class A and B water utilities that have a five percent or greater divergence between authorized and actual sale during declared drought years to request a sales reconciliation mechanism to conform water forecasts authorized in the last general rate case to recorded consumption. If the CPUC authorizes this request, the resulting monthly bill for a typical residential customer using 15 CCF per month will increase by $3.66, or 3.65%. If approved, the requested rate increase would be effective around March 15, 2017.
San Jose Water Company filed Advice Letter No. 505 on January 27, 2017 with the CPUC to suspend its allocation program and all drought surcharges in Schedule 14.1, Water Shortage Contingency Plan with Staged Mandatory Reductions and Drought Surcharges.  However, Schedule 14.1, and all of the water use restrictions defined therein, will remain in effect in light of the call for continued conservation by the SCVWD and the State Water Resources Control Board.  The allocations and drought surcharges were suspended effective February 1, 2017. 
On February 17, 2017, San Jose Water Company filed Advice Letter No. 506 with the CPUC requesting authorization to increase its revenue requirement by $5.3 million via a rate base offset for calendar year 2016 plant additions related to the Montevina Water Treatment Plant upgrade project. If approved, the bill for a residential customer using 15 CCF per month will increase by $1.52, or 1.5% per month. San Jose Water Company has requested that the rate increase become effective on or about March 18, 2017.
Effective September 1, 2014, CLWSC became subject to the economic regulation of the Public Utilities Commission of Texas (“PUCT”). Prior to that time, CLWSC was subject to economic regulation by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (“TCEQ”). Both the PUCT and TCEQ authorize rate increases after the filing of an Application for a Rate/Tariff 
 5

Change. Rate cases may be filed as they become necessary, provided there is no current rate case outstanding. Further, rate cases may not be filed more frequently than once every 12 months.
On September 16, 2015, CLWSC filed an application with the PUCT requesting approval of the reincorporation of SJW Group from a California corporation to a Delaware corporation. A decision was issued on March 24, 2016 approving the reincorporation.

Financial Information about Industry Segments
See Note 12 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for information regarding SJW Group’s business segments.
Description of Business
General
The principal business of Water Utility Services consists of the production, purchase, storage, purification, distribution, wholesale, and retail sale of water. San Jose Water Company provides water services to approximately 229,000 connections that serve customers in portions of the cities of San Jose and Cupertino and in the cities of Campbell, Monte Sereno, Saratoga and the Town of Los Gatos, and adjacent unincorporated territories, all in the County of Santa Clara in the State of California. San Jose Water Company distributes water to customers in accordance with accepted water utility methods. CLWSC provides water service to approximately 13,000 connections that serve approximately 39,000 people in a service area comprising more than 244 square miles in the growing region between San Antonio and Austin, Texas. TWA has water lease arrangements with certain landowners in Gonzales County, Texas. In January of 2013, TWA’s groundwater production and transportation permits were approved by the groundwater district in Gonzales County. On February 22, 2016, SJW Group entered into an agreement with GBRA, pursuant to which SJW Group agreed to sell all of its equity interest in TWA to GBRA. The agreement is subject to specified closing conditions, including the completion of a financing by GBRA to fund the purchase price. SJW Land Company owns commercial properties, several undeveloped real estate properties, and warehouse properties in the states of California and Tennessee and holds a 70% limited partnership interest in 444 West Santa Clara Street, L.P. 
San Jose Water Company also provides non-tariffed services under agreements with municipalities and other utilities. These non-tariffed services include water system operations, maintenance agreements and antenna site leases.
In October 1997, San Jose Water Company commenced operation of the City of Cupertino municipal water system under the terms of a 25-year lease. The system is adjacent to the San Jose Water Company service area and has approximately 4,600 service connections. Under the terms of the lease, San Jose Water Company paid an upfront $6.8 million concession fee to the City of Cupertino that is amortized over the contract term. San Jose Water Company assumed responsibility for all maintenance and operating costs, while receiving all payments for water service.
Among other things, operating results from the water business fluctuate according to the demand for water, which is often influenced by seasonal conditions, such as impact of drought, summer temperatures or the amount and timing of precipitation in Water Utility Services’ service areas. Revenue, production expenses and income are affected by changes in water sales and the availability of surface water supply. Overhead costs, such as payroll and benefits, depreciation, interest on long-term debt, and property taxes, remain fairly constant despite variations in the amount of water sold. As a result, earnings are highest in the higher demand, warm summer months and lowest in the lower demand, cool winter months.
Water Supply
San Jose Water Company’s water supply consists of groundwater from wells, surface water from watershed run-off and diversion, reclaimed water, and imported water purchased from the SCVWD under the terms of a master contract with SCVWD expiring in 2051. Purchased water provides approximately 40% to 50% of San Jose Water Company’s annual production. San Jose Water Company pumps approximately 40% to 50% of its water supply from the underground basin and pays a groundwater extraction charge to SCVWD. Surface supply, which during a year of normal rainfall satisfies about 6% to 8% of San Jose Water Company’s annual needs, provides approximately 1% of its water supply in a dry year and approximately 14% in a wet year. In dry years, the decrease in water from surface run-off and diversion and the corresponding increase in purchased and pumped water, increases production expenses substantially.
The pumps and motors at San Jose Water Company’s groundwater production facilities are propelled by electric power. San Jose Water Company has installed standby power generators at 33 of its strategic water production sites. In addition, the commercial office and operations control centers are outfitted with standby power equipment that allow critical distribution and customer service operations to continue during a power outage. SCVWD has informed San Jose Water Company that its filter plants, which deliver purchased water to San Jose Water Company, are also equipped with standby generators. In the event of a 
 6

power outage, San Jose Water Company believes it will be able to prevent an interruption of service to customers for a limited period by pumping water with its standby generators and by using purchased water from SCVWD.
In 2016, the level of water in the Santa Clara Valley groundwater basin, which is managed by the SCVWD, experienced an increase due to: (1) a reduction in groundwater pumping by various water retailers in the region, and (2) a substantial increase in groundwater recharge efforts on the part of the SCVWD. As reported by the SCVWD at the end of 2016, groundwater level in the Santa Clara Plain was 19 feet higher compared to the same time in 2015, and 19 feet higher than the five-year average. The total groundwater storage at the end of 2016 was within the lower range of Stage 1 (Normal) of the SCVWD’s Water Shortage Contingency Plan. On January 19, 2017, SCVWD’s 10 reservoirs were 71.2% full with 120,269 acre-feet of water in storage. As of December 31, 2016, San Jose Water Company’s Lake Elsman contained 6,153 acre-feet or approximately 485.7% of the five-year seasonal average. In addition, the rainfall at San Jose Water Company’s Lake Elsman was measured at 23.55 inches for the period from July 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016, which is 171.3% of the five-year average. Local surface water is a less costly source of water than groundwater or purchased water and its availability significantly impacts San Jose Water Company’s results of operations. The Montevina Water Treatment Plant is undergoing a large scale retrofit project. The resulting shutdown impacts the use of local run-off and surface water storage at Lake Elsman, thereby significantly restricting our use of Lake Elsman water. San Jose Water Company believes that its various sources of water supply will be sufficient to meet customer demand in 2017 after consideration of the retrofit project and implemented water restrictions and conservation activities in response to the recent drought.
In response to recent drought conditions in California, on November 13, 2015, Governor Edmund Brown Jr. issued Executive Order B-36-15 to bolster the state’s drought response. On November 24, 2015, the SCVWD extended their call for 30% conservation and restrictions on outdoor watering of ornamental landscapes two days a week through June 30, 2016. On February 2, 2016, the State Water Board adopted an extended and revised emergency regulation to ensure that urban water conservation continues through October 2016. On May 9, 2016, Governor Brown issued Executive Order B-37-16 to build on temporary statewide emergency water restrictions and to establish longer term water conservation measures, including permanent monthly water use reporting, new permanent water use standards in California communities and bans on clearly wasteful practices. On May 18, 2016, the State Water Board adopted a new approach to water conservation regulation and replaced its prior percentage reduction-based water conservation standard with a new approach designed to ensure at least a three year supply of available water based on local conditions. On June 14, 2016, the SCVWD reduced its conservation target from 30% to 20% and also increased the number of outdoor watering days from two to three effective July 1, 2016 through January 31, 2017. On January 24, 2017, the SCVWD maintained their call for 20% conservation and restrictions on outdoor watering for ornamental landscapes to no more than three days a week effective February 1, 2017.
Effective June 15, 2015, San Jose Water Company was authorized by the CPUC to activate Stage 3 of Tariff Rule 14.1 which is a water shortage contingency plan with mandatory water usage reductions and drought surcharges resulting from usage above customer allocations. Tariff Rule 14.1 focuses primarily on restrictions of outdoor water use which accounts for 50% of a typical customer’s water usage. On June 24, 2016, San Jose Water Company filed with the CPUC to amend its water shortage contingency plan with mandatory water usage reductions and drought surcharges to reflect the SCVWD’s changes. This request was approved by the CPUC with an effective date of July 1, 2016. The drought surcharges are not recorded as revenue. Rather, they are recorded in a regulatory liability account which has been authorized by the CPUC to track lost revenues from conservation. The amount recorded in the surcharge account is being used to offset future rate increases that would otherwise be necessary to recover lost revenue due to drought conservation efforts. As of December 31, 2016, San Jose Water Company has a remaining balance of approximately $7.7 million in the drought surcharge account to offset future rate increases related to drought conservation efforts. In light of the improved water supply outlook, San Jose Water Company filed Advice Letter 505 with the CPUC to suspend its allocation program and all drought surcharges in Schedule 14.1, Water Shortage Contingency Plan with Staged Mandatory Reductions and Drought Surcharges.  However, Schedule 14.1, and all of the water use restrictions defined therein, will remain in effect in light of the call for continued conservation by the SCVWD and the State Water Resources Control Board.  The allocations and drought surcharges were suspended effective February 1, 2017. San Jose Water Company is continually working to remain in compliance with the various drought rules and regulations and is also working with local governments as well as the SCVWD to communicate consistent messages to the public about use restrictions and related matters associated with the recent drought. 
California also faces long-term water supply challenges. San Jose Water Company actively works with SCVWD to meet the challenges by continuing to educate customers on responsible water use practices and conducting long-range water supply planning.
CLWSC’s water supply consists of groundwater from wells and purchased treated and raw water from the GBRA. CLWSC has long-term agreements with the GBRA, which expire in 2037, 2040, 2044 and 2050. The agreements, which are take-or-pay contracts, provide CLWSC with an aggregate of 6,900 acre-feet of water per year from Canyon Lake at prices that may be adjusted periodically by GBRA.

Franchises
Franchises granted by local jurisdictions permit Water Utility Services to construct, maintain, and operate a water distribution system within the streets and other public properties of a given jurisdiction. San Jose Water Company holds the necessary franchises to provide water in portions of the cities of San Jose and Cupertino and in the cities of Campbell, Monte Sereno and Saratoga, the Town of Los Gatos and the unincorporated areas of Santa Clara County. None of the franchises have a termination date, other than the franchise for the unincorporated areas of Santa Clara County, which terminates in 2020.
CLWSC holds the franchises for water and wastewater services to the City of Bulverde and the City of Spring Branch, which terminates in 2029 and 2036, respectively. The unincorporated areas that CLWSC serves in Comal and Blanco Counties do not require water service providers to obtain franchises.
Seasonal Factors
Water sales are seasonal in nature and influenced by weather conditions. The timing of precipitation and climatic conditions can cause seasonal water consumption by customers to vary significantly. Demand for water is generally lower during the cooler and rainy winter months. Demand increases in the spring when the temperature rises and rain diminishes.
Competition
San Jose Water Company and CLWSC are public utilities regulated by the CPUC and PUCT, respectively, and operate within a service area approved by the regulators. The statutory laws provide that no other investor-owned public utility may operate in the public utilities’ service areas without first obtaining from the regulator a certificate of public convenience and necessity. Past experience shows such a certificate will be issued only after demonstrating that service in such area is inadequate.
California law also provides that whenever a public agency constructs facilities to extend utility service to the service area of a privately-owned public utility, like San Jose Water Company, such an act constitutes the taking of property and is conditioned upon payment of just compensation to the private utility.
Under the California law, municipalities, water districts and other public agencies have been authorized to engage in the ownership and operation of water systems. Such agencies are empowered to condemn properties operated by privately-owned public utilities upon payment of just compensation and are further authorized to issue bonds (including revenue bonds) for the purpose of acquiring or constructing water systems. To the Company’s knowledge, no municipality, water district or other public agency has pending any proceeding to condemn any part of its water systems.
Environmental Matters
Water Utility Services’ produces potable water in accordance with all applicable county, state and federal environmental rules and regulations. Additionally, public utilities are subject to environmental regulation by various other state and local governmental authorities.
Water Utility Services is currently in compliance with all of the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s (the “EPA”) surface water treatment performance standards, drinking water standards for disinfection by-products and primary maximum contaminant levels. These standards have been adopted and are enforced by the California State Water Board, Division of Drinking Water and the TCEQ for San Jose Water Company and CLWSC, respectively.
Other state and local environmental regulations apply to our Water Utility Services’ operations and facilities. These regulations relate primarily to the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials and discharges to the environment. In 2008, as part of routine replacement of infrastructure, San Jose Water Company identified legacy equipment containing elemental mercury which was released into the surrounding soil. San Jose Water Company has determined the release posed no risk of contamination to the water supply, notified the appropriate authorities and remediated the affected area. San Jose Water Company also identified 10 other potentially affected sites. Seven of these sites have been remediated and San Jose Water Company is continuing its assessment of the remaining sites in conjunction with its infrastructure replacement program. SJW Group believes there will be no material financial impact related to this matter. In 2016, San Jose Water Company has begun performing hazardous materials site assessments and remediation prior to the construction phase of capital projects. The site assessments are performed to remove any legacy materials and to obtain site closures from the Santa Clara County Department of Environmental Health under its Voluntary Cleanup Program.
San Jose Water Company is currently in compliance with all state and local regulations governing hazardous materials, point and non-point source discharges and the warning provisions of the California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic
