Item 1. | Business


CSP Inc. (“CSPI” or “the Company” or “we” or “our”) was incorporated in 1968 and is based in Lowell, Massachusetts. To meet the diverse requirements of our commercial, and defense customers worldwide, CSPI and its subsidiaries develop and market IT integration solutions, advanced security and managed services, purpose built network adapters, and high-performance cluster computer systems.
Segments
CSPI operates in two segments; High Performance Products ("HPP") and Technology Solutions ("TS").

HPP Segment

• | The HPP segment revenues have two distinct product lines: (i) our Multicomputer product portfolio of computing systems for digital signal processing ("DSP") applications within the defense market and (ii) our Myricom product line of network Ethernet adapters that are offered to both commercial and government customers. 


• | Our Multicomputer revenue flows from a modest number of existing high-value customers that support the deployment and maintenance of systems utilized by domestic and foreign government entities. During fiscal 2015, the Company determined to no longer design and develop new systems for the defense market and is not expected to participate in next generation of defense systems and applications. Instead, the Company will focus on servicing the existing product line. As a result, the revenue from these products as a percentage of overall Company revenue is expected to decline over time as we focus on the growth of our Myricom products and TS Segment product line. 


• | Our Myricom product portfolio derives its revenues from a line of network Ethernet adapters purchased by a wide range of customers in three specialized markets: (i) packet capture, (ii) financial transactions and (iii) the storage interconnect market. Our primary customers in the packet capture market include government agencies that want the ability to capture, inject, and analyze network traffic at line rate, and original equipment manufacturers ("OEM") selling into vendors of computer security appliances. Our customers in the financial transactions market include

HPP Segment 

Products and Services 

In the HPP segment, we design, manufacture and deliver products and services to customers that require specialized networking and signal processing.
Our DSP product line (also referred to as the "Multicomputer" product portfolio) utilizes commercially available, industry standard compliant hardware components and open source software to deliver high-performance, high density and low power consuming computer solutions to our customers. These systems incorporate tens to hundreds of processors, interconnected by a high-bandwidth network. They are specifically designed for analysis of complex signals and images in real-time or in modeling and simulations. CSPI's experience in processing density, large memory subsystems, high-bandwidth networking components, optimized signal processing libraries, and specialized algorithms facilitates use of these DSP products in the military/defense markets.
Our Ethernet adapters and solutions product line (also referred to as the “Myricom" product line) consists of high performance 10 Gigabit ("10G") Ethernet adapters and application software specialized for vertical markets. By optimizing latency, throughput and cost, these solutions address the requirements of applications in the packet capture, financial transaction, broadcast video and media markets.
Products 
Our Multicomputer product portfolio includes the 2000 SERIES VME and 3000 SERIES VXS systems. The 2000 SERIES products, with PowerPC RISC processors with AltiVec™ technology, high-speed memory and Myrinet-2000™ cluster interconnect are in deployment by customers in the aerospace, commercial and defense markets. The 3000 SERIES VXS product line, incorporating the Freescale QorIQ PowerPC processors with AltiVec technology, targets high performance DSP,

signal intelligence (“SIGINT”), radar and sonar applications in airborne, shipboard and unmanned aerial vehicle (“UAV”) platforms where space, power and cooling are at a premium. The HPP segment continues to ship existing products to its customer base and support an installed base of DSP systems.
Our Myricom product line includes10G Ethernet adapters and associated network adapter software for Linux, Windows, Mac OS X and VMware ESX that we acquired through an asset purchase on November 4, 2013. The acquired line of network 10GBASE-T adapters, marketed under the name Myricom ARC Series, continue to meet the critical requirements of performance, multi-platform compatibility, software vendor approval, and maturity required in the media and entertainment market. ARC Series adapters are a preferred choice for media editors as they have been tested and qualified for use with the Avid® MediaCentral™ Platform and similar software packages popular among media editors. Our latest generation of ARC Series adapters is based on FPGA technology and purpose built for complex and demanding applications including automated trading and network monitoring. We introduced The ARC Series with DBL™ (“DBL”) to the market during fiscal 2015. DBL offers the ultra-low latency requirements of the high frequency trading market. However, adoption of the ARC Series with DBL product line was less than expected with limited success in Windows operating system environments. As a result, we have shifted R&D resources to accelerate the introduction of our new ARC Series with Sniffer10G software (“Sniffer 10G”) which is expected to be introduced to the packet capture market during fiscal 2017. Likely customers include enterprise and government customers seeking the ability to perform thorough inspection of the network traffic to provide better detection of cyber threats enabled by 100% lossless packet capture and packet injection required for network surveillance, including lawful intercept; deep packet inspection for use by Intrusion Detection systems ("IDS"), forensic tools and denial-of-service ("DDoS") defense applications .
Royalties 
 We license the design of certain of our 2000 SERIES computer processor boards and switched interconnect technology to third parties. In exchange for licensing this technology, we receive a royalty payment for each processor board that the licensee produces that utilizes our design for these products.
