Overview
 
GeoVax Labs, Inc. (“GeoVax” or the “Company”) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing human vaccines against infectious diseases and cancer using a novel patented Modified Vaccinia Ankara-Virus Like Particle (MVA-VLP) vector vaccine platform. In this platform, MVA, a large virus capable of carrying several vaccine antigens, expresses highly effective VLP immunogens in the person being vaccinated. The platform elicits durable immune responses while providing the safety characteristics of a replication-defective vector.
 
Our current development programs are focused on preventive vaccines against Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Zika Virus, hemorrhagic fever viruses (Ebola, Sudan, Marburg, and Lassa), and malaria, as well as therapeutic vaccines for chronic Hepatitis B infections and cancers. Our most advanced vaccine program is focused on the clade B subtype of HIV prevalent in the larger commercial markets of the Americas, Western Europe, Japan and Australia; this program is currently undergoing human clinical trials.
 
Our corporate strategy is to advance and protect our vaccine platform and use its capabilities to design and develop an array of products. We aim to advance products through to human clinical testing, and to seek partnership or licensing arrangements for commercialization. We will also leverage third party resources through collaborations and partnerships for preclinical and clinical testing. Our current collaborators and partners include the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the HIV Vaccines Trial Network (HVTN), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), United States Army Research Institute of Infectious Disease (USAMRIID), Emory University, University of Georgia Research Foundation, University of Pittsburgh, Georgia State University Research Foundation, Peking University, University of Texas Medical Branch, Burnet Institute, American Gene Technologies, Inc., and Viamune, Inc.
 
We are incorporated in Delaware, and our offices and laboratory facilities are in Smyrna, Georgia (metropolitan Atlanta). 
 
Our Technology
 
Vaccines typically contain agents (antigens) that resemble disease-causing microorganisms. Traditional vaccines are often made from weakened or killed forms of the virus or from its surface proteins. Many newer vaccines use recombinant DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) technology to generate vaccine antigens in bacteria or cultured cells from specific portions of the DNA sequence of the target pathogen. The generated antigens are then purified and formulated for use in a vaccine. The most successful of these purified antigens have been non-infectious virus-like particles (VLPs) as exemplified by vaccines for hepatitis B (Merck's Recombivax® and GSK's Engerix®) and Papilloma viruses (GSK's Cervarix®, and Merck's Gardasil®). Our approach uses recombinant DNA or recombinant MVA to produce VLPs in the person being vaccinated (in vivo). In human clinical trials of our HIV vaccines, we have demonstrated that our VLPs, expressed from the cells of the person being vaccinated, are safe, yet elicit both strong and durable humoral and cellular immune response.

VLPs train the body's immune system to recognize and kill the authentic virus should it appear. VLPs also train the immune system to recognize and kill virus-infected cells to control infection and reduce the length and severity of disease. One of the biggest challenges with VLP-based vaccines is to design the vaccines in such a way that the VLPs will be recognized by the immune system in the same way as the authentic virus would be. When VLPs for enveloped viruses like HIV, Ebola, Marburg or Lassa fever are produced in vivo, they include not only the protein antigens, but also an envelope consisting of membranes from the vaccinated individual's cells. In this way, they are highly similar to the virus generated in a person's body during a natural infection. VLPs produced externally, by contrast, have no envelope; or, envelopes from the cultured cells (typically hamster or insect cells) used to produce them. We believe our technology provides distinct advantages by producing VLPs that more closely resemble the authentic virus, which in turn, allows the body's immune system to more readily recognize the virus. By producing VLPs in vivo, we also avoid potential purification issues associated with in vitro production of VLPs.

Figure 1. Electron micrographs showing the VLPs elicited by GeoVax vaccines from human cells. Note that the Ebola VLPs on the left self-assemble into the rod-like shape of the actual Ebola virus, while the HIV VLPs shown on the right take on the spherical shape of the actual HIV virus. While below the resolution of these micrographs, both types of VLPs display what we believe to be the native form of their respective viral envelope glycoproteins which we believe is key to generating an effective immune humoral response.

 
We selected MVA for use as the live viral component of our vaccines because of its well-established safety record and because of the ability of this vector to carry sufficient viral proteins to produce VLPs. MVA was originally developed as a safer smallpox vaccine for use in immune-compromised people. It was developed by attenuating the standard smallpox vaccine by making over 500 passages of the virus in chicken embryos or chicken embryo fibroblasts, which resulted in a virus with limited ability to replicate in human cells, but did not compromise the ability of MVA to grow on avian cells, which are used for manufacturing the virus. The deletions also resulted in the loss of immune evasion genes which assist the spread of wild type smallpox infections, even in the presence of human immune responses.
 
Our MVA-VLP vaccine platform affords other unique advantages:
 
Safety: Our HIV vaccines have demonstrated outstanding safety in human clinical trials. Safety for MVA, generally, has been shown in more than 120,000 subjects in Europe, including immunocompromised individuals during the initial development of MVA and more recently with the development of MVA as a safer vaccine against smallpox.
 
Durability: Our technology raises highly durable (long-lasting) vaccine responses, the most durable in the field of vectored HIV vaccines. We hypothesize that elicitation of durable vaccine responses is conferred on responding B cells by the vaccinia parent of MVA, which raises highly durable responses for smallpox.
 
Limited pre-existing immunity to vector: Following the eradication of smallpox in 1980, smallpox vaccinations subsequently ended, leaving all but those born before 1980 and selected populations (such as vaccinated laboratory workers, first responders) unvaccinated and without pre-existing immunity.
 
No need for adjuvants: MVA stimulates strong innate immune responses and does not require the use of adjuvants.
 
Thermal stability: MVA is stable in both liquid and lyophilized formats (> 6 years of storage).

Genetic stability and manufacturability: If appropriately engineered, MVA is genetically stable and can reliably be manufactured in either the established Chick Embryo Fibroblast cell substrate, or novel continuous cell lines that support scalability as well as greater process consistency and efficiency.

Our HIV/AIDS Vaccine Program
 
About HIV/AIDS. HIV/AIDS is considered by many in the scientific and medical community to be the most lethal infectious disease in the world. An estimated 37 million people are living with HIV worldwide, with approximately 2.5 million newly infected annually. Approximately 39 million people infected with HIV have died since the 1981 start of the HIV pandemic. The United States currently has an estimated 1.2 million HIV-infected individuals, with approximately 50,000 new infections per year, a number that has remained virtually the same for 20 years. Alarmingly the fastest growing demographic for acquiring an HIV infection in the US is the 13 – 24-year-old group which is expanding at roughly 10% per year and will soon become the group with the highest total number of infections.
 
There are several AIDS-causing HIV virus subtypes, or clades, that are found in different regions of the world. These clades are identified as clade A, clade B and so on. The predominant clade found in Europe, North America, parts of South America, Japan and Australia is clade B, whereas the predominant clades in Africa are clades A and C. In India, the predominant clade is clade C. Genetic differences between the clades may mean that vaccines or treatments developed against HIV of one clade may only be partially effective or ineffective against HIV of other clades. Thus, there is often a geographical focus to designing and developing HIV vaccines.
 
At present, the standard approach to treating HIV infection is to inhibit viral replication through the use of combinations of drugs. Available drugs include reverse transcriptase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, integration inhibitors and inhibitors of cell entry. However, HIV is prone to genetic changes that can produce strains that are resistant to currently approved drugs. When HIV acquires resistance to one drug within a class, it can often become resistant to the entire class, meaning that it may be impossible to re-establish control of a genetically altered strain by substituting different drugs in the same class. Furthermore, these treatments continue to have significant limitations which include toxicity, patient non-adherence to the treatment regimens and cost. Thus, over time, viruses acquire drug-resistant mutations, and many patients develop intolerance to the medications or simply give up taking the medications due to cost, inconvenience or side effects.
 
Prevention of HIV infection remains a worldwide unmet medical need, even in the United States and other first world countries where effective antiretroviral therapies are available. There is no approved HIV vaccine. Current antiretroviral therapies do not eliminate HIV infection, requiring individuals to remain on antiretroviral drugs for their entire lives. Uptake and successful long term adherence to therapy is also limited. Only 30% of those infected with HIV in the US ultimately remain in HIV care with their viral load sufficiently suppressed to prevent spread of HIV. Furthermore, the financial burden to the US taxpayer for HIV education, prevention, and treatment costs borne through multiple federal agencies is more than $20 billion annually.
 
According to the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI), the cost and complexity of new treatment advances for HIV/AIDS puts them out of reach for most people in the countries where treatment is most needed. In industrialized nations, where drugs are more readily available, side effects and increased rates of viral resistance have raised concerns about their long-term use. Vaccines are seen by many as the most promising way to end the HIV/AIDS pandemic. It is expected that vaccines, once developed, will be used universally and administered worldwide by organizations that provide healthcare services, including hospitals, medical clinics, the military, prisons and schools.

Our Preventive HIV Vaccine Program 
 
Our most clinically advanced vaccine is GOVX-B11, designed to protect against the clade B subtype of the HIV virus prevalent in the Americas, Western Europe, Japan and Australia. GOVX-B11 consists of a recombinant DNA vaccine used to prime immune responses and a recombinant MVA vaccine used to boost the primed responses. Both the DNA and MVA vaccines produce non-infectious VLPs in the cells of the vaccinated person.
 
Phase 1 and phase 2a clinical trials of GOVX-B11 have been conducted by the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN). In these trials, totaling approximately 500 participants, GOVX-B11 was tested at various doses and regimens and was extremely well tolerated. The HVTN is the largest worldwide clinical trials network dedicated to the development and testing of HIV/AIDS vaccines. Support for the HVTN comes from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the NIH. The HVTN’s HIV Vaccine Trial Units are located at leading research institutions in 27 cities on four continents. 
 
Considering prior results from the GeoVax vaccines in non-human primate studies and human trials, we believe that GOVX-B11 vaccine is ready for human efficacy trials. In January 2017 HVTN began the next human clinical trial (HVTN 114) in the path toward human efficacy trials. HVTN 114 will test the ability of late boosts to increase the antibody responses elicited by GOVX-B11. These “late boosts” will consist of the GeoVax MVA vaccine with or without a gp120 protein vaccine. HVTN 114 is being conducted by HVTN with funding from NIAID. Information from this trial will contribute to the design of additional human clinical trials testing our vaccine in the presence and absence of the gp120 proteins. During 2016, NIAID also awarded us a Staged Vaccine Development contract of up to $7.8 million for production of the DNA vaccine component of GOVX-B11 in sufficient quantities for use in future clinical trials. 
 
Clade C Preventive HIV Vaccine Program. We also are developing DNA/MVA vaccines designed for use against the clade C subtype of HIV that predominate in South Africa and India. NIAID has awarded us Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) grants in support of this effort.
 
Our HIV Immunotherapy Program
 
Finding a cure for HIV/AIDS remains an elusive goal. Current antiretroviral therapies (ART), though highly effective at suppressing HIV viral load, are unable to eliminate latent forms of HIV that are invisible to the immune system and inaccessible to antiretroviral drugs. And the long-term use of ART can lead to loss of drug effectiveness and can come with severe side effects. The lifetime medical costs of treating an HIV-infected patient in the U.S. is estimated to exceed $500,000. Therefore, any new treatment regimen that allows patients to reduce, modify, or discontinue their antiretroviral therapy can offer measurable quality of life benefits to the patient and tremendous value to the marketplace.
 
In March 2017, we entered into a collaboration with American Gene Technologies, Inc. (AGT) whereby AGT intends to conduct a Phase 1 human clinical trial with our combined technologies. The GeoVax vaccine will be used to stimulate virus-specific CD4 T cells in vivo, which will then be harvested from the patient, genetically modified ex vivo using AGT’s technology, and reinfused to the patient. The primary objectives of the trial will be to assess the safety and efficacy of the therapy, with secondary objectives to assess the immune responses as a measure of efficacy. The overall goal of the program will be to develop a functional cure for HIV infection. 
 
In a previous phase 1 clinical trial (GV-TH-01), we demonstrated that our vaccine can potently stimulate production of CD4+ T cells in HIV infected patients– the intended use of the MVA-VLP HIV vaccine in the proposed AGT study. 
 
Our Hemorrhagic Fever Vaccine Program
 
About Ebola, Sudan, Marburg and Lassa fever viruses. Ebola (EBOV, formerly designated as Zaire ebolavirus), Sudan (SUDV), and Marburg viruses (MARV) are the current most virulent species of the Filoviridae family. They can cause up to a 90% fatality rate in humans, and are epizootic in Central and West Africa with 28 outbreaks since 1976. The 2013-16 Ebola outbreak caused 28,616 cases and 11,310 deaths (40% fatal). Additional outbreaks are certain due to indigenous reservoirs of the virus (e.g. fruit bats).
 
Lassa fever virus (LASV), a member of the Arenaviridae family, also causes severe and often fatal hemorrhagic illnesses in an overlapping region with Ebola. In contrast to the unpredictable epidemics of filoviruses, LASV is endemic in West Africa with an annual incidence of >300,000 infections, resulting in 5,000-10,000 deaths. Data from a recent study suggest that the number of annual LASV cases may be much higher, reaching three million infections and 67,000 deaths, putting as many as 200 million persons at risk.

Although the timing of the next filovirus outbreak cannot be predicted, it is certain that one will occur due to multiple factors such as: the zoonotic nature of the virus, weak health systems, high population mobility, cultural beliefs and burial practices, and endemic infectious diseases such as malaria and Lassa fever that mimic early Ebola symptoms in those at natural risk; and for those not at natural risk, the risk of intentional release by a bioterrorist.
 
We believe an ideal vaccine against major filoviruses and LASV must activate both humoral and cellular arms of the immune system. It must include the induction of antibodies to slow the initial rate of infection and a cellular immune response to help clear the infection. Moreover, it must address strain variations by providing broad coverage against potential epizootic filovirus strains, and it must be safe not only in healthy individuals (e.g. travelers or health care workers), but also in immunocompromised persons (e.g., HIV infected) and those with other underlying health concerns. 
 
Despite significant progress being made with some experimental vaccines in clinical trials, none have been fully tested for both safety and efficacy. The replication competent rVSV-ZEBOV showed safety concerns in Phase 1 trials and by virtue of being replication competent could pose threats to immunocompromised individuals, such as those infected with HIV. The less advanced adeno-vectored vaccine candidates may require relatively cumbersome heterologous prime/boost regimens, for example with MVA, to elicit durable protective immunity. The use of Ad5 vectors also has been associated with concerns over increased susceptibility to HIV infection in areas with high HIV incidence. Even with rVSV-ZEBOV showing promise in the 2013-2015 epidemic, the world would benefit by being prepared with a multivalent, as well as safer vaccine, to prevent or alleviate the effects of the next epidemic. 
 
Our Vaccines. To address the unmet need for a product that can respond to future filovirus epidemics and potentially end LASV infections in West Africa, we are developing an innovative Tetravalent Vaccine (TV) utilizing our proven MVA-VLP platform. We are addressing strain variations, and induction of broad humoral and cellular response through development of 4 monovalent vaccines, which can be blended to provide broad coverage, potentially with a single dose. The MVA vector is highly safe, having originally been developed for use in immunocompromised individuals as a smallpox vaccine.
 
Our TV vaccine is expected to not only protect at-risk individuals against EBOV, SUDV, MARV, and LASV, but also potentially reduce or modify the severity of other re-emerging filovirus pathogens such as Bundibugyo, Ivory Coast, and Reston viruses, based on antigenic cross reactivity and the elicitation of T cells to the more conserved matrix proteins. Thus, the GeoVax MVA-VLP-TV approach offers a unique combination of advantages to achieve breadth and safety of a pan-filo/LASV vaccine. In addition to protecting people in Africa, it is intended to prevent the spread of disease to the US, and for preparedness against terrorist release of any of bio-threat pathogens. The initial markets for the TV vaccine are both NGOs such as the GAVI vaccine alliance and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, as well as US and foreign governments. 
 
Our initial preclinical studies in rodents and nonhuman primates for our first vaccine candidate (EBOV) have shown 100% protection against a lethal dose of Ebola virus upon a single immunization.
 
Our Zika Virus Vaccine Program
 
About Zika Virus. Zika disease is a rapidly spreading emerging infection caused by the Zika virus (ZIKV) and has been linked to an increase in microcephaly in infants and Guillain-Barre syndrome (a neurodegenerative disease) in adults. ZIKV is a member of the Flaviviridae family, which includes medically important pathogens such as dengue fever, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, tick-borne encephalitis, and West Nile viruses. ZIKV, which was first discovered in 1947 in the Zika forest of Uganda, was considered only a minor public health concern for 60 years. Recently, with its appearance and rapid spread in the Americas, it has emerged as a serious threat with pandemic potential. Symptoms of Zika infection have historically been mild. In the recent epidemic, however, an alarming association between ZIKV infection and fetal brain abnormalities including microcephaly has been observed. No approved preventive or therapeutic products are currently available to fight the Zika epidemic. Public health officials recommend avoiding exposure to ZIKV, delaying pregnancy, and following basic supportive care (fluids, rest, and acetaminophen) after infection. A vaccine is urgently needed to prevent a Zika pandemic.
 
Our Vaccine. To address the unmet need for a ZIKV vaccine, we are developing novel vaccine candidates constructed in our MVA live vector platform, which has already shown great promise in our HIV and Ebola vaccines. We believe that, unlike other vaccines in development, the GeoVax vaccine combines a highly potent, yet safe, replication deficient viral vector (MVA) to deliver novel antigens of ZIKV to develop a single-dose vaccine. MVA has an outstanding safety record, which is particularly important given the need to include women of child-bearing age and newborns among those being vaccinated. We expect these features to yield a safe and highly effective vaccine that is well suited to provide potent and durable immunity against ZIKV infection.

We are also collaborating with the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to develop a lethal challenge model in mice to test our vaccine candidates and with the University of Georgia (UGA) for additional mouse studies. We have demonstrated 100% protection in mice against a lethal challenge after a single dose vaccination. ZIKV and reagents are supplied by the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB). Working with multiple collaborators and multiple candidate vaccines, we will manage risk by providing multiple paths toward the selection of the best vaccine candidate.
 
Our Malaria Vaccine Program
 
About Malaria. Malaria is a mosquito-borne disease caused by Plasmodium parasites. Symptoms are fever, chills, sweating, vomiting and flu-like illness. If untreated, severe complications (severe anemia, cerebral malaria and organ failure) will lead to death. Over 3 billion people in 106 countries and territories live at risk of malaria infection. According to the latest estimates from the World Health Organization (WHO), 214 million new cases of malaria were recorded worldwide in 2015, resulting in 438,000 deaths. There are 1,500 cases in the US each year (travelers returning home). Children under five years of age are particularly susceptible to malaria illness, infection, and death. In 2015, malaria killed an estimated 306,000 children. Current treatments include bed net distributions, drug treatment and mosquito spraying. Malaria parasite develop resistance to drugs and insecticides. Even though vaccines have shown to be the most cost effective ways to fight and eliminate infectious diseases (Smallpox, polio, etc.), and many decades of research and development, there is no commercial malaria vaccine at the present time. Even a vaccine with efficacy of 30-50% will prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths annually. Current vaccine candidates generally consist of subunit proteins, are poorly immunogenic, based on limited number of antigens (generally 4-5 antigens), do not target multi stages of parasite life cycle, and do not induce strong durable functional antibodies and T cell responses. Therefore, identification of appropriate antigens and vaccine technologies is critical for development of an effective malaria vaccine. 
 
Our Vaccine Approach. An ideal malaria vaccine candidate should contain antigens from multiple stages of malaria life cycle, should induce functional antibodies (predominantly IgG1 and IgG3 subtypes shown to be associated with protection) and strong cell mediated immunity (e.g. Th1 biased CD4+ ad CD8+) to reduce parasitemia by clearing infected cells (liver cells or erythrocytes)). We have shown (in animal models and humans) that MVA-VLP vaccines induce a Th1 biased response with both durable functional antibodies (IgG1 and IgG3) and CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses both of which are hallmarks of an ideal malaria vaccine.
 
GeoVax has established a collaboration with the Burnet Institute, a leading infectious diseases research institute in Australia, for the development of a vaccine to prevent malaria infection. The project includes the design, construction, and characterization of multiple malaria vaccine candidates using GeoVax’s MVA-VLP vaccine platform combined with malaria Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax sequences identified by the Burnet Institute. The vaccine design, construction, and characterization will be performed at GeoVax with further characterization and immunogenicity studies in animal models conducted at Burnet Institute using their unique functional assays that provide key information on vaccine efficacy.
 
Our Hepatitis B Vaccine Program
 
About Hepatitis B Disease. Hepatitis B is a contagious liver disease caused by the Hepatitis B virus (HBV). It is transmitted person-to-person by blood, semen, or other bodily fluids. This can happen through sexual contact, needle sharing, or mother to infant transmission during birth. For some people, Hepatitis B is an acute (or short-term) illness; but for others, it can become a long-term, chronic infection that may lead to serious health issues like cirrhosis or liver cancer. The risk of chronic infection is related to age at infection. Approximately 90% of infected infants will develop chronic infections. As a child gets older, the risk decreases. Approximately 25%–50% of children infected between the ages of 1 and 5 years will develop chronic hepatitis. The risk drops to 6%–10% when a person is infected at over 5 years of age. Worldwide, most people with chronic Hepatitis B were infected at birth or during early childhood.
 
The CDC estimates that between 700,000 to 1.4 million people in the United States have chronic HBV infections, with an estimated 20,000 new infections every year. Many people are unaware that they are infected or may not show any symptoms. Therefore, they never seek the attention of medical or public health officials. Globally, chronic Hepatitis B affects more than 240 million people and contributes to nearly 686,000 deaths worldwide each year. Even though a preventive HBV vaccine is available, less than 5% of chronic HBV infections are cured.

Our Hepatitis B Vaccine Approach. There is a clear medical need to treat chronic HBV infections, which affect hundreds of millions of people around the world, many of whom die due to complications of HBV including cirrhosis and cancer. Multiple vaccines exist to protect against HBV infection, but they cannot help patients already diagnosed with the disease. Although chronic HBV can be treated with drugs, the treatments do not cure 95% of patients; they cannot induce strong neutralizing antibodies and cellular responses needed to break tolerance to HBV antigens and clear infections, but only suppress the replication of the virus. Therefore, most people who start treatments must continue with them for life. Moreover, diagnosis and treatment options are very limited in resource/low income-constrained populations, which leads to many patients succumbing within months of diagnosis. 
 
Our combination therapeutic vaccine strategy is comprised of multivalent vaccine antigens delivered by DNA and MVA-VLP in combination with the standard-of-care treatment to induce functional antibodies and CD4+, CD8+ T cell responses to clear infection and break tolerance needed toward a functional cure. Our goal is to significantly increase the current cure rate of HBV infections while reducing the duration of drug therapy, overall treatment costs, side effects, and potential drug resistance.
 
We are collaborating with Georgia State University Research Foundation (GSU) to advance the development of a therapeutic vaccine for treatment of chronic HBV infections. The project includes the design, construction, characterization and animal testing of multiple vaccine candidates using our MVA-VLP vaccine platform. Vaccine antigens include both GeoVax and GSU’s proprietary designed sequences. The vaccine design, construction, and characterization will be performed at GeoVax with further characterization and immunogenicity studies in mice conducted at GSU in collaboration with the Shenzhen Graduate School of Peking University. Unique functional assays developed by Dr. Ming Luo, Professor in the Department of Chemistry at Georgia State University, and performed at Peking University will provide key information on vaccine efficacy.
 
Our Cancer Immunotherapy Program
 
About Cancer Immunotherapy. Cancer is the second most common cause of death in the US, exceeded only by heart disease. Its global burden is expected to rise to 22 million new cases per year by 2030. Currently, there is only one FDA approved cancer vaccine, PROVENGE® (sipuleucel-T). PROVENGE® is a personalized therapy for prostate cancer patients, which prolongs survival times by about 4 months. However, the field of immune-oncology has received new momentum with the discovery and initial launch of monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) called immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Tumors hijack the body’s natural immune checkpoints by over expressing immune checkpoint ligands (proteins that bind to and activate the inhibitory activity of immune checkpoints), as a mechanism of immune resistance, especially against the T cells that are specific for tumor antigens and can kill cancer cells. ICIs block the interaction of Immune checkpoints with their ligands on tumor cells, allowing poorly functional T cells to resume proliferation, cytokine production and killing of tumor cells. 
 
Unlike conventional therapies (e.g. radiation, chemotherapy, antibody, etc.), cancer vaccines have the potential to induce responses that not only result in the control and even clearance of tumors but also establish immunological memory that can suppress and prevent tumor recurrence. Convenience, safety, and low toxicity of cancer vaccines make them invaluable tools to be included in future immunotherapy approaches for treating tumors. Currently, there are only a few vectored cancer vaccines being tested in combination with ICIs, all of which are in early clinical stages.
 
Our Immuno-Oncology Development Efforts. GeoVax has established a collaboration with Dr. Olivera Finn, a leading expert in cancer immunotherapy at the University of Pittsburgh. Dr. Finn was the first to show that many tumors express an abnormal form of cell surface-associated Mucin 1 (MUC1) protein that is recognized by the immune system as foreign. Given this, we are developing our MVA-VLP vaccine platform to deliver abnormal forms of MUC1 with the goal of raising protective anti-tumor antibodies and T cell responses in cancer patients. 
 
We are also collaborating with ViaMune, Inc., which has developed a fully synthetic MUC1 vaccine candidate (MTI). The collaboration will assess each companies’ vaccine platform, separately, and in combination, with the goal of developing a tumor MUC1 vaccine that can produce a broad spectrum of anti-tumor antibody and T cell responses. The resulting MUC1 vaccine will be combined with ICIs as a novel vaccination strategy for cancer patients with advanced MUC1+ tumors.
 
We have produced an MVA-VLP-Muc1 vaccine candidate, demonstrated VLP production by electron microscopy using MUC1 immunogold staining, and showed that the VLPs express hypo-glycosylated form of MUC1 in human cell lines. Preclinical proof of concept is being demonstrated through our collaboration with ViaMune and University of North Carolina at Charlotte, using engineered murine human MUC1 models. Depending on the outcome of the preclinical studies, we anticipate that within 2 years we will be able to file an IND with the FDA and initiate a Phase 1 trial in a limited number of cancer patients.

Support from the United States Government
 
Grants and Contracts. We have been the recipient of multiple federal grants and contracts in support of our vaccine development programs. Our most recent awards are as follows:
 
Staged Vaccine Development Contract. In August 2016, NIAID awarded us a Staged Vaccine Development contract to produce our preventive HIV vaccine for use in future clinical trials. The award includes a base contract of $199,442 for the initial twelve-month period beginning August 1, 2016 to support process development, as well as $7.6 million in additional development options that can be exercised by NIAID. Prior to the end of the initial twelve-month base period, we expect that NIAID will exercise the first development option under the contract, which would provide approximately $1.5 million in additional funding for the period August 1, 2017 to January 31, 2018 for the next stage of manufacturing
 
SBIR Grant No. 2R44AI106422-03. In April 2016, NIAID awarded us a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant entitled “Enhancing Protective Antibody Responses for a DNA/MVA HIV Vaccine.” The initial grant award was $740,456 for the first year of a two-year project period beginning April 15, 2016, with a total project budget of $1,398,615. In March 2017, NIAID awarded us $658,159 for the second year of the project period.

SBIR Grant No. 1R43AI120887-01/02. In June 2015, NIAID awarded us an SBIR grant entitled “Directed Lineage Immunizations for Eliciting Broadly Neutralizing Antibody.” The initial grant award was $299,585 for the first year of a two-year project period beginning July 1, 2015. In June 2016, NIAID awarded us $294,038 for the second year of the project period.
 
SBIR Grant No. 5R43AI106422-01-02. In July 2013, NIAID awarded us an SBIR grant entitled “Enhancing Protective Antibody Responses for a GM-CSF Adjuvanted HIV Vaccine.” The initial grant award was $276,690 for the first year of a two-year project period beginning August 1, 2013. In July 2014, the NIH awarded us $289,641 for the second year of the project period. 
 
Clinical Trial Support. All our human clinical trials to date for our preventive HIV vaccines, including the recently initiated HVTN 114 trial, have been conducted by the HVTN and funded by NIAID. This financial support has been provided by NIAID directly to the HVTN, so has not been recognized in our financial statements, and we do not know the cost of these trials.
 
Other Federal Support. We have been the recipient of additional in-kind federal support through collaborative and intramural arrangements with CDC for our Zika vaccine program, the Rocky Mountain Laboratory facility of NIAID for our hemorrhagic fever virus vaccine program, and the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) for our hemorrhagic fever virus vaccine program. This support generally has been for the conduct or support of preclinical animal studies on our behalf.
 
Regulations
 
Regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries is a significant factor in our ongoing research and development activities and in the manufacture of our products under development. Complying with these regulations involves considerable expertise, time and expense.
 
In the United States, drugs are subject to rigorous federal and state regulation. Our products are regulated under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended (FD&C Act), and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and other federal and state statutes and regulations. These laws govern, among other things, the testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of medications and medical devices. Product development and approval within this regulatory framework is difficult to predict, takes several years and involves great expense. The steps required before a human vaccine may be marketed in the United States include:
 

● | Pre-clinical laboratory tests, in vivo pre-clinical studies and formulation studies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Manufacturing and testing of the product under strict compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for human clinical testing which must become effective before human clinical trials can commence;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the submission of a Biologics License Application to the FDA, along with the required user fees;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA approval of the Biologics License Application prior to any commercial sale or shipment of the product; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Post-marketing requirements imposed by FDA.
--+--------------------------------------------

Each of these steps is described further below. Before marketing any drug or biologic for human use in the US, the product sponsor must obtain FDA approval. In addition, each manufacturing establishment must be registered with the FDA and must pass a Pre-Approval Inspection (PAI) before introducing any new drug or biological product into commercial distribution. Because GeoVax does not manufacture vaccines for human use within our own facilities, we must ensure compliance both in our own operations and in the outsourced manufacturing operations. All FDA-regulated manufacturing establishments (both domestic establishments and foreign establishments that export products to the United States) are subject to inspections by the FDA and must comply with the FDA’s Good Manufacturing Practices for products, drugs and devices.
 
FDA determines compliance with applicable statutes and regulations through documentation review, investigations, and inspections. Several enforcement mechanisms are available to FDA, ranging from a simple demand to correct a minor deficiency to mandatory recalls, closure of facilities, and even criminal charges for the most serious violations.
 
Preclinical Testing. Preclinical testing includes laboratory evaluation of chemistry and formulation, as well as cell culture and animal studies to assess the safety and potential efficacy of the product. Preclinical safety tests and certain other pivotal preclinical studies must be conducted by laboratories that comply with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP. The results of pre-clinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of the IND application and are reviewed by the FDA prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. Unless the FDA objects to an IND, the IND becomes effective 30 days following its receipt by the FDA.
 
CGMP-Compliant Manufacturing and Testing. FDA has issued, and frequently updates, extensive regulations on current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP). Any drug, biologic, or device for human use, whether commercial or investigational, must be manufactured under these regulations. CGMP regulations include a wide variety of requirements covering personnel, documentation, facilities, equipment, testing procedures, and many other aspects of manufacturing and testing. 
 
Clinical Trials. Clinical trials involve the administration of investigational drugs to volunteers or to patients under the supervision of a qualified, medically trained clinical investigator. Clinical trials are conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practices under protocols that detail the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used to monitor safety and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol and the qualifications of the investigators who plan to carry it out must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, each clinical trial must be conducted under the auspices of an independent institutional review board at the institution where the trial will be conducted. The institutional review board will consider, among other things, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects and the possible liability of the institution.
 
Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In the Phase 1 clinical trial, the initial introduction of the product into healthy human subjects, the vaccine is tested for safety (including adverse side effects) and dosage tolerance. The Phase 2 clinical trial is the proof of principal stage and involves trials in a limited patient population to determine whether the product induces the desired effect (for our vaccines this means immune responses) and to better determine optimal dosage. The continued identification of possible safety risks is also a focus. When there is evidence that the product may be effective and has an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 clinical trials, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to evaluate clinical efficacy and to test for safety within an expanded patient population. Phase 3 trials are completed using multiple clinical study sites which are geographically dispersed. The manufacturer or the FDA may suspend clinical trials at any time if either believes that the individuals participating in the trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks.
 
Biologics License Application and FDA Approval Process. The results and details of the pre-clinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA in the form of a Biologics License Application (BLA), which is equivalent to the New Drug Application (NDA) submitted by companies seeking to market new drugs. If the BLA is approved, the manufacturer may market the product in the United States. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), FDA charges user fees to applicants to offset the costs of its operations. The PDUFA user fee for a new vaccine is over $2 million, unless the applicant obtains a waiver or reduction through certain programs designed to encourage development of certain types of products.
 
Post-marketing Requirements. FDA frequently imposes post-marketing requirements as a condition of NDA or BLA approval. Common post-marketing requirements include additional clinical trials (Phase 4 trials) or observational studies. Post-marketing requirements are especially relevant to our Ebola and Marburg vaccines. We intend to pursue approval of these vaccines using the accelerated approval process, in which FDA grants approval based on performance against a criterion other than actual protection against the disease but requires the manufacturer to monitor and submit data on efficacy of the approved product. Unlike pathogens such as human papillomavirus, Ebola and Marburg are not constantly in circulation; instead, they occur in sporadic but extremely deadly outbreaks. For this reason, it would be impractical and potentially unethical to attempt to perform a traditional Phase 3 trial in which vaccinated participants are compared against unvaccinated participants to determine the efficacy of the vaccine in preventing infection with Ebola or Marburg. The accelerated approval process allows FDA to approve a new medicine based on its performance against a surrogate endpoint (in the case of Ebola or Marburg, its performance in raising immune responses). We anticipate that, as a condition of receiving accelerated approval, GeoVax would agree to monitor the real-world performance of our Ebola and Marburg vaccines.

International Approval. Whether or not the FDA has approved the drug, approval of a product by regulatory authorities in foreign countries must be obtained prior to the commencement of commercial sales of the drug in such countries. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and drug approvals vary widely from country to country, and the time required for approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
 
Other Regulations. In addition to FDA regulations, our business activities may also be regulated by the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other present and potential future federal, state or local regulations. Violations of regulatory requirements at any stage may result in various adverse consequences, including regulatory delay in approving or refusal to approve a product, enforcement actions, including withdrawal of approval, labeling restrictions, seizure of products, fines, injunctions and/or civil or criminal penalties. Any product that we develop must receive all relevant regulatory approvals or clearances before it may be marketed.
 
Manufacturing
 
We do not have the facilities or expertise to manufacture any of the clinical or commercial supplies of any of our products. To be successful, our products must be manufactured in commercial quantities in compliance with regulatory requirements and at an acceptable cost. To date, we have not commercialized any products, nor have we demonstrated that we can manufacture commercial quantities of our product candidates in accordance with regulatory requirements. If we cannot manufacture products in suitable quantities and in accordance with regulatory standards, either on our own or through contracts with third parties, it may delay clinical trials, regulatory approvals and marketing efforts for such products. Such delays could adversely affect our competitive position and our chances of achieving profitability. We cannot be sure that we can manufacture, either on our own or through contracts with third parties, such products at a cost or in quantities that are commercially viable.
 
We currently rely and intend to continue to rely on third-party contract manufacturers to produce vaccines needed for research and clinical trials. We have arrangements with third party manufacturers for the supply of our DNA and MVA vaccines for use in our planned clinical trials. These suppliers operate under the FDA’s Good Manufacturing Practices and (in the case of European manufacturers) similar regulations of the European Medicines Agency. We anticipate that these suppliers will be able to provide sufficient vaccine supplies to complete our currently planned clinical trials. Various contractors are generally available in the United States and Europe for manufacture of vaccines for clinical trial evaluation, however, it may be difficult to replace existing contractors for certain manufacturing and testing activities and costs for contracted services may increase substantially if we switch to other contractors.
 
Competition
 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive. There are many pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, public and private universities and research organizations actively engaged in the research and development of products that may be competitive with our products. There are several multinational pharmaceutical companies and large biotechnology companies currently marketing or pursuing the development of products or product candidates targeting the same indications as our product candidates. The number of companies seeking to develop products and therapies for the treatment of unmet needs in these indications is likely to increase. Some of these competitive products and therapies are based on scientific approaches that are the same as, or similar to, our approaches, and others are based on entirely different approaches.
 
Many of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products. Our competitors’ products may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any drug we may commercialize and may render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available. We expect any products that we develop and commercialize to compete based on, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third party payers.

There are currently no FDA licensed and commercialized HIV vaccines, Zika vaccines, or hemorrhagic fever virus vaccines available in the world market. We are aware of several development-stage and established enterprises, including major pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms, which are actively engaged in vaccine research and development in these areas. For hemorrhagic fever viruses, these include NewLink Genetics and Merck, Johnson & Johnson, Novavax, Profectus Biosciences, Protein Sciences, Inovio and GlaxoSmithKline. For HIV, these include Sanofi, GlaxoSmithKline, and Johnson & Johnson. Other HIV vaccines are in varying stages of research, testing and clinical trials including those supported by the NIH Vaccine Research Center, the U.S. Military, IAVI, the European Vaccine Initiative, and the South African AIDS Vaccine Initiative. For Zika, these include NewLink Genetics, Inovio, Sanofi, Merck, Butantan Institute and NIH (NIAID).
 
There are numerous FDA-approved treatments for HIV, primarily antiretroviral therapies, marketed by large pharmaceutical companies. Currently, there are no approved therapies for the eradication of HIV. We expect that major pharmaceutical companies that currently market antiretroviral therapy products or other companies that are developing HIV product candidates may seek to develop products for the eradication of HIV.
 
There are currently no commercialized vaccines to treat chronic HBV infection. Multiple vaccines exist to protect against HBV infection, but they cannot help patients already diagnosed with the disease. Although chronic HBV can be treated with drugs, the treatments do not cure 95% of patients; they cannot induce strong neutralizing antibodies and cellular responses needed to break tolerance to HBV antigens and clear infections, but only suppress the replication of the virus. 
 
There are currently no commercialized vaccines to prevent malaria infection A first generation infection-blocking malaria vaccine, RTS,S, is under regulatory review. It requires 4 doses and has been recommended by the WHO for pilot implementation studies. Since this vaccine is based on a single antigen and has modest efficacy (30-40%, depending on the age of subjects), the WHO has defined a Road Map for developing and licensing of next generation malaria vaccines. These vaccines are expected to contain multiple antigens designed to block both infection and transmission of malaria with at least a 75% efficacy rate.
 
A number of companies are developing various types of therapeutic vaccines or other immunotherapy approaches to treat cancer including Advaxis, Immune Design, Oncothyreon, Bavarian Nordic, Roche Pharmaceuticals, Merck & Co, Bristol Myers Squibb, AstraZeneca plc, and Medimmune, LLC. 
 
Our Intellectual Property
 
We will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary rights are described by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. Accordingly, we are pursuing and will continue to pursue patent protection for our proprietary technologies obtained or developed through our collaborations or developed by us alone. Our patent portfolio, described more fully below, includes applications directed to DNA and MVA based HIV vaccines, their genetic inserts expressing multiple HIV protein components, composition, structure, claim of immunization against multiple subtypes of HIV, routes of administration, safety and other related factors and methods of therapeutic and prophylactic use thereof including administration regimes. Also included are applications directed to preventive vaccines against hemorrhagic fever viruses (Ebola, Sudan, Marburg and Lassa), Zika virus and malaria, and use thereof; immuno-oncology vaccine compositions and methods of use thereof; and therapeutic vaccines against HBV and use thereof. We are the licensee of at least nine issued or allowed U.S. patents and at least fourteen issued or allowed non-U.S. patents. We are actively pursuing five U.S. provisional applications and two international patent applications as the owner of record, in addition to at least four U.S. patent applications and at least fourteen non-U.S. patent applications in five jurisdictions under license. 
 
We are the exclusive, worldwide licensee of several patents and patent applications, which we refer to as the Emory Technology, owned, licensed or otherwise controlled by Emory University for HIV or smallpox vaccines pursuant to a license agreement originally entered into on August 23, 2002 and restated on June 23, 2004 (the “Emory License”). Through the Emory License we are also a non-exclusive licensee of four issued United States patents owned by the NIH related to the ability of our MVA vector vaccine to operate as a vehicle to deliver HIV virus antigens, and to induce an immune response in humans. The four issued United States patents owned by the NIH expire in 2023. All our obligations with respect to the NIH-owned MVA patents are covered by the Emory License. The Emory License expires on the expiration date of the last to expire of the patents licensed thereunder including those that are issued on patents currently pending. We will not know the final termination date of the Emory License until such patents are issued. The Company may terminate the Emory University License upon 90 days’ written notice. The Emory License also contains standard provisions allowing Emory University to terminate upon breach of contract by the Company or upon the Company’s bankruptcy. We may only use the Emory Technology for therapeutic or prophylactic HIV or smallpox vaccines. Emory University also reserved the right to use the Emory Technology for research, educational and non-commercial clinical purposes. Due to the use of federal funds in the development of the Emory Technology, the U.S. Government has the irrevocable, royalty-free, paid-up right to practice and have practiced certain patents throughout the world, should it choose to exercise such rights.

The Emory License, among other contractual obligations, requires payments based on the following:
 
● | Milestone Payments. An aggregate of $3,450,000 is potentially due to Emory University in the future upon the achievement of clinical development and regulatory approval milestones as defined in the Emory License. To date, we have paid a nominal milestone fee upon entering Phase 2 clinical trials for our preventive HIV/AIDS vaccine.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Royalties. Upon commercialization of products covered by the Emory License, we will owe royalties to Emory University of between 5% and 7.5%, depending on annual sales volume, of net sales made directly by GeoVax. The Emory License also requires minimum annual royalty payments of $3 million in the third year following product launch, increasing annually to $12 million in the sixth year. If we sublicense a covered product to a third party, we will owe royalties to Emory University based on all cash or noncash compensation we receive from our sublicensees. Those royalties will be 19% of all sublicensing consideration we receive prior to the first commercial sale of a related product. Commencing with the first commercial sale, the royalty owed to Emory University will be 27.5% of all sublicensing consideration we receive.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Patent Reimbursements. During the term of the Emory License, we are obligated to reimburse Emory University for ongoing third party costs in connection with the filing, prosecution and maintenance of patent applications subject to the Emory License. The expense associated with these ongoing patent cost reimbursements amounted to $50,186, $113,914, and $179,958 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We are not a party to any litigation, opposition, interference, or other potentially adverse proceeding with regard to our patent positions. However, if we become involved in litigation, interference proceedings, oppositions or other intellectual property proceedings, for example as a result of an alleged infringement or a third-party alleging an earlier date of invention, we may have to spend significant amounts of money and time and, in the event of an adverse ruling, we could be subject to liability for damages, invalidation of our intellectual property and injunctive relief that could prevent us from using technologies or developing products, any of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial conditions or results of operations. In addition, any claims relating to the infringement of third-party proprietary rights, or earlier date of invention, even if not meritorious, could result in costly litigation, lengthy governmental proceedings, divert management’s attention and resources and require us to enter royalty or license agreements which are not advantageous if available at all.
 
In addition to patent protection, we also attempt to protect our proprietary products, processes and other information by relying on trade secrets and non-disclosure agreements with our employees, consultants and certain other persons who have access to such products, processes and information. Under these agreements, all inventions conceived by employees are our exclusive property. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that these agreements will afford significant protection against misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of our trade secrets and confidential information.
 
We cannot be certain that any of the current pending patent applications we have licensed, or any new patent applications we may file or license, will ever be issued in the United States or any other country. Even if issued, there can be no assurance that those patents will be sufficiently broad to prevent others from using our products or processes. Furthermore, our patents, as well as those we have licensed or may license in the future, may be held invalid or unenforceable by a court, or third parties could obtain patents that we would need to either license or to design around, which we may be unable to do. Current and future competitors may have licensed or filed patent applications or received patents, and may acquire additional patents or proprietary rights relating to products or processes competitive to ours. In addition, any claims relating to the infringement of third-party proprietary rights, or earlier date of invention, even if not meritorious, could result in costly litigation, lengthy governmental proceedings, divert management’s attention and resources and require us to enter royalty or license agreements which are not advantageous to us, if available at all.
 
Research and Development
 
Our expenditures for research and development activities were $1,970,859, $1,693,102, and $1,812,969 during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As our vaccines continue to go through the process to obtain regulatory approval, we expect our research and development costs to increase. We have not yet formulated any plans for marketing and sales of any vaccine candidate we may successfully develop. Compliance with environmental protection laws and regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position to date.

As of March 15, 2017, we had seven full-time and four part-time employees. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and we believe that our employee relations are good. 
Corporate Background
 
Our primary business is conducted by our wholly-owned subsidiary, GeoVax, Inc., which was incorporated under the laws of Georgia in June 2001. The predecessor of our parent company, GeoVax Labs, Inc. (the reporting entity) was originally incorporated in June 1988 under the laws of Illinois as Dauphin Technology, Inc. (“Dauphin”). In September 2006, Dauphin completed a merger with GeoVax, Inc. As a result of the merger, GeoVax, Inc. became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dauphin, and Dauphin changed its name to GeoVax Labs, Inc. In June 2008, the Company was reincorporated under the laws of Delaware. We currently do not conduct any business other than GeoVax, Inc.’s business of developing new products for the treatment or prevention of human diseases. Our principal offices are in Smyrna, Georgia (metropolitan Atlanta).
