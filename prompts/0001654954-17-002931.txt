  Our Products
  
 We market and distribute products that offer a healthful, natural alternative to high sugar, high calorie and nutritionally deficient beverages. Our mission is to bring integrity back to the beverage industry and that honesty applies to every drop in every bottle. Our goal is to create and deliver beverages for families that encourage improved health, while being clear about what our products contain (and what they don’t).
 AquaBall™ Naturally Flavored Water
  
 Our flagship product is AquaBall™ Naturally Flavored Water, a zero-sugar, zero-calorie, preservative-free, vitamin-enhanced, naturally flavored water drink. AquaBall™ does not contain high fructose corn syrup, artificial flavors, or artificial colors. Unlike high sugar and high calorie beverages marketed toward children, AquaBall™ is sweetened with stevia, an all-natural sweetener, allowing AquaBall™ to provide a zero-sugar, zero-calorie alternative to juice and soda for kids. The main component of the marketing vision behind the AquaBall™ brand is our licensing agreements with Disney Consumer Products, Inc. and Marvel Entertainment, allowing each AquaBall™ bottle to prominently feature various Disney and Marvel characters. Both Disney and Marvel characters have an established reputation of high retail sales of licensed products, giving each AquaBall™ the presence associated with these brands.
  
 AquaBall™ is packaged in 10-ounce bottles, and is wrapped with colorful, eye-catching labels featuring popular Disney characters and various Marvel Superheroes. AquaBall™ currently comes in fruit punch, grape, strawberry lemonade and berry frost flavors and is sold primarily in grocery and convenience stores throughout the United States. During the year ended December 31, 2016, AquaBall™ sales accounted for approximately 92% of the Company’s total revenues.
  
  Bazi®
  
 Bazi® All Natural Energy, is a liquid nutritional drink packed with eight different super fruits, including the Chinese jujube and seven other superfruits, plus 12 vitamins. The proprietary formula contains the following fruits: jujube fruit, blueberry, pomegranate, goji berry, chokeberry, raspberry, acai and sea buckthorn. Additionally, Bazi® contains 12 vitamins including vitamins A, C, E and B-complex. In August, 2011, BioEnergy Ribose was added to Bazi® enhancing the products energy delivery system. During the year ended December 31, 2016, Bazi® sales accounted for approximately 8% of the Company’s total revenues.

  Manufacturing and Distribution
  
  Manufacturing
  
 Beginning in May 2016, all production of AquaBall™ moved to Niagara Bottling, LLC (“Niagara”), pursuant to the terms and conditions of a bottling agreement executed by the Company and Niagara in October 2015 (the “Niagara Agreement”). Niagara handles all aspects of production, including the procurement of all raw materials necessary to produce AquaBall™. In accordance with the terms of the Niagara Agreement, Niagara provides us with finished goods and bills us for product as it is shipped to customers. In addition to Niagara, we work a limited number of partners to repack bottles of AquaBall™ into six-packs and our 15-pack club packages.
  
  Prior to May 2016, we utilized the service of certain third parties to supply and manufacture our products. We had co-packing agreements with 7-Up Bottling in Modesto, California, Mountain Pure in Palestine, Texas, and Adirondack Beverages in Scotia, New York to package up to 4.0 million cases of AquaBall™ Naturally Flavored Water per year.
  
  Bazi® has been, and continues to be manufactured by Arizona Packaging and Production since 2007.
  
  Retail Distribution
  
 After experiencing an increase in same store sales in those locations serviced by regional distributors, we began shifting our retail distribution strategy towards a nationwide network of regional distributors for each of our grocery, drug and convenience accounts in November 2015. Throughout 2016 and the first quarter of 2017, we signed with distributor partners in 44 states. We will continue to ship directly to certain customers for which direct to warehouse delivery is required.
 Online Sales
  
 Our e-commerce platform allows current and future consumers to purchase AquaBall™ Naturally Flavored Water and Bazi® Energy Shot through Amazon.com and http://www.drinkbazi.com, respectively. We drive traffic to relevant landing pages and micro sites through digital marketing campaigns and promotions, as well as a variety of social media marketing efforts.
 Sales and Marketing
  
 Our sales and marketing efforts are directed from our corporate offices in Irvine, California, utilizing our own staff, as well as outside resources retained to build market awareness and shelf placement of our products, including dedicated sales teams from Disney Consumer Products, Inc. and Marvel Entertainment. The Company manages key national accounts through our in-house national sales team. Our sales teams work to secure national distribution with these customers through multiple avenues including joint sales meetings with Disney and Marvel sales personnel.
  
 As noted above, in November 2015, we began building a nationwide network of direct store distributors to handle the distribution of AquaBall™ in the grocery, drug and convenience channels. With the exception of accounts requiring direct to warehouse delivery, accounts are serviced by our distribution network. Our sales team will continue to secure distribution with both national and regional accounts, while our distributor partners add to our distribution with independent grocery and convenience stores in their respective territories.
  
  Source and Availability of Raw Materials
  
 Beginning in May 2016, Niagara began handling all aspects of production of AquaBall™, including the procurement of all raw materials. Prior to May 2016, we utilized a variety of suppliers to purchase raw materials for the AquaBall™.
  
 During 2016, we relied significantly on one supplier for 100% of our purchases of certain raw materials for Bazi®. Bazi, Inc. has sourced these raw materials from this supplier since 2007 and does not anticipate any issues with the supply of these raw materials.

 We own the formulas for both AquaBall™ Naturally Flavored Water and Bazi® Energy Shot, and we believe that our purchasing requirements can be readily met from alternative sources, if necessary.
  
  Competition
  
 The industries in which we operate are highly competitive. AquaBall™ Naturally Flavored Water competes most directly with other beverages marketed directly to children. We also compete with other manufacturers of functional beverages, and with manufacturers of more traditional beverages, such as juice and soda.
  
 Our primary competition for AquaBall™ is in the estimated $2.0 billion market for products marketed directly to children, including CapriSun®, Honest Kids, Good to Grow, Tummy Ticklers, Kool-aid and others. General competition in the beverage industry includes products owned by multinational corporations with significant financial resources, including Vitamin Water, owned by Coca-Cola, and Sobe and Propel, both owned by Pepsi Co. Bazi® competitors include Steaz®, Guayaki Yerba Mate, POM Wonderful®, as well as sports and energy drinks including Gatorade®, Red Bull®, 5-Hour Energy®, RockStar®, Monster®, Powerade®, Accelerade® and All Sport®. Indirect competition for the AquaBall™ and Bazi® includes soft drinks and juice products, such as Sunny Delight® and other fruit drinks. These competitors can use their resources and scale to rapidly respond to competitive pressures and changes in consumer preferences by introducing new products, reducing prices or increasing promotional activities. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories and have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. They, therefore, have the advantage of established reputations, brand names, track records, back office and managerial support systems and other advantages that we cannot duplicate in the near future. Moreover, many competitors, by virtue of their longevity and capital resources, have established lines of distribution to which we do not have access, and are not likely to duplicate in the near term, if ever.
  
  Intellectual Property
  
 We rely on the AquaBall™ patent, AquaBall™ and Bazi® trademarks and licensing agreements to market our products and make them stand out among our competitors.
  
  Patents and Trademarks
  
 We were granted the patent for AquaBall™’s stackable, spherical drink container in 2009, via GT Beverage Company, LLC, who we purchased on March 31, 2012. In 2016, we stopped using this bottle and, instead, switched to a bottle specifically designed for us by Niagara Bottling. In 2016, we took an impairment charge on the value of the spherical drink container patent.
  
 We maintain trademark protection for AquaBall™ and have federal trademark registration for Bazi®. This trademark registration is protected for a period of ten years and then is renewable thereafter if still in use.
  
  Licensing Agreements
  
 We first entered into licensing agreements with Disney Consumer Products, Inc. and an 18-month licensing agreement with Marvel Characters, B.V. (collectively, the “Licensing Agreements”) in 2012. Each Licensing Agreement allows us to feature popular Disney and Marvel characters on AquaBall™ Naturally Flavored Water, allowing AquaBall™ to stand out among other beverages marketed towards children. Under the terms and conditions of the Licensing Agreements, we work with the Disney and Marvel teams to create colorful, eye-catching labels that surround the entire spherical shape of each AquaBall™. Once the label designs are approved, we work with Disney and Marvel to set retail calendars, rotating the placement of different AquaBall™ designs over the course of the year.

 In 2015, the Company and Disney entered into a renewed Licensing Agreement, which extended the Company’s license with Disney through March 31, 2017 (the “Disney Agreement”). The terms of the Disney Agreement entitle Disney to receive a royalty rate of 5% on sales of AquaBall™ Naturally Flavored Water adorned with Disney characters, paid quarterly, with a total guarantee of $450,870 over the period from April 1, 2015 through March 31, 2017. In addition, the Company is required to make a ‘common marketing fund’ contribution equal to 1% of sales due annually during the agreement. The Company is required to spend a total of $820,000 on advertising and promotional opportunities over the term of the Disney Agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company paid a total of $129,597 to Disney pursuant to the Disney Agreement.
  
 On August 22, 2015, the Company and Marvel entered into a renewed Licensing Agreement to extend the Company's license to feature certain Marvel characters on bottles of AquaBall™ Naturally Flavored Water through December 31, 2017. The Marvel Agreement requires the Company to pay to Marvel a 5% royalty rate on sales of AquaBall™ Naturally Flavored Water adorned with Marvel characters, paid quarterly, through December 31, 2017, with a total guarantee of $200,000. The total royalty paid to Marvel during the year ended December 31, 2016 was $100,000.
  
  Government Regulations
  
 The production, distribution and sale in the United States of our products are subject to various U.S. federal and state regulations, including but not limited to: the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, including as amended by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994; the Occupational Safety and Health Act; various environmental statutes; and a number of other federal, state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, marketing, labeling and ingredients of such products.
  
 Certain states and localities prohibit the sale of certain beverages unless a deposit or tax is charged for containers. These requirements vary by each jurisdiction. Similar legislation has been proposed in certain other states and localities, as well as by Congress. We are unable to predict whether such legislation will be enacted or what impact its enactment would have on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
  
 All of our facilities in the United States are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Although compliance with these provisions has not had any material adverse effect on our financial or competitive position, compliance with or violation of any current or future regulations and legislation could require material expenditures or have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
  
  We believe that current and reasonably foreseeable governmental regulation will have minimal impact on our business.
  
  Research and Development
  
 No expenses were recorded on research and development for the year ended December 31, 2016. We are working with certain third parties on the development of possible future products, but these projects are funded by the respective third parties. Upon execution of the Niagara Agreement in October 2015, we completed the development of an improved “clean label” formulation of AquaBall™, which remains sugar and calorie free but eliminated all preservatives, and is produced using a hot-fill process. We completed the transition of AquaBall™ to the new, preservative-free formulation and begin distribution from Niagara facilities in June 2016.
  
 During 2006, Bazi® was developed and was launched in January 2007. This product did not require FDA or other regulatory approval. During 2009, new ingredients and productions methods were researched to integrate into existing products or new products. Since 2012, Bazi® has been and is now being sold solely online in 12, 24, 36, 48 and 144 packs.
  
  Employees
  
 We had 13 full-time employees and one part-time employee as of December 31, 2016.
