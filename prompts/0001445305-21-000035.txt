Item 1. Business
Overview
Workiva simplifies complex work for thousands of organizations worldwide. We are a leading provider of cloud-based compliance and regulatory reporting solutions that are designed to solve business challenges at the intersection of data, process and people. 
Workiva changes the way enterprises manage and report business data. Our open, intelligent and intuitive platform is based on single instance, multi-tenant software applications deployed in the cloud. Our platform connects data, documents and teams, which results in improved efficiency, greater transparency and reduced risk of errors. We offer customers controlled collaboration, data linking, data integrations, granular permissions, process management and a full audit trail on our proprietary reporting and compliance platform. As of December 31, 2020, 3,723 organizations, including 75% of Fortune 500® companies, subscribed to our platform for at least one solution. 
Customers use our platform to create, review and publish data-linked documents and reports with greater control, consistency, accuracy and productivity. Customers collaborate in the same document simultaneously, which improves efficiency and version control. Our platform is flexible and scalable, so customers can easily adapt it to define, automate and change their business processes in real time. 
Our platform lets our customers connect data from Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Governance Risk and Compliance (GRC), Human Capital Management (HCM) and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems, as well as other third-party cloud and on-premise applications.
While our customers use our platform for more than 100 different use cases, we organize our sales and marketing resources into four solution groups focused on the Office of the CFO: Regulatory Reporting, Non-Regulatory Reporting, Financial Services and Integrated Risk.
We have experienced strong revenue growth since we released our first solution in March 2010. Our revenue increased from $244.3 million in 2018 to $351.6 million in 2020, representing a 20% compound annual growth rate. We incurred net losses of $50.1 million in 2018, $47.5 million in 2019 and $48.4 million in 2020. Approximately 84% of our revenue in 2020 was derived from subscription and support fees, with the remainder from professional services. 
Macro Trends
We designed our cloud-based collaboration platform to simplify complex work, supporting both remote and hybrid work environments. Four macro trends have been driving demand for Workiva's solutions: the shift to the cloud; digital transformation; increasing interest in remote and hybrid work environments; and increasing use of machine-readable data. 
Shift to the Cloud. Enterprises around the world have been shifting deployment of data management systems from on-premises to the cloud. A shift to the cloud started more than two decades ago with CRM and other front-office systems. In the last 10 years, enterprises also began adopting the cloud for managing middle- and back-office systems, owing to advantages in data security, data accessibility and total cost of operation. In its report “Forecast: Public Cloud Services, Worldwide, 2018-2024, 3Q20 Update,” Gartner estimates that worldwide end-user spending on public cloud services will grow 18.4% to a total of $304.9 billion in 2021. 
Digital Transformation. The economic benefits to enterprises of optimizing processes and transforming data to a digital environment are so compelling that the largest IT consulting firms in the world have built substantial advisory practices devoted to digital transformation. These consulting practices deliver business process reengineering, as well as technology selection and integration services. In its report “IDC FutureScape: Worldwide Digital Transformation 2021 Predictions,” IDC estimates direct, digital transformation investment will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 15.5% from 2020 to 2023 and approach a total of $6.8 trillion.
Remote and Hybrid Work Environments. To attract and retain talent in the marketplace of knowledge workers, enterprises are responding to pressure to adopt more flexible work environments. In an online survey conducted in May 2020, staffing firm Robert Half found that 60% of professionals who had transitioned to remote work said they have better work/life balance and that 74% of respondents would like to continue to telecommute more after pandemic restrictions are eased. Companies that manage a growing number of digital workplace employees are implementing collaborative technologies to streamline work processes and automate decision-making, actions and responses. 
Use of Machine-Readable Data. Regulators are demanding greater use of structured, machine-readable data in companies’ disclosures. For example, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires that public companies include “structured financial data” in filed annual and quarterly reports so that investors can automate extraction of data for analysis. The SEC implemented its structured data mandate by requiring companies to tag data in their financial statements using eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL), which is a royalty-free, international standard designed specifically for digital reporting of financial, performance, risk and compliance information. XBRL provides a unique, machine-readable tag for individual disclosures within business reports. Use of XBRL enables government agencies to automate screening and analysis of filed documents. For example, the SEC’s Division of Enforcement has integrated the analysis of XBRL data into its investigative processes. 
In 2019, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) revised its electronic filing format to incorporate structured data in XBRL. As a result, at least 200 electric utility, natural gas, oil pipeline and centralized service companies will be required to file quarterly and annual reports using XBRL in 2021.
Fifty-two countries have issued 147 mandates for XBRL, and we expect use of the standard to continue to grow. The SEC now requires foreign private issuers that prepare their financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) to include XBRL tagging in their SEC filings. In addition, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) now mandates Inline XBRL for its European Single Electronic Format (ESEF) regulation. Inline XBRL is a standard that embeds XBRL in financial statements, thus eliminating the need to file separate HTML and XBRL documents. 
Growth Vectors
We are focusing investment on five growth opportunities: international markets, global statutory reporting, integrated risk, the U.S. government and partnerships.
International Markets. We believe international growth presents an attractive opportunity because the factors that drive demand for our solutions in the United States are similar to those in other developed countries, including the need to manage complex datasets, reduce errors and risk, improve efficiency and respond to regulatory requirements.  In 2020, we generated less than 8% of our consolidated revenue from Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Asia-Pacific (APAC), and we expect these international markets to contribute an increasing percentage of total revenue. 
Global Statutory Reporting. We plan to accelerate our investments in global statutory reporting. Multinational corporations are required to report statutory financial information to the governments of many of the countries and local jurisdictions where they have entities and do business using local accounting standards. Our early go-to-market efforts have validated three important factors: demand for our solutions in this marketplace, our product fit and the lack of significant competition — all of which are contributing to encouraging sales activity. 
Integrated Risk Solutions. We plan to continue to invest in expanding our solution set in the integrated risk market. Part of the opportunity is based on requests from our customers and prospects to expand beyond Sarbanes–Oxley Act (SOX) compliance and audit management to provide a broader integrated risk platform to support general frameworks for internal controls, a wide variety of audit types, enterprise risk management and policies and procedures.
U.S. Government. Workiva is authorized as a Moderate Impact Cloud Service Provider under the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP). Our level of authorization enables us to help federal agencies connect, control and report up to 80 percent of their information types. In addition, many commercial enterprises, particularly those in regulated industries, consider FedRAMP the highest standard of security assessment, authorization and continuous monitoring for cloud software.
Partnerships. We believe that our ecosystem of partners extends our geographic reach, accelerates the usage and adoption of our platform, and enables more efficient delivery of professional services. We intend to expand and deepen our relationships with global and regional partners, including global consulting firms, systems integrators, large and mid-sized independent software vendors and implementation partners. Our advisory and service partners offer a wider range of domain and functional expertise that broadens our platform’s capabilities and promotes Workiva as part of the digital transformation projects they drive for their customers.
Workiva Solutions
We organize our sales and marketing resources into four solution groups: Regulatory Reporting, Non-Regulatory Reporting, Integrated Risk and Financial Services.
Regulatory Reporting
Changing regulations and mandates create complexity in regulatory and compliance reporting, which is often executed by teams distributed across different departments and geographies within organizations. While changes to future regulations are unpredictable, we expect demand for our platform to remain strong owing to its ability to improve transparency, accountability and insight into data.
SEC and System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval (SEDAR) Reporting. Our platform gives customers control over the entire SEC reporting process, from data collection to drafting to embedding supporting documentation to the actual filing with Inline XBRL. Our SEC reporting solution allows our customers to prepare and file all major SEC reports, such as Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and Form 8-K, as well as Form S-1 and other registration statements, proxy statements and Section 16 reports. Features tailored to the SEC reporting process include the capability to concurrently create reports in the HTML format required for filing on the SEC’s Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval (EDGAR) system and the ability to perform XBRL tagging as well as to submit SEC reports with Inline XBRL. Foreign Private Issuers can use our platform to include XBRL tagging in their 20-F and 40-F filings with the SEC. Workiva also enables customers to create earnings press releases, earnings call scripts, presentations and other investor relations materials with data linked to the corresponding filing. Canadian issuers can use our platform to draft and submit reports through SEDAR.
ESEF Reporting. We market our platform in Europe to help companies comply with the ESMA mandate to use Inline XBRL for its ESEF taxonomy. More than 5,000 European Union (EU) issuers will be required to use this taxonomy for their annual financial reports. Originally, the mandate applied to EU issuers for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2020. As part of a broader EU Recovery Prospectus responding to COVID-19, the EU is allowing member states the option to delay compliance with the ESEF mandate for one year, while still permitting voluntary filing in line with the new rules.
FERC Reporting. We market our platform to help companies comply with the FERC XBRL mandate. More than 200 utility, natural gas, oil pipeline and centralized service companies will be required to file quarterly and annual reports using XBRL in 2021.
Global Statutory Reporting. We see growing demand for our platform in the U.S. and in Europe for statutory reporting, which is a complex process for our multinational customers that are required to report statutory financial information throughout different countries and local jurisdictions where they do business. Currently, most of these enterprises rely on hundreds of legacy word-processing documents and spreadsheets with no digital audit trail. This disconnected, manual process is prone to errors and creates risk of accounting inconsistencies in reports between legal entities across jurisdictions. Without a standardized process and central oversight, companies face enormous risk and high expenses related to outsourcing to a bevy of consultants and accounting firms, which weakens control and extends review time. 
Government Regulatory Reporting. State and local governments use our platform to streamline and modernize Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports (CAFR) and budgeting. We are also expanding adoption of our platform across U.S. government agencies. With our FedRAMP authorization, we can help federal agencies connect, control and report up to 80 percent of their information types. 
Non-Regulatory Reporting
Public and private companies, government agencies and higher-education institutions must create a vast array of complex financial and managerial reports. Organizations of all sizes typically have to collect, track, manage and report on a wide range of operating metrics to drive better business outcomes. Our customers continuously find new use cases across their organizations, including Financial Planning and Analysis (FP&A), board/committee and quarterly reporting, C-Suite reporting, strategic business plans, financial statements, variance reports, monthly management reports, managing and tracking key performance indicators, data collection for domestic sales, performance reporting and employee benefit financial statements.
Integrated Risk
We sell our platform to teams that work in SOX compliance, internal audit management, enterprise risk management and policy and procedure management.
SOX Compliance. Our customers use our platform to increase efficiency in documenting, implementing and assessing internal controls over financial reporting (ICFR) as required by SOX. SOX also requires public company CEOs and CFOs to individually certify that their annual and quarterly financial reports are accurate and complete and to assess the effectiveness of their ICFR. Increased scrutiny from the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board on audits of management’s assessment of internal controls – and the transition in the framework used for assessing internal controls – is driving public companies to find more efficient and accurate solutions for SOX compliance. Our customers can collect data from multiple departments, centralize that information in a linked platform, create and track process narratives and flows with co-workers, embed evidence and directly test controls. 
Internal Audit Management. We sell to the broad-based audit market because users in that market often collaborate with colleagues working in SOX, risk and controls across an organization. Internal audit management extends throughout an organization, attracting Workiva customers from a wide range of departments. Internal audit management includes audit risk assessments, the audit planning process, workpaper management, testing, issues management and audit reports that encompass the audit committee report and the internal audit group. Workiva enables simultaneous collaboration with control and accountability and enables robust documentation, accurate audit conclusions and complete audit trails, which are essential to auditors, executives and boards. With permission controls, administrators can restrict access at all levels for each user to create, review and edit data and documents that relate directly to them. This control feature also enables users to grant access to their external auditors, which further streamlines the review process and reduces expenses. 
Enterprise Risk Management (ERM). With our platform, our customers can integrate their risk management practices throughout the organization while maintaining information privacy, audit trails and security resulting in highly efficient and transparent compliance. We also sell a solution for ERM to help enterprises identify systemic risks, determine risk probabilities, assess risk magnitude, plan strategic responses, report to boards and other stakeholders and ultimately make real-time ERM decisions.
Policy and Procedure Management. Our customers can use our platform to establish a connected, enterprise-wide policy and procedure management process. Teams can access and manage all content for policies, standards, procedures and guidelines for the entire enterprise in our platform, and they can efficiently manage ongoing policy review cycles throughout the year. Customers can map policies directly to risks, controls, processes and regulations and create a consistent template-driven format or taxonomy for all policies. Customers can also distribute and track employee attestation of policies and procedures with automated certification reminders and progress dashboards. 
Financial Services.
We market our platform to address regulatory compliance risk and enterprise risk at banks, insurance companies and other financial services companies. Examples of regulations facing our customers include the Dodd-Frank Act, Basel III, Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR), Capital Requirements Directive (CRD), Resolution and Recovery Plans (RRP), Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), and Dodd-Frank Stress Testing (DFAST). We also help investment management companies streamline industry-specific compliance and capital markets transactions.
We also market our platform to help organizations comply with the European Banking Authority’s Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP), which requires institutions to report on their Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) and the Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process (ILAAP). In addition, our platform helps financial services firms in the UK comply with regulations from The Financial Conduct Authority, which requires reporting under the Client Asset Sourcebook (CASS) rules for registered firms who hold or control client money or custody assets.
Workiva Platform
The Workiva platform is single instance, multi-tenant software deployed in the cloud. Our platform, built on Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform, is composed of both proprietary and open-source technologies. Customers can access Workiva solutions with any standard web browser. 
We believe the following characteristics highlight our platform’s key competitive advantages:
Features and Functionality. With our platform’s data-linking capabilities, every change is automatically updated in all linked instances—including narrative and numbers—throughout spreadsheets, word-processing documents, charts and graphs, presentation decks and dashboards in our platform. Linking enables data consistency and ensures that collaborators are working with the most current data. 
Our platform's detailed audit trail provides accountability and transparency by tracking every change made by every user over time. A complete record of data provenance and all changes helps our customers mitigate risk, gain insights and make better, data-driven decisions.
 With permission controls in our platform, administrators can manage access at all levels so each user can create, review and edit data and documents. This control feature also enables users to grant access to their external auditors, outside counsel and other consultants, which further streamlines the review process and reduces expenses. 
Our platform also allows customers to connect data from ERP, GRC, HCM and CRM systems, as well as other third-party cloud and on-premise applications. Once the data is connected in the Workiva platform, users can automate data and workflow updates, track every change and seamlessly collaborate with colleagues to create trusted reports and regulatory filings.
Easy to Deploy and Configure. The Workiva platform can be deployed within days or weeks for new customers and can be easily configured by the customer for individual employees or entire teams. Because our solutions are browser-based, customers avoid costly, time-intensive deployments typically associated with on-premise enterprise software.
High Performance. The architecture, design, deployment and management of our solutions provide enterprise-grade scalability, availability and security. The performance of the Workiva platform has been tested and proven by some of the largest, most demanding enterprises in the world. 
Continuous Improvement. Frequent collaboration with customers and development iteration allow us to make continuous improvements by releasing a new version of our platform several times each week. 
Scales Rapidly. The Workiva platform is designed to support millions of end users as a result of its scalability and our relationship with Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform. A number of our customers have reported millions of links to single sources of data, among multiple documents, spreadsheets and presentations, without any discernible negative effects on performance. 
Secure. Many of the largest enterprises in the world trust us with their most sensitive data. We employ stringent data security, reliability, integrity and privacy practices. In addition to our regular customer security assessments, we engage in continuous and ongoing penetration and vulnerability testing (manual and automatic, internal and third-party) and adhere to standards established by third parties such as FedRAMP. We also engage third-party auditors to evaluate our controls against the SOC1 and SOC2 compliance frameworks.
Recent Platform Milestones
In September 2019, we launched new functionality that enables customers to connect data from ERP, GRC, HCM and CRM systems, as well as other third-party on-premise and cloud applications. Automating these processes enables our customers' reporting teams to connect data from source systems directly to end reports, including SEC filings and board presentations, thereby creating repeatable processes that improve their ability to prepare prompt, accurate and reliable reports.
In 2020, we used platform capabilities to unlock geographical and industry-specific XBRL mandates for European Single Electronic Format (ESEF) and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) reporting. The ESEF tagging capabilities use machine learning to power search recommendations for taxonomy concepts in annual reports. Machine learning also powers new language translation capabilities integrated into the platform for digital review and commenting to assist a growing number of global teams adopting the platform for global statutory reporting.
As of December 31, 2020, we upgraded substantially all of our customers to our new platform, which is faster and more scalable with dozens of new capabilities, including improved real-time collaboration, new data importers and exporters, multi-monitor support, drag and drop capabilities, better charts, Workspaces for teams, additional languages and currencies, an improved filing wizard and additional ways to link data.
Research and Development
Our research and development team is distributed among several office locations in North America and Europe. Our research and development efforts are focused on building functionality, adding features, supporting scalability, and maintaining stability of our platform. Listening to our customers and creating solutions to meet their needs drives innovation at Workiva. We employ Agile software development methods that place customers at the heart of the design process. This approach demands continuous collaboration and iteration that deliver new software functionality at a fast pace. 
Customers
Thousands of organizations, including global enterprises with hundreds of thousands of employees, trust Workiva. As of December 31, 2020, we had more than 3,700 customers, including 75% of Fortune 500 companies who use our platform for at least one solution. Our customers are passionate, loyal supporters of our solutions, as demonstrated by our subscription and support revenue retention rate of 95.0% as of the December 2020 measurement date. Our subscription and support revenue retention rate including add-on solutions was 109.5% as of December 31, 2020.
Competition
The intensity and nature of our competition vary significantly across our different solutions, as changes in regulation and market trends result in evolving customer requirements and demand for enterprise software. Our primary competitors include: 
•Status quo, manual business processes that rely on legacy software productivity tools;
•Diversified enterprise software providers;
•Niche software providers that provide point solutions;
•Providers of professional services, including consultants and financial printers;
•Governance, risk and compliance software providers; and
•Business intelligence / performance management software providers.
As our markets expand, we expect to compete with more highly specialized software vendors, as well as larger vendors that may continue to acquire or bundle their products more effectively. 
The principal competitive factors in our market include: product features, reliability, performance and effectiveness; product line breadth, diversity and applicability; product extensibility and ability to integrate with other technology infrastructures; price and total cost of ownership; adherence to industry standards and certifications; strength of sales and marketing efforts; and brand awareness and reputation. We believe that our cloud-based platform has the combination of features and value to our customers that will continue to allow us to compete effectively. 
Sales and Marketing
Our “land-and-expand” sales strategy focuses on acquiring new customers and selling additional solutions to existing customers. We believe that we have penetrated only a small fraction of our market opportunity. We intend to continue investing in sales and marketing to drive growth in the U.S., Canada, Europe and parts of the Asia-Pacific region.

Our sales organization employs a combination of field sales, inside sales and partnership channels. 
Our sales organization comprises sales development representatives, pre-sales engineers and account managers. Our sales development representatives qualify sales-accepted opportunities for our account managers. Our pre-sales engineers focus on solutions and custom product demonstrations and consultative sales. Our account managers work to attract new customers as well as expand our platform into new use cases and departments across our current customers’ organizations. 
Our customer success and professional services teams also help our account managers build our existing customer relationships by providing advice and best practices that enable users to harness the full power of our platform.
We plan to continue strengthening our sales coverage in our current markets, as well as expand our sales footprint in locations where we see a demand for our solutions. To achieve this growth, we plan to continue hiring motivated sales people with experience in enterprise software sales and in specific geographical regions. We believe that our approach to hiring sales people, along with a progressive training, culture and compensation package will allow us to retain sales talent and continue to drive growth.
In 2020, we continued to expand our ecosystem of partners, including global consulting firms, systems integration and technology firms, and leading regional consulting firms. Our highly skilled advisory and implementation partners offer a wide range of subject-matter expertise that broadens our platform’s capabilities and promotes Workiva as part of the digital transformation projects they implement for their customers. Our technology partners enable powerful data and process integrations that enable our customers to connect their existing ecosystem of solutions directly to our platform. Our partners help to extend our customer reach through marketing and promotion and help accelerate the sale and delivery of our platform.

Our marketing organization promotes our brand, generates demand for our offerings, and researches and assesses product and market needs. Our advance planning team assesses customer needs, conducts industry-based research and identifies new markets. Our product marketing team develops the go-to-market strategy for Workiva solutions and manages pricing and licensing strategies. The product marketing team also supports our sales team with playbooks that include profiles of typical buyers, key messages, value propositions, competitive analysis and sales strategies. 
Our demand generation programs are categorized by technology solution and industry and are focused on engaging business leaders, process owners and technology teams. We use a variety of marketing programs across traditional and social channels to target current and prospective customers. Our marketing team hosts virtual and in-person events to educate prospects and customers and generate demand for our solutions. 
Customer Success and Professional Services
Our customer success and professional services teams help our account managers build relationships with customers by providing advice that enables them to harness the full power of our platform. 
Customer Success. Our customer success team partners with users of our platform to understand their business objectives and offers best practices in the use of our software. We deliver 24/7 live customer support via phone, digital messaging and web-based conferencing. We provide intensive training to our customer success team and segment them for each solution and market focus.
Professional Services. Our professional services include initial setup of documents; XBRL mapping, tagging and review; best practices implementation; and business process consulting. Our XBRL team of accounting and financial reporting professionals provide XBRL mapping, tagging and review services to our customers. We also employ a team of consultants who offer services to customers to improve and streamline their Workiva-related data processes. 
We pay for employees to maintain professional certifications and licenses that are important to our customers, and we host regular company-wide employee education sessions on business, industry, technology and workplace topics.
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property and proprietary rights are important to our business. To safeguard these rights, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and contractual protections in the United States and other jurisdictions.
As of December 31, 2020, we had 54 issued patents and 13 patent applications pending in the United States relating to our platform. We cannot assure you that any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or whether the examination process will require us to narrow or otherwise limit our claims. Any patents issued may be contested, designed around, found unenforceable, or invalidated, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing them. We also license software from third parties for integration into our solutions, including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms. We cannot assure you that such third parties will maintain such software or continue to make it available.
We control access to and use of our proprietary software and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, end-customers, and partners, and our software is protected by U.S. and international copyright laws. Despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets and proprietary rights through intellectual property rights, licenses, and confidentiality agreements, unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software and technology. In addition, we intend to expand our international operations, and effective patent, copyright, trademark, and trade-secret protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries.
If we continue to be successful, we believe that competitors will be more likely to try to develop solutions and services that are similar to ours and that may infringe our proprietary rights. It may also be more likely that competitors or other third parties will claim that our platform infringes their proprietary rights.
Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. In particular, leading companies in the enterprise software industry have extensive patent portfolios and are regularly involved in both offensive and defensive litigation. From time to time, third parties, including certain of these leading companies, may assert claims of infringement, misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights against us, and our standard license and other agreements obligate us to indemnify our customers against such claims. Successful claims of infringement by a third party could prevent us from distributing certain solutions or performing certain services, require us to expend time and money to develop non-infringing solutions, or force us to pay substantial damages (including enhanced damages if we are found to have willfully infringed patents or copyrights), royalties or other fees. In addition, to the extent that we gain greater visibility and market exposure as a public company, we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims from third parties. We cannot assure you that we do not currently infringe, or that we will not in the future infringe, upon any third-party patents, copyrights or other proprietary rights.    
We have registered a number of trademarks and logos, including “Workiva,” “Wdesk” and “Wdata” with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in several jurisdictions outside the United States. We have also registered other trademarks in the United States and in other jurisdictions outside the United States. In addition, we intend to expand our international operations, and we cannot assure you that these names will be available for use in all such jurisdictions.
Litigation
From time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings or be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we currently believe that the final outcome of any currently pending legal proceedings to which we are a party will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition or cash flows. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.
Government Regulations
We believe that our businesses and operations are in substantial compliance with all applicable government laws and regulations. Any additional measures to maintain compliance are not expected to materially affect our capital expenditures, competitive position, financial position or results of operations. Various legislative and administrative regulations applicable to us have become effective or are under consideration in many parts of the world. To date, such developments have not had a substantial adverse impact on our revenues, earnings or cash flows. However, if new or amended laws or regulations impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our business, our capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position could be negatively impacted. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for further information.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2020, Workiva employed 1,718 full-time people worldwide. Our headcount as of December 31, 2020 increased 8.7% from 1,580 full-time employees as of December 31, 2019. None of our U.S. employees is represented by a labor organization or is a party to any collective bargaining arrangement. We have never experienced a strike or similar work stoppage, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, employee compensation and benefits accounted for approximately 83% of our total operating expense.
Diversity, equity and inclusion are core values at Workiva. We strive to create a workplace where everyone is comfortable bringing their best, authentic self to work every day. 
We foster a work environment that encourages fairness, teamwork, and respect among all employees. We value all backgrounds, beliefs, and interests, and we recognize this diversity as an important source of our innovation and success. We believe that our culture of diversity, equity and inclusion increases employee engagement, empowerment and satisfaction. As of December 31, 2020, women represented 37% of our global workforce and 29% of our leadership (director and above). As of December 31, 2020, 15% of our U.S. employees and 11% of our U.S. leadership (director and above) were racially or ethnically diverse. Increasing diversity in our workforce and key operational leadership roles will remain an organizational priority. Current key initiatives include Employee Resource Groups (ERG), learning and development and talent acquisition. The Company maintains its ERG chapters globally across seven categories: Ethnic diversity, LGBTQ+, Veterans, Women in Technology, Women in Sales, Parents and Caregivers, and Employees who work remotely. Each ERG is sponsored and supported by senior leaders across the enterprise.
The health and safety of our colleagues and anyone who enters our workplace around the world is of paramount importance to Workiva. In response to the global pandemic of respiratory disease (abbreviated “COVID-19”), we initially closed all of our offices. Although we commenced reopening our offices in the latter half of 2020 with reduced capacity due to local business necessities, differences in laws, culture and employee needs, we have since closed most of our offices again. For those offices that have remained open, we have advised all employees that working from home is the safest course of 
action. Additionally, in order to maximize the health and safety of our workforce, we added weekly communication from senior leaders regarding the impacts of COVID-19 on the workforce and the Company and work from home flexibility, while initiating new protocols across all offices under the direction of our COVID-19 task force.
