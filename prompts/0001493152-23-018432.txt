Item 1. | Business.
--------+----------

Overview
 
We are a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on March 31, 2021. We were formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, or the initial business combination. We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act) and, as such, we are subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies.
 
As of December 31, 2022, we had not commenced any operations. All activity for the period from March 31, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2022 relates to our formation, initial public offering (“IPO”), operating costs, and expenses related to finding a business combination target as further described below. We will not generate any operating revenues until after the consummation of our initial business combination, at the earliest. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents from the proceeds derived from the IPO. We have selected December 31 as our fiscal year end.
 
Initial Public Offering
 
On December 23, 2021, we consummated our initial IPO of 11,500,000 units, including 1,500,000 units issued pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option. Each unit consists of one share of Class A capital stock, par value $0.0001 and one right, with each right entitling the holder to receive one-eighth (1/8) of one share of Class A common stock. The units were sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $115.0 million.
 
Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, we consummated the sale of 400,000 units at a price of $10.00 per unit in a private placement to our Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of $4.0 million. In connection with the consummation of the IPO, we issued to the representative and/or its designees 115,000 representative’s shares.
 
Upon the closing of the IPO and the private placement, $116.15 million ($10.10 per unit) of the net proceeds of the IPO and certain of the proceeds from the private placement were placed in a trust account located in the United States with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, which will be invested only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, as determined by us, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a business combination and (ii) the distribution of the trust account as described below.
 
On December 22, 2022, we entered into an amendment to our underwriting agreement dated December 20, 2021 (the “Underwriting Agreement”) with EF Hutton, Division of Benchmark Investments, LLC (the “Underwriter”). Pursuant to the terms of the amendment, the Underwriter has agreed to reduce the amount of the Deferred Underwriting Commission (as defined in the Underwriting Agreement) payable to the Underwriter under the Underwriting Agreement from $4,025,000 in cash to $3,025,000 in cash.
 
The 2022 Charter Amendment and Related Stockholder Redemptions
 
Under Sagaliam’s previous charter, Sagaliam had until December 23, 2022 (the “Original Deadline Date”) to consummate its initial business combination, unless otherwise extended either (a) automatically for four months upon the execution of a business combination agreement and filing of a preliminary proxy statement with the SEC prior to the Original Deadline Date or (b) for successive three-month periods up to two times from the Original Deadline Date by the Sponsor depositing additional funds into the trust account.

Sagaliam’s Board believed that there was not sufficient time before the Original Deadline Date to consummate the business combination. Therefore, Sagaliam’s Board determined that it is in the best interests of Sagaliam’s stockholders to extend the date by which we must consummate a business combination in order to provide Sagaliams’ stockholders with the opportunity to participate in the prospective investment.
 
As reported by Sagaliam’s Form 8-K filed with the SEC on December 23, 2022, on December 22, 2022, Sagaliam’s shareholders voted in favor of amending Sagaliam’s charter to allow it more time to complete our initial business combination up until October 23, 2023 (the “Extended Deadline Date”).
 
The charter amendment provides Sagaliam with the option to extend the date by which it must complete its initial business combination from the Original Deadline Date by up to ten successive one-month periods up to an Extended Deadline Date by the Sponsor depositing the lesser of (x) $120,000 or (y) $0.06 per share for each public share of Sagaliam that is not redeemed in connection with our special meeting held on December 22, 2022 for each one-month extension after December 23, 2022 into the trust account at each extension election. As reported by Sagaliam’s Form 8-K filed with the SEC on January 23, 2023, Sagaliam extended the date by which it has to complete its business combination from January 23, 2023 to February 23, 2023. As reported by Sagaliam’s Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 24, 2023, Sagaliam extended the date by which it has to complete its business combination from February 23, 2023 to March 23, 2023. As reported by Sagaliam’s Form 8-K filed with the SEC on April 3, 2023, Sagaliam extended the date by which it has to complete its business combination from March 23, 2023 to April 23, 2023. As reported by Sagaliam’s Form 8-K filed with the SEC on April 24, 2023, Sagaliam extended the date by which it has to complete its business combination from April 23, 2023 to May 23, 2023. If Sagaliam’s business combination is not consummated by the Extended Deadline Date or if Sagaliam fails to deposit additional funds into the trust account after each extension election, then Sagaliam will cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up and Sagaliam will distribute amounts in the trust account as provided in the charter, unless it further amends the charter.
 
In connection with the charter amendment, 10,543,663 shares were redeemed at a price of $10.21 per share and $107,595,680.53 was removed from the trust account to pay Sagaliam public stockholders who requested redemption of their Sagaliam Shares. As of December 31, 2022, the trust account balance was $9,843,440.
 
Proposed Business Combination
 
Business Combination Agreement
 
On November 16, 2022, we entered into a Business Combination Agreement (as it may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Business Combination Agreement”) by and among Sagaliam, Allenby Montefiore Limited, a private company limited by shares organized and existing under the Laws of the Republic of Cyprus (“PubCo”), AEC Merger Sub Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of PubCo (“PubCo Merger Sub”), Supraeon Investments Limited, a private company limited by shares organized and existing under the Laws of the Republic of Cyprus (“Supraeon”), and GLD Partners, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (“Seller”). Arabian Entertainment Company Limited, a limited liability company organized under the Laws of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (“AEC”) is a majority-owned subsidiary of Supraeon, with Seller as the only other owner of shares of AEC.


Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, Supraeon may terminate the Business Combination Agreement and abandon the Merger at any time prior to the Merger Effective Time by written notice to Sagaliam if Sagaliam has not received commitments in the form of mutually agreed Subscription Agreements (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) for at least fifty percent of the Minimum Cash Amount before December 15, 2022. On February 23, 2023, Supraeon notified Sagaliam that as Sagaliam did not receive such commitments before December 15, 2022, Supraeon was electing to terminate the Merger and the Business Combination Agreement. All related ancillary agreements entered into in connection with the Business Combination Agreement were also terminated on February 23, 2023. For additional information regarding the Business Combination Agreement and related ancillary agreements, see our Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 16, 2022 and March 1, 2023, respectively. All capitalized terms used herein and not defined shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Business Combination Agreement, the Seller Support Agreement, the Sponsor Support Agreement, the Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement and the Lock-up Agreement.

Membership Interest Purchase Agreement
 
On March 23, 2023, GLD Sponsor Member, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Seller”), entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with BN Holdings Trust, a Nevada Trust (“BN Holdings Trust”) and Sagaliam Sponsor, LLC (the “Sponsor”), pursuant to which BN Holdings Trust agreed to purchase all of the issued and outstanding equity interests in the Sponsor from the Seller, which constitutes 100% of the membership interests in the Sponsor. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement (the “Closing”) is expected to take place at 10:00 am., New York time, on or before May 19, 2023.
 
There are a number of conditions precedent to the Closing including the delivery of an amended letter agreement, pursuant to which Sagaliam Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) and EF Hutton, as underwriter to the Company, will consent to the transfer of certain Class A units and Class B Shares from the Sponsor to certain individuals and entities as listed in the Purchase Agreement. The Purchase Agreement also requires (i) the delivery of a release in favor of the Seller by the Sponsor and certain third parties, (ii) the delivery of indemnification and hold harmless agreements between BN Holdings Trust and certain third parties, including the current directors of the Company, (iii) the assumption by BN Holdings Trust of certain obligations of the Sponsor and the Company, each of which are to be paid as of the closing date of a business combination for the Company, (iv) the maintenance of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and (v) the resignation of the current officers of the Sponsor.
 
Initial Business Combination
 
Our management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the IPO and the sale of the private placement units, although substantially all of these net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a business combination. The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) rules provide that the business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned on the trust account) at the time we sign a definitive agreement to enter a business combination. We will only complete a business combination if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.
 
Although we may pursue an acquisition in any industry or geography, we intend to capitalize on the capabilities of our management team and our Sponsor to identify, acquire and operate a business that may provide opportunities for attractive risk-adjusted returns in the telecommunications, media, and technology industries.
 
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject certain limitations. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of a business combination with respect to our rights.
 
If we are unable to complete a business combination by October 23, 2023 if all extension rights are exercised, and our stockholders have not further amended our certificate of incorporation to extend such date, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible, but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (less taxes payable and up to $150,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining stockholders and the board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case, to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.
 
Our Business Strategy
 
Although our efforts to identify a prospective target business will not necessarily be limited to a particular industry, sector or region, we intend to capitalize on our expertise in the telecommunications, media, and technology industries.
 
We believe that the telecommunications, media and technology industries present attractive characteristics of long-term growth prospects globally, stable and cycle-resistant demand, fragmented markets with opportunities for consolidation, a lack of dominant players and global brands, predictable digital transition patterns and a large universe of growing and profitable targets.
 
We believe that five long-term trends are driving positive transformation in the telecommunications, media and technology industries, creating opportunities for long-term value creation in the sector specifically and, more broadly, in the associated knowledge economy. These drivers of transformation are: (i) digitization (the use of digital content and services), (ii) responsiveness (designing and offering products and services on a customized or bespoke basis for the individual), (iii) privatization (the growing private supply of media, content and services), (iv) automation (the use of artificial intelligence and data to enhance the efficacy and efficiency of product delivery platforms) and (v) globalization (the international development and dissemination of content, certification, technology and brands). We intend to take advantage of these long-term trends and the associated consolidation and value-creation opportunities.

Our acquisition and value creation strategy is to identify, acquire and, after our initial business combination, fundamentally enhance a company in the public markets. We intend to seek a company in an industry that complements the experience and expertise of our management team and is a business to which we believe we can add value.
 
Our management team is deeply familiar with the trends of our target industries and brings an investing approach that offers multiple competitive advantages in sourcing, evaluating and executing on opportunities, including being:
 

● | Stockholder Centric: We think like owners and are focused on long-term gains rather than short-term results. Our compensation structure of our management team is closely tied to the long-term performance of the stock. See “Management – Officer and Director Compensation”. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Forward Looking: We are deeply familiar with the trends of the industries in which we plan to invest and can evaluate the opportunities and risks presented by ongoing secular changes and temporary market disruptions. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Nimble: Our team is structured to allow it to move quickly when opportunities arise, and we can be creative in our deal structures. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Financially Sophisticated: Our management team has extensive experience in mergers, capital restructuring, divestitures, investing, capital deployment, credit analysis and setting capital structures. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Long-Term Focused: We take a long-term, strategic view in our various operating businesses and are less concerned with short-term bouts of volatility. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Connected, through Proprietary Sourcing Channels and Leading Industry Relationships: We believe the capabilities and connections associated with our management team will provide us with a differentiated pipeline of acquisition opportunities that would be difficult for other participants in the market to replicate. We expect these sourcing capabilities will be further bolstered by our management team and our reputation and deep industry relationships.

Our Business Combination Criteria
 
Consistent with our business strategy, we have developed the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective initial business combinations. We will use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating business combination opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines.

● | Businesses with Significant Revenue and Earnings Growth Potential. We will seek to acquire one or more businesses that we believe will have multiple organic and M&A-driven growth opportunities over time. We will search for attractive, growth-oriented businesses that exhibit sound, underlying fundamentals as well as demonstrated revenue growth and a clear path to profitability. This includes such potential targets that are currently, or have the potential to be, a category leader with long-term growth potential. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Targets That Can Benefit from our Management Team’s Relationships and Experience. Although we may pursue an initial business combination opportunity in any industry or sector, we intend to capitalize on our management team’s domain expertise acquired through decades of strategic deal-making in the media, digital media/consumer technology and related industries. We believe our management’s deep network of CEO-level and other C-suite and board relationships, in addition to contacts with pre-eminent private and public market investors, will give us a number of competitive advantages and will present us with a substantial number of potential business combination targets, particularly in the aforementioned industries. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Companies with Potential to Benefit from Digital Disruption. We will seek to acquire one or more businesses which currently, or have the potential to, benefit from digital disruption, or a disruption of traditional business models or markets. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Businesses in High-Growth Markets. We will seek out opportunities in higher-growth sectors in the U.S., as well as in selected developed and emerging international markets. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Companies that Drive Shareholder Returns. We will seek to acquire one or more businesses that offer an attractive risk-adjusted return for our stockholders, weighing potential growth opportunities and operational improvements in the target business against any identified downside risks. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet them in our stockholder communications related to our initial business combination would be in the form of tender offer documents or proxy solicitation materials that we would file with the SEC.
 
Our Business Combination Process
 
In evaluating prospective business combinations, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review process that will encompass, among other things, a review of historical and projected financial and operating data, meetings with management and their advisors (if applicable), on-site inspection of facilities and assets, discussion with customers and suppliers, legal reviews and other reviews as we deem appropriate.
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.
 
Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations to present the opportunity to such entity, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such entity. We believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will not materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue, and to the extent the director or officer is permitted to refer that opportunity to us without violating another legal obligation.
 
Our Sponsor and our officers and directors own founder shares following the IPO. Because of this ownership, our Sponsor and our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers or directors were to be included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination. Our Sponsor paid an aggregate of $25,000, or approximately $0.009 per founder share, and accordingly, the Sponsor could potentially make a substantial profit even if the company selects an acquisition target that substantially declines in value and is unprofitable for public stockholders.

Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of our Initial Business Combination
 
Nasdaq rules require that we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. The fair market value of our initial business combination will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as discounted cash flow valuation, a valuation based on trading multiples of comparable public businesses or a valuation based on the financial metrics of M&A transactions of comparable businesses. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target’s assets or prospects. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination. Subject to this requirement, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.
 
In any case, we will only complete an initial business combination in which we own or acquire 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquire a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If we own or acquire less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses, the portion of such business or businesses that are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company is what will be taken into account for purposes of Nasdaq’s 80% of net assets test.
 
To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
 
In evaluating a prospective business target, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review, which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information that will be made available to us.
 
Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic business combinations. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the initial business combination of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding rights, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.

Human Capital Management
 
We currently have four executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the initial business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination.
