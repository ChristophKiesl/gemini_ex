NORTH AMERICA 
 Sales in our North America segment increased 2.4 percent, or $40.2 million, in 2016 compared with the prior year. The sales increase in 2016 was the result of price increases in the U.S. for residential and commercial water heaters and higher volumes of commercial water heaters and boilers in the U.S. Lower volumes of U.S. residential water heaters partially offset these favorable factors. Our acquisition of Aquasana, Inc. (Aquasana) a water treatment company, in August 2016, added approximately $18 million of sales in 2016 compared with 2015. 
 We serve residential and commercial end markets in North America with a broad range of products including: 
 Water heaters. Our residential and commercial water heaters come in sizes ranging from 2.5 gallon (point-of-use) models to 12,000 gallon products with varying efficiency ranges. We offer electric, natural gas, gas tankless and liquid propane models as well as solar tank units. Our North American residential water heater sales in 2016 totaled approximately $1.1 billion or 62 percent of North America sales. Typical applications for our water heaters include residences, restaurants, hotels and motels, office buildings, laundries, car washes and small businesses. 
 Boilers. Our residential and commercial boilers range in size from 40,000 British Thermal Units (BTUs) to 6.0 million BTUs. Our commercial boilers are primarily used in space heating applications for hospitals, schools, hotels and other large commercial buildings. 
 Other. In our North America segment, we also assemble and market water treatment products, primarily for the U.S. We also manufacture expansion tanks, commercial solar water heating systems, swimming pool and spa heaters, related products and parts. 
 A significant portion of our North America sales is derived from the replacement of existing products. 
 We are the largest manufacturer and marketer of water heaters in North America with a leading share in both the residential and commercial markets. In the commercial market, we believe our comprehensive product line including boilers and our high-efficiency products give us a competitive advantage in this portion of the water heating industry. Our wholesale distribution channel includes more than 1,200 independent wholesale plumbing distributors serving residential and commercial end markets. We also sell our residential water heaters through the retail and maintenance, repair and operations (MRO) channels. In the retail channel, our customers include five of the seven largest national hardware and home center chains, including a long-standing exclusive relationship with LoweÂ’s. Our commercial boiler distribution channel is primarily comprised of manufacturer representative firms. Our water treatment products are primarily sold directly to consumers through e-commerce.

 Our Aquasana brand is one of the leading brands in the direct to consumer portion of the water treatment industry in the U.S. 
 Our energy efficient product offerings continue to be a sales driver for our business. Our Cyclone product family and our condensing boilers continue to be an option for commercial customers looking for high efficiency water and space heating with a short payback period through energy savings. We offer residential heat pump, condensing tank-type and tankless water heaters in North America, as well as other higher efficiency water heating solutions to round out our energy efficient product offerings. 
 We sell our water heating products in highly competitive markets. We compete in each of our targeted market segments based on product design, reliability, quality of products and services, advanced technologies, product performance, maintenance costs and price. Our principal water heating and boiler competitors in North America include Rheem, Bradford White, Rinnai, Aerco and Navien. Numerous other manufacturing companies also compete.

 REST OF WORLD 
 Sales in our Rest of World segment increased 11.5 percent, or $99.5 million, in 2016 compared with the prior year. A 12.5 percent increase in sales in China to $887.9 million was the primary source of the increase. Excluding the appreciation of the U.S. dollar in 2016, sales in China increased 18.9 percent in 2016. 
 We have operated in China for more than 20 years. In that time, we have been aggressively expanding our presence while building A. O. Smith brand recognition in the residential and commercial markets. The Chinese water heater market is predominantly comprised of electric wall-hung, gas tankless and solar water heaters. We believe we are one of the leading suppliers of water heaters to the residential market in China, with a broad product offering including electric, gas, gas tankless, heat pump and solar units as well as combi boilers. Primarily for Asia, we also manufacture and market water treatment products and air purification products. 
 We sell water heaters in more than 9,000 retail outlets in China, of which over 2,500 exclusively sell our products. Our water treatment products and air purification products are sold in over 6,500 and 2,500 retail outlets in China, respectively.

 Our primary competitor in China is Haier Appliances, a Chinese company, but we also compete with Midea in the electric water heater and water treatment markets and Rinnai and Noritz in the gas tankless water heater market. Additionally, we compete with numerous other Chinese private and state-owned water heater and water treatment companies in China. Our principal competitors in the China air purification market are Phillips, Panasonic and Sharp. In India, we compete with Bajaj and MTS-Racold in the water heater market and Eureka Forbes, Kent and Hindustan Unilever in the water treatment market. 
 In addition, we sell water heaters in the European and Middle Eastern markets and water treatment products in Turkey and Vietnam, all of which combined comprised six percent of total Rest of World sales in 2016. 
 RAW MATERIALS 
 Raw materials for our manufacturing operations, primarily consisting of steel, are generally available in adequate quantities. A portion of our customers are contractually obligated to accept price changes based on fluctuations in steel prices. There has been volatility in steel costs over the last several years.
