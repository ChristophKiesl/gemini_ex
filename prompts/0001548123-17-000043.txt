Item 1. Business.
OVERVIEW

UAS Drone Corp. (the Company, UAS, we, us, or similar terms), headquartered in Palm Beach, Florida, was founded in 2014 as Unlimited Aerial Systems, LLP (UAS LLP). We completed an Asset Purchase Agreement on March 31, 2015, purchasing all the assets and certain liabilities of UAS LLP in exchange for 600,000 shares of our common stock and our assumption of certain liabilities of UAS LLP. Our mailing address is 420 Royal Palm Way, Suite 100, Palm Beach, FL 33480, and our telephone number is 561-693-1424.
BUSINESS

We are a developer and manufacturer of commercial unmanned aerial systems, or drones, with the goal of providing a superior Quadrotor aerial platform at an affordable price point in the law enforcement and first responder markets.

Our Quadrotor is a proprietary commercial drone platform developed with the specific needs of law enforcement customers in mind. This includes long flight times, ease of use, durability and ruggedness, and high-end sensor and power components. We believe that our Quadrotor is one of the longest flying commercial drones in the sub-$20,000 market, which provides its users with long missions and less down time.

On October 21, 2015, we entered into two agreements with Havis Inc., of Warminster, Pennsylvania, to provide manufacturing and distribution services for our products. Havis is an 80-year-old privately held, ISO 9001:2008 certified company that manufactures in-vehicle mobile computer and workflow solutions for public safety, public works government agencies and mobile professionals. Havis products are distributed through a nationwide network of resellers and sales representatives in the United States. We entered into this agreement in anticipation of the FAA commercial UAV regulations being released at some point in 2016. 

In June of 2016, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) finally released the national commercial UAV regulations allowing drones to be used for commercial purposes in the U.S. for the first time. These regulations took effect in August of 2016. As a result of the effectiveness of the commercial UAV regulations, law enforcement agencies are now able to operate commercial drones to enhance their capabilities and document their activities from an aerial perspective. It is the Companys

opinion that these regulations provide law enforcement agencies with proper guidance and a level of comfort, thus allowing them to seriously consider adding UAVs to their workflow. As a result, UAS Drone Corp. was then able to gain material insight into the budget availability, budgetary process and customized specifications that would be critical to winning their business. 

Our distribution agreement with Havis is currently on hold as we work to customize our Quadrotor to meet the requirements of the commercial law enforcement market in conjunction with a drone flight training company in the western U.S. This company has over eight years of experience field training both consumers and professionals in proper drone flight, safety and regulatory procedures. 

In late 2016, we delivered to this flight training company one of our inventory Quadrotors with the intention of: (1) allowing them to use our drone in their training courses, specifically with law enforcement and first responder professionals, (2) obtain feedback on performance and operating characteristics of our drone with the intention of improving the product for future generations, and (3) seeking sales of additional Quadrotors to this company or their clients. This program has been successful in identifying aspects that we intend on improving in the next generation, including the latest infrared sensors, and creating interest for the sale of our product. We are currently in discussion with this company both to purchase our remaining inventory of current generation drones, and to have them manufacture the next generation of our Quadrotor for sale through their training and sales personnel, as well as through additional distributors. If we are able to formalize an agreement, we believe this group will provide an additional manufacturing and sales arm for UAS, for which we may receive sales revenue and/or license fees for our technology. We expect to progress with this agreement in the first half of 2017. 

In addition to UAV sales, we intend on providing additional value-added services to our product offering, including specialized training for police officers and video/data management software and hosting services. We believe these are critical services and components to having a successful product offering for our target market. 

Further, we are exploring several acquisitions of other drone-based technologies that we may be able to offer in the future. However, we are in the very early stages of this process and can make no assurance that we will ever complete any such acquisition or that, if we do, it will be successful. See the Risk Factor UAS may pursue acquisitions, investments or other strategic relationships or alliances, which may consume significant resources, may be unsuccessful and could dilute holders of its common stock of this Annual Report.

We expect that our initial Quadrotor product may serve as an efficient information gathering tool for government agencies across the United States and internationally. The Law Enforcement sector itself is an industry constantly looking to implement innovative practices to serve citizens to the fullest extent, while increasing safety, and decreasing time and costs of fulfilling their duties. This Quadrotor can provide a swift and convenient aid to search and rescue missions, crime scene investigations, public safety, monitoring traffic for emergency responders, and other similar activities.

Emerging Growth Company

We are and we will remain an "emerging growth company" as defined under The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the JOBS Act), until the earliest to occur of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which our total annual revenues equal or exceed $1 billion (subject to adjustment for inflation), (ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt securities, or (iv) the date on which we are deemed a "large accelerated filer" (with at least $700 million in public float) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). 

As an "emerging growth company", we may take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:

· only two years of audited financial statements in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements with correspondingly reduced Managements Discussion and Analysis disclosure;
 · reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements;
 · no requirement that we hold non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements; and
 · exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting.

We have taken advantage of some of these reduced burdens, and thus the information we provide stockholders may be different from what you might receive from other public companies in which you hold shares.

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. However, we are choosing to opt out of such extended transition period, and as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.

Notwithstanding the above, we are also currently a smaller reporting company, meaning that we are not an investment company, an asset-backed issuer, or a majority-owned subsidiary of a parent company that is not a smaller reporting company and have a public float of less than $75 million and annual revenues of less than $50 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. In the event that we are still considered a smaller reporting company, at such time as we cease being an emerging growth company, the disclosure we will be required to provide in our SEC filings will increase, but will still be less than it would be if we were not considered either an emerging growth company or a smaller reporting company.  Specifically, similar to emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies are able to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures in their filings; are exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) requiring that independent registered public accounting firms provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting; and have certain other decreased disclosure obligations in their SEC filings, including, among other things, only being required to provide two years of audited financial statements in annual reports.
