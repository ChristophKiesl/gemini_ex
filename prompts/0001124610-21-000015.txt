ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Overview
VMware, Inc. (“VMware”) originally pioneered the development and application of virtualization technologies with x86 server-based computing, separating application software from the underlying hardware. Information technology (“IT”) driven innovation continues to disrupt markets and industries. Technologies emerge faster than organizations can absorb, creating increasingly complex environments. IT is working at an accelerated pace to harness new technologies, platforms and cloud models, ultimately guiding businesses through a digital transformation. To take on these challenges, we are working with customers in the areas of hybrid and multi-cloud, virtual cloud networking, digital workspaces, modern applications and intrinsic security. Our software provides a flexible digital foundation to enable customers in their digital transformation.
Our portfolio supports and addresses the key IT priorities of our customers, including accelerating their cloud journey, modernizing their applications, empowering digital workspaces, transforming networking and embracing intrinsic security. We enable customers to digitally transform their operations as they ready their applications, infrastructure and employees for constantly evolving business needs. 
We incorporated in Delaware in 1998, were acquired by EMC Corporation (“EMC”) in 2004 and conducted our initial public offering of our Class A common stock in August 2007. In September 2016, Dell Technologies Inc. (“Dell”) acquired EMC. As a result, EMC became a wholly owned subsidiary of Dell, and we became an indirectly held, majority-owned subsidiary of Dell. In December 2019, we acquired Pivotal Software, Inc., a subsidiary of Dell. We are considered a “controlled company” under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”). As of January 29, 2021, Dell controlled approximately 80.6% of our outstanding common stock, including 31 million shares of our Class A common stock and all of our Class B common stock.
We refer to our fiscal years ended January 28, 2022, January 29, 2021 and January 31, 2020 as “fiscal 2022,” “fiscal 2021” and “fiscal 2020,” respectively. 
Total revenue in fiscal 2021 increased 9% to $11.8 billion. Total revenue is comprised of license revenue of $3.0 billion, subscription and SaaS revenue of $2.6 billion and services revenue of $6.1 billion. As customers shift from our on-premises offerings to our cloud-based offerings, license revenue may be lower and subject to greater fluctuation in the future, driven by a higher percentage of cloud-based offerings being sold.
Our corporate headquarters are located at 3401 Hillview Avenue, Palo Alto, California, and we have 127 offices worldwide. 
Products and Technology Solutions
Our multi-cloud, virtual cloud networking, digital workspace, application modernization and intrinsic security solutions form a flexible, consistent digital foundation on which to build, run, manage, connect and protect applications, anywhere.
Multi-Cloud
The VMware Multi-Cloud Solution provides infrastructure products and services to customers to create a common operating environment based on VMware Cloud Foundation that extends from on-premises data centers to cloud to edge. 
VMware vSphere (“vSphere”), VMware vSAN (“ vSAN”), VMware NSX (“NSX”) and vRealize Cloud Management are foundational products that provide solutions to our customers. VMware Cloud Foundation (“VCF”) is a hybrid cloud platform that combines our vSphere, vSAN and NSX offerings with vRealize Cloud Management into an integrated stack that delivers developer-ready cloud infrastructure for private and public clouds. VMware Cloud Foundation software can be consumed as a software-only solution on customers’ choice of hardware, as an integrated system pre-installed at the factory such as Dell EMC VxRail (“VxRail”) or as a service on leading public clouds including Amazon Web Services (“AWS”), Azure, Google Cloud, IBM Cloud and Oracle. 
vSphere, our flagship data center infrastructure offering, utilizes our hypervisor software and provides the fundamental compute layer for customer environments. A “hypervisor” is a layer of software that resides between the operating system and system hardware to enable compute virtualization. We continue to build on vSphere with VMware Tanzu solutions, which provides a simple way for vSphere customers globally to get started with Kubernetes and modernize their workloads running on vSphere.
vSAN and VxRail products offer cost-effective, holistic data storage and protection options to all applications running on vSphere. These products are applicable to hyperconverged infrastructure as well as traditional infrastructure solutions and enable customers to deploy on a broad range of hardware solutions. Our vSAN offering creates simple, shared storage designed 
for virtual machines. VxRail is a hyperconverged infrastructure solution comprised of a fully integrated and pre-configured Dell EMC appliance powered by vSAN and vSphere software. 
vRealize Cloud Management solutions–available as a service or on-premises offerings–help customers manage hybrid and multi-cloud environments running in both virtual machines and containers. VMware cloud management offerings optimize cloud usage and costs, automate the deployment, management and migration of applications and data, improve cloud security and compliance, and monitor application and cloud infrastructure. Key products in the VMware cloud management product portfolio include CloudHealth by VMware, vRealize Automation, vRealize Operations, VMware vRealize Suite and VMware vCloud Suite. VMware vRealize Cloud Universal, which was launched in fiscal 2021, is a single offering that combines VMware’s SaaS and on-premises cloud management capabilities with the flexibility to move between the two as needed. 
VCF extends to multi-cloud through VMware Cloud on AWS and VMware Cloud on Dell EMC offerings; hyperscaler public cloud services including Azure VMware Solution, Google Cloud VMware Engine, IBM Cloud for VMware Solutions and Oracle Cloud VMware Solution; and VMware Cloud Verified Providers.

Digital Workspace
Our digital workspace offerings enable our customers to more securely deliver access to applications and data for their end users from any device of the user’s choice and from any location. These offerings are designed to deliver simplicity and choice for end users, while providing more security and control to corporate IT organizations for corporate applications, data and endpoints.
Our complete digital workspace solution is VMware Workspace ONE (“Workspace ONE”), the platform that more securely delivers and manages any application on any device by integrating access control, application management and multi-platform endpoint management. Workspace ONE brings together Workspace ONE Unified Endpoint Management (“UEM”), Workspace ONE Access (“Access”) and VMware Horizon (“Horizon”), tied together with a common access control layer:
•Workspace ONE UEM—a solution built to manage and help secure endpoints across all major operating systems from a single management console that includes a suite of productivity applications, enabling customers to more effectively manage, secure and benefit from “bring your own device” programs. 
•Access—a cloud service that enables customers to continuously track device state, user details and authentication context to determine user and device risk, allow or deny access and require multi-factor authentication or a remediation for access. 
•Horizon—a virtual platform that provides a streamlined approach to delivering, protecting and managing virtual desktops and applications from one digital workspace, while containing costs and allowing end users to work anytime, anywhere and across any device.
While Workspace ONE UEM, Access and Horizon are also offered separately, together the complete Workspace ONE platform provides customers with a holistic digital workspace solution that combines identity, mobile management, employee productivity tools and application and desktop virtualization solutions. Through the continued expansion of our virtual desktop portfolio, we offer customers the opportunity to run virtual desktops as-a-service through multiple environments including the Azure platform, VMware Cloud on AWS and IBM Cloud.
Workspace ONE Intelligent Hub empowers employees to more securely access corporate apps and resources from “hire to retire.” IT can grant access to any application with single sign-on from a unified catalog, send informational and actionable notifications, and enable one-click contextual workflows with SaaS and backend applications on-the-go.
Application Modernization
VMware Tanzu, a family of products and services for modernizing applications and infrastructure, enables customers to deliver better software to production, continuously. The portfolio enables customers to build, run and manage modern applications on any cloud and simplifies the use of Kubernetes, an open source platform for managing containers, in a multi-cloud environment. The modern or cloud native applications allow businesses to bring new ideas to market faster and respond sooner to customer demands. VMware Tanzu uses cloud native patterns to build applications with microservices and APIs, and utilizing Kubernetes to simplify how these applications are deployed, observed and managed across on-premises, public clouds and edge. VMware Tanzu includes technologies acquired as part of our Pivotal, Bitnami, Heptio and Wavefront acquisitions.

•VMware Carbon Black Cloud Workload—delivers advanced protection purpose-built for better securing modern workloads to reduce the attack surface and strengthen security postures. The solution combines prioritized vulnerability reporting and foundational workload hardening with industry-leading prevention, detection and response capabilities to protect workloads running in virtualized private and hybrid cloud environments. VMware Carbon Black Cloud Workload is also tightly integrated with vSphere to provide agentless security that alleviates installation and management overhead and consolidates the collection or telemetry for multiple workload security use cases. 
Technology Alliances
We have more than 900 technology partners with whom we bring offerings to the marketplace and over 4,500 active cloud and managed service provider partners. We classify our partners as follows:
Independent Hardware Vendors (“IHVs”)—we have established relationships with large system vendors, including Apple, Cisco, Fujitsu, Hitachi, HPE, IBM, Lenovo and Samsung for certification and co-development, and we continue to work closely with Dell. We also work closely with Intel, NVIDIA and other IHVs to provide input on product development to enable them to deliver hardware advancements that benefit virtualization users. We coordinate with the leading storage and networking vendors to ensure interoperability and enable our software to access their differentiated functionality.
Independent Software Vendors (“ISVs”)—we partner with leading systems management, infrastructure software and application software vendors, including healthcare, telecom, finance and retail leaders, to deliver value-added products that integrate with our products.
VMware Cloud Providers—we have established partnerships with over 4,500 active cloud and managed service providers, including Microsoft, Google, Oracle, Lumen, Fujitsu, IBM, KPN, NTT, OVH, Rackspace, Softbank, Telefonica, Tieto and Virtustream supporting our multi-cloud strategy. These partners leverage our cloud technologies to host and deliver enterprise-class cloud services for enterprises to extend their data centers to external clouds, while preserving security, compliance and quality of service. 
In addition to our base of active partnerships with cloud providers, we have a strategic alliance with AWS to build and deliver an integrated hybrid offering, VMware Cloud on AWS, that enables customers to run applications across vSphere-based private, public and multi-cloud environments.
Our Technology Alliance Partner (“TAP”) program facilitates collaborative solution creation and coordinated go-to-market activities for our more than 900 technology partner ecosystem. Created exclusively for IHV and ISV partners, the TAP program 
gives technology partners the ability to test, integrate and package application software, infrastructure and hardware products with our products and services offerings—on premises or in the cloud.
Our ISVs and other alliance partners, developers and additional VMware community members continue to distribute software applications as virtual appliances. We invest significant capital in testing and certification of infrastructure to rigorously ensure our software is compatible with major hardware and software products.
Research and Development
We have made, and expect to continue to make, significant investments in research and development (“R&D”). We have assembled an experienced group of developers with expertise in software-defined data centers, hybrid and multiple public clouds, the modernization, migration and management of applications, networking, security, and digital workspaces. We also have strong ties to leading academic institutions around the world, and we invest in joint research with academia.
We prioritize our product development efforts through a combination of engineering-driven innovation and customer- and market-driven feedback. Our R&D culture places a high value on innovation, quality and open collaboration with our partners. We currently participate in numerous standards groups, and our employees hold a variety of standards organization leadership positions.
We continue to invest in our key growth areas while also investing in areas that we expect to be significant growth drivers in future periods. 
Sales and Marketing
We have a highly leveraged go-to-market strategy that includes a direct sales force, including a specialized sales force for our key growth offerings, and our channel and cloud partners.
We have established ongoing business relationships with our distributors. Our distributors purchase software licenses and software support from us for resale to end-user customers via resellers. These resellers are part of our VMware Partner Connect (formerly known as VMware Partner Network), a program which offers resellers pricing incentives, rebates, sales and product training through the VMware Partner Connect web portal, and access to the worldwide network of VMware distributors. In addition, our channel partner network includes certain systems integrators and resellers trained and certified to deliver consulting services and solutions leveraging our products. Our channel network also includes partners that host our products and deliver them as a service to customers. 
We generally do not have long-term contracts or minimum-purchase commitments with our distributors, resellers, system vendors and systems integrators, and our contracts with these channel partners do not prohibit them from offering products or services that compete with ours.
End users can purchase the full breadth of our subscription, SaaS, perpetual license, and services portfolio through discrete purchases to meet their immediate needs or through the adoption of enterprise agreements (“EAs”). Both of which provide access to a range of flexible purchasing programs. EAs are comprehensive offerings that may include license and subscription and SaaS, offered both directly by us and through certain channel partners that also provide for multi-year maintenance and support. EAs enable us to build long-term relationships with our customers as they commit to our virtual infrastructure solutions. Our sales cycle can vary greatly depending on numerous factors, including the size and complexity of the proposed offering and customer’s infrastructure footprint.
In establishing list prices for our products, we take into account, among other numerous factors, the value our products and solutions deliver and the cost of alternative virtualization, end-user computing and hardware solutions.
Our marketing efforts focus on communicating the benefits of our solutions and educating our customers and users, distributors, resellers, system vendors, systems integrators, the media and analysts about the advantages of our innovative offerings. We raise awareness of our company and brands, market our products and generate sales leads through VMware and industry events, public relations efforts, marketing materials, advertising, direct marketing, social media initiatives, free downloads and trials, and our website. We have invested in multiple online communities that enable customers and partners to share and discuss sales and development resources, best practices implementation and industry trends among other topics. Our annual user conferences, VMworld, vForum, Connect and SpringOne are held globally. We also offer management presentations, seminars and webinars on our solutions and services. We believe the combination of these activities strengthens our brand and enhances our leading positions in the industries in which we compete.
We continue joint marketing, sales, branding and product development efforts with Dell and other Dell companies to enhance the collective value we deliver to our mutual customers. Our collective business with Dell continued to create synergies that benefited our sales during fiscal 2021. Bookings through Dell sales channels have grown more rapidly than through non-Dell resellers and distributors, and Dell sales channels in aggregate comprise the largest route-to-market for our sales. We also have strategic partnerships with AWS, Google, IBM and Microsoft to jointly provide the expertise, solutions and 
go-to-market capabilities to help our customers efficiently and more securely extend their proven software-defined solutions into public clouds, utilizing the tools and processes with which our customers are already familiar.
Our business is subject to seasonality in the sale of our products and services. For example, our fourth quarter revenue is affected by a number of seasonal factors, including year-end spending trends which impact the timing of renewals of our EAs and support and maintenance contracts.
Remaining Performance Obligations
Remaining performance obligations represent the aggregate amount of the transaction price in contracts allocated to performance obligations not delivered, or partially undelivered, as of the end of the reporting period. Remaining performance obligations include unearned revenue, multi-year contracts with future installment payments and certain unfulfilled orders against accepted customer contracts at the end of any given period.
As of January 29, 2021, the aggregate transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was $11.3 billion, of which approximately 55% is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next twelve months and the remainder thereafter.
As of January 31, 2020, the aggregate transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was $10.3 billion, of which approximately 54% was expected to be recognized as revenue during fiscal 2021, and the remainder thereafter.
Backlog
Backlog is comprised of unfulfilled purchase orders or unfulfilled executed agreements at the end of a given period and is net of related estimated rebates and marketing development funds. Backlog consists of licenses, subscription and SaaS, and services. As of January 29, 2021, our total backlog was $93 million and our backlog related to licenses was $23 million. For our backlog related to licenses, we generally expect to deliver and recognize as revenue during the following quarter. Backlog totaling $18 million as of January 29, 2021 was excluded from the remaining performance obligations because such contracts are subject to cancellation until fulfillment of the performance obligation occurs.
As of January 31, 2020, our total backlog was $18 million, and our backlog related to licenses was $5 million. The amount excluded from the remaining performance obligations because such contracts were subject to cancellation until fulfillment of the performance obligation occurs was not material as of January 31, 2020. 
The amount and composition of backlog will fluctuate period to period, and backlog is managed based upon multiple considerations, including product and geography. We do not believe that the amount of backlog is indicative of future sales or revenue or that the mix of backlog at the end of any given period correlates with actual sales performance of a particular geography or particular products or services.
Customers
Our product offerings allow customers to manage IT resources across private clouds and complex multi-cloud, multi-device environments. Customer deployments range in size from a single virtualized server for small businesses to thousands of virtual machines and managed devices for our largest enterprise customers.
During fiscal 2021, revenue from Dell, including purchases of products and services directly from us, as well as through our channel partners, accounted for 35% of our consolidated revenue. These purchases included Dell selling joint solutions as an OEM, which accounted for 12% of revenue from Dell, or 4% of our consolidated revenue. The remaining revenue from Dell consisted of Dell acting as a distributor to other non-Dell resellers, reselling products and services as a reseller or purchasing products and services for its own internal use. On certain transactions, Dell Financial Services also provided financing to our end users at our end users’ discretion. 
During fiscal 2021, another distributor, Arrow Electronics, Inc., who purchased software licenses and software support from us for resale to end-user customers directly or via resellers, accounted for 11% of our consolidated revenue. Our distribution agreements are typically terminable at will by either party upon 30 to 90 days’ prior written notice to the other party, and neither party has any obligation to purchase or sell any products under the agreement.
Competition
We face intense competition across all markets for our products and services. We believe that the key factors in our ability to successfully compete include the level of reliability, interoperability and new functionality of our product and service offerings; the ability of our product offerings to support multiple hardware platforms, operating systems, applications frameworks and public cloud platforms; our ability to anticipate customer needs in rapidly evolving markets for IT resources; the pricing of our product and service offerings; the ability to integrate open source technologies that are critical in private and public cloud computing architectures; the ability to attract and retain key employees; and the ability to maintain and expand our ecosystem of technology partners, service providers and sales channel partners. While we believe that we are a technology leader in virtualization and cloud infrastructure solutions and have a strong, favorable image with our customers, many of our 
current or potential competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources than we do. Additionally, the adoption of public cloud, micro-services, containers and open source technologies has the potential to erode our profitability.
We face competition from, among others:
Providers of public cloud infrastructure and SaaS-based offerings. As businesses increasingly utilize public cloud and SaaS-based offerings, they are building more of their new compute workloads off-premises and may also shift some of their existing workloads. As a result, the demand for on-premises IT resources is expected to slow, and our products and services will need to increasingly compete for customers’ IT workloads with off-premises public cloud and SaaS-based offerings. If our private, hybrid and multi-cloud products and services fail to address evolving customer requirements, the demand for our virtualization products and services may decline, and we could experience lower growth. Additionally, VCPP offerings from our partners may compete directly with infrastructure-as-a-service (“IaaS”) offerings from various public cloud providers such as AWS and Microsoft. Many of these cloud providers are partnering with on-premises hardware vendors to deliver their cloud platform as an on-premise solution, including Microsoft Azure Stack (“Azure Stack”) and AWS Outposts. In fiscal 2018, we entered into a strategic alliance with AWS to deliver a vSphere-based cloud service, VMware Cloud on AWS, running in AWS data centers available in certain geographies. In fiscal 2020, we also announced partnerships with Microsoft (Azure VMware Solution by CloudSimple), Google (Google Cloud VMware Solution by CloudSimple), and Oracle (Oracle Cloud VMware Solution) under the framework of our VCPP that enable customers to run native VMware-based workloads on Azure, Google Cloud and Oracle Cloud. Our partnerships with these public cloud providers may be seen as competitive with each other, with other VCPP partners and with AWS, while some VCPP partners may elect to include solutions such as VMware Cloud on AWS as part of their managed services provider offerings. In addition, in November 2018, when AWS announced AWS Outposts, we extended our collaboration with AWS by previewing offerings that will run on AWS Outposts. To the extent customers choose to operate native AWS environments (or similar non-VMware environments, such as Azure Stack) in their data centers in lieu of purchasing our on-premises and hybrid and multi-cloud products, our operating results could be materially adversely affected.
Providers of enterprise security offerings. With the close of VMware’s acquisition of Carbon Black in October 2019, we launched a new set of enterprise security solutions that includes the Carbon Black endpoint security platform and the intrinsic security elements of our existing NSX virtual networking, Workspace ONE end user and our compute offerings. The cybersecurity market is large, highly competitive, fragmented and subject to rapidly evolving technology, shifting customer needs and the frequent introductions of new solutions. Competitors in the end point security space include legacy antivirus solution providers such as McAfee and NortonLifeLock, established software and infrastructure providers such as Blackberry Limited (after recently purchasing Cylance, Inc.) and Microsoft as well as next-generation endpoint security providers such as CrowdStrike. In addition, new startup companies and established companies have entered or are currently attempting to enter the next-generation endpoint security market. While we believe that the intrinsic security elements in our existing offerings coupled with our Carbon Black endpoint security offerings and new combined offerings we expect to develop and introduce in the future will enable us to provide an integrated security offering with significant advantages over our competitors’ current offerings, our ability to gain traction and market share as a new entrant into this well-established market segment is uncertain. New trends such as Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) and Zero Trust Network Access represent the coalescence of formerly distinct markets, such as identity management, secure web gateway, SD-WAN, network firewall, and cloud access security brokers. These trends may bring existing partners such as Zscaler and Okta, into a more competitive position with Carbon Black, VeloCloud and other distributed network security offerings from VMware. If we are unable to successfully adapt our product and service offerings to meet these opportunities and rapidly evolving trends, our operating results could be adversely affected.
Large, diversified enterprise software and hardware companies. These competitors supply a wide variety of products and services to, and have well-established relationships with, our current and prospective end users. For example, small- to medium-sized businesses and companies in emerging markets that are evaluating the adoption of virtualization-based technologies and solutions may be inclined to consider Microsoft solutions because of their existing use of Windows and Office products. Some of these competitors have in the past and may in the future take advantage of their existing relationships to engage in business practices that make our products and services less attractive to our end users. For example, in August 2019, Microsoft modified its on-premises licensing terms to require end users who wish to deploy Microsoft software on certain dedicated hosted cloud services other than Microsoft’s Azure cloud service, including VMware Cloud on AWS, to purchase additional rights from Microsoft. Other competitors have limited or denied support for their applications running in VMware virtualization environments. In addition, these competitors could integrate competitive capabilities into their existing products and services and make them available without additional charge. For example, Oracle provides free server virtualization software intended to support Oracle and non-Oracle applications, Microsoft offers its own server, network, and storage virtualization software packaged with its Windows Server product as well as built-in virtualization in the client version of Windows and Cisco includes network virtualization technology in many of their data center networking platforms. As a result, our existing and prospective customers may elect to use products that are perceived to be “free” or “very low cost” instead of 
purchasing our products and services for certain applications where they do not believe that more advanced and robust capabilities are required.
Companies offering competing platforms based on open source technologies. Open source technologies for virtualization, containerization and cloud platforms, such as Xen, KVM, Docker, rkt, OpenShift, Mesos, Kubernetes and OpenStack, and other open source software-based products, solutions and services developed by enterprise IT vendors that target data center virtualization and private cloud, such as Red Hat (now a part of IBM) and Nutanix, may reduce the demand for our solutions, put pricing pressure on our offerings and enable competing vendors to leverage open source technologies to compete directly with us. In addition, one of the characteristics of open source software is that, subject to specified restrictions, anyone may modify and redistribute existing open source software and use it to compete in the marketplace. Such competition can develop with a smaller degree of overhead and lead time than traditional proprietary software companies require. New platform technologies and standards based on open source software are consistently being developed and can gain popularity quickly. Improvements in open source software could cause customers to replace software purchased from us with open-source software. We are delivering container technologies, such as PKS, and Cloud Native Application technologies portfolio with VMware Tanzu. We have also increased our level of commitment to open source projects and communities like the Cloud Native Computing Foundation that are designed to increase that rate at which customers adopt micro-services architectures. The adoption of distributed micro-service application architectures, and their alignment with container technologies, represents an emerging area of competition. As we continue to invest in these areas, we will experience increasing competitive overlap with other cloud native vendors like Red Hat and the large providers of public cloud infrastructure. Such competitive pressure or the availability of new open source software may result in reduced sales, price reductions, lower operating margins and increased sales and marketing expenses, any one of which may adversely affect our operating results.
Other industry alliances. Many of our competitors have entered into or extended partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer more comprehensive virtualization and cloud computing solutions than they individually had offered. We expect these trends to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or maintain their positions in the evolving virtualization infrastructure and enterprise IT solutions industry. These alliances may result in more compelling product and service offerings than we offer.
Our partners and members of our developer and technology partner ecosystem. We face competition from our partners. For example, third parties currently selling our products and services could build and market their own competing products and services or market competing products and services of other vendors. Additionally, as formerly distinct sectors of enterprise IT such as software-based virtualization and hardware-based server, networking and storage solutions converge, we also increasingly compete with companies who are members of our developer and technology partner ecosystem. For example, in July 2019, one of our important partners and customers, IBM, closed its acquisition of Red Hat, one of our competitors in the cloud native applications space. Consequently, we may find it more difficult to continue to work together productively on other projects, and the advantages we derive from our ecosystem could diminish. 
This competition could result in increased pricing pressure and sales and marketing expenses, thereby materially reducing our operating margins, and could also prevent our new products and services from gaining market acceptance, thereby harming our ability to increase, or causing us to lose, market share.

As of January 29, 2021, over 4,100 patents of varying duration issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office have been granted or assigned to us. We also have been granted or assigned patents from other countries. These patents cover various aspects of our server virtualization and other technologies. We also have numerous pending U.S. provisional and non-provisional patent applications, and numerous pending foreign and international patent applications, that cover other aspects of our virtualization and other technologies.
We have federal trademark registrations in the U.S. for “VMWARE,” “VMWORLD,” “VSPHERE,” “VCLOUD,” “VCENTER SERVER,” “VMOTION,” “HORIZON,” “AIRWATCH,” “VREALIZE,” “VCLOUD,” “WORKSPACE ONE,” “ESX,” “VMWARE NSX,” “VMWARE CLOUD FOUNDATION,” “VELOCLOUD,” “CARBON BLACK,” “BITNAMI” and “PIVOTAL” and numerous other trademarks. We also have trademarks registered in several foreign countries.
We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights and our brand.
We enforce our intellectual property rights in the U.S. and several foreign countries. Despite our efforts, the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to preclude misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights, and our ability to police such misappropriation or infringement is uncertain, particularly in countries outside of the U.S. patent filings are intended to provide the holder with a right to exclude others from making, using, offering to sell, selling or importing into the U.S. products covered by the claims of granted patents.
Our granted U.S. patents, and any future patents (to the extent they are issued), may be contested, circumvented or invalidated in the future. Moreover, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing these patents. Therefore, the exact effect of our patents and the other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property cannot be predicted with certainty.
Environmental, Social and Governance
At VMware, we believe technology can have a positive impact on society and the planet. In December 2020, we announced our 2030 Agenda, which represents our ESG Strategy focused on three business outcomes: Trust, Equity and Sustainability. Our 2030 Agenda is designed for all VMware stakeholders: stockholders, customers, employees, partners, suppliers, communities and the environment. To promote long-term stakeholder value creation, we created an ESG governance structure comprised of internal leadership and members of our executive staff to guide strategy, performance measurement and engage with our Board of Directors to review our ESG strategy.
Sustainability
We are committed to creating products and services that support our customers in reducing the environmental impact of their digital infrastructure. In addition to operating as a certified CarbonNeutral® company, in accordance with The CarbonNeutral Protocol, and procuring 100% renewable energy for our operations, in accordance with RE100’s technical guidance, during fiscal 2021, we received validation of our science-based targets from the Science Based Targets Initiative organization (“SBTi”) to address climate change. This year, we utilized concepts from the Financial Stability Board’s (“FSB”) Taskforce for Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”) framework in our reporting processes. Additionally, we were recognized on CDP’s Climate A List (formerly known as Carbon Disclosure Project) and added to the 2020 Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (“DJSI”). 
Human Capital 
General Demographics
As of January 29, 2021, we employed approximately 34,000 employees located in 60 countries, approximately 15,000 of which work in the U.S.
We contract with Dell subsidiaries for support from Dell personnel who are managed by us on a full-time basis. These individuals are located in countries in which we do not currently have an operating subsidiary and are predominantly dedicated to our sales and marketing efforts. We use contractors from time to time for temporary assignments and in locations in which we do not currently have operating subsidiaries. In the event that these contractor resources were not available, we do not believe that this would have a material adverse effect on our operations. As of January 29, 2021, less than 5% of our employees were contracted through Dell. None of our employees are represented by labor unions, and we consider current employee relations to be good.
COVID-19 
In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, we acted with urgency to address the safety of our employees while continuing to support the business continuity needs of our customers and partners. We transitioned to a remote workforce model during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and since then, have created flexible work and customer outreach experiences that have enabled our teams to remain connected with each other and with our customers while maintaining and enhancing productivity, operational excellence and innovation. We provided additional benefits to employees including a wellbeing allowance, pandemic time off, home equipment allowance and coverage of COVID-19 testing and treatment. 
Future of Work
Going forward, we plan to continue building a dynamic, global workforce of the future that empowers our people to work from any location, consistent with business requirements, that accelerates their productivity to deliver innovative solutions and operational excellence for our customers worldwide. We believe our approach to employee flexibility will enable the Company to hire skilled and talented team members from many new locations globally and contribute to meeting our diversity, equity and inclusion goals. While planning for the initiative was well underway before the emergence of COVID-19, the pandemic accelerated our efforts. As our employees demonstrated throughout the pandemic, work location does not dictate success. The choice and flexibility that form the cornerstones of this new distributed workforce model mirror the choice and flexibility we provide to our customers when choosing their digital infrastructure. 
Compensation and Benefits
We tailor our compensation programs including base pay strategy, variable compensation programs and health, wellbeing, and retirement programs to meet the needs of our employees. Equity awards are a key compensation component that enables us to recruit and retain top talent. The Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee of the VMware Board oversees the utilization of stock-based compensation to appropriately balance competitive needs against the dilutive impact on our 
stockholders. These components of total compensation are part of a broader framework of employee recognition, as well as our strategy to reinforce VMware’s culture, and to attract, develop, and retain a talented and diverse workforce. 
Wellbeing and Culture
The VMware culture is based on a set of shared values best expressed through the acronym EPIC2: Execution, Passion, Integrity, Customers, and Community. Each year, we honor extraordinary employees through our EPIC2 Achievement Awards program. Individuals are recognized for their ability to regularly go above and beyond the Company’s high standards and for demonstrating a remarkable quality of character. Their dedication to projects, customers, and fellow team members represents great leadership—people who can inspire and motivate, especially during times of transformation and change. 
We recognize that total wellbeing for our employees goes beyond physical fitness encompassing emotional, financial and community in defining overall health. In fiscal 2021, we expanded our wellbeing allowance to include all employees worldwide. During fiscal 2021, we were recognized by Forbes’ 2020 JUST 100 List and Glassdoor’s Best Places to Work. 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI)
DEI is a business priority at VMware. Our DEI initiative, VMinclusion, is a business-led effort to attract and engage the multinational, multicultural talent critical to our globally connected business. We are committed to creating a flexible, inclusive environment where everyone is respected and has equal opportunity to succeed. During fiscal 2021, all Senior Directors and above were assigned responsibility for achievement of company-wide DEI goals tied to bonus compensation. We carefully monitor the impact of our practices on the hiring and retention of talent from underrepresented communities, women, people with disabilities, veterans and those that identify as being part of LGBTQ communities. In fiscal 2021 we focused on our Black colleagues and their communities through executive level engagement to drive positive change that is systemic and long term. 
We have been recognized for our achievements including Forbes 2020 The Best Employers for Diversity, Forbes 2020 The Best Employers for Women, and the 2020 Human Rights Campaign Foundation Best Places to Work for LGBTQ Equality. 
As of the end of fiscal 2021, women represented 27.1% of our global employees and underrepresented minorities represented 10.4% of our U.S. employees. 
We are committed to equitable compensation. We know that leveraging the power of human difference starts with equal pay for equal work. We continually analyze compensation globally, accounting for multiple factors that influence pay such as job, grade, tenure, time in job, geographic location and performance. Our most recent data analysis as of November 2020 shows that at VMware, women, in the aggregate, adjusting for the factors identified above, earn 99% of their male counterparts' target cash compensation globally and underrepresented minorities earn 100% of their white counterparts in the U.S.
