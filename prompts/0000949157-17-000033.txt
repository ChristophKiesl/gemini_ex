Carbon anodes are used in the production of primary aluminum and both BHH and Vlissingen currently supply carbon anodes to our smelter in Grundartangi, Iceland.
We operate our business through one reportable segment, primary aluminum. Additional information about our segment reporting and certain geographic information is available in Note 19 Business segments to the consolidated financial statements included herein.
Century Aluminum Company is a Delaware corporation with principal executive offices located at One South Wacker Drive, Suite 1000, Chicago, Illinois 60606.
Strategic Objective
Our strategic objective is to maximize the financial returns we generate for our stockholders by: (a) optimizing our safety and environmental performance; (b) improving our cost structure for our existing assets by managing costs and improving productivity and efficiency; (c) pursuing upstream investment opportunities in bauxite mining, alumina refining and the production of other key operating supplies; and (d) expanding our primary aluminum business by improving and investing in the facilities we currently own as well as constructing, investing in or acquiring additional capacity. 
Primary Aluminum Facilities
Overview of Facilities
We operate three U.S. aluminum smelters, in Hawesville, Kentucky ("Hawesville"), Robards, Kentucky ("Sebree") and Goose Creek, South Carolina ("Mt. Holly"), and one smelter in Grundartangi, Iceland ("Grundartangi"). 
Grundartangi
The Grundartangi facility, located in Grundartangi, Iceland, is a primary aluminum reduction facility owned and operated by our wholly-owned subsidiary, Nordural Grundartangi ehf, and is our most modern facility. Grundartangi is currently in the process of a multi-year expansion project that has brought the annual capacity from 280,000 tonnes to current capacity of 313,000 tonnes (2016 volume) and is expected to ultimately increase annual production capacity to approximately 325,000 tonnes.  Grundartangi produces standard-grade aluminum and a primary foundry alloy product, which is a value-added product that is sold at a premium to standard-grade aluminum. 
Grundartangi operates under various long-term permits and agreements with the Government of Iceland, local municipalities and Faxafloahafnir sf (which operates the harbor at Grundartangi and is jointly owned by several municipalities).  
Hawesville
Hawesville, located adjacent to the Ohio River near Hawesville, Kentucky, is a primary aluminum reduction facility owned and operated by our wholly-owned subsidiary, Century Kentucky, Inc. ("CAKY"). Hawesville has an annual production capacity of approximately 252,000 tonnes. Hawesville is our largest U.S. smelter and the largest producer of high purity 
1

primary aluminum in North America. High purity primary aluminum is sold at a premium to standard-grade aluminum.  Hawesville’s specially configured facility is also capable of providing high-conductivity metal used in electrical wire and cable products as well as for certain aerospace applications. Approximately 60% of Hawesville's capacity has been curtailed since the fourth quarter of 2015. During 2016, Hawesville primarily produced high-purity aluminum and molten metal that is delivered directly to the customer's adjacent facility. 
Sebree
Sebree, located adjacent to the Green River near Robards, Kentucky, is a primary aluminum reduction facility owned and operated by our wholly-owned subsidiary, Century Aluminum Sebree LLC ("Century Sebree"). Sebree has an annual production capacity of approximately 218,000 tonnes. Sebree produces standard-grade aluminum that is cast into sow and value-added products, including billet, that are sold at a premium to standard-grade aluminum and molten metal that is delivered directly to the customer's nearby facility. In 2016, approximately 78% of Sebree's production was value-added products.
Mt. Holly
Mt. Holly, located in Goose Creek, South Carolina, is a primary aluminum reduction facility owned and operated by our wholly-owned subsidiary, Century Aluminum of South Carolina, Inc. ("CASC"). Mt. Holly has an annual production capacity of approximately 229,000 tonnes. Mt. Holly is the most modern aluminum reduction facility in the United States. 
Mt. Holly produces standard-grade aluminum that is cast into tee bars as well as several value-added products, including billet and foundry products. These value-added primary aluminum products are sold at a premium to standard-grade aluminum. In 2016, approximately 99% of Mount Holly's production was value-added products. The Mt. Holly facility is currently operating at 50% of capacity while CASC pursues a long-term power solution. See "Supply Contracts — Electrical Power Supply Agreements" below for further discussion of our power arrangements at Mt. Holly.

Primary Aluminum Projects
Helguvik project 
The Helguvik project is a greenfield project for an aluminum reduction facility in Helguvik, Iceland ("Helguvik" or the "Helguvik project"), owned by our wholly-owned subsidiary Nordural Helguvik ehf ("Nordural Helguvik"). Construction of the Helguvik project is currently curtailed. The Helguvik project site is located approximately 30 miles from the city of Reykjavik, Iceland.  
We commenced construction of the Helguvik project in June 2008.  In late 2008, we curtailed construction activity and spending on the project in response to the global financial crisis and deterioration of Icelandic economic conditions, including the financial condition of our contracted power suppliers. Construction activity and spending on the project have remained curtailed pending our ability to secure power delivery for the project at competitive prices. See "Electrical Power Supply Agreements" below for further discussion of our power arrangements at Helguvik. See Item 1A Risk Factors — "If we are unable to procure a reliable source of power, the Helguvik project may be further delayed or ultimately may not be feasible which could increase the cost of the project and could expose us to other risks, some of which may not be foreseeable at this time.”

BHH | Guangxi Zhuang, China | Carbon anode, cathode and graphitized products | 180,000 anode; 20,000 cathode/graphitized products | 40% 

(1) The numbers in this column reflect each facility's rated production capacity.
Pricing
Primary aluminum is an internationally traded commodity and its price is effectively determined on the London Metal Exchange (the "LME") and other exchanges, plus any regional delivery premiums and value-added product premiums. Our operating results are highly sensitive to changes in the LME price of primary aluminum and the value of regional delivery and product premiums, as well as the cost of electrical power, raw materials and other operating supplies used in production.  As a result, from time to time, we assess the appropriateness of mitigating the effects of fluctuations in these items through the use of various fixed-price commitments and financial instruments.
Customer Base
For the year ended December 31, 2016, we derived approximately 89% of our consolidated net sales from sales to Glencore plc and its affiliates (together, "Glencore").
Glencore purchased substantially all of the aluminum produced at our North American smelters during 2016 under the terms of that certain purchase and sale agreement, effective as of December 31, 2014 (the "2015-2016 US Sales Agreement"). The 2015-2016 US Sales Agreement expired on December 31, 2016. We have since entered into a new agreement with Glencore pursuant to which Glencore has agreed to continue to purchase a substantial portion of our aluminum products produced at our North American smelters in 2017. The pricing for aluminum sold under these agreements is determined by reference to the LME price for primary aluminum, plus the Midwest regional delivery premium (the "Midwest Transaction Price") plus additional product premiums based on market terms.
Glencore has also agreed to purchase substantially all primary aluminum produced at Grundartangi through 2017 at market prices (the "Glencore Grundartangi Metal Agreement"). The price for aluminum delivered to Glencore under the Glencore Grundartangi Metal Agreement is determined by reference to the LME price for primary aluminum, plus the European Duty Paid Price ("EDPP") premium and any applicable product premiums based on market terms. We were also 
4

party to a tolling agreement with Glencore for 90,000 tpy through June 2016. Under this agreement, Glencore provided Grundartangi alumina for processing and received primary aluminum in return for tolling fees that were based on the price of primary aluminum plus any applicable premiums.  
Glencore purchases the aluminum we produce for resale to end users.
Energy, Key Supplies and Raw Materials
We consume the following key supplies, energy and raw materials in the primary aluminum reduction process:

● | electrical power | ● | carbon anodes | ● | liquid pitch 
● | alumina | ● | cathode blocks | ● | calcined petroleum coke
● | aluminum fluoride | ● | natural gas | ● | silicon carbide 

Electrical power, alumina, carbon anodes and labor are the principal components of our cost of goods sold.  These components together represented over 75% of our cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2016.  For a description of certain risks related to our raw materials, supplies and labor, see Item 1A Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Facility | Supplier | Term | Pricing 
Grundartangi | Landsvirkjun | Through 2023 - 2036 | Variable rate based on (i) the LME price for primary aluminum or (ii) the Nord Pool power market for 161MW of Landsvirkjun supply post-2019
Orkuveita Reykjavíkur ("OR")
HS Orka hf ("HS") 
Hawesville | Kenergy Corporation ("Kenergy") | Through December 31, 2023 | Variable rate based on market prices 
Sebree | Kenergy | Through December 31, 2023 | Variable rate based on market prices 
Mt. Holly | South Carolina Public Service Authority | Through December 31, 2018 | Variable rate based in part on a cost of service charge and in part on natural gas prices 
Helguvik | OR | Approximately 25 years from the dates of each phase of power delivery | Variable rate based on the LME price for primary aluminum 

Electrical power represents one of the largest components of our cost of goods sold. We may enter into forward contracts or other hedging arrangements to mitigate our electrical power or natural gas price risk, but did not hold any such contracts as of December 31, 2016. The paragraphs below summarize the sources of power and the long-term power arrangements for each of our operations.
Grundartangi. Power is currently supplied to Grundartangi from hydroelectric and geothermal sources under long-term power purchase agreements with HS, Landsvirkjun and OR at prices indexed to the price of primary aluminum, which provides a natural hedge of our largest production cost.  Beginning in November of 2019, our contract with Landsvirkjun (covering approximately 30% of our current power requirements at Grundartangi) will be priced based on the market price for power in the Nord Pool power market, the trading market for power in the Nordic countries and certain other areas of Europe. These power purchase agreements expire on various dates from 2023 through 2036 (subject to extension). Each power purchase agreement contains take-or-pay obligations with respect to a significant percentage of the total committed and available power under such agreement. 
Hawesville. CAKY is party to a power supply arrangement with Kenergy and EDF Trading North America, LLC (“EDF") which provides market-based power to the Hawesville smelter. Under this arrangement, the power companies purchase power on the open market and pass it through to Hawesville at Midcontinent Independent System Operator ("MISO") pricing plus transmission and other costs. The power supply arrangement with Kenergy has an effective term through December 2023. The arrangement with EDF to act as our market participant with MISO has an effective term through May 2018, extending year to year thereafter unless a one year notice is given.
Sebree. Century Sebree is party to a power supply arrangement with Kenergy and EDF which provides market-based power to the Sebree smelter. Similar to the arrangement at Hawesville, the power companies purchase power on the open market and pass it through to Sebree at MISO pricing plus transmission and other costs. The power supply arrangement with Kenergy has an effective term through December 2023. The arrangement with EDF to act as our market participant with MISO has an effective term through May 2018, extending year to year thereafter unless a one year notice is given.
Mt. Holly. CASC is party to a power agreement with the South Carolina Public Service Authority ("Santee Cooper") for power to the Mt. Holly smelter. Under this contract, 25% of Mt. Holly's electric power requirements is supplied from Santee Cooper's generation at cost-of-service based rates. The remaining 75% of Mt. Holly's electric power requirements is supplied from third-party generation at rates based on natural gas prices. The agreement with Santee Cooper has a term through December 31, 2018; the current third party supply contract has a term through December 31, 2017. Each of these agreements can be terminated by Mt. Holly on 60 days' notice. 
Mt. Holly's inability to access the open market for 100% of its power requirements significantly impacts its ability to be competitive in the aluminum industry and puts its continued operation at risk. As a result of such uncompetitive power prices, Mt. Holly has already curtailed 50% of its production capacity. In January 2017, we filed an antitrust lawsuit against Santee Cooper seeking damages and injunctive relief, including the ability to purchase 100% of Mt. Holly's power from the open 
6

market. See Item 1A Risk Factors — "If we are unable to enter into a long term, market-based power arrangement for Mt. Holly, we may choose, or be forced, to curtail operations at the plant."
Helguvik. Nordural Helguvik is party to a power agreement with OR for a portion of Helguvik’s expected power requirements to the Helguvik project.  The agreement would provide a portion of Helguvik’s power at LME-based variable rates and contains take-or-pay obligations with respect to a significant percentage of the total committed and available power under such agreements.  The first stage of power under the OR power purchase agreement (approximately 47.5 MW) became available in the fourth quarter of 2011 and is currently being utilized at Grundartangi. The agreement contains certain conditions to OR’s obligations with respect to the remaining phases. We are in discussions with OR with respect to such conditions and other matters pertaining to this agreement. In November, 2016, an arbitration panel ruled that Nordural Helguvik's power agreement with HS Orka hf ("HS") was no longer in force. See Item 1A Risk Factors — "If we are unable to procure a reliable source of power, the Helguvik project may be further delayed or ultimately may not be feasible which could increase the cost of the project and could expose us to other risks, some of which may not be foreseeable at this time.” 
See Note 15 Commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information concerning our power arrangements. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had 1,741 employees. 
Labor Agreements 
The bargaining unit employees at our Grundartangi, Hawesville and Sebree smelters and our Vlissingen carbon anode facility, representing approximately 63% of our total workforce, are represented by labor unions.  Our employees at Mt. Holly are not represented by a labor union.
A summary of our key labor agreements is provided below:

Facility | Organization | Term 
Grundartangi | Icelandic labor unions | Through December 31, 2019
Hawesville | USW | Through April 1, 2020 
Sebree | USW | Through October 28, 2019 
Vlissingen | FME | Through June 1, 2018 

Approximately 83% of Grundartangi’s workforce is represented by five labor unions, governed by a labor agreement that establishes wages and work rules for covered employees. The current labor agreement is effective through December 31, 2019. 
100% of Vlissingen's workforce is represented by the FME. The FME negotiates working conditions with trade unions on behalf of its members. The current agreement with the FME is effective through June 1, 2018.
Approximately 54% of our U.S. based workforce is represented by the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union ("USW"). CAKY's Hawesville employees represented by the USW are under a collective bargaining agreement that expires on April 1, 2020. Century Sebree's employees represented by USW are under a collective bargaining agreement that expires on October 28, 2019.
Competition
The market for primary aluminum is global, and demand for aluminum varies widely from region to region.  We compete with U.S. and international companies in the aluminum industry as well as with materials such as steel, copper, carbon fiber, composites, plastic and glass, each of which may be substituted for aluminum in certain applications.
Our U.S. facilities benefit from the proximity to our U.S. customer base, allowing us to capture the Midwest regional delivery premium and providing a competitive advantage in freight costs over our competitors. The proximity to our customers also allows our Hawesville and Sebree plants to deliver a portion of their production in molten form, saving casting costs, and providing a competitive advantage over other potential suppliers. 
7

In Iceland, our proximity to European markets provides a competitive advantage for Grundartangi including logistical benefits compared to our competitors outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). As a member of the EEA, Iceland has duty free access to these European markets. 
For additional information, see Item 1A Risk Factors — "We may be unable to continue to compete successfully in the highly competitive markets in which we operate."
Financial Information about Segments and Geographic Areas
We operate in one reportable segment, primary aluminum.  Additional information about our segment reporting and certain geographic information is available in Note 19 Business segments to the consolidated financial statements included herein.  
Environmental Matters
We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate.  We have spent, and expect to continue to spend, significant amounts for compliance with those laws and regulations.  In addition, some of our past manufacturing activities have resulted in environmental consequences that require remedial measures.  Under certain environmental laws, which may impose liability regardless of fault, we may be liable for the costs of remediation of contaminated property, including our current and formerly owned or operated properties or adjacent areas, or for the amelioration of damage to natural resources. We believe, based on currently available information, that our current environmental liabilities are not likely to have a material adverse effect on Century.  However, we cannot predict the requirements of future environmental laws and future requirements at current or formerly owned or operated properties or adjacent areas or the outcome of certain existing litigation to which we are a party.  Such future requirements or events may result in unanticipated costs or liabilities that may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.  More information concerning our environmental contingencies can be found in Note 15 Commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included herein.
Intellectual Property
We own or have rights to use a number of intellectual property rights relating to various aspects of our operations. We do not consider our business to be materially dependent on any of these intellectual property rights.
Disclosure Pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act 
Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (“ITRA”), effective August 10, 2012, added a new subsection (r) to Section 13 of the Exchange Act, which requires issuers that file periodic reports with the SEC to disclose in their annual and quarterly reports whether, during the reporting period, they or any of their “affiliates” (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act) have knowingly engaged in specified activities or transactions relating to Iran, including activities not prohibited by U.S. law and conducted outside the U.S. by non-U.S. affiliates in compliance with applicable laws. Issuers must also file a notice with the SEC if any disclosable activity under ITRA has been included in an annual or quarterly report.
Because the SEC defines the term “affiliate” broadly, our largest stockholder may be considered an affiliate of the Company despite the fact that the Company has no control over its largest stockholder’s actions or the actions of its affiliates. As such, pursuant to Section 13(r)(1)(D)(iii) of the Exchange Act, the Company hereby discloses the following information provided by our largest stockholder regarding transactions or dealings with entities controlled by the Government of Iran (“the GOI”):
During the year ended December 31, 2016, non-U.S. affiliates of the largest stockholder of the Company (“the non-U.S. Stockholder Affiliates”) entered into sales and purchase contracts for agricultural products, metals, minerals, oil and oil products with, or for delivery to or from Iranian entities wholly or majority owned by the GOI. The non-U.S. Stockholder Affiliates performed their obligations under the contracts in compliance with applicable sanction laws and, where required, with the necessary prior approvals by the relevant governmental authorities.
The gross revenue of the non-U.S Stockholder Affiliates related to the contracts did not exceed the value of USD $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. 
8

The non-U.S. Stockholder Affiliates do not allocate net profit on a country-by-country or activity-by-activity basis, but estimate that the net profit attributable to the contract would not exceed a small fraction of the gross revenue from such contract. It is not possible to determine accurately the precise net profit attributable to such contracts.
The contracts disclosed above do not violate applicable sanctions laws administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control, and are not the subject of any enforcement action under Iran sanction laws.
In compliance with applicable economic sanctions and in conformity with US secondary sanctions, the non-U.S. Stockholder Affiliates expect to continue to engage in similar activities in the future. 
The Company and its global subsidiaries had no transactions or activities requiring disclosure under ITRA, nor were we involved in the transactions described in this section. As of the date of this report, the Company is not aware of any other activity, transaction or dealing by it or any of its affiliates during the year ended December 31, 2016 that requires disclosure in this report under Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act.
