Our Mission
Our mission is to secure the digital world through Intelligent Identity.
Overview
Ping Identity is pioneering Intelligent Identity. We enable secure access to any service, application or application program interface (“API”) from any device. Our Intelligent Identity Platform can leverage artificial intelligence (“AI”) and machine learning (“ML”) to analyze device, network, application and user behavior data to make real-time authentication and security control decisions, enhancing the user experience. Our platform is designed to detect anomalies and automatically insert additional security measures, such as multi-factor authentication, only when necessary. We built our platform to meet the requirements of the most demanding enterprises. Our platform can be deployed across cloud, hybrid and on-premise infrastructures, offers a comprehensive suite of turnkey integrations and is able to scale to millions of identities and thousands of cloud and on-premise applications in a single deployment.
​
Enterprises are undergoing digital transformation as they seek to create new revenue streams, transition business models and increase customer engagement. Concurrently, enterprises are becoming more distributed as the adoption of cloud, mobile and the Internet of Things (“IoT”) moves data, applications and access requirements beyond the traditional network perimeter. These enterprises must contend with an evolving cyber-threat landscape, new privacy directives and stringent regulatory requirements. As a result, enterprises require Intelligent Identity solutions that proactively ensure the right user has authorized access to resources at the appropriate time.
​
Our Intelligent Identity Platform can secure all primary use cases, including customer, workforce, partner and IoT. For example, enterprises can use our platform to enhance their customers’ user experience by creating a single ID and login across web and mobile properties. For the year ended December 31, 2019, 42% of our subscription revenue was derived from the customer use case. Enterprises can also use our platform to provide their workforce and commercial partners with secure, seamless access from any device to the applications, data and APIs they need to be productive. Enterprises are increasingly using our platform to manage and authenticate IoT devices, such as connected vehicles and consumer devices.
​
Our Intelligent Identity Platform is comprised of six solutions that can be purchased individually or as a set of integrated offerings for the customer, workforce, partner or IoT use case:
​

● | secure single sign-on (“SSO”);
--+-------------------------------


● | adaptive multi-factor authentication (“MFA”);
--+----------------------------------------------


● | security control for applications and APIs (“Access Security”);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


● | personalized and unified profile directories (“Directory”);
--+------------------------------------------------------------


● | data governance to control access to identity data (“Data Governance”); and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | AI and ML powered API security (“API Intelligence”).
--+-----------------------------------------------------

We have spent over a decade building a comprehensive suite of turnkey integrations designed to ensure that enterprises can use our platform to secure their applications wall-to-wall, facilitating easier deployment and rapid time-to-value.
​

We sell our solutions via a subscription model through a direct sales force, with increasing influence from our channel partners. We also utilize channel partners and system integrators to assist our customers in the implementation process. Our SSO, Access Security and Directory solutions typically replace legacy and homegrown systems. We also have significant greenfield opportunities with our MFA, Data Governance and API Intelligence solutions and, increasingly, the IoT use case.
​
Our land and expand strategy targets enterprises with a specific use case and solution or solution package, and then seeks to grow our footprint with additional use cases, identities, solutions and solution packages. The success of our strategy is validated by our strong dollar-based net retention rates, which were 116% and 115% at December 31, 2018 and 2019, respectively, and our growing number of large customers. At December 31, 2019, we had 38 customers with greater than $1,000,000 in ARR, an increase of 52% from 25 customers at December 31, 2018. Additionally, our customers with ARR over $250,000 increased from 202 at December 31, 2018 to 232 at December 31, 2019, representing a year-over-year growth rate of 15%. The increase of 30 net customers with ARR greater than $250,000 for the 2019 fiscal year is comprised of 13 new customers and 17 existing customers that had ARR grow to exceed $250,000 in 2019. Our total customers increased from 1,284 at December 31, 2018 to 1,361 at December 31, 2019. We have seen strong market demand for our cloud-based offerings and from enterprises deploying our solutions across the customer use case. A number of our customers deploy a combination of our solutions across multiple business units, functions and use cases in their initial purchase. For definitions of ARR and dollar-based net retention rate and descriptions of how we calculate these metrics, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
​
Our customers include many of the world’s largest enterprises, including over 50% of the Fortune 100. These customers are security-focused, and typically operate in regulated industries, have hybrid IT infrastructures, require turnkey integrations and have demanding scalability requirements. Our solutions secure 12 of the 12 largest U.S. banks (measured by assets), 8 of the 10 largest bio-pharmaceutical companies (measured by revenue), 7 of the 10 largest healthcare plans (measured by revenue) and 5 of the 7 largest U.S. retailers (measured by revenue). Our customer base is diversified, with no one customer or reseller accounting for more than 5% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019.
​
Since our inception, we have been an innovator in identity. We pioneered the concept of Intelligent Identity, which leverages AI and ML to analyze device, network, application and user behavior data to secure access and enhance the user experience. We founded Ping Identity with the vision of enabling enterprise security in a highly-connected world, replacing legacy security controls such as web gateways, virtual private networks (“VPNs”) and firewalls. We contributed to or co-authored many of the open identity standards such as SAML, OAuth, SCIM and OpenID Connect, which form the foundation of our industry. We have consistently been recognized as a leader in the Identity and Access Management (“IAM”) industry by Gartner and KuppingerCole.
​
Our Growth Strategy
The key elements of our growth strategy include:
​

● | Increase Sales to Existing Customers. We believe there are significant upsell and cross-sell opportunities within our existing customer base by adding identities and use cases and selling new solutions and solution packages. We have a strong track record of growing sales to our existing customers, as evidenced by our dollar-based net retention rates, which were 115% and 116% at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Innovate and Enhance our Offerings. We intend to continue investing in research and development to enhance our existing solutions, add new solution packages and deployment options and expand use cases, such as IoT. We believe these emerging devices present a significant opportunity for us as the number of IoT identities and human-to-machine and machine-to-machine connections continue to increase. Additionally, we may from time to time assess acquisition opportunities to supplement our organic development of new solutions or capabilities.

--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | flexible plugin architecture; and
--+----------------------------------


● | advanced multi-region and multi-master replication for low latency data access.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Data Governance. Our Data Governance solution provides centralized, fine-grained control over access to sensitive identity and device data across use cases. This enables organizations to restrict internal and external applications from accessing specific identity attributes such as social security numbers, credit card numbers, billing addresses or the entire user profile. Data access policies can evaluate attributes and preferences of the profile being requested, data from other repositories and information about the application and user making the request. Our Data Governance solution enables enterprises to comply with a broad range of regulatory requirements, such as the General Data Protection Regime (the “GDPR”), by restricting data that a user has not consented to share and denying access to personal information that applications and users do not need to perform their tasks. Our advanced Data Governance features include:
​

● | centralized policy controls via XACML and JEXL to govern data access;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | customer management of opt-in/opt-outs and preferences;

● | API threat detection and blocking; and
--+---------------------------------------


● | deployment in-line or to the side of API gateways.
--+---------------------------------------------------

Our Technology
Our technology has been developed to the highest standards for security, performance, scale and interoperability. Our platform is built on the following core tenets:
​

12





● | Open Standards. We pioneered open identity standards that reduce the cost and complexity of interoperability and integration between IT vendors and partners. We also participated in the creation of many of the Internet Engineering Task Force standards in the identity space and continue to support the evolution and creation of new standards.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Turnkey Integrations. We provide a broad range of out-of-the-box adapters for “first-mile” and “last-mile” integration to cloud and on-premise applications and other systems. For example, we integrate with major enterprise identity systems, such as CA Technologies (now Broadcom), IBM, Oracle and Microsoft, as well as environments and application platforms such as Apache, Java, IIS, NGINX and WebSphere. In addition, we provide an extensive set of SaaS and social identity connectors that provide full integration with API functions. For example, our ServiceNow integration leverages over 20 user attributes. We also have out-of-the-box integrations with a variety of cloud-based and on-premise data sources, adaptive authentication providers and security and intelligence service providers.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Our API Intelligence solution utilizes our proprietary AI/ML capabilities to continuously inspect, report and act on all API activity. We are in the process of leveraging and expanding these AI/ML capabilities across our broader platform to deliver Intelligent Identity security based on device, network, application and user behavior data instead of manual rules and policies. Currently, our core identity and access management solutions can be deployed with AI and ML capabilities that we license from a third party. However, we do not actively market or sell the AI and ML capabilities of these solutions. Our platform’s ultimate goal is to deliver password-less, zero-login capabilities to secure access and enhance user experience. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Business — We rely on software and services from other parties. Defects in or the loss of access to software or services from third parties could increase our costs and adversely affect the quality of our solutions.”
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Uptime and Availability. We provide critical uptime and offer advanced redundancy features such as off-line modes to ensure services are available even when internet connectivity is lost. Our multi-tenant cloud-based offering is hosted in multiple regions around the world for redundancy and continuity. Our maintenance windows do not require any downtime, and our platform has delivered over 99.9% uptime across our customer base over the past 12 months.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Scalability and Performance. Our platform can scale to millions of identities and thousands of cloud and on-premise applications in a single deployment.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Self-service. Self-service is becoming increasingly important as IT and IAM teams with limited resources seek to provide centralized IAM to the entire enterprise. The ability for developers to directly integrate identity into their applications accelerates the adoption of identity within the enterprise.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Security by Design. We integrate security into all of our solutions. Our security analysts maintain the security of our solutions by monitoring core services, both corporate and customer-facing, for indications of attack or compromise. We partner with trusted third party security firms to perform full-scope assessments and additional architectural reviews of our solutions. We also engage with third-party audit firms to perform SOC2 Type II audits, and ISO 27001-2013 certification of our security program.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Sales and Marketing
Sales
​
We sell our solutions primarily through direct sales. We have a stratified direct sales organization that is organized by customer size and the type of solution and deployment. Within our sales organization, our strategic account executives focus on the largest and most complex enterprises that typically purchase multiple products or deployment options. In addition, we have account executives that target less complex enterprise customers that typically purchase a single solution or deployment option initially.

13




​
Our direct sales are enhanced by collaboration with our channel partners in sourcing new leads, aiding in pre-sale processes such as proof of concepts, demos or requests for proposals and reselling our solutions to customers, as well as collaboration with our system integrators and technology partners. We also leverage a number of our channel partners and system integrators to provide the implementation services for some of our larger and more complex deployments, significantly increasing the time-to-value for our customers and maximizing the efficiency of our go-to-market efforts. For the year ended December 31, 2019, 55% of our new business was influenced by channel partners.
​
Marketing
​
We focus our marketing strategy on building brand recognition through thought leadership and differentiated messaging that communicates the business value of our platform. Our efforts include content marketing, social media, SEO, events and public and analyst relations. We convert this brand awareness into our pipeline through campaigns that integrate digital, social, web and field marketing tactics aimed at adding new customers and cross-marketing our solutions into our existing customer base. We host user conferences in select cities around the globe to tap into the power of our passionate customer base and our broader ecosystem. We also founded and host the leading identity industry conference called Identiverse. Identiverse is held annually and attendees include architects, IAM professionals, IT administrators, developers, security professionals and CISOs, as well as technology vendors, system integrators, industry analysts and thought leaders.

We continue to invest in our solutions across our development centers in: Denver, Colorado; Austin, Texas; Tel Aviv, Israel; Vancouver, Canada; and Bangalore, India.
​
Intellectual Property
​
Our success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely on copyrights and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, employment agreements and proprietary information and invention assignment agreements, trademarks and patents to protect our intellectual property rights.
​
We control access to, and use of, our solutions and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers and partners, and our software is protected by U.S. and international copyright and trade secret laws. Despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets and proprietary rights through intellectual property rights, licenses and confidentiality agreements, unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software and technology, and such risks may increase as we attempt to expand into jurisdictions where such rights are less easily enforced, or are more subject to reverse engineering or misappropriation due to local legal requirements.
​
As of December 31, 2019, we had 16 issued United States patents and 8 patent applications pending in the United States relating to certain aspects of our technology. Our issued United States patents expire between December 14, 2031 and July 31, 2036. We cannot assure you whether any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims. Any of our 

15




existing patents and any that are issued in the future may be contested, circumvented, found unenforceable or invalidated, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing them. In addition, we have international operations and intend to continue to expand these operations, and effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries.
​
Competition
​
We face competition from (1) legacy providers, (2) cloud-only providers and (3) homegrown solutions.
​
Legacy providers include Broadcom, IBM and Oracle, among others. These providers generally designed their solutions when enterprise applications were monolithic and on-premise. Their solutions utilize proprietary architectures, which require customized features and integrations to scale. Today, these solutions have the reputation of being complex, costly and increasingly fragile. Thus, legacy providers often struggle to offer a single comprehensive solution that spans all IT environments, including cloud and on-premise.
​
We also compete with cloud-only providers, such as Okta and OneLogin, that primarily focus on the workforce use case. These providers have solutions that are generally geared towards small and medium-sized businesses that have IT infrastructures hosted entirely in the cloud. Large enterprises typically do not have cloud-only infrastructures, and while many are moving components of their IT environments to the cloud, we believe the majority of applications and workloads will continue to reside on-premise. Thus, a cloud-only IAM solution cannot deliver a single comprehensive solution to enterprises that provides wall-to-wall coverage across their complex hybrid IT environments.
​
Microsoft also competes in our market and has tied its identity services to both Azure and its Office365 offerings. However, we partner with Microsoft to provide SSO, security control and adaptive MFA where non-Microsoft environments require integration or independence is preferred. Microsoft’s integration and interoperability with our solutions benefits enterprises while providing optionality and choice.
​
We believe the principal competitive factors in the IAM market include: (1) the ability to address all primary use cases from one platform; (2) the ability to deploy in large, complex hybrid IT environments; (3) the ability to integrate easily with all applications (cloud and on-premise); (4) technology uptime, reliability, scalability and performance; (5) the ability to support open standards; and (6) customer, technology and platform support. We believe we compete favorably on these factors.
