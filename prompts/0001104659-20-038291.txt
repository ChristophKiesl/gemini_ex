Item 1. Business
Introduction
 
We are a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company on November 6, 2018 and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, amalgamation, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to in this report as our initial business combination.
 
While we may pursue a business combination target in any business, industry or geographical location, we have initially focused our search for a target in Argentina and/or Brazil. Both countries are recovering from years of macroeconomic and political instability, which discouraged investment and hindered growth. Although significant risks to the recoveries of these economies persist, we believe that these countries are characterized by strong long-term growth prospects. We have focused our search for a target in industries that we believe have favorable prospects and a high likelihood of generating strong risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. Targeted industries include, but are not limited to, the consumer, telecommunications and technology, energy, financial services and real estate sectors, which we refer to as the Latin America opportunity sectors.
 
We believe that recent volatility in Argentina has created a favorable backdrop for long-term investment opportunities. Many companies that we believe have attractive underlying fundamentals have been impacted by recent macroeconomic factors, potentially generating an advantageous entry point for investment. Consumption and real salaries have been negatively impacted by the very recent economic slowdown. We believe that improved consumption from future recovery of real salaries and foreign direct investment will drive further economic growth with positive tailwinds for valuation improvement.
 
Similarly, we believe that Brazil’s current government, which has entrusted economic and monetary policy to market friendly economists, will focus on stricter fiscal policies, initiatives to improve productivity, and liberalization of the economy aiming to put the country back on the path of sustainable development. Potential tax and productivity reforms, combined with a larger agenda of privatizations and concessions, may foster short-term economic environment and provide investment opportunities. We expect Brazil’s economic recovery will be driven by a variety of factors, including deleveraging across households and businesses, tax reforms to simplify a complex tax system and more favorable labor market conditions.
 
We expect the economic and political developments in both Argentina and Brazil to generate multiple attractive targets in the Latin America opportunity sectors.
 
In December 2018, we issued 7,187,500 founder shares to our sponsor for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.003 per share. In March 2019, our sponsor transferred to our independent directors an aggregate of 90,000 founder shares at the same price originally paid for such shares.
 
The registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-230347) for our initial public offering was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on April 3, 2019. On April 8, 2019, we consummated our initial public offering of 28,750,000 units, including the issuance of 3,750,000 units as a result of the underwriters’ full exercise of their over-allotment option, with each unit consisting of one ordinary share and one-half of one warrant. Each whole warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one ordinary share at an exercise price of $11.50 per share. The units in our initial public offering were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating total gross proceeds of $287,500,000.
 
Simultaneously with the consummation of our initial public offering and the full over-allotment option, we consummated the private placement of an aggregate of 7,750,000 private placement warrants to our sponsor at a price of $1.00 per private placement warrant, generating total gross proceeds of $7,750,000 (the “private placement”).
 
A total of $287,500,000 (or $10.00 per unit sold in our initial public offering) of the net proceeds from our initial public offering and the private placement was placed in a trust account established for the benefit of our public shareholders (the “trust account”), with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and has been invested only in U.S. “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of our initial business combination within the required time period and (ii) the distribution of the trust account, as described below, except that interest earned on the trust account can be released to pay our taxes payable and for dissolution expenses up to $100,000, as applicable.

Transaction costs amounted to approximately $5.9 million, consisting of $5.25 million of underwriting fees and approximately $638,000 of other costs. In addition, the underwriters of our initial public offering agreed to defer approximately $9.2 million in underwriting commissions, which amount will be payable upon consummation of our initial business combination, if consummated.
 
As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $1.6 million outside of the trust account, approximately $4.6 million of investment income available in the trust account to pay for tax obligations (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), and a working capital surplus of approximately $1.6 million.
 
Our units began trading on April 4, 2019 on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) under the symbol “RPLA.U.” Commencing on April 18, 2019, the ordinary shares and warrants comprising the units began separate trading on the NYSE under the symbols “RPLA” and “RPLA WS,” respectively. Those units not separated continue to trade on the NYSE under the symbol “RPLA.U.”
 
On August 15, 2019, we received a written notice (the “Notice”) from the staff of NYSE Regulation indicating that we are not currently in compliance with Section 802.01B of the NYSE Listed Company Manual (the “Manual”), which requires us to maintain a minimum of 300 public shareholders on a continuous basis. Pursuant to the Notice, we are subject to the procedures set forth in Sections 801 and 802 of the Manual. We submitted a business plan that demonstrates how we expect to return to compliance with the minimum public shareholders requirement within 18 months of receipt of the Notice. We anticipate that we will satisfy this listing requirement within such time period once we consummate our initial business combination. On October 24, 2019, we were notified by the staff of NYSE Regulation that the NYSE’s Listings Operations Committee agreed to accept our business plan, and we are currently subject to quarterly monitoring for compliance with such plan. Our ordinary shares, warrants and units will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE during the cure period, subject to our compliance with the NYSE’s other applicable continued listing standards, and will bear the indicator “.BC” on the consolidated tape to indicate noncompliance with the NYSE’s continued listing standards.
 
Management Expertise
 
Our management team is led by our founders, Edmond Safra, Gregorio Werthein and Gerardo Werthein. Our founders collectively have decades of experience investing in, managing and operating companies in Argentina across a variety of industries. Our founders also have decades of experience investing in Brazil. We believe that our management team has established a favorable reputation in the Latin American business community, built strong partnerships with first-tier international institutional investors, developed a vast network of corporate relationships and acquired deep knowledge of the region’s economic fundamentals and regulatory environment. In addition to our management team’s direct involvement, we have recruited and will continue to recruit industry experts to evaluate potential investment opportunities. We believe that our management team’s extensive network in the region will allow them to attract, select and retain high-performing members of management.
 
Edmond Safra, our Co-Chief Executive Officer, is the founder and President of EMS Capital LP, a New York-based investment manager with over $1.9 billion in assets under management as of December 31, 2019. Mr. Safra is also a Vice President and director of M. Safra & Co., Inc., a multi-asset class investment management company that serves as the family office of the late Moise Y. Safra. He has extensive experience investing across various strategies, asset classes, sectors and geographies. He has been an active investor in the public and private markets in Brazil for the past two decades and in Argentina for the past six years, most recently including private real estate development projects in Buenos Aires.
 
Gregorio Werthein, our Co-Chief Executive Officer, currently serves as a board member and an executive committee member of Transportadora de Gas del Sur SA (NYSE: TGS). Previously, he served as an Executive Managing Director of Werthein Group (2012 to August 2019), and also as a board member of GNNW S.A., Experta ART and Cachay S.A. 
 
Gerardo Werthein, our Advisory Board Member, has been a principal and shareholder of Werthein Group since 1990. Over the last three decades, Mr. Gerardo Werthein has played an instrumental role in Werthein Group, executing more than fifty M&A and corporate finance transactions in Argentina. Mr. Gerardo Werthein’s transaction experience includes:
 

• | the acquisition, together with the Sielecki family, of a 23.3% stake in BankBoston Argentina (later known as Standard Bank Argentina) in April 2007, with the remaining 76.7% stake being acquired by Standard Bank. The combined investments represented total consideration of approximately $170 million. In November 2012, ICBC acquired an aggregate of 80% of Standard Bank Argentina for $600 million, which included the complete stakes of the Werthein and Sielecki families;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | the acquisition of a 48% stake in Telecom Argentina, the largest telecommunications company in Argentina, from France Telecom for $125 million in September 2003, an investment which Werthein Group partially exited in March 2011, when it sold a 10% stake for $145 million, and completely exited by May 2017 through share amortizations and dividend payments for approximately $470 million; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the acquisition of La Caja de Ahorro y Seguro, one of the largest insurance companies in Argentina, in 1994, an investment which Werthein Group exited in 2015.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Mr. Gerardo Werthein has held a variety of leadership positions, including Vice Chairman of the board of directors of Telecom Argentina from 2003 to 2017, where he negotiated and completed a $3.3 billion debt refinancing, one of the largest private debt restructurings in Argentina’s history. Mr. Gerardo Werthein also acted as the CEO of Holding Caja de Ahorro y Seguro from 1994 to 2009. Over his tenure as CEO, the company increased its participation in the market to become the largest insurance group in Argentina.
 
We have drawn and will continue to draw upon the extensive networks, relationships and investment personnel of our management team and our sponsor to identify, source, negotiate and execute an initial business combination in the Latin America opportunity sectors. Our management team has built these relationships over multiple decades of investment and operating experience in Latin America. We believe that the reputations of the members of our management team will make us a preferred partner for potential initial business combination targets. Furthermore, we believe that these relationships give us access to key resources to understand macroeconomic trends, government policies and reforms, regulatory frameworks, investor expectations and market sentiment in the region.
 
The past performance of our management team and their affiliates is not a guarantee (i) that we will be able to identify a suitable candidate for our initial business combination or (ii) of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate. You should not rely on the historical record of our sponsor, management team and their affiliates as indicative of our future performance. None of the members of our management team has any past experience with any blank check companies or special purpose acquisition companies.
 
Business Strategy
 
Our business strategy is to identify and complete our initial business combination with a company in the Latin America opportunity sectors. We believe that there is an opportunity to take advantage of the recent economic volatility in Argentina to acquire a high-quality, but undervalued, company or asset, as well as of the new economic environment in Brazil, and leverage our expertise to build a strong business with competitive advantages that have the potential to improve the target’s overall value proposition.
 
We believe our management team has significant experience:
 

· | identifying, sourcing, negotiating and executing acquisitions in the Latin America opportunity sectors;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | investing in, managing and operating companies across a variety of industries;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | attracting, selecting and retaining high-performing management teams with proven track records;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | developing and executing strategic business plans to grow companies, both organically and inorganically;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | partnering with other industry-leading players to increase sales and improve profitability, enhancing the competitive position of companies;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | implementing an optimized capital structure that enables companies to achieve their next phase of growth;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | accessing the capital markets, including local and international capital sources, across various business cycles; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | running successful and growing businesses throughout changing macroeconomic, legal, tax and regulatory environments.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our acquisition plan is to leverage our management team’s networks of potential transaction sources where we believe a combination of our management team’s industry relationships, knowledge and experience could effect a positive transformation or augmentation of existing businesses or assets. Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships that we believe will serve as a useful source of acquisition opportunities. We plan to leverage relationships with management teams of public and private companies, investment professionals at private equity firms and other financial sponsors, owners of private businesses, government bodies, investment bankers, restructuring advisers, consultants, attorneys and accountants, which we believe should provide us with a number of business combination opportunities.
 
Upon completion of our initial public offering, the members of our management team began communicating with their networks of relationships to articulate the parameters for our search for a target business and a potential business combination and began the process of pursuing and reviewing potentially interesting leads.
 
Acquisition Criteria
 
Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective targets for our initial business combination. We will use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. We expect to weigh potential upside from growth in the target business and an improved capital structure against any identified downside risks. We intend to focus on target businesses that we believe:

· | are leading players or high-quality assets within one of the Latin America opportunity sectors. We intend to seek a target that has a leading position, technology or product capability in the consumer, telecommunications and technology, energy, financial services and real estate sectors;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | are fundamentally sound with consistent operational performance and free cash flow generation. We expect to target a business that has historically exhibited profitability and strong cash flow generation. Our management team has a proven track record accelerating growth of companies with strong past performance;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | are well-suited for the volatility in local financial markets. We intend to seek targets that can thrive throughout volatile market conditions such as export-oriented businesses with global sales or where U.S. dollar-denominated revenues will be prioritized;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | are at an inflection point, such as requiring additional capital to achieve a growth strategy. We intend to look for targets that have clear opportunities for long-term sustainable growth, but which require our capital or expertise to execute a growth strategy;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | have the potential to further improve their performance under our ownership. We intend to seek targets where we believe we can improve company results by leveraging our transactional, financial, managerial and investment experience as well as our extensive networks and insights. We believe our management team has the right skills and capabilities to enhance companies’ results and consolidate competitive positions in their sectors;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | may benefit from capital markets access. We intend to seek a target that may benefit from being, or has the potential to become, a public company with an increased public profile, enhanced corporate governance and increased access to a more diversified pool of capital; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | exhibit unrecognized value and desirable returns on capital. We will look for targets that we believe have been undervalued by the marketplace based on our analysis and due diligence review.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our shareholder communications related to our initial business combination, which would be in the form of proxy solicitation or tender offer materials that we would file with the SEC.

Initial Business Combination
 
The rules of the NYSE require that our initial business combination must be with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in trust (net of taxes payable and excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting discount held in trust). We refer to this as the 80% of net assets test. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA, or from an independent accounting firm, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination.
 
We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the issued and outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to our initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our issued and outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If our initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses.
 
We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either (1) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the business combination or (2) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek shareholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement. Asset acquisitions and share purchases would not typically require shareholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares or seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association would require shareholder approval. We intend to conduct redemptions without a shareholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC unless shareholder approval is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement or we choose to seek shareholder approval for business or other reasons. We will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, solely if we seek shareholder approval, a majority of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares voted are voted in favor of the business combination.
 
We have until April 8, 2021 to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination within such time period, we will: (1) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (2) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, subject to lawfully available funds therefor, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses and which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law; and (3) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination by April 8, 2021.
 
Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.

Employees
 
We currently have three executive officers and do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that any such person will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the current stage of the business combination process.
Our Website
 
Our corporate website address is www.replayacquisition.com. The information contained on or accessible through our corporate website or any other website that we may maintain is not incorporated by reference into this report.
Periodic Reporting and Audited Financial Statements
 
We have registered our units, ordinary shares and warrants under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.
 
We will provide shareholders with audited financial statements of a prospective target business as part of any tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to shareholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, United States generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) or international financial reporting standards (“IFRS”), depending on the circumstances and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), or PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such financial statements in time for us to disclose such financial statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. While this may limit the pool of potential business combination candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.
 
We will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2020 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”). Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), as modified by the JOBS Act, and will remain such for up to five years. However, if our annual gross revenue is $1.07 billion or more, if our non-convertible debt issued within a three-year period exceeds $1 billion or the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million on the last day of the second fiscal quarter of any given fiscal year, we would cease to be an emerging growth company as of the following fiscal year. As an emerging growth company, we have elected, under Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act, to take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards.
