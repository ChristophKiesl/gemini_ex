Item 1. Business. 
 Since our inception in 2012, our mission has been to help clients and communities meet their environmental goals and needs. Today, we have emerged as one of the fastest growing companies in a highly fragmented and growing $1.25 trillion global environmental industry. 
 We service complex, recurring and often non-discretionary environmental needs of our diverse clients across our three business segments: Assessment, Permitting and Response; Measurement and Analysis; and Remediation and Reuse. Examples of our services include: 
 

Our industry is highly fragmented with no single market leader. By focusing on environmental solutions, we believe we are uniquely positioned to become a leading platform in the industry. We provide a diverse range of environmental services to our private and public sector clients across the life cycle of their needs—whether they are launching new projects, maintaining operations, decommissioning operations, rehabilitating assets, managing the impacts of climate change or responding to unexpected environmental disruption. Our integrated platform has been a catalyst for our organic growth and we have built on this platform through strategic acquisitions. 
 Innovation is core to our strategy. The world’s environmental challenges continue to grow in number, scope and complexity, and mounting public pressure and regulatory changes continue to drive demand for better information and solutions. We focus on innovation in order to improve the quality of information we can provide to clients (such as identifying variations of Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, in water) and provide better solutions to their environmental needs (such as the efficient removal of PFAS from contaminated water). We intend to continue innovating by investing in research, development and technology (directly and through strategic partnerships) to develop better solutions for our clients. We believe these investments—together with our investments in geographic expansion, sales and marketing initiatives, environmental service offerings and strategic acquisitions—will continue to distinguish us in the marketplace.

Our revenue and earnings are highly resilient. We are not dependent upon any single service, product, political approach or regulatory framework. We also serve a diverse set of approximately 5,000 clients across a wide variety of end markets and geographies within the private and public sectors. Funding for our services is typically non-discretionary given regulatory drivers and public health concerns. As a result, our business is positioned to be less susceptible to political and economic cycles. 
 Our financial success is driven by both strong organic and acquisition-driven growth. When combined with the annual organic revenue growth of our April 2020 acquisition, The Center for Toxicology and Environmental Health, L.L.C., or CTEH, our environmental response business, for the full year 2020, but excluding CTEH’s revenues from projects contributing more than $4 million of revenue, our organic revenue growth for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 17%. Excluding CTEH, our organic revenue growth was 4% in the year ended December 31, 2020. See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview—Key Factors that Affect our Business and Results—Organic Growth.” In addition, our acquisitions of selected environmental services firms have expanded our geographic reach and service offerings. 
 Our environmental focus and reputation have enabled us to attract and retain some of the most highly sought-after employees in our industry. These employees have contributed to our organic growth, differentiated brand, reputation and culture. 
 We have experienced strong growth over the past few years. Our revenue increased from $114.8 million in 2016 to $328.2 million in 2020, representing a 30% compound annual growth rate, or CAGR. Over the same period, we had a net loss of $8.9 million and $57.9 million in 2016 and 2020, respectively, and our adjusted EBITDA increased from $7.3 million in 2016 to $54.5 million in 2020, representing a CAGR of 65%. See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Information” for a discussion of non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation thereof to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. 
 Our approach has allowed us to successfully scale our business, and we believe we are well positioned to continue our trajectory and market leadership as we address the growing environmental needs of our clients and communities. 
 The Industry 
 The environmental industry is large, growing, highly fragmented and subject to complex regulatory frameworks. Federal, state, provincial and local environmental regulations dictate compliance requirements that create demand for environmental services. Increasingly, public and stockholder interest in environmental sustainability is also driving prudent management of our shared and finite environmental resources. 
Global Environmental Industry is Large and Growing 
 According to an October 2019 Environmental Industry Study prepared by Environmental Business International, Inc., or EBI, which we commissioned, the global environmental industry is estimated to be approximately $1.25 trillion, with over 60% of this industry concentrated in North America and Western Europe. The services within the industry which we currently offer represent a global market size of approximately $395 billion.
 According to EBI, our approximately $395 billion addressable global market is expected to grow 3.4% per year from 2018 through 2024. Positive growth is expected across all environmental sectors in the global market. 
 Public Demands, Industrial Activity, Climate Change and Regulations Each Increase Need for Environmental Services 
 Heightened public awareness and increasing stockholder demand for environmental sustainability has increased the need and demand for environmental services. Many companies around the world have implemented initiatives on Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility, or CSR, and Environmental, Social and 
 5

Governance, or ESG, making environmental impact a core factor in many business decisions. These initiatives are often focused on managing potential future risks, as opposed to past emphasis on compliance. 
 Steady increases in industrial activity and infrastructure investment, and the regulations underpinning these activities, are also driving demand for environmental services. In addition, environmental disruptions caused by climate change or aging infrastructure drive demand for environmental services. Infrastructure investments and environmental emergency responses often require substantial assessments, planning and/or permitting services in addition to environmental testing or remediation services. Industrial operations, including oil, gas and chemical production, require testing and monitoring throughout the manufacturing process to ensure continuous regulatory compliance. Testing and monitoring are typically recurring processes throughout the industrial production process. 
 In addition to current regulations, future regulatory changes may also drive demand for additional or different environmental services. In the United States, Canada and Australia, the federal, state, provincial and local regulations targeting air and water quality management, waste and contaminated soil management or reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, each of which drives portions of our business, have been implemented over many decades, and are subject to change and challenge. 
 We expect these trends to continue and to spur growth in the environmental services industry. 
 The Environmental Services Industry is Highly Fragmented and Complex 
 According to EBI, thousands of firms operate in the markets in which we operate. Several larger firms provide environmental services as a small part of their broader product portfolio. However, much of the industry is served by small firms that provide limited service offerings addressing specific regulations and geographies. It is difficult for small firms to expand given the technical expertise, accreditations and licenses necessary to serve a broad array of clients and industries across geographies and service lines. These dynamics create significant barriers to entry in our industry. 
 As clients increasingly seek effective, customized and streamlined solutions to address their impact on the environment, they will increasingly value environmental solutions providers with scale. Providers able to address the full lifecycle of environmental concerns and needs, particularly for companies and organizations with multi-jurisdictional footprints, and are subject to complex regulatory frameworks, will continue to enjoy competitive advantages. 
 Competitive Strengths 
 We are a leading global brand focused on environmental services with a resilient and recurring revenue base anchored on long-term client relationships. Our focus on innovation, our ability to acquire and integrate leading companies, our highly accredited businesses and our experienced and credentialed team provide our clients with quality solutions and create significant barriers to entry. Our competitive strengths include: 
Resilient and Recurring Revenue Across Political and Economic Cycles 
 Our revenues are resilient over political cycles primarily because our business is not dependent on any one regulatory framework. We have a diversified geographic footprint, and we often help clients comply with multiple regulatory frameworks. As a result, we are often insulated from major shifts in individual federal, state, provincial and local regulations. While federal governments set certain minimum standards, many state, provincial or local policies are more stringent. In addition, state, provincial and local governments often define how environmental standards will be met or implemented. These different levels of government often serve as counterweights to each other and minimize the risk and impact of sudden shifts in policy. 
 We believe our diverse portfolio of services and end markets position us to be resilient across economic cycles. For example, clients use our services when launching development projects, while maintaining ongoing operations, when decommissioning operations, and when remediating the release of contaminants into air, water or soil. These client activities can occur at different times for different industries, regardless of economic cycles. In addition, many of our service offerings are typically non-discretionary and our projects often create significant 
 6

economic value for our clients (in the form of reduced liability, cost savings or revenue streams), further incentivizing the continued use of our services. Furthermore, community demands, such as those for PFAS- free water, continue regardless of political or economic cycles. As another example, during the COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders, most of our services were deemed essential and continued to be requested by clients. Though there were some delays in the scheduling of certain services due to travel restrictions or social distancing requirements, particularly during the second quarter, the environmental and/or regulatory implications of not completing environmental projects has resulted in a resilient demand for our services.
Clients generating over 90% of our revenue in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 repeated in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. Similarly, clients generating over 90% of our revenue in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 repeated in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. 
 Long-term Relationships Across a Large and Diversified Client Base 
 We currently serve approximately 5,000 clients. We have long-standing relationships with a number of Fortune 1000 companies and government entities, and our legacy businesses have been operating for as long as a century. 
 We provide services to our largest clients across multiple projects and/or multiple locations, and the number of services we provide to these clients varies from one project per year to several dozen projects per year. Our revenues are not, however, dependent on any one single client or industry. In fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, our largest client, which was not a client in 2019, represented approximately 7% of revenue, with these revenues derived from over twenty separate projects. Our top twenty clients represented less than 36% of our revenue in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. 
 We serve clients in a wide variety of end markets within the private and public sectors, and no single private sector industry comprised more than 18% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. Approximately, 86% from the private sector and approximately 14% from the public sector. 
 Differentiated Technology, Processes and Applications 
 Our focus on innovation and on accessing and developing proprietary technologies, processes and applications is a key competitive advantage and differentiator of our brand and services. These innovative tools complement our professionals’ years of experience, technical expertise and industry knowledge and bolster the solutions we provide our clients. We have consistently used technology and process advancements across geographies, to accelerate growth and to address our clients’ environmental concerns. 
Significant Scale with Global Reach 
 Clients value our ability to provide coordinated, diversified services across many geographies, including domestic and international geographies that reach beyond our approximately 70 locations. Through our strategic acquisitions and targeted recruiting, we have achieved a scale that combines knowledge of local environments and regulations with global reach, which positions us to win and execute our projects globally. As a result, we expect to continue to capture market share. 
 Our global footprint supports our ability to gain market share by attracting new clients and by expanding offerings to our existing clients. As clients seek environmental solutions providers able to address the life cycle of their environmental concerns and needs across jurisdictions, we believe our footprint and diversified portfolio of services position us well to attract and retain clients, and expand our relationships with those clients over time. 
 Our scale has enabled us to leverage our investments in technology, innovation and process resources in a way that we believe will continue to support our industry leadership position. 
 Proven Ability to Identify, Execute and Integrate Acquisitions 
 We have acquired and integrated over 50 businesses over the last eight years, and we intend to continue selectively acquiring companies in our industry. Key characteristics of past and expected acquisition targets include 
 7

quality management teams, complementary services, access to differentiated technologies and extension of our geographic reach. 
 We believe we add value to the businesses we acquire by introducing a culture focused on teamwork and innovation, and by providing superior operating discipline. The majority of owners and key personnel of our acquired businesses have remained with us, in large part due to our ability to effectively integrate them into our existing team. As a result of our focus on integration, our acquired businesses typically begin contributing to our organic growth after the first year following acquisition. Post-acquisition performance is driven by revenue synergies and operating leverage through corporate cost allocation over a larger base, as demonstrated by our consistent organic revenue growth and improving margin profile. 
 We maintain a robust acquisition pipeline primarily driven by word of mouth and existing relationships. As we have to-date, we intend to continue acquiring businesses at disciplined valuation levels. We believe our approach to acquisitions will enable us to continue creating substantial value. 
 Experienced Management Team Coupled with a Team-Centric Culture 
 Our leadership and culture define who we are. Our senior leadership team includes industry pioneers who have led a number of industry organizations and are considered among the foremost experts in the environmental services industry. The average tenure of our operational leadership in the environmental industry is 25 years. Our key executives and board members also have extensive experience in growing businesses both organically and through acquisitions. 
 Our management and employees share a passion for the environment and a compassion for each other. We again received the National Safety Council Award in 2020 in recognition of our excellence in safety across our business. In addition, our employees’ dedication to supporting each other has led to the establishment of The Montrose Community Foundation, a non-profit organization formed and operated by our employees for the benefit of our employees. Through its volunteer board, The Montrose Community Foundation uses employee donations to provide resources to our employees in times of need. Our employees’ dedication of personal time and resources solely for the benefit of their colleagues exemplifies our team-oriented culture. 
 We believe it is our strong management team and our culture that enables us to attract and retain our exceptional talent. 
 Growth Strategies 
 Our goal is to become a global leader in the growing environmental services industry. We expect to continue growing organically by expanding existing client relationships, developing new client relationships and investing in sales and marketing infrastructure. We also expect to continue growing by strategically acquiring companies in our highly fragmented industry. Our proven ability to recruit and retain industry leaders and innovators will further contribute to our growth. We believe these growth strategies position us well to capture market share from competitors and benefit from industry growth. 
Continue Organic Growth 
  
• | Expand existing local relationships into national and international relationships: Many of our clients have a broad national and international presence. Historically, these clients have often managed their environmental programs locally using regional service providers. However, these clients often have a desire to standardize their programs across geographies, which requires their environmental services providers to have the scale, reach and capabilities to match their footprint. Meeting this need is challenging for many in our industry given their regional focus and limited service offerings. Our geographic reach, strong relationships and reputation for quality enable us to address our clients’ ever-growing and diverse needs in a way most of our regional competitors cannot. As a result, we have generated many intra-client referrals and won new business with existing clients in geographies historically served by competitors. We intend to continue to expand into new geographies where our existing clients operate.

• | Sell additional environmental services to existing clients: Many of our clients have historically hired us for a specific environmental service such as environmental audits or tests. As we have diversified our service offerings, and as clients have grown accustomed to the quality and consistency that our teams provide, clients have increasingly engaged us to perform additional environmental services. As a result, we have won new business historically served by competitors that are typically single service-line focused. We expect to continue cross-selling additional environmental services to existing clients with multidimensional needs, including where we can replace services provided in-house.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Deploy innovative technologies, processes and applications to address unmet client needs: Newly identified contaminants, public health concerns and changes to regulations have created and are expected to continue to create unmet environmental service needs for many of our current and prospective clients. Our investments in innovation—both stand-alone and through partnerships—have better equipped us to address these client needs in a manner that differentiates us from our competitors. We have won and expect to continue winning business from both existing and new clients because of the innovative solutions we offer. Internally, we are also establishing carbon footprint reduction goals and committing to minimizing our own impact on the environment.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Provide sales training and build a targeted sales team to drive growth and acquire new clients: We have started investing in our dedicated sales capabilities and intend to continue these efforts. We are providing sales training to our technical practitioners, investing in customer relationship management systems and building a targeted sales force to help identify new clients and capture market share from competitors. Sales training and a targeted sales force will also enable us to accelerate growth initiatives with existing clients, including through geographic expansion and cross-selling of additional services.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Build Montrose brand awareness and marketing capabilities: We believe we are uniquely positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for environmental services. Even though we have not historically invested in marketing our brand, our business has expanded both geographically and in our service offerings in response to client needs. For example, consumer demand for clean water continues to generate demand for our water treatment technology and service both in the United States and internationally, including in Europe where we have begun our expansion and anticipate continuing to do so over the upcoming years. Client demand for renewable energy sources also has resulted in us creating and building out our Waste-to-Energy (biogas) service line. We intend to build brand awareness, expand field marketing efforts and create relevant content to showcase our ability to address environmental needs for clients and communities. We believe our brand development efforts will be very additive to our sales and organic growth initiatives.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Capture environmental service opportunities arising from federal, state or provincial spending and stimulus measures: Government stimulus packages may include incentives and guidelines to target improved water treatment and water infrastructure, soil remediation and land development, air quality improvement, and infrastructure development initiatives (which often require environmental assessments). These types of initiatives can both directly or indirectly increase demand for our environmental services and would be additive to our organic growth opportunities.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Utilize our expertise in environmental toxicology and emergency response to support COVID-19-related preparation and response plans: Through the acquisition of CTEH, we have expanded our toxicology and environmental response capabilities. Though these capabilities are typically used during environmental emergencies that often arise from aging infrastructure or from the impacts of climate change, they are also utilized in response to pandemics such as COVID-19. As a result, and given our expertise in helping businesses plan for and respond to disruptions, our scientists and response teams have helped clients navigate their preparation for and response to COVID-19 infections. Though our business strategy is not focused on pandemic response, we believe CTEH’s COVID-19 related response opportunities will accelerate our growth for the short term and provide cross-selling opportunities with new and existing clients.

Pursue Strategic Acquisitions 
 The environmental services industry is highly fragmented and has no single leading brand. Through strategic acquisitions, we can continue to accelerate our growth, brand development and market leadership. Over the last eight years, we have acquired and integrated over 50 businesses that have provided us with talent, complementary services, access to differentiated technologies and geographic reach. Many of our acquisitions were initiated with 
 9

personal introductions given our favorable reputation in the market. We believe our ability to identify, execute and integrate acquisitions and retain talent has been and remains a key driver of our operational and financial success. 
 Our pipeline of potential future acquisitions is robust, and we plan to continue pursuing acquisitions to enhance our strategic and competitive positions in existing and new markets. 
 Recruit and Retain Industry Leaders 
 Given the highly technical nature of many of our services, our ability to recruit and retain talent enhances our ability to capture market share. We believe our mission and focus on the environment, our emphasis on ownership opportunities for our employees and our team of renowned industry leaders creates a competitive advantage when competing for talent. 
Segments 
 We provide environmental services to our clients through our integrated solutions across three business segments—Assessment, Permitting and Response, Measurement and Analysis and Remediation and Reuse. 
 

Assessment, Permitting and Response. Our Assessment, Permitting and Response segment provides scientific advisory and consulting services to support environmental assessments, environmental emergency response and recovery, toxicology consulting and environmental audits and permits for current operations, facility upgrades, new projects, decommissioning projects and development projects. We work closely with clients to navigate the regulatory process at the local, state, provincial and federal levels, identify the potential environmental and political impacts of their decisions and develop practical mitigation approaches, as needed. In addition to environmental toxicology, and given our expertise in helping businesses plan for and respond to disruptions, our scientists and response teams have helped clients navigate their preparation for and response to COVID-19 infections. 
 We believe this segment maintains a number of competitive advantages, including: 
  
• | strong relationships with key private and public sector clients with needs for multiple environmental services, facilitating cross selling opportunities;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a core team of approximately 550 employees, including well-known technical experts with longstanding client relationships and significant experience across the key disciplines in the segment;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our proven ability to help clients navigate regulatory, public and legal scrutiny; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a national reach established by having successfully assessed and permitted hundreds of projects in jurisdictions across the United States.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This segment, which is primarily based on a time and materials, or T&M, revenue model, generated approximately 30% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. 
 Measurement and Analysis. Our Measurement and Analysis segment is a market leader in testing and laboratory services based on 2018 annual revenue according to EBI. Supported by over 900 employees, our highly credentialed teams test and analyze air, water and soil to determine concentrations of contaminants as well as the toxicological impact of contaminants on flora, fauna and human health. Our offerings include source and ambient air testing and monitoring, leak detection and advanced analytical multi-media laboratory services such as air, stormwater, wastewater and drinking water analysis. 
 10

We believe we have a variety of sustainable competitive advantages in this market, including: 
  
• | a reputable brand;
--+-------------------


• | a market leadership position as (1) one of the most prominent air testing companies in the United States and (2) the sixth largest U.S. environmental laboratory network each based on EBI’s estimates of 2018 revenue; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our unique technologies, processes and applications, including the ability to detect air contaminants in real time at ultra-trace concentrations (parts per trillion or parts per quadrillion).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This segment, which is primarily based on a fixed price and, for out-of-scope work, a T&M revenue model, approximately 46% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. 
 Remediation and Reuse. Our Remediation and Reuse segment provides clients with engineering, design, implementation and operations and maintenance services, primarily to treat contaminated water, remove contaminants from soil or create biogas from waste. Nearly 300 of our employees, including engineers, scientists and consultants, provide these services to assist our clients in designing solutions, managing products and mitigating environmental risks and liabilities at their locations. We do not own the properties or facilities at which we implement these projects or the underlying liabilities, nor do we own material amounts of the equipment used in projects. 
 We believe this segment’s competitive advantages include: 
  
• | advanced technologies and our owned and licensed intellectual property portfolio, such as our patented water treatment systems and proprietary process to optimize the generation of biogas;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a team with industry-leading experts and several patent-generating PhDs; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | local expertise and capabilities with respect to unique soil, sediment and water table characteristics and contamination types.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This segment, which is primarily based on a fixed price and, for out-of-scope work, a T&M revenue model, approximately 24% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 through a combination of project-based work and recurring, monthly fee operating & maintenance (O&M) revenue stream.

This table illustrates a summary of our segments. 
 


Differentiated Technology, Processes and Applications 
 Advanced technology and innovative processes and applications are key competitive advantages in the environmental services industry. Our team of industry leaders are integral drivers of our investments in differentiated services. As our brand and environmental platform grows, our experts are increasingly able to deploy innovative technologies that address our clients’ needs, further differentiate our services and create new barriers to entry. Recent examples of our investment and development activities are related to air monitoring equipment, technology and software to detect ultra-low concentrations of pollutants and triangulate to sources of emissions and water treatment solutions to remove various emerging contaminants from water. 
Strategic Acquisitions 
 We operate in a growing and highly fragmented market with thousands of potential acquisition targets. Given our success in identifying, executing and integrating more than 50 acquisitions since our inception in 2012, we believe we can continue to selectively acquire additive businesses. We seek to acquire businesses at disciplined valuation levels that: 

(1) | are led by high quality management teams,
----+------------------------------------------


(2) | expand our portfolio of services,
----+----------------------------------


(3) | provide access to differentiated technologies or processes, and
----+----------------------------------------------------------------


(4) | extend our geographic coverage.
----+--------------------------------

 We have personnel specifically dedicated to identifying acquisition targets, exploring acquisition opportunities, negotiating terms and overseeing acquisition and post-acquisition integration. Our in-house 
 12

acquisition team has established extensive relationships throughout the industry and maintains and regularly re-evaluates an established pipeline of potential acquisition opportunities, largely driven by word of mouth and personal introductions. 
 Since January 1, 2018 we have acquired the following eighteen businesses:

We believe we add value to the businesses we acquire by introducing a team-centric culture focused on innovation, implementing award-winning safety programs and providing superior operating discipline, risk management, cash management, financial controls, information technology and human resources support. Each 
 13

business we acquire is systematically integrated into our systems and processes, thereby creating revenue synergy opportunities and operating leverage. 
 We believe that the acquisition of CTEH provides opportunities for deepened relationships with clients, additional long-term revenue synergies and operating leverage. The clients served by the CTEH business provide opportunities for us to provide field testing, laboratories services and/or environmental remediation services not historically offered by CTEH. Similarly, the additional services and software provided by CTEH can be offered to our other clients. In addition, the combined platform allows much of our existing corporate infrastructure to be utilized across a larger base business. 
 Clients 
 We provide environmental services to approximately 5,000 clients operating in a number of sectors and industries, including the oil & gas, utilities, construction, midstream energy, commodities, petrochemical and tobacco industries, as well as local, state, provincial and federal government entities. We have long-term, and through our legacy companies, decades-old relationships. We serve a diversified client base in both the private and public sectors. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, our revenues were derived approximately 86% from the private sector and 14% from the public sector. 
 We have minimal client concentration with the largest client representing approximately 7% of revenue for fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, with these revenues derived from over twenty separate projects. However, as a result of the nature of CTEH’s environmental response business, our Assessment, Permitting and Response segment may at times experience higher customer concentration levels based on the severity, duration and outcome of certain types of environmental emergencies for which we provide response services. For example, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, 58% of CTEH’s revenues were attributable to three customers, each of whom engaged CTEH in connection with either a significant environmental incident or COVID-19 response support. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors.” 
 Contracts 
 Our client contracts are generally fixed price, including milestone-based fixed price contracts in our Remediation and Reuse segment, and, for out-of-scope work, T&M based. Our Assessment, Permitting and Response client contracts are generally T&M based. Our client contracts vary from purchase-order based contracts utilizing standard terms and conditions to comprehensive master services agreements with terms of multiple years. In accordance with industry practice, most of our contracts, both in the private and public sector, are subject to termination at the discretion of the client, as discussed in greater detail in Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business and Industry—We do not always have long-term agreements with our clients and attempts by clients to change the terms of or terminate their relationships with us may have a negative impact on our business.” In such situations, our contracts typically provide for reimbursement of costs incurred and payment of fees earned through the date of termination. 
Competition 
 We operate in a competitive, but fragmented, market. No single company or group of companies dominates across the entire environmental services market in which we operate. Our primary competitors are divisions of large companies, various small companies which generally are limited to a specific service and focused on a niche market or geographic region and our clients’ own in-house resources. We believe that few, if any, of our competitors currently provide the full range of environmental solutions that we offer. Instead, each of our segments has competitors with narrower service offerings and/or geographies.

We compete based on the following factors, among others: reputation, safety track record, quality, geographic reach, price, technical capabilities, access to innovative technology and breadth of services. We believe that our current capabilities position us to compete favorably in each of these factors. 
 The environmental services industry has significant barriers to entry which would make it difficult for new competitors to enter the market. These barriers include: 
  
• | highly technical, costly and time-consuming accreditation and licensure requirements;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ability to deploy/services client needs across geographies;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | advanced quality and safety programs and mandated scores;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | the complex and geographically varying regulatory landscape that requires significant industry experience;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the need to acquire or develop innovative technologies and processes that are acceptable to regulatory bodies, which in our case occurred over many years of client and regulator engagements and at significant research and development expense; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | emphasis by large clients on size and scale, length of relationship and past service record.

Intellectual Property 
 We utilize a combination of intellectual property safeguards, including patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and licenses, as well as employee and third-party confidentiality agreements, to protect our intellectual property. However, we do not principally rely on any single piece of intellectual property, nor is any single piece of intellectual property material to our financial condition or results of operations. 
Seasonality 
 Because demand for environmental services is not driven by specific or predictable patterns in one or more fiscal quarters, our business is better assessed based on yearly results. In addition, our operating results experience some quarterly variability. Excluding the impact of revenues and earnings from new acquisitions, and excluding revenues from COVID-19 response services, we typically generate slightly lower revenues and lower earnings in the first and fourth quarters and higher overall revenues and earnings in the second and third quarters. Historically, quarterly variability has been driven by weather patterns, which generally impacts our field-based teams’ ability to operate in the winter months, particularly in parts of North America. As we continue to grow and expand into new geographies and service lines, quarterly variability may be impacted and may deviate from historical trends. 
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 1,850 employees, including approximately 1,500 full-time employees in the United States. Approximately 95% of our full-time employees work in our U.S. operations and approximately 5% work in foreign operations. None of our facilities are covered by collective bargaining agreements. 
Human Capital Resources
 At the heart of our employee-centric model is our focus on recruiting, developing, and retaining top talent and skills. We have built a contemporary, talent recruitment and management platform that has dynamic, automated workflows, enabling us to successfully recruit, hire and develop top talent while meeting all compliance requirements. Having a diverse, fair and inclusive workforce is core to our values and our job board platforms attract a diverse pool of candidates to our organization. Additionally, we continued to build our employer brand at universities by attending careers fairs in 2020.
 With changing trends in the workforce, in 2020 we revised our employee handbook to include the following enhancements and achieved 100% acknowledgement:
 15

 
• | Expanded parental leave to all full-time employees to support families during birth or adoption
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Implemented floating holiday options so employees can choose to celebrate holidays meaningful to them
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enhanced time off benefits such as sick time to include part-timers and formalized jury duty, bereavement, and voting time to assist with work-life balance
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Added an educational reimbursement, aimed at helping employees develop skills and increase knowledge in their chosen field
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Diversity, Fairness and Inclusion 
 In 2020, we established a Diversity, Fairness and Inclusion, or DF&I, task force and program. In doing so, we have committed to the establishment and formalization of employee development policies that support diversity, inclusion, fairness, and equality. The DF&I task force is promoting awareness of company talent, is working with our CEO to communicate about social issues, has advocated for changes in policies such as our vacation policy and our increase in COVID-19 leave time, and continues to support various diversity, fairness and inclusion efforts globally.
 We LEAD 
 In January 2020, our senior female leadership, Chairman of the Board, and CEO established the Montrose Environmental Group Women Empowering Leadership, or WeLEAD, program. The group’s mission is to foster the recruitment, retention and professional development of women at our company. Our WeLEAD program is working to develop an alliance of women leaders across Montrose, with a key emphasis on mentorship and talent development.  Since the program’s inception, a formal pay parity effort was launched across the organization to ensure equal pay across job titles and functions, both for existing employees and for new hires going forward, several prominent female leaders have been promoted into senior roles within the Company’s science and engineering departments, and policy recommendations have been submitted to ensure the development and retention of female talent (e.g., parental leave policy changes).
 Training and Development
 Montrose University, our collection of employee development efforts, aims to provide employees and leaders with the tools and skills they need to succeed and advance personally and professionally. Our Leadership Development Program within Montrose University is focused on developing contemporary leadership competencies via on-line and in-person sessions. Our key operations and sales executives participated in our formal Leadership Coaching program. We also conducted 360-degree feedback surveys to identify key leader strengths and development opportunities. Finally, we continuously take steps to ensure that our new hires and existing employees complete our training programs and review all of our training activities and curricula annually to incorporate any necessary updates.
Pay Equity
 We strive to maintain pay equity by identifying and eliminating pay gaps and making salary decisions that are based on employee performance and that are equitable, fair, and transparent regardless of employee race, gender, or other personal characteristics. We also maintain pay equity by developing and maintaining a market-aligned salary structure with what we believe are competitive salary ranges, benefits and incentive eligibility for each job level and in each geography where we operate.  
Equity Incentives
 As part of our dedication and commitment to motivating and rewarding our employees, we offer equity incentives to a large number of our employees under our stock incentive plans.  We believe strongly in employee ownership of Montrose and we believe our approach creates value for our clients, for our employees, for the communities in which our employees live, and for our shareholders.

Engagement
 Our employees’ dedication to supporting each other has led to the establishment of The Montrose Community Foundation, a non-profit organization formed and operated by our employees for the benefit of our employees. Through its volunteer board, The Montrose Community Foundation uses employee donations to provide resources to our employees in times of need. Our employees’ dedication of personal time and resources solely for the benefit of their colleagues exemplifies our team-oriented culture.
The Montrose Community Foundation 
 In 2016, our employees formed and have since independently operated The Montrose Community Foundation, a non-profit organization funded by personal donations from our employees for the benefit of our employees. The Foundation, through its volunteer board, confidentially provides resources to our employees in times of need. Our employees’ dedication of time and resources to this organization is a testament to our team-centric culture.
Health, Safety and Wellness
 We offer a spectrum of benefit plans to meet the needs of our diverse employee population, including health, dental, vision, life insurance, and various supplemental plans.
 In 2020, we established a COVID-19 task force to help keep employees informed on the virus, its impacts, and methods to minimize and manage infections. Flexible working arrangements, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) resources and a 24/7 emergency response hotline were made available to our teams across the globe. We also launched two initiatives: the COVID-19 Time Off Grant and the COVID-19 Vacation Donation Program, which served as time off resources to help those who had been personally affected by the virus and/or those who needed to care for others who had been affected by the virus.
 Our culture of safety and wellbeing of our employees is supported by a dedicated team of health and safety professionals. 
 Across our organization, we demonstrate our strong commitment of safety to our employees with frequent communications and systems that actively engage employees and encourage all employee's input and involvement.  The foundation of the safety program focuses on ensuring that our employees are sufficiently trained to perform their job duties, have properly operating equipment including correct Personal Protective Equipment such as gloves, eyewear and respirators, job hazards are properly identified, mitigated and planned for prior to work commencement, and the entire process is documented to validate and improve performance. All employee time associated with safety preparation and training is fully paid to employees.  Current initiatives include driving safety, job safety planning and job hazard analysis.  Further to our commitment to our employees, we employ a third party occupational medical provider that is available to all employees 24/7 to discuss occupational health concerns. Finally, all of our employees have complete stop work authority and can stop any project or task if there is any concern about a safety issue without any fear of retribution.
 Our dedication and commitment to safety have resulted in us again receiving the National Safety Council Award in 2020 in recognition of our excellence in safety across our business.
 Compliance with Federal, State/Provincial and Local Laws 
 Our operations subject us to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in jurisdictions where we operate, including the United States, Australia and Canada. Such laws and regulations relate to, among other things, the discharge of wastewater, the discharge of hazardous materials into the environment, the handling, storage, use, transport, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and solid, hazardous and other wastes and workplace health and safety. These laws and regulations impose a variety of requirements and restrictions on some of our operations and the services we provide. The failure by us to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines, penalties, enforcement actions, third-party claims, damage to property or natural resources and personal injury claims, requirements to investigate or cleanup property or to pay for the costs of investigation or cleanup or regulatory or judicial orders requiring corrective measures, and could negatively impact our reputation with clients. 
 17

We are not aware of any pending environmental compliance or remediation matters that, in the opinion of management, are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. 
 A portion of our revenue is derived from working with the U.S. federal government. When working with U.S. governmental agencies and entities, we must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of contracts. Internationally, we are subject to various government laws and regulations (including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and similar non-U.S. laws and regulations). To help ensure compliance with these and other laws and regulations, our employees are sometimes required to complete tailored ethics and other compliance training relevant to their position and our operations.
