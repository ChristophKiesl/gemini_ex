Item 1. Business
Company History
 
We were incorporated, in Delaware, as Pensare Acquisition Corp, a special purpose acquisition company (“SPAC”) on April 7, 2016 for the purpose of entering into one or more mergers, share exchanges, asset acquisitions, stock purchases, recapitalizations, reorganizations or other similar business combinations with one or more target businesses.
 
On April 7, 2020 (the “Computex Closing Date”), we consummated a business combination transaction (the “Computex Business Combination”) in which we acquired Stratos Management Systems, Inc. (“Computex”), a private operating company that does business as Computex Technology Solutions. The Computex Business Combination was consummated pursuant to the terms of an amended agreement originally entered into on July 25, 2019. In connection with the closing of the Computex Business Combination, the Company changed its name to American Virtual Cloud Technologies, Inc.
 
On December 1, 2020 (the “Kandy Closing Date”), we acquired the Kandy Communications business (hereafter referred to as “Kandy” or “Kandy Communications”) from Ribbon Communications, Inc. and certain of its affiliates (“Ribbon”), by acquiring certain assets, assuming certain liabilities and acquiring all of the outstanding membership interests of Kandy Communications LLC.
 
Our Business
 
Kandy Communications
 
As a provider of cloud-based enterprise services, Kandy deploys a global carrier grade cloud communication platform that supports the digital and cloud transformation of mid-market and enterprise customers across any device, on any network, in any location. Based on a powerful, proprietary multi-tenant, highly scalable, and secure cloud platform, our platform supports unified communications as a service (“UCaaS”), communications platform as a service (“CPaaS”) and contact center as a service (“CCaaS”) including pre-built customer engagement tools, based on web real-time communication technology (“WebRTC technology”) enabling frictionless communications. Further, we support rapid service creation and multiple go to market models including white labelling, multi-tier channel distribution, enterprise direct, and self-service via our SaaS (software as a service) web portals.
 
Our cloud-based, real-time communications platform, enables service providers, enterprises, software vendors, systems integrators, partners and developers to enrich their applications and their services with real-time contextual communications empowering the API (Application Programming Interface) economy. With Kandy’s platform, companies of various sizes and types can quickly embed real-time communications capabilities into their existing applications and business processes, providing a more engaging user experience.
 
While the cloud communications business is focused on highly complex, medium and large enterprise deployments, the customer experience is augmented by our managed services capabilities. In addition, our strategic partnerships with companies such as AT&T, IBM, and Etisalat give us access to a marquee customer base and the ability to sell end to end solutions.
 
Computex
 
Our Computex subsidiary, which has been in business for over 30 years, is an award-winning multi-brand technology solutions provider to small, midsize and large global customers. With a team of talented architects and engineers who specialize in the delivery of private and hybrid data centers, enterprise networking solutions, cloud, cybersecurity, managed services and unified communications, we provide a comprehensive and integrated set of technology solutions, along with an extensive hardware, software and value-added service offering. Our managed services and managed security services provide customers 24x7 access to a world class service desk, network operations centers and security operations center through which we maintain, upgrade and troubleshoot IT systems. Our security operations center (“SOC”) provides comprehensive cybersecurity services to proactively protect customers from cyber threats and, in case of a breach, our managed detection and response services provide incident response, remediation and recovery services. The breadth of this offering enables us to offer our customers a complete technology solution. We design best-fit solutions for our customers, based on a thorough assessment of their needs. Leveraging our relationships with industry leading technology partners, we also assist our customers with the procurement of suitable hardware and software to fit their customized needs.
 
1

 

Our hardware offerings are sourced from a network of leading manufacturers, and include data storage, desktops, servers, and other hardware.
 
Third party software and maintenance offerings include licensing, licensing management, software solutions and other services. We offer a full suite of value-added services, which typically are delivered as part of a complete technology solution, to help our customers meet their specific needs. Our solutions range from configuration services for computer devices to fully integrated solutions such as virtualization, collaboration, security, mobility, data center optimization and cloud computing. We also offer complementary offerings such as installations, warranty services and certain managed services including remote network services and data center monitoring. We believe our software and service offerings are important growth areas for us.
 
Our professional and managed services include managed IT services, virtualization, storage, networking and data center services. As part of these services, we offer customized solutions for business continuity, back-up and recovery, capacity on-demand, regulatory compliance and data center best practice methodologies as well as infrastructure as a service (“IaaS”) and software as a service (“SaaS”). Our customers utilize our solutions to optimize their current and planned investments in IT infrastructure and data centers. We believe the breadth of our service offering and our consultative approach to working with our clients distinguishes us from other providers.
 
We believe Computex is well-diversified across verticals (industries), technology solutions offerings and procurement partners from whom we procure products and software for resale. Our sales teams consist of seasoned account executives and regionally focused sales support teams who work within assigned territories to provide customized solutions to our customers. Our sales teams are supported by industry leading technologists who design end to end solutions and who take projects from design, to implementation, to management. Leveraging an extensive network of OEMs and distributors, we are able to direct-sell a diverse selection of products and software to our growing customer base in the form of packaged software or as licensed products and services.
 
We have developed an infrastructure that enables us to deliver our IT solutions on a service-agnostic basis as to technology platform and location, through a flexible, customer-focused delivery model which spans three datacenter environments (customer-owned, co-location, and the cloud). By optimizing our customers’ use of secure, energy efficient and reliable data centers combined with a comprehensive suite of related IT infrastructure services, we are able to offer our customers highly customized solutions that address their needs for data center availability, data management, data security, business continuity disaster recovery and data center consolidation, as well as a variety of other related managed services.
 
Growth Strategy
 
The acquisition of Kandy serves to complement the services provided by Computex by giving us the opportunity to provide a full suite of UCaaS, CPaaS, and CCaaS products to serve the rapidly growing cloud communications market. Customers today demand a highly reliable, secure, and scalable communications platform along with a world class customer experience. We offer end-to-end services spanning connectivity, managed IT solutions, managed services, and cloud communications, delivered by certified experts that provide exceptional white glove customer experiences to businesses, service providers, independent software vendors, and systems integrators. Our capabilities around adjacent technologies such as SD WAN (software-defined networking in a wide area network), SASE (secure access service edge) and cybersecurity, combined with our own software platform, position us as a premier white label provider of choice for UCaaS, CPaaS and CCaaS solutions.
 
The acquisition of Kandy also enables us to provide carrier grade global cloud communications that address the needs of medium and large enterprises. As the velocity of public, hybrid, and private cloud communications continues, we believe we are in a position to focus on execution while competitors in our space need to concentrate on platform capabilities, global expansion and improved customer experience. Our world class, globally-deployed, carrier grade, white-labeled proprietary communications platform gives us the ability to solve customer communication needs. We believe our IP platform, growth trajectory, global marquee customer and partner base, should accelerate our go to market plans and enable us to expand our award-winning portfolio.

We have developed a clear go-to-market strategy that leverages our teams’ prior experiences and that utilizes multiple avenues to attack the total addressable market. Our goal is to accelerate current enterprise momentum, cross-sell into the Computex enterprise customer base, ramp up channel partner and strategic alliance sales with additional headcount, ramp up white label partner sales with additional head count, access certain enterprise customer leads and continue to grow our IT managed services. By “enterprise,” we mean a corporation or customer having over 1,000 employees.
 
In July 2019, AVCT entered into a contract with AT&T and formally joined the AT&T Partner Exchange®, building on AVCT management’s proven track record. Kandy also has strategic partnerships with major service providers such as Etisalat and IBM in addition to AT&T. We will continue to expand our strategic partnership network. Our strategy is to offer bundled, white-label, white-glove managed services targeted at mid-market, multi-location business customers, with a particular focus on offerings in the fast growing UCaaS industry. When we say mid-market, we mean companies with 100-1000 employees.
 
Computex-focused growth strategies include:
 
Strategies to grow organically by seeking to become our customers’ primary IT Solutions Provider
 
Regardless of the type of IT service that our customers require, whether those services relate to security requirements, on-premise solutions, cloud-based solutions or professional managed services needs, we seek to become their primary IT provider. As a result, we focus on providing excellent customer service, competitive pricing, and efficient and advanced professional services, while endeavoring to remain available to respond to their requests. Our managed security services provide customers with a comprehensive solution as technology continues to expand into more complex service offerings. Our cybersecurity managed services complete our portfolio to deliver a robust “as a service” model to our customers that provides IT and cybersecurity services to them via a contractual engagement, thereby providing us with monthly recurring revenue. Our experienced pre-sales engineers engage with customers in their search for advanced technologies. Our account executives, who are supported by experienced internal sales representatives, are trained on broad solutions capabilities with access to numerous category-focused subject matter experts, which allow them to take a consultative sales approach that focuses on our customers’ desired business outcomes. Such an approach enhances our ability to cross-sell our solutions.
 
Continue to focus on building our expertise
 
We focus on gaining top-level engineering certifications and expertise in the advanced technologies of our strategic partners. We also submit to rigorous vendor audits and certification processes each year that validate our capabilities. Our customers can harness this expertise as they seek to develop their cloud capabilities. We believe our ability to deliver advanced professional services benefits us in two ways. Firstly, we gain recognition from our strategic vendor partners, resulting in us becoming their preferred partner, which, in turn, can provide direct and referral sales opportunities for us, and which can also positively impact pricing. Secondly, within our existing and potential customer base, our advanced professional services are a key differentiator against competitors who cannot provide the products or advanced services for these key technologies nor can they provide such products and services across as many vendor product lines.
 
Investing in scalable managed services
 
We continue to invest in our profitable and scalable managed services and have built a team of focused sellers to strictly focus on driving monthly recurring revenue through subscription contracts. We plan to further invest and build capabilities that allow us to accelerate our MRR (monthly recurring revenue) growth. We have also invested in top tier security talent, and have acquired penetration testers, threat hunters and SOC analysts to boost our managed security offering. In addition, we have invested in a Security Operations Center, which complements our Network Operations Center. Currently, we provide our customers with 24 hour managed security services, such as managed advanced endpoint security, managed SIEM (security information and event management), security awareness and training programs. The success of our solutions portfolio is evident in the various awards and recognitions we have received including, national recognition from AT&T for our significant growth.

The building of our geographic footprint
 
We intend to increase our direct sales and go-to-market capabilities and actively seek to acquire new account relationships through face-to-face field sales, through digital outreach, through the leveraging of the relationships with our partners, and through targeted demand-generation activities that increase awareness to our solutions. We also seek to expand our customer base and geographic reach. Our managed services and managed security services capabilities allow us to deliver solutions to customers without geographic restrictions.
 
Strategies to improve operational efficiencies
 
We continue to invest in our internal technology infrastructure and software platforms to optimize our operations and engage in process re-engineering efforts to become more streamlined and cost effective. Recently, we separated our Network Operations Center and Security Operations Center into two separate, air gapped operational teams. We took this action to, among other things, better secure our clients’ information so that access to clients’ information is only granted to those operational team members that are working with that client.
 
Key Trends Affecting Our Business
 
We believe the following key trends present growth opportunities for our business:
 

● | Increasing need for third-party services. We believe that customers are relying on third-party service providers, such as Computex Technology Solutions, to manage significant aspects of their IT environment, from design, to implementation, to pre- and post-sales support, to maintenance, engineering, cloud management, security operations, and other services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Reduction in the number of IT solutions providers. Our view is that customers are seeking to reduce the number of solutions providers they engage, to improve supply chain and internal efficiencies, enhance accountability, improve supplier management practices, and reduce costs. In addition, enterprises are increasingly in need of global communications solutions through one service provider rather than multiple providers due to increasing network complexity, data privacy and security compliance. Further, they expect this connection to global communications networks to support UCaaS, CCaaS, and CPaaS use cases ubiquitously. As a result, customers are looking to find IT solutions providers that can provide a whole suite of solutions to meet their local and global IT needs.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Lack of sufficient internal IT resources at mid-sized and large enterprises, and scarcity of IT personnel in certain high-demand disciplines. We believe that IT departments at mid-sized and large enterprises are facing pressure to deliver emerging technologies and business outcomes but lack the properly trained staff and the ability to hire personnel with high in-demand disciplines such as security and data analytics. At the same time, the prevalence of security threats, increased use of cloud computing, software-defined networking, new architectures, rapid software development frameworks, the proliferation of mobile devices and bring-your-own-device (“BYOD”) policies; and the complexity of multi-vendor solutions, have made it difficult for IT departments to implement high-quality IT solutions.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Disruptive technologies are creating complexity and challenges for customers and vendors. The rapid evolution of disruptive technologies, and the speed by which they impact an organization’s technology platforms, has made it difficult for customers to effectively design, procure, implement and manage their own IT systems. Moreover, increased budget pressures, fewer internal resources, a fragmented vendor landscape and fast time-to-value expectations make it challenging for customers to design, implement and manage, efficient, secure and cost-effective IT environments. Customers are increasingly turning to IT solutions providers such as Computex Technology Solutions to implement complex IT offerings, including software defined infrastructure, cloud computing, converged and hyper-converged infrastructures, big data analytics, and flash storage.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Migration from on-premise communication solutions to cloud hosted services. The migration to cloud hosted services is in full swing with years of solid market growth. For years, on-premise PBX and Centrex carrier-hosted telephony switches dominated the market. In recent years, cloud communications technologies have eclipsed those functions which has led to lower human, capital and operational costs. The transformation to the cloud is accelerating. Complimenting those technologies with video, messaging and embedded communications is adding to revenue streams and productivity enhancements in the workplace. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Multi-Cloud Strategy. As cloud architectures and cloud-enabled frameworks, whether public, private, or hybrid, have become the core foundation of modern IT, we are focused on assisting our customers with their assessment, definition, deployment, and management of private and hybrid clouds that align with their business needs. This strategy leverages our strength in deploying private clouds, while also incorporating elements of the public cloud. By assessing our client’s applications, workloads and business requirements, among others, we are able to deploy solutions that leverage the best available technology platforms and consumption models. For example, we may build a private cloud solution to host mission critical applications, while utilizing a public cloud solution for development, collaboration, or disaster recovery. Our cloud strategy is tightly aligned with key strategic initiatives, including security, and digital workspace. 
● | Increasing trend away from the use of hard phones. Business communications are rapidly moving away from hard phones to work-from-anywhere-applications on desktops and mobile phones. Further, customers are rapidly evolving to communications that are embedded within applications and business process flows without context switching between applications which leads to increased productivity and contextual communications.

● | Increasing sophistication and incidences of IT security breaches and cyber-attacks. In recent years, cyber-attacks have become more sophisticated, numerous, and pervasive. During COVID, the threat landscape significantly evolved with customers’ workforce and data being more dispersed than ever. Organizations are finding it increasingly difficult to effectively safeguard their confidential and personal information from a constant stream of advanced threats, both internal and external. Moreover, cyber-threats have shifted from uncoordinated individual efforts to highly coordinated and well-funded attacks by criminal organizations and nation-state actors. For most organizations, it is no longer a matter of “if a cyber-attack will occur;” the question is “when” and “what impact will it have” on the organization. We believe our customers are focused on all aspects of cyber security, including information and physical security, intellectual property, and compliance requirements related to industry and government regulations. To meet current and future security threats, enterprises must implement security controls and technology solutions that leverage integrated services and products to help monitor, mitigate, and remediate security threats and attacks.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Customer IT decision-making is shifting from IT departments to line-of-business personnel. As IT consumption shifts from legacy, on-premise infrastructure to agile “on-demand” and “as-a-service” solutions, customer procurement decisions are shifting from traditional IT personnel to lines-of-business personnel, which is changing the customer engagement model and types of consultative services required to fulfill the needs of customers. In addition, many such services create recurring revenue streams paid for over a period of time, rather than paid for upfront.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Explosive growth in remote workforce needs. During COVID, we successfully supported thousands of IT users across several hundred customers and believe that there will be a large percentage of knowledge workers that will continue to work remotely. Our solutions, such as Branch Connect, provide comprehensive IT, UCaaS, CPaaS, CCaaS and cyber services to these remote workers in an easy to consume fashion via our robust platform.

Successor/Predecessor References
 
In the Computex Business Combination, AVCT was considered the acquirer and Computex was considered the acquiree and the Predecessor for accounting purposes. The Computex Business Combination, which was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, reflects a new basis of accounting that is based on the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed. In the consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K, we distinguish between the entity that existed before the Computex Closing Date (“Predecessor”) and the entity that existed on and after such date (“Successor”).
 
Major customers
 
The five top customers during the Successor period, the Predecessor period January 1, 2020 to April 6, 2020 and the Predecessor year ended December 31, 2019 accounted for 24%, 25%, and 26% of total revenue, respectively. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue in such periods.
 
Competition
 
Computex’s competitors are varied, offer a variety of solutions, and include:
 

● | IT departments of current and potential customers; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Supply chain vendors; 
● | Point of sale vendors; and 
● | Smaller companies that have developed or are attempting to develop partnerships with manufacturers and managed service solutions providers.

 
Example of such competitors include Presidio Inc., Ahead, Datalink Software LLC and CDW Corporation.
 
Despite the competition, we believe we possess certain attributes that differentiates us from our competitors. Our competitive strengths include:
 


● | Our Ability to Provide Complex, Multi-Vendor Technology Solutions to the Large Addressable Market which has Substantial Growth Opportunities Driven by Increasing IT Complexity
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We participate in the large IT market with a focus on the data center, network, cloud, security, virtualization, and emerging segments of the industry, facilitated by our professional and managed service solutions. We believe we are well-positioned in the complex high-growth IT solutions segment through our offering of services related to hybrid and public datacenter implementations, cybersecurity management, incident response and remediation, SD-Wan, IOT and complex network projects.
 
Our products and services target large enterprise companies, the roughly 37,000 middle market companies with revenues between $100 million and $2 billion, the approximately 96,000 state and local governmental organizations, large school districts, and the approximately 3,800 higher educational institutions in the U.S. We believe that IT departments within these organizations are unable, on their own, to provide the ever-increasing range of services to their end users, leading to an increased dependence on third-parties such as us, who can provide them with the complex, multi-vendor technology solutions that their businesses demand.
 
In the small to medium-sized business (“SMB”) segment, we believe there is demand for our services and we believe we will be able to use certain competitive advantages to capture a significant portion of the IT business in this segment through our IT sales and managed services.

● | A Broad and Diverse Customer Base Across a Wide Range of End Markets
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have a broad and diverse customer base of over 600 customers across a wide range of end-markets, including oil and gas, financial services, healthcare, education, state and local government, technology, retail, manufacturing and telecommunications. In addition, we are not reliant on any single customer in any given year and customarily our top customers change from year to year.
 

● | A Business Model that Serves the Entire IT Lifecycle
--+-----------------------------------------------------

 We believe we are a trusted IT advisor to our clients through our delivery of differentiated products and services that enable our customers to meet their increasingly complex IT requirements. We can provide complete, turn-key solutions aligned to the entire IT lifecycle starting with an assessment of the IT problem, designing and creating architecture solutions, assisting with the procurement of the required IT solution, assisting with the implementation of the solution and then providing on-going professional and managed services and cyber-security assistance.
 

● | A Deep Expertise in Advanced Technology in Cloud Services, Security, Digital Infrastructure and other Emerging IT Trends
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe our customers choose us for their complex IT infrastructure needs based on our track record of delivering top-tier solutions, offering value-added services, and our close relationships with both established and emerging vendors. We focus on obtaining and maintaining top-level engineering certifications for each of our strategic vendor’s most advanced technologies. We possess more than 500 certifications, which we leverage to help our customers achieve positive business outcomes. For example, we received our fourth Cisco Master Certification in July 2019. We are one of only 10 companies in the Americas, and one of only 16 companies worldwide, that hold these four certifications. This is one example of our high level of technical expertise and commitment to obtaining the industry’s highest level of certifications possible.
 

● | Our Strategic Ability to Design and Integrate Cloud Solutions Across Multiple Vendors
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe our expertise in architecting data center and cloud environments allows us to provide differentiated offerings that help our customers transition significant portions of their business—and sometimes all of their critical business workloads—to the cloud. Combined with our strong foundations in networking and security, we are uniquely poised to help customers adopt a multi-cloud strategy that utilizes our cloud cost management framework that helps them to overcome the inherent challenges. We also leverage our strategic partnerships with leading vendors such Cisco Systems, Nutanix, PureStorage, Amazon AWS, Dell EMC, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Microsoft Azure, NetApp, Palo Alto Networks, and VMware in conjunction with our professional, managed, and lifecycle services to help our customers achieve their desired business outcomes.
 

● | The Scalable IT Service Delivery that Our Personnel Provide
--+------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that our Company has been properly constructed with the correct ratio of technical experts, sales experts, and operational experts. More than two-thirds of our current employees are technical experts in their requisite fields, allowing us to customize solutions for customers of all sizes. The engineering talent we possess, coupled with the wide range of IT solutions that our talent covers, gives us a large competitive advantage around creating, implementing, and maintaining large-scale IT solutions. Our managed services department also relies on this pool of engineers to solve the toughest IT challenges for our customers.
 
All of Computex’s employees are full time and, therefore, we do not rely on a pool of independent contractors or other outsourced IT talent for the services provided by Computex. This advantage in personnel, which we call “brainware,” further differentiates us from many IT service providers. Our IT personnel also focus on ensuring a human component in every IT project in which we are involved, which results in creating meaningful long-term customer relationships.

Though we believe we have developed competitive differentiation through the breadth of our offering and our consultative approach to working with our clients, among others, in order to increase our market share, we must continue to respond promptly to economic models such as cloud subscription versus perpetual license, technological change and our competitors’ innovations. As a result, we can provide no assurance that we will not be required to make substantial additional investments in research, development, marketing, sales and customer service in order to maintain or build our competitive edge, or that we will be able to successfully compete in the future.
 
Kandy primarily competes with technology and cloud providers such as 8X8, RingCentral, Vonage, Twilio, Nice and Five 9, among others. However, Kandy differentiates itself from its competitors largely by the nature of its route to market - its platform is a proprietary white label, and global cloud platform that support one or a multi-tier distribution via the CSP (communications service provider), VAR (value-added reseller) or ISV (independent software vendor) brand.  Further, in addition to being a true multi-tenant platform, Kandy supports a BYOD (bring your own data) and BYOC (bring your own carrier) model while providing both a light weight and heavy weight OSS/BSS (Ordering/Billing) system and automation integration with its channel partners.  Lastly, the Kandy platform brings a ubiquitous experience across UCaaS, CCaaS, and CPaaS versus most of the competition who play in one or two of these communications market verticals.
 
International Operations and Segments
 
We have been reporting our operating results and financial data in one operating and reportable segment. However, as the Company integrates the Kandy business, which it recently acquired, the way the chief operating decision makers view the business may change. Accordingly, the Company’s operating and reportable segments may change. During 2020, our revenues were primarily domestic, with international revenues representing 3.2% of total revenues. At December 31, 2020, approximately 80 associates were employed in our international operations.
Research and Development
 
Through the Computex technology team, we have continued to invest in engineering and technology resources to endeavor to stay in the forefront of technology trends. Our expertise in core and emerging innovative technologies, fortified by our robust portfolio of consulting, professional, and managed services, has enabled us to remain a trusted advisor for our customers. This broad portfolio enables us to deliver a unique customer experience that spans the gamut from fast delivery of competitively priced products, services, subsequent management and upkeep, through to end-of-life disposal services. This approach permits us to deploy ever-more-sophisticated solutions that positively impact the business outcomes of our customers.
 
Through Kandy, we incur software development costs to enhance, improve, expand and/or upgrade our proprietary software in an agile software environment with releases broken down into several iterations called sprints. These development activities are performed by internal staff primarily located outside of the US.
 
Through our Kandy R&D team, we focus our research and development efforts on building a carrier-grade communications platform, middleware, software application clients and believe that our future success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to innovate and sustain a competitive differentiation. Therefore, our research and development focuses on deploying next generation software technologies, making communications more frictionless, and supporting multiple go-to-market strategies, including channel and direct sales models.
 
On December 31, 2020, our research and development team consisted of 115 employees and 159 contractors.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We target customers of varying sizes in both the private and public sector and develop relationships with them through direct marketing efforts as well as through strategic relationships with our technology partners. As of December 31, 2020, we had relationships with over 100 technology partners and during 2020, we did business with over 600 customers spanning various industries including oil and gas, finance, healthcare, manufacturing and retail. Our sales teams consist of seasoned account executives and regionally focused sales support teams who work within assigned territories to provide customized solutions to our customers.
 
We acquire new account relationships through face-to-face field sales, through relationships with our partners and through targeted direct marketing efforts that aim to increase awareness of our solutions. We target large enterprise companies, the roughly 37,000 middle market companies with revenues between $100 million and $2 billion, the over 96,000 state and local governmental organizations, larger school districts, and the over 3,800 higher educational institutions in the U.S.
 
Our sales representatives are compensated through a combination of fixed and variable compensation. Variable compensation or commission becomes the primary basis of compensation as sales representatives gain more experience.
 
At December 31, 2020, our sales and marketing team consisted of approximately 60 associates, including sales support personnel.

Proprietary Rights 
 
We rely on a combination of copyrights, patents, trade secrets, trademarks, and contractual provisions to protect the proprietary rights of our products, processes and technology. In addition, we sometimes enter into confidentiality and assignment-of-rights agreements with our employees, consultants and customers and limit access to, and distribution of, our proprietary information. We license our proprietary products to our customers under license agreements that we believe contain appropriate use and other restrictions. However, despite our efforts to safeguard our proprietary rights, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to successfully deter misappropriation or unauthorized third-party use of such rights. As is the case with any software company, safeguarding unauthorized use of our software is difficult, and piracy could become a problem. In addition, if we are engaged in transactions in countries where intellectual property laws are not well developed or are not well enforced, our efforts to protect our proprietary rights may not be effective. Enforcing our proprietary rights in the U.S. and abroad and any litigation to enforce such rights, can result in significant costs and can divert resources, which could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
 
As the number of solutions available in the marketplace increases and solution functionality continues to overlap, software companies may increasingly become subject to claims of infringement or other misappropriation of intellectual property. Third parties may assert infringement or misappropriation claims against us relating to our software, processes or technology. Following up such claims, whether or not they have merit, can be time-consuming and can result in costly litigation, divert management’s attention away from operations or cause delays in our business or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements. Defending such claims, entering into royalty or licensing agreements, or adverse determinations in proprietary rights litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.
 
COVID-19
 
Commencing in December 2019, the novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) began spreading throughout the world, including the first outbreak in the US in February 2020. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. COVID-19 has disrupted and continues to significantly disrupt local, regional, and global economies and businesses. The COVID-19 outbreak is disrupting supply chains and affecting production and sales across a range of industries. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, impact on our customers, employees and vendors, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. At this point, the extent to which COVID-19 may impact our financial condition and/or results of operations is uncertain.
 
In response to COVID-19, we have put into place certain restrictions, requirements and guidelines to protect the health of our employees and clients, including requiring that certain conditions be met before employees return to the Company’s offices. Also, to protect the health and safety of our employees, our daily execution has evolved into a largely virtual model. Between April 1, 2020 and September 1, 2020, salaries of Computex’s employees were reduced and there are efforts to reduce other operating expenses relative to revenue. We plan to continue to monitor the current environment and may take further actions that may be required by federal, state or local authorities or that we determine are in the interests of our employees, customers, and partners.

Backlog
 
Deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet, which relate to payments received but for which the related performance obligations have not yet been performed, was $4.6 million at December 31, 2020. These amounts primarily relate to payments received that were contractually due, in advance of providing the products or performing the services. The related performance obligations for such payments are expected to be performed, and the related revenue recognized, within 12 months of the reporting date.
 
Further, we allocate a contract’s transaction price to each distinct performance obligation and recognize the revenue when, or as, the performance obligations are satisfied. Total transaction price for remaining performance obligations as of December 31, 2020 related to non-cancelable contracts longer than 12 months in duration that are expected to be recognized over future periods was approximately $27.2 million, of which 62% is expected to be recognized as revenue within one year of the reporting date.
 
Seasonality
 
Our hardware revenue tends to be seasonal with higher revenues occurring in the fourth quarter of each year.

We are an emerging growth company (“EGC”) as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012, (the “JOBS Act”) and will remain an EGC for up to five years. However, if our non-convertible debt issued within a three-year period exceeds $1.0 billion or our total annual revenues exceed $1.07 billion or the market value of our ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million on the last day of the second fiscal quarter of any given fiscal year, we would cease to be an EGC as of the following fiscal year. As an EGC, we have elected, under Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act, to take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards.
