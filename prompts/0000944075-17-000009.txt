The Company and its Products
 
We are a leading producer of data capture products for mobile applications used in business mobility markets worldwide. Our products are incorporated into mobile applications used in mobile point of sale (mPOS), enterprise mobility, asset tracking, control systems, logistics, event management, medical and education. Our primary products are cordless data capture devices that connect over Bluetooth and work with applications running on smartphones, mobile computers and tablets using operating systems from Apple® (iOS), Google™ (Android™) and Microsoft® (Windows®). We offer an easy-to-use software developer kit (SDK) to mobile application developers to enable them to integrate our products into their applications. Our products become an ingredient of the mobile application solution. Our products are marketed by the application developer or their resellers as part of that solution. Our registered developer program for data capture applications has grown from 700 developers at the beginning of 2015 to more than 1,500 developers at the beginning of 2017.

We offer barcode scanning products for both 1D (imager and laser) and 2D barcode scanning in standard and durable cases. During 2016, we introduced our DuraScan™ line of durable barcode scanners in 3 models: linear imager (D700), laser (D730) and 2D imager (D750). Using the same ergonomic form factor, these barcode scanners have an IP54 durability rating and improved usability features in industrial colors: Construction Orange, Safety Green and Utility Gray. Our 7 Series standard barcode scanners are lightweight and ergonomically designed for easy handling as a stand-alone cordless barcode scanner. Our 7 Series come in 6 vivid colors: blue, gray, green, red, white and yellow. Our SocketScan™ 800 Series cordless barcode scanners in linear imaging and 2D models are designed to be attachable to smartphones and other mobile devices for more integrated barcode scanning and can also be used in simple handheld mode. They attach to mobile devices with an easily detachable clip. During 2016, we introduced an 800 series sleeve solution, “DuraCase”, designed to keep an iPod or smartphone and barcode scanner together and enabling both devices to be used and charged simultaneously and easily operated with a single hand.
 
In 2016, Socket Mobile developed the D600, a Contactless SmartTag Reader Writer version of our durable handheld barcode scanner which will be available in 2017. The D600 can read and write many different types of electronic SmartTags, including NFC. SmartTags are used in many applications today, like digital wallet applications for loyalty cards, identification cards, payment cards, coupons, event tickets and others which leverage the exchange of electronic “tokens”. These tokens can be exchanged via NFC enabled devices. We are also incorporating the Contactless SmartTag reader/writer technology into the base of a retail accessory stand that today enables customers to scan barcoded documents. The Contactless SmartTag reader/writer may also be used as a stand-alone base. We will work with our registered developers during 2017 and beyond to encourage them to use Smart Tags to include Near Field Communications capabilities in their mobile applications.
 
Our Software Developer Kit (“SDK”) supports all of our data capture devices (both barcode reader and Smartcard Reader Writer) with a single installation, making it easy for a developer to integrate our data capture capabilities into their Application centric solution while giving the customer the ability to select the products that work best for them. Socket Mobile’s SDK enables the developer to modify, control the placement of the captured data in their application, and control the feedback to the user that the transaction and transmission was successfully completed. Socket Mobile SDK also enables the built-in camera in a customer’s smartphone or tablet to be used for occasional or lower volume data collection requirements.
 
Cordless barcode scanning represented 86 percent of our revenue in 2016, up from 85 percent in 2015. Handheld computer and legacy product revenue represented 12 percent of our revenue in 2016 and 13 percent of our revenue in 2015. Service revenue represented 2 percent of our revenue in both 2016 and 2015. In 2016, we discontinued our handheld mobile computer. The handheld mobile computer introduced in 2007 has been in decline for several years as developers move their applications to smartphones and tablets.

Marketing Dynamics
 
Developer Relationships. We actively support software application developers to integrate our products into their applications through our registered developer program. We provide an easy to use software developer kit (SDK) and training and technical support to our registered developers. We support the marketing activities of our registered developers in promoting the applications that include our products. Once our barcode scanning products are integrated into a developer’s application, our products become an ingredient of the application solution and part of the developer’s marketing program for that application. Socket Mobile provides regular SDK updates including updates that support the latest operating system updates provided by Apple, Google and Microsoft. We spend extensive engineering time and resources to ensure that our cordless data capture products are compatible with a wide variety of the most popular smartphones, tablets and mobile computers running a variety of operating systems. We adhere to standards of a number of standards setting bodies whose technologies are used in our products such as Bluetooth.
 
Mobile Markets. Our growth in 2016 and 2015 was driven by sales of barcode scanners integrated into retail mobile point of sale applications for use with Apple tablets. Many mobile point of sale application providers have been funded by venture capital organizations enabling their rapid development and growth. Other mobile markets being addressed by registered developers include Enterprise Mobility (field workers), asset tracking, control systems (manufacturing process controls, merchandising), logistics (goods tracking and movement), event management (ticketing, entry, access control, and identification), medical, and education. We expect all of these markets to increase the availability and use of mobile applications and the demand for mobile barcode scanners.
 
Expanded and improved product offerings. We offer a wide range of products that enable application developers and their customers to design their mobile systems to meet their specific requirements, and we encourage our distributors to support the full range of our products. The goal is for customers to view Socket as a primary source for their mobile data capture needs. We offer barcode scanning products for both 1D (imager and laser) and 2D barcode scanning in both standard and durable cases. Our standard barcode scanners, the 7 Series, are lightweight and ergonomically designed as a stand-alone cordless barcode scanner and come in 6 vivid colors: blue, gray, green, red, white and yellow. Our DuraScan Series has 3 models: linear imaging (D700), laser (D730) and 2D (D750). Using the same ergonomic form factor, these barcode scanners have an IP54 durability rating and improved durability features. The DuraScan Series are available in industrial colors Construction Orange, Safety Green and Utility Gray.

Cordless Barcode Scanning. We offer a full range of handheld cordless barcode scanners connecting to smartphones, tablets and other computing devices over Bluetooth. Our Software Developer Kit (SDK) enables registered third party application developers to integrate the features of our Data Capture software into their applications and helps differentiate our products. We face competition from products similar to our cordless hand scanners from Koamtec, Code Corporation, and Opticon (Japan). Barcodes may also be scanned using the built-in camera in smartphones or tablets with applications from Scandit or Manatee Works. However, scanning using the built-in camera is typically slower and more awkward especially as the camera pixel count gets larger. Users may choose a barcode scanner that connects directly to an Apple tablet, iPhone or computer such as offered by Infinite Peripherals and Honeywell. Users also may choose more rugged barcode scanners as an alternative, some of which are integrated into computing devices from manufacturers such as Datalogic, Honeywell®, and Zebra Technologies. Many of these devices are not Apple certified. Many connect to Apple devices over Bluetooth in keyboard emulation mode and do not offer extensive tools for software developers such as our software developer kit (SDK) to integrate features of our sophisticated data collection scanning software into data capture applications.
 
Socket Mobile developed a Contactless SmartTag Reader Writer, D600, version of our durable handheld barcode scanner. The D600 can read and write many different types of electronic SmartTags, including NFC. SmartTags are used in many applications today, like digital wallet applications for loyalty cards, identification cards, payment cards, coupons, event tickets and others which leverage the exchange of electronic “tokens”.
