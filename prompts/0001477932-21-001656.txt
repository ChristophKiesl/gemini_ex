Item 1. Business

Viking Energy Group, Inc. (“Viking” or the “Company”) is an independent exploration and production company engaged in the sale of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, focused on the acquisition and development of oil and natural gas properties in the Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent regions of the United States. The Company owns oil and gas leases in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Kansas. The Company targets under-valued assets with realistic appreciation potential. 
 
The Company's business plan is to engage in the acquisition, exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas properties, both individually and through collaborative partnerships with other companies in this field of endeavor. On March 8, 2016, the Company incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary, Viking Oil & Gas (Canada) ULC, in Alberta, Canada, to hold its Canadian oil and gas interests. On August 30, 2016, the Company organized a wholly owned subsidiary, Mid-Con Petroleum, LLC (“Mid-Con Petroleum”), a Kansas limited liability company, to hold oil and gas interests in the central United States. On August 25, 2017, the Company organized another wholly owned subsidiary, Mid-Con Drilling, LLC (“Mid-Con Drilling”), a Kansas limited liability company, to hold additional oil and gas interests in the central United States. On December 27, 2017, the Company organized a third wholly owned subsidiary, Mid-Con Development, LLC (“Mid-Con Development”), a Kansas limited liability company, to hold additional oil and gas interests in the central United States. In 2016 and 2017, the Company acquired oil and gas interests in Kansas through these subsidiaries, and in December of 2017, the Company acquired Petrodome Energy, LLC, a Texas limited liability company based in Houston, Texas, with interests in oil and gas leases in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi. During November, 2018, the Company organized created, Ichor Energy Holdings, LLC, (a Nevada limited liability company), Ichor Energy, LLC (a Nevada limited liability company), Ichor Energy (TX), LLC (a Texas limited liability company), and Ichor Energy (LA), LLC (a Louisiana limited liability company) to facilitate the acquisition and ownership of additional oil and gas interests in Texas and Louisiana. On December 28, 2018, the Company completed an acquisition of additional oil and gas interests in Texas and Louisiana, and in connection therewith: (i) Ichor Energy (LA), LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ichor Energy LLC, acquired all of the purchased assets located in Louisiana; and (ii) Ichor Energy (TX), LLC, an initially wholly-owned subsidiary of Ichor Energy, acquired all of the purchased assets located in Texas. On February 3, 2020, the Company completed an acquisition of additional oil and gas interests in Texas and Louisiana through a Nevada subsidiary, Elysium Energy Holdings, LLC (“Elysium Holdings”), and assigned a portion of its membership interests in that subsidiary to Camber Energy, Inc. (“Camber”) in connection with acquisition financing secured from Camber at that time. On December 23, 2020, as described below in connection with Camber’s Acquisition, Camber assigned its Elysium interests back to Viking, and Elysium became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
 
On January 5, 2021, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment with the State of Nevada to effect a reverse split of our common stock at a ratio of 1-for-9. As a result of the reverse stock split, each nine (9) pre-split shares of common stock outstanding were combined into one (1) new share of common stock. Unless otherwise stated, all share and per share numbers in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and included in the consolidated financial statements have been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split.
 
On December 23, 2020, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Camber, pursuant to which Camber acquired (“Camber’s Acquisition”) 26,274,510 shares of Viking common stock (“Camber’s Viking Shares”), constituting 51% of the common stock of Viking, in consideration of (i) Camber’s payment of $10,900,000 to Viking (the “Cash Purchase Price”), and (ii) cancelation of $9,200,000 in promissory notes issued by Viking to Camber (“Camber’s Viking Notes”). Pursuant to the purchase agreement, Viking is obligated to issue additional shares of Viking common stock to Camber to ensure that Camber shall own at least 51% of the common stock of Viking through July 1, 2022.

In connection with Camber’s Acquisition, the Company and Camber terminated their previous merger agreement, dated August 31, 2020, as amended, and Camber assigned its membership interests in one of Viking’s subsidiaries, Elysium Energy Holdings, LLC, back to Viking. Also in connection with Camber’s Acquisition, effective December 23, 2020, Camber (i) borrowed $12,000,000 from an institutional investor; (ii) issued the investor a promissory note in the principal amount of $12,000,000, accruing interest at the rate of 10% per annum and maturing December 11, 2022 (the “Camber Investor Note”); (iii) granted the Investor a first-priority security interest in Camber’s Viking Shares and Camber’s other assets pursuant to a pledge agreement and a general security agreement, respectively; and (iv) entered into an amendment to Camber’s $6,000,000 promissory note previously issued to the investor dated December 11, 2020 (the “Additional Camber Investor Note”), amending the acceleration provision of the note to provide that the note repayment obligations would also not accelerate if Camber has increased its authorized capital stock by March 11, 2021 (and Camber increased its authorized capital stock in February of 2021 as required). In order to close Camber’s Acquisition, effective December 23, 2020, Viking entered into a Guaranty Agreement, guaranteeing repayment of the Camber Investor Note and the Additional Camber Investor Note.
 
On December 23, 2020, the Camber Investor Note was funded, and Viking and Camber closed Camber’s Acquisition, with Camber paying the Cash Purchase Price to Viking and cancelling Camber’s Viking Notes, and Viking issuing Camber’s Viking Shares. At the closing, James Doris and Frank Barker, Jr., Viking’s CEO and CFO, were appointed the CEO and CFO of Camber, and Mr. Doris was appointed a member of the Board of Directors of Camber.
