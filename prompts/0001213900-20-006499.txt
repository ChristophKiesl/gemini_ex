ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
Reference herein to the “Company,” “PME,” “we,” “our” or “us,” means Pingtan Marine Enterprise Ltd. and includes its subsidiaries, unless the contest requires otherwise.
 
Our Business
 
We are a marine enterprise group primarily engaging in ocean fishing through our operating subsidiary, Fujian Provincial Pingtan County Ocean Fishing Group Co., Ltd., or Pingtan Fishing, which is organized in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”). We carry out marine fishing operations in the international waters and the approved waters in access fishing countries with many of our owned vessels or licensed vessels for which we have exclusive operating license rights. We provide high quality seafood to a diverse group of customers including distributors, restaurant owners and exporters in the PRC.
 
We initially had a fishing fleet of 40 vessels in 2013. By June 2015, we have expanded the number of vessels to 135 through construction of 3 new vessels, purchase of 72 licensed vessels and acquisition of 20-year exclusive operation rights to 20 vessels. Our fishing fleet consists of vessels of diversified fishing methods ranging from trawling, drift netting, light luring seine, long line fishing to squid jigging.
 
From 2017 to 2018, we purchased 2 refrigerated transport vessels and 4 squid jigging vessels. Of those vessels, 2 transport vessels and 2 squid jigging vessels finished renovation in subsequent years and were deployed to international waters. The remaining 2 squid vessels’ ownership transfer was not yet completed, but the Company is entitled to 100% of the operations and net profits (losses) from the vessels.
 
In April, 2018, we had 27 fishing vessels that received approval from the MOA to operate in the international waters after completion of the modification and rebuilding projects. The 27 vessels were rebuilt and modified into 20 squid jigging vessels and 7 light luring seine vessels and have been deployed to sea for operations in late 2018 and early 2019.
 
In 2019, the Company had 30 fishing vessels that received approval from the MOA to operate in the international waters after completion of the modification and rebuilding projects. The 30 vessels were rebuilt and modified into 15 squid jigging vessels and 15 light luring seine vessels. All the 30 vessels finished renovation in 2019 and were deployed to the international waters for operations. In late 2019, we further applied to the MOA for permits to modify and rebuild 10 fishing vessels.

As of December 31, 2019, we owned 41 squid jigging vessels, 26 trawlers, 25 seine vessels, 13 drifters, 4 longline fishing vessels, and 2 transport vessels, had exclusive operating license rights to 20 drifters, and also had 10 squid jigging vessels which were in the modification and rebuilding project. 
 
Among the 141 vessels, 69 were located in international waters, 12 were located in the Bay of Bengal in India, 13 were located in the PRC, 37 were located in the Arafura Sea in Indonesia; and the remaining 10 vessels were in the modification and rebuilding projects.
 
We catch nearly 30 different species of fish, including squid, ribbon fish, croaker fish and cuttle fish. All of our catch is shipped back to the PRC. We arrange chartered transportation ships to deliver frozen stocks to cold storage warehouses located in one of the PRC’s largest seafood trading centers, Mawei Seafood Market in Fujian Province.  
 
We derive our revenue primarily from the sale of frozen seafood products. We sell our products directly to customers, including seafood processors, distributors, restaurant owners and exporters. Most of our customers have long-term, cooperative relationships with us. Our existing customers also introduce new customers to us from time to time. In July 2017, we entered into an exclusive strategic cooperation agreement to sell our fish products directly to consumers online. Based on past experiences, demand for seafood products is the highest from December to January, during Chinese New Year. We believe that our profitability and growth are dependent on our ability to deploy our vessels to new fishing grounds and our ability to expand our customer base.

Government Permits and Approvals
 
We are required to go through a series of procedures to obtain all approvals necessary to fish in the designated fishing areas.
 
Step one: Obtaining Vessel Building Permits
 
First, we have to file a vessel building application to the relevant governmental authorities in Fujian to obtain the Fishing Vessel and Net Tools Building Permits. Governmental authorities in Fujian verify Pingtan Fishing’s qualifications for pelagic fishing and pass on the verified and approved application documents to affiliates of the MOA for further confirmation. Once confirmed, the certificates are issued to Pingtan Fishing.
Step two: Vessels Building and Inspection
 
After obtaining the Fishing Vessel and Net Tools Building Permits, we start building the new vessels through contracting with third party vessel manufacturers. During the period of construction, inspection of the vessels is performed several times by the relevant governmental authorities. Once the construction is completed, a Vessel Inspection Certificate is issued, after which we can apply for certificates of ownership and certificates of nationality for new vessels.
Step three: Fishing Project Application
 
Each vessel is required to be licensed by the MOA and, to the extent required, the vessel may also be required to obtain a license from the local government where the vessel conducts fishing operations. For example, in order to conduct fishing operations in the exclusive economic zone of other countries, foreign fishing vessels need to obtain the approval from each of the local departments of fisheries of those other countries. After obtaining all certificates in step two, we file applications to the relevant governmental authorities to obtain approvals for pelagic fishing projects in the specified fishing areas. Meanwhile, we start the application process for obtaining fishing permits from the relevant governmental authorities in the applicable fishing destination countries. In some countries, the Company may be required to obtain licenses through local entities, which are required to also possess a fishery business license.
Step four: Preparations Before Departure
 
Once the approval for pelagic fishing projects is issued, we can complete all relevant departure procedures within six months from the time the notification of approval is issued. Departure procedures include obtaining visas for fishing vessels and crew members, submitting required certificates to the PRC customs in Fujian, and obtaining other relevant documents from governmental authorities, such as Vessel Departure Certificates.
Step five: Fishing Project Approval and Departure to Fishing Areas
 
After we have submitted all required documents to the relevant governmental authorities and completed all procedures required for departure, we receive confirmation of pelagic fishing project approval from affiliates of the MOA. Once we obtain such confirmation, our vessels can depart to the applicable fishing destination country. Fish caught at the destination may then be shipped back and be declared at the PRC customs.

Operations
 
Harvesting Operations
 
The fishing vessels can carry up to one-month of supplies. The captains of the vessels utilize sophisticated technology to identify, among other things, fishing areas, time to cast and draw in the nets, vessel speed and sailing direction allowing the vessels to optimize the catch and resource value. Nearby fishing groups share real-time fishing information through wireless radio equipment. The catch is separated based on species and sizes and is frozen immediately. Once the storage of a fishing vessel is at capacity, the catch is shipped to our cold storage located in Mawei.
Seasonality
 
In most waters where our vessels operate, autumn and winter are the seasons when harvest is most productive and summer is relatively a low season. In addition, our annual catches are affected by a number of unpredictable factors, such as weather patterns and fish migration, which are likely to vary from year to year.
Cold Storage
 
Fish are stored separately according to different species and sizes for best practices of cold storage management, goods selectivity and delivery.
 
We have secured several cold storages located in one of the PRC’s largest seafood trading centers, MaWei seafood market. The monthly rent for Fuxin cold storage is RMB70 (US$10) per square meter and the leases are renewable annually. The following table sets forth information regarding the cold storages we currently rent as of December 31, 2019:

 | Monthly | 
-----------------+----------------+-------
Cold Storage | rent (US$) | 
Fuxin#201 | $ | 10,604
Fuxin#203 | | 10,604
Fuxin#503 | | 10,604
Total | $ | 31,812

Sales, Marketing and Distribution
 
We market, sell and distribute products all over China, including the Fujian, Shandong and Zhejiang provinces. Squid, ribbon fish and cuttle fish were the main types of seafood sold for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing 65.5% of our sales.
 
As of December 31, 2019, we sold our fish to over 70 distributors and retailers by acting as a wholesaler. We serve a wide customer base and two customers accounted for more than 10% of our sales for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Vessels
 
As of December 31, 2019, we owned 41 squid jigging vessels, 26 trawlers, 25 seine vessels, 13 drifters, 4 longline fishing vessels, and 2 transport vessels, had exclusive operating license rights to 20 drifters, and also had 10 squid jigging vessels which were in the modification and rebuilding project.
 
Among the 141 vessels, 69 were located in international waters, 12 were located in the Bay of Bengal in India, 13 were located in the PRC, 37 were located in the Arafura Sea in Indonesia, and the remaining 10 vessels were in the modification and rebuilding projects.
 
Business Strategy
 
We are committed to developing our business to become a global, integrated seafood company. We plan to enlarge our fishing fleet in the next few years through organic growth and acquisition opportunities of potential targets, domestically and abroad.
 
We are actively seeking opportunities to expand to other fishing grounds worldwide including North America, South America and the High Sea, which will further diversify the fish types we harvest. We are also planning to extend to fish processing and trading business.
 
Competition
 
As vessels with access to the pelagic fishing operations are restricted to a limited number, we believe that competition within our designated fishing areas is not significant.
 
Competition in the consumer market in China is high as fish compete with other sources of protein. We compete with other fishing companies which offer similar and varied products. There is significant demand for fish in the Chinese market. Our catch appeals to a wide segment of consumers because of the low-price points of our products. We have generally been able to sell our catch at market prices.

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2019, we had 2,060 employees. The following table sets forth the number of employees by function as of December 31, 2019:

In 2019, we contracted six third-party labor companies to provide crew labor dispatching service. We pay the hiring costs based on the actual fees incurred on monthly basis. Welfare and benefit payments for such personnel are covered by the companies supplying the crew members.
 
Company History
 
China Equity Growth Investment Ltd. (“CGEI”) was incorporated in the Cayman Islands as an exempted limited liability company and a blank check company on January 18, 2010 and changed its name to Pingtan Marine Enterprise Ltd. in February 2013.
 
China Dredging Group Co., Ltd (“CDGC” or “China Dredging”) and Merchant Supreme Co., Ltd (“Merchant Supreme”) are limited liability companies incorporated on April 14, 2010 and June 25, 2012, respectively, in the British Virgin Islands (“BVI”).
 
China Dredging, through its PRC Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”), Fujian Xinggang Port Service Co., Ltd (“Fujian Service”), provided specialized dredging services exclusively to the PRC marine infrastructure market and is, based on the number and capacity of the dredging vessels it operates, one of the leading independent (not state-owned) providers of such services in the PRC.
 
Merchant Supreme, through its PRC VIE, Fujian Provincial Pingtan County Ocean Fishing Group Co., Ltd. (“Pingtan Fishing”) engages in ocean fishery with its fleet of self-owned vessels and vessels with exclusive operating license rights within Indian EEZ and Arafura Sea of Indonesia.
 
CGEI and CDGC entered into the Merger Agreement dated October 24, 2012, providing for the combination of CGEI and CDGC. CGEI also acquired all of the outstanding capital shares and other equity interests of Merchant Supreme as per Share Purchase Agreement dated October 24, 2012. Following the completion of the business combination on February 25, 2013, CDGC and Merchant Supreme became the wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company (the “Business Combination”). The ordinary shares, par value $0.001 per share were listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol “PME”.

In order to place increased focus on fishing business and pursue more effective growth opportunities, we decided to exit and sell the specialized dredging services operated by China Dredging, and we completed the sale of CDGC and its subsidiaries on December 4, 2013.
 
On February 9, 2015, we terminated our existing VIE agreements, pursuant to an Agreement of Termination dated February 9, 2015, entered into by and among Ms. Honghong Zhuo, Mr. Zhiyan Lin (each a shareholder of Fujian Provincial Pingtan County Ocean Fishing Group Co., Ltd (“Pingtan Fishing”), together the “Pingtan Fishing’s Shareholders”), Pingtan Fishing and Pingtan Guansheng Ocean Fishing Co., Ltd. (“Pingtan Guansheng”). On February 9, 2015, the Pingtan Fishing’s Shareholders transferred 100% of their equity interest in Pingtan Fishing to Fujian Heyue Marine Fishing Development Co., Ltd. (“Fujian Heyue”), pursuant to an Equity Transfer Agreement dated February 9, 2015, entered into by and among the Pingtan Fishing’s Shareholders, Pingtan Fishing and Fujian Heyue. On February 15, 2015, China Agriculture Industry Development Fund Co., Ltd. (“China Agriculture”) invested RMB 400 million (approximately $65 million) into Pingtan Fishing for an 8% equity interest in Pingtan Fishing. After the restructuring transactions described above, Pingtan Fishing and its entities became the 92% equity-owned subsidiaries of our company and our VIE structure was terminated.
