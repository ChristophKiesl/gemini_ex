Item 1. Business
Description of Business
South Jersey Industries, Inc. (SJI or the Company), a New Jersey corporation, was formed in 1969 for the purpose of owning and holding all of the outstanding common stock of South Jersey Gas Company (SJG), a public utility, and acquiring and developing non-utility lines of business.

SJI provides a variety of energy-related products and services, primarily through the following wholly-owned subsidiaries:
▪SJIU is a holding company that owns SJG and ETG and, until its sale, owned ELK.
•SJG is a regulated natural gas utility which distributes natural gas in the seven southernmost counties of New Jersey.
•ETG is a regulated natural gas utility which distributes natural gas in seven counties in northern and central New Jersey.
•ELK is a regulated natural gas utility which distributes natural gas in northern Maryland. On July 31, 2020, SJI sold ELK to a third-party buyer (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements).
•SJE acquires and markets electricity to retail end users.
•SJRG markets natural gas storage, commodity and transportation assets along with fuel management services on a wholesale basis in the mid-Atlantic, Appalachian and southern states.
•SJEX owns oil, gas and mineral rights in the Marcellus Shale region of Pennsylvania.
▪Marina develops and operates on-site energy-related projects. Included in Marina were MTF and ACB, which, in February 2020, were sold to a third-party buyer (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements). Also included in Marina was a solar project that was sold in March 2020 (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements). The significant wholly-owned subsidiaries of Marina include:
•ACLE, BCLE, SCLE and SXLE own and operate landfill gas-to-energy production facilities in Atlantic, Burlington, Salem and Sussex Counties, respectively, located in New Jersey. On June 1, 2020, the BCLE, SCLE, and SXLE landfill gas-to-energy production facilities ceased operations after receiving approval from their respective local governmental authorities to do so.
•Entities which own and operate rooftop solar generation sites located in New Jersey. These entities were acquired in 2020. Also included are two solar projects previously classified as held for sale. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
•SJESP receives commissions on appliance service contracts from a third party. 
•Midstream invests in infrastructure and other midstream projects, including PennEast. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.
•SJEI provides energy procurement and cost reduction services. The significant wholly-owned subsidiaries of SJEI include:
•AEP, an aggregator, broker and consultant in the retail energy markets that matches end users with suppliers for the procurement of natural gas and electricity, which was acquired in August 2019.
•EnerConnex, an aggregator, broker and consultant in the retail and wholesale energy markets that matches end users with suppliers for the procurement of natural gas and electricity. On August 7, 2020, SJEI acquired the remaining 75% of EnerConnex, of which SJEI previously held a 25% interest. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
South Jersey Industries, Inc.
Part I

•SJI Renewable Energy Ventures, LLC and SJI RNG Devco, LLC are newly formed subsidiaries which hold the equity interest in REV LNG and the renewable natural gas development rights in certain dairy farms, respectively (see "Acquisitions" below). 
Acquisitions:
SJI, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Marina, acquired three LLCs on June 30, 2020, and acquired a fourth LLC on August 21, 2020. These entities own newly operational rooftop solar-generation sites located in New Jersey, and were acquired for $3.8 million in total consideration.
On August 7, 2020, SJI, through its wholly-owned subsidiary SJEI, completed its acquisition of the remaining 75% of EnerConnex for total consideration of $7.5 million. Prior to this transaction, SJEI had a 25% interest in EnerConnex.
On August 12, 2020, SJI, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Marina, formed the Catamaran joint venture with a third party partner. Catamaran was formed for the purpose of developing, owning and operating renewable energy projects, and will support SJI's commitment to clean energy initiatives. On the same date, Catamaran purchased 100% ownership in Annadale, an entity that has constructed two fuel cell projects totaling 7.5 MW in Staten Island, New York. These fuel cell projects became operational in December 2020.
On December 23, 2020, SJI, through its wholly-owned subsidiary SJES, completed its acquisition of a 35% interest in REV LNG. As part of the transaction, SJI also acquired renewable natural gas development rights in certain dairy farms, previously owned by REV LNG. The total consideration for the 35% interest in REV LNG was $10.5 million while the total consideration for the development rights was $10.0 million. As part of this transaction, SJI has also committed to providing up to $25.0 million in capital contribution loans to REV LNG, $19.3 million of which has been issued as of December 31, 2020. This acquisition is consistent with SJI's commitment to decarbonization, as REV LNG specializes in the development, production and transportation of renewable natural gas, liquified natural gas and compressed natural gas. Over the last few years, REV LNG has become one of the country’s leading developers of RNG projects through capturing, cleaning and converting bio-methane to RNG. Among its service offerings, REV LNG acquires the rights to build anaerobic digesters on dairy farms to produce RNG for injection into natural gas pipelines. SJI's investment in REV LNG includes an interest in RNG projects, a developing pipeline of RNG projects, as well as certain energy infrastructure assets associated with transporting and supplying RNG to market.
On August 31, 2019, SJI, through its wholly-owned subsidiary SJEI, completed its acquisition of AEP for $4.0 million in total consideration.
On July 1, 2018, SJI, through its wholly-owned subsidiary SJIU, acquired the assets of ETG and ELK from Pivotal Utility Holdings, Inc., a subsidiary of Southern Company Gas, for total consideration of $1.72 billion after the settlement of working capital.
See Notes 1, 3 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements.

Part I

On June 27, 2018, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Marina, entered into a series of agreements whereby Marina agreed to sell its portfolio of solar energy assets (for this section, the “Transaction”) to a third-party buyer. As part of the Transaction, Marina agreed to sell its distributed solar energy projects across New Jersey, Maryland, Massachusetts and Vermont (for this section, the “Projects”), along with the assets comprising the Projects. These sales occurred between 2018-2020. Also in connection with the Transaction, Marina is leasing back from the buyer certain of the Projects that have not yet passed the fifth anniversary of their placed-in-service dates for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The leaseback runs from the date each such project was acquired by the buyer until the later of the first anniversary of the applicable acquisition date and the fifth anniversary of the applicable placed-in-service date of the project. As of December 31, 2020, there are ten projects being leased back from the buyer through the end of 2021, which is the fifth anniversary of their placed-in-service date. The results of these projects being leased back are not material.
In July 2018, as part of the Transaction, Marina received a cash payment of $62.5 million for the sale of certain SRECs. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company closed on the majority of these Projects, including the wholly-owned subsidiaries MCS, NBS and SBS, with each project sold having met all conditions to satisfy closing. Total consideration received in the fourth quarter 2018 related to these sales was $228.1 million. During 2019, seven Projects were sold for total consideration of $24.3 million. During 2020, one Project was sold for total consideration of $7.2 million. 
On November 30, 2018, SJI sold the retail gas business of SJE for total consideration of $15.0 million. As a result, SJE no longer acquires, transports or markets natural gas for retail markets.
See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.

Resources
The Utilities:
Transportation and Storage Agreements
During 2020, SJG and ETG purchased and had delivered natural gas distribution of 45.9 MMdts and 31.4 MMdts, respectively. These deliveries were for on-system (SJG and ETG) and off-system (SJG) customers and for injections into storage. SJG's average cost per dt of natural gas purchased and delivered in 2020, 2019 and 2018, including demand charges, was $3.52, $4.17, and $5.20, respectively. ETG's average cost per dt of natural gas purchased and delivered in 2020 and 2019 was $3.85 and $4.33, respectively. The average cost per dt of natural gas purchased and delivered for ETG for the period July 1 - December 31, 2018 was $4.71.
SJG has direct connections to the interstate pipeline systems of Transco and Columbia. SJG secures other long-term services from Dominion, a pipeline upstream of the Transco and Columbia systems.

Gas Supplies
SJG has four separate AMAs with gas marketers that extend through March 31, 2021. SJG released to the marketers its firm transportation rights, and in return the marketers manage this capacity and provide SJG with firm deliverability each day. The marketer's intents are to optimize the capacity released to SJG under these AMAs and pay SJG an asset management fee.
SJG has committed to a purchase of a minimum of 15,000 dts/d and up to 70,000 dts/d, from a supplier for a term of ten years at index-based prices. Also, in 2019 SJG entered into a two-year purchase agreement with a producer delivering 5,000 dts/day at SJG’s Leidy Line for certified responsible gas from November 1, 2019 through October 31, 2021.
On July 1, 2018, ETG entered into an AMA with SJRG which extends through March 31, 2022. Under this agreement ETG released to SJRG and/or designated SJRG as agent for all firm transportation and storage contracts. SJRG is obligated to provide natural gas supply to meet demand requirements and optimize ETG’s portfolio of natural gas transportation and storage contracts. SJRG pays a fixed fee and shares net margin generated through portfolio optimization.
As part of the gas purchasing strategy, the Utilities use financial contracts to hedge against forward price risk. These contracts are recoverable through the BGSS Clause, subject to BPU approval. 
Supplemental Gas Supplies
SJG operates peaking facilities, located in McKee City, NJ, where it liquefies, stores and vaporizes LNG for injection into its distribution system. SJG's LNG facility has a storage capacity equivalent to 434,300 dts of natural gas and has an installed capacity to vaporize up to 118,250 dts of LNG per day for injection into its distribution system.
ETG operates a peaking facility, located in Elizabeth, NJ, where it stores and vaporizes LNG for injection into its distribution system. ETG's LNG facility has a storage capacity equivalent to 165,000 dts of natural gas and has an installed capacity to vaporize up to 25,000 dts of LNG per day for injection into its distribution system.

Peak-Day Supply

SJG plans for a winter season peak-day demand on the basis of an average daily temperature of 2 degrees F or 63 Heating Degree Days, while ETG's plans on an average daily temperature of 0 degrees F or 65 Heating Degree Days. Gas demand on such a design day for the 2020-2021 winter season is estimated to be 578,029 dts for SJG and 474,859 dts for ETG (excluding industrial customers). SJG and ETG project to have adequate supplies and interstate pipeline entitlements to meet design day requirements. SJG and ETG experienced their highest peak-day demand for calendar year 2020 on February 14th and January 20th, respectively.

South Jersey Energy Company
Due to the liquidity in the market, SJE primarily purchases delivered electric in the day-ahead and real-time markets through regional transmission organizations.

Gas Supplies

SJRG has entered into several long-term natural gas supply agreements to purchase 721,900 dts/d, depending upon production levels, for terms ranging from five to eleven years at index-based prices. 
Patents and Franchises

The Utilities hold nonexclusive franchises granted by municipalities in the areas to which they serve. No other natural gas public utility presently serves the territory covered by the Utilities' franchises. Otherwise, patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises and concessions are not material to the business of the Utilities.
Seasonal Aspects

Utility Companies

The Utilities experience seasonal fluctuations in sales when selling natural gas for heating purposes. The Utilities meet these seasonal fluctuations in demand from firm customers by buying and storing gas during the summer months, and by drawing from storage and purchasing supplemental supplies during the heating season. As a result of this seasonality, the Utilities' revenues and net income are significantly higher during the first and fourth quarters than during the second and third quarters of the year.

Non-Utility Companies

Among SJI's non-utility activities, wholesale (including fuel supply management) has seasonal patterns similar to the Utilities. Activities such as energy services do not follow seasonal patterns. Other activities, such as retail electric marketing, can have seasonal earnings patterns that are different from the Utilities. The first and fourth quarters remain the periods where most of SJI's revenue and net income is produced.
Working Capital Practices

Reference is made to “Liquidity and Capital Resources” included in Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” of this Report.
Government Contracts

No material portion of the business of SJI or any of its subsidiaries is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of any government.
Competition

Information on competition for SJI and its subsidiaries can be found in Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” of this Report.
