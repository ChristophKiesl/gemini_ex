GENERAL
Invacare Corporation (“Invacare,” the “company,” including its subsidiaries, unless otherwise noted) is a leading manufacturer and distributor in its markets for medical equipment used in non-acute care settings. At its core, the company designs, manufactures and distributes medical devices that help people to move, breathe, rest and perform essential hygiene. The company provides clinically complex medical device solutions for congenital (e.g., cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, spina bifida), acquired (e.g., stroke, spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, post-acute recovery, pressure ulcers) and degenerative (e.g., ALS, multiple sclerosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), age related, bariatric) conditions. The company's products are an important component of care for people facing a wide range of medical challenges, from those who are active and heading to work or school each day and may need additional mobility or respiratory support, to those who are cared for in residential care settings, at home and in rehabilitation centers. The company sells its products principally to home medical equipment providers through retail and e-commerce channels, residential care operators, dealers and government health services in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific. Invacare's products are sold through its worldwide distribution network by its sales force, independent manufacturers' representatives, and distributors.
Invacare is committed to providing medical products that deliver the best clinical value; promote recovery, independence and active lifestyles; and support long-term conditions and palliative care. The company's global tagline - Yes, You Can.® is indicative of the "can do" attitude of many of the people who use the company's products and their care providers. In everything it does, the company strives to leave its stakeholders with its brand promise - Making Life's Experiences Possible®.
The company is a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Ohio in 1971. When the company was first established as a stand-alone enterprise in December 1979, it had $19.5 million in net sales and a limited product line of basic wheelchairs and patient aids. Since then, the company has made approximately fifty acquisitions and, after some recent divestitures to harmonize its portfolio, Invacare's net sales in 2020 were approximately $900 million. Based upon the company's distribution channels, breadth of product lines and net sales, Invacare is a leading company in many of the following medical product categories: custom power wheelchairs; custom manual wheelchairs; electromotive technology to augment wheelchairs and recreational products; recreational adaptive sports products; non-acute bed systems; patient 

transfer and bathing equipment; and supplementary respiratory therapy devices.
THE NON-ACUTE DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT INDUSTRY
The non-acute durable medical equipment market includes a broad range of equipment and services that enable the care and lifestyle needs of individuals with a broad range of conditions. With expected long-term pressure to control healthcare spending per capita, the company believes the market for equipment and services that support higher acuity care in lower acuity settings will continue to grow. Healthcare payors and providers continue to seek to optimize therapies which result in improved outcomes, reduced cost protocols, and ultimately, earlier discharge, including recovery and treatment in non-acute settings. Care in these settings may reduce exposure to concomitant issues and be preferred by patients.
As healthcare costs continue to increase, the interests of patients and healthcare providers are converging to focus on the most cost-effective delivery of the best care. As healthcare payors become more judicious in their spending, companies that provide better care or demonstrate better clinical outcomes will have an advantage. With its diverse product portfolio, clinical solutions, global scale and focus on the non-acute care setting, the company believes it is well positioned to serve this growing market.
Macro trends are impacting the world's aging population. While institutional care will likely remain an important part of healthcare systems in the wealthiest economies, the company believes care settings other than traditional hospitals will increasingly provide higher acuity care. With a broad product offering, diversified channels of trade, and infrastructure capable of serving many of the largest healthcare economies, the company believes it is well positioned to benefit from these global demographic trends and changes to the provision of healthcare.
North America Market
The population of the United States is growing and aging. As a result, there is a greater prevalence of disability among major U.S. population groups and an increasing need for assistance and care. The U.S. Census Bureau has projected the U.S. population will continue to grow to an estimated 400 million by 2050. Along the way, the bolus of Baby Boomers is expected to continue to raise the average age of the U.S. population. By 2030, the government estimates that more than 20% of the U.S. population will 



Part I 
Item 1. Business

consist of individuals over the age of 65, a 50% increase compared to the population in 2010.
In the United States, healthcare provision is supported by reimbursement from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), the Department of Veterans Affairs, state agencies, private payors and healthcare recipients themselves. In total, CMS estimates U.S. national healthcare expenditures will grow by more than 5% annually between 2019 and 2028. At this rate, healthcare spending would exceed GDP growth by 1%, which will sustain pressure to deploy care in ways that deliver the best outcomes for lower cost.
The Canadian health care system is a publicly funded model that provides coverage to all citizens. Provinces and territories are primarily responsible for the administration and delivery of Canada's health care services, and all health insurance plans are expected to meet the national guidelines established by the Canada Health Act. The objective of the Canada Health Act is to provide consumer-centered support and funding to residents with long-term physical disabilities and to provide access to personalized assistive devices that meet the basic needs of each patient. Each provincial and territorial health insurance plan differs with respect to reimbursement policies and product specification standards, allowing healthcare services to be adjusted based on regional needs. Invacare sells across Canada, taking into consideration the regional differences among the various provinces and territories.
Europe, Middle East and Africa Markets
While the healthcare equipment market in each country in Europe has distinct characteristics, many of the factors driving demand and affecting reimbursement are consistent with those in North America: population aging; more patients with chronic illnesses; an increasing preference to deliver healthcare outside hospitals; and a focus on the use of technology to increase productivity and reduce ancillary costs. Each European country has variations in product specifications and service requirements, regulations, distribution needs and reimbursement policies. These differences, as well as differences in the competitive landscape, require the company to tailor its approach based on the local market and the reimbursement requirements into which the products are being sold. The company's core strategy is to address these distinct markets with global product platforms that are localized with country-specific adjustments as necessary. This is especially the case for power wheelchairs, manual wheelchairs, and respiratory products. Customers in all European markets typically make product selections based upon quality, features, alignment with local reimbursement requirements, ability to reduce total cost of care, and customer service.

The company serves various markets in Eastern Europe, Russia, Middle East and Africa. It approaches these markets with the global portfolio of products developed and manufactured elsewhere. Sales in these markets are made somewhat opportunistically to balance changes in demand and specific product requirements. Often, sales in the Middle East and Africa represent episodic tenders as well as in some cases consistent sustained trade over the years. Most of the company's sales in these markets result from business conducted in Western Europe, as well as through dedicated local distributors.
Asia Pacific Market
The company's Asia Pacific market comprises revenue from products sold in Australia, New Zealand, China, Japan, Korea, India and Southeast Asia. Invacare's Asia Pacific businesses sell through multiple channels. Mobility and seating products are sold directly in New Zealand and through a network of dealers in all other countries, with almost all sales funded to reimbursed levels directly by governmental payors. Homecare products are sold via a dealer network that sells products to the consumer market. Long-term care products are sold via a dealer network and directly to care facilities. The company operates a rental business in New Zealand supporting the three largest hospital districts on New Zealand's North Island. Sales to other parts of Asia are sold via distributors and agents based in China, Japan, Korea, India and Southeast Asia. The company has a distribution and assembly center in Thailand. 
Reimbursement
In most markets, the company does not make significant sales directly to end-users. In some markets, such as the United States, the United Kingdom and certain Scandinavian countries, the company sells directly to a government payor. In other markets, the company's customers purchase products to have available for use by, or re-sale to, end-users. These customers then work with end-users to determine what equipment may be needed to address the end-user's particular medical needs. Products are then provided to the end-user, and the company's customer may seek reimbursement on behalf of the consumer or sell the products, as appropriate. Product mix, pricing and payment terms vary by market. The company believes its market position and technical expertise will allow it to respond to ongoing changes in demand and reimbursement.
PRODUCT CATEGORIES
The company designs, manufactures, markets and distributes products in three key product categories: Mobility and Seating, Lifestyle and Respiratory.



Part I 
Item 1. Business

Mobility and Seating
•Power Wheelchairs. This product category includes complex power wheelchairs for individuals who require powered mobility. The company's power wheelchair product offerings include products that can be highly customized to meet an individual end-user's needs, as well as products that are inherently versatile and designed to meet a broad range of requirements. Center-wheel drive power wheelchair lines include the Invacare® TDX® (Total Driving eXperience) product line and the ROVI® X3 and A3 power base product line, offered through the company's Motion Concepts subsidiary and also sold in Asia Pacific. The TDX line of power wheelchairs offers a combination of power, stability and maneuverability, including the Invacare® SureStep® suspension with Stability Lock and available G-Trac™ Technology. Seating systems offer elevate, power tilt and recline features. The ROVI A3 also offers the Multi-Positioning-Standing-MAXX System (MPS), an innovative, highly adjustable system that provides consumers the medical benefits of adjusting to a standing position throughout the day, adding additional independence, function and accessibility.
The company also offers rear-wheel drive power wheelchair technology through the Invacare® Storm Series®. The company launched a new generation of front and rear wheel drive power wheelchairs in early 2020 under the AVIVA® brand name. AVIVA replaces some of the legacy products, with compelling enhancements, and provides new market share opportunities. The market feedback after some months from the launch has been extremely positive. Several of the company's subsidiaries specialize in the development and implementation of complementary technology designed to enhance the utility of wheelchairs to meet unique and complex physiological needs. For example, Adaptive Switch Labs has developed alternative electronic control systems and human/machine input devices that enable wheelchair and environmental control via alternative interfaces to joysticks, such as sip/puff, eye-gaze, or head position inputs. Motion Concepts designs and produces custom powered seating and power positioning systems. The company continues to be a leader in this market with unique intellectual property in wheelchair suspension, and alternative controls.
•Custom Manual Wheelchairs. This product category includes products for independent everyday use, outdoor recreation, and casual and competitive sports, such as basketball, racing and tennis. These products are marketed under the Invacare® and Invacare® Top End® brand names. The company 

markets a premiere line of lightweight, aesthetically-stylish custom manual wheelchairs under the Küschall® brand name. This Küschall family of products was renewed during 2020, adding to the traditional features, the new hydroforming technology. This technology forms material specifically to the areas of the highest strength needs using less total material. As a consequence, the rigidity and the driving performance of the chair improve significantly while the weight is reduced. These custom manual wheelchairs feature precision components and outstanding driving performance. The company provides a wide range of mobility solutions for everyday activities for active and passive users. The company's competitive advantages include a wide range of features and functionality and the ability to build purposeful custom wheelchairs, along with components which feature cross compatibility across the portfolio and wheelchairs that collapse to fit into very small spaces for ease of transportability.
•Seating and Positioning Products. At the core of care for seated end-users is the need for proper seating and positioning. Invacare designs, manufactures and markets some of the industry's best custom seating and positioning systems, custom molded and modular seat cushions, back supports and accessories to enable care givers to optimize the posture of their patients in mobility products. The Invacare® Seating and Positioning series provides seating solutions for less complex end-user needs. The Invacare® Matrx® Series offers versatile modular seating components with unique proprietary designs and materials designed to optimize pressure management and to help ensure long-term proper posture. The company's PinDot® series provides custom molded seat modules that can accommodate the most unique anatomic needs, and that can be adapted to fit with a wide range of mobility products. The company's ability to rapidly produce highly-customized products is highly specialized in the market, and is valued by therapists who need timely solutions for their patient's most complex clinical needs.
•Power Add-Ons The company sells innovative power add-on devices that enable manual wheelchair users to have optional electric power to augment manual propulsion and enable caretakers to more easily maneuver manual wheelchairs. This product category includes six main product lines: stairclimbers (scalamobil® and scalacombi); push and brake aids (viamobil® and viamobil eco), push-rim activated power assists (e-motion®, twion®, smoov®), Joystick controlled add-on kits (e-fix® and Esprit); Handbikes (e-pilot®) and E-Bike drive train components (neodrives®). Add-on drives can be retrofitted to almost any manual wheelchair. The 



Part I 
Item 1. Business

products are characterized by their light weight design and compactness, which makes them an ideal travel companion. Highly efficient hub motors along with the latest Lithium-Ion battery technology are used to enhance freedom of movement for users and their caregivers.
Lifestyle Products
•Pressure Relieving Sleep Surfaces. This product category includes a complete line of therapeutic pressure relieving overlays and mattress systems. The Invacare® Softform and microAIR® brand names feature a broad range of pressure relieving foam mattresses and powered mattresses with alternating pressure, low-air-loss, or rotational design features, which redistribute weight and assist with moisture management. These mattresses are designed to provide comfort, support and relief to those patients who are immobile or have limited mobility; who may have fragile skin or be susceptible to skin breakdown; and who spend long periods in bed.
•Safe Patient Handling. This product category includes products needed to assist caregivers in transferring individuals from surface to surface (e.g., bed to chair). Designed for use in the home or in institutional settings, these products include ceiling and floor lifts, sit-to-stand devices and a comprehensive line of slings. The company has very strong development in these areas with numerous launches in the last year: Birdie™, Evo, ISA™, and new Optislings.
•Beds. This product category includes wide variety of Invacare® branded semi-electric and fully-electric bed systems designed for both residential and institutional care for a range of patient sizes. The company's offering includes bed accessories, such as bedside rails, overbed tables and trapeze bars. The company's bed systems introduced the split-spring bed design, which is easier for home medical equipment providers to deliver, assemble and clean than other bed designs. Invacare's bed systems also feature patented universal bed-ends, where the headboard and footboard may be used interchangeably. This enables customers to more efficiently deploy their inventory.
•Manual Wheelchairs. This product category includes a complete line of manual wheelchairs. The company's manual wheelchairs are sold for use in the home and in institutional care settings. Consumers include people who are chronically or temporarily-disabled, require basic mobility with little or no frame modification, and may propel themselves or be moved by a caregiver. The company's manual wheelchairs are marketed under the Invacare® brand 

name. Examples include the 9000, Tracer® wheelchair product lines, as well as the Action family of products in Europe.
•Personal Care. This product category includes a full line of personal care products, including ambulatory aids such as rollators, walkers, and wheeled walkers. The company also distributes bathing safety aids, such as tub transfer benches and shower chairs, as well as patient care products, such as commodes and other toileting aids. In markets where payors value durable long-lasting devices, especially those markets outside of the U.S., personal care products continue to be an important part of the company's lifestyle products business. In certain other markets, and in the U.S. in particular, this product area is focused on residential care.
Respiratory Therapy Products
The company designs and manufactures products that concentrate oxygen for consumers who need supplemental oxygen for breathing. Invacare® oxygen products are designed to meet a wide variety of patient needs, including stationary systems for use while at home and portable systems for mobile use. Historically, oxygen therapy required the delivery of large tanks of liquid oxygen or the routine delivery of tanks of compressed oxygen to patients. Industry trends continue to displace modes of oxygen therapy that involve delivery, which is costlier to provide and less convenient for patients who need to coordinate the exchange of oxygen containers. Published industry data suggests a large portion of the costs associated with home oxygen therapy are directly associated with delivery-related activities required to meet the ambulatory oxygen therapy needs of patients. Invacare's newer modalities of oxygen supply replace these costlier and constraining delivery-based forms of care.
•Stationary Oxygen Concentrators. Invacare oxygen concentrators are manufactured under the Platinum® and Perfecto2™ brand names and are available in five-, nine-, and ten-liter models. All Invacare stationary oxygen concentrators are designed to provide patients with durable equipment that reliably concentrates oxygen at home or in a healthcare setting. Stationary oxygen concentrators are typically used by people needing home or nocturnal oxygen, or by patients who have advanced-stage lung diseases and whose lifestyles keep them largely at home.
•Portable Oxygen Concentrators. One of two primary modalities for non-delivery supplementary ambulatory oxygen is the battery-powered portable category. Invacare's Platinum® Mobile Oxygen Concentrator has among the most competitive features in the five-liter equivalent category, including the industry's first wireless informatics 



Part I 
Item 1. Business

platform in the five-pound category. The informatics platform includes a user centric app which allows remote flow control of the portable concentrator from up to 25ft and a provider facing portal for remote fleet monitoring to help reduce unplanned dispatches and total operating costs.
•Oxygen Refilling Devices. The Invacare® HomeFill® Oxygen System is an alternative source of ambulatory oxygen that allows patients to fill their own convenient small portable oxygen cylinders from a stationary oxygen concentrator at home. This enables users to access high-flow stationary oxygen while at home and provides an easy-to-use form of mobile oxygen while away. As a result, medical equipment providers can significantly reduce time-consuming and costly service calls associated with cylinder and/or liquid oxygen deliveries, limit recurring high maintenance expenses and total cost of ownership while at the same time enhancing the lifestyle of the patient. 
Other Products and Services
Other products and services include various services, including repair services, equipment rentals and external contracting. In certain regions of Europe and Asia Pacific, refurbishing of products is increasing as governments look for ways to lower costs while still providing needed equipment. A range of distributed products including a heart rate monitor, thermometer and nebulizer were launched for the Asia Pacific market. Portable ramps are sold throughout Asia and Europe, largely to public transport providers.
GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENTS
Europe
The company's Europe segment operates as an integrated unit across the European, Middle Eastern and African markets with sales and operations throughout Europe. The Europe segment is coordinated with other global business units for new product development, supply chain resources and additional corporate resources. This segment primarily includes mobility and seating; lifestyle; and respiratory therapy product lines. Products are sold through home healthcare providers and government provider agencies. In total, the Europe segment comprised 55.0%, 57.4% and 57.4% of net sales in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
North America
The company's North America segment comprises sales and operations throughout the United States, Mexico and Canada. This segment primarily includes mobility and 

seating, lifestyle and respiratory therapy product lines.

For financial information regarding reportable segments, including revenues from external customers, products, segment profitability, assets and other information by segments, refer to Business Segments in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
WARRANTY
Generally, the company's products are covered by warranties against defects in material and workmanship for product-specific warranty periods starting from the date of sale to the customer. Certain components, principally wheelchair and bed frames, carry a lifetime warranty.
COMPETITION
The durable medical equipment markets are highly competitive, and Invacare products face significant competition from other well-established manufacturers and distributors in the industry. Each country into which the company sells and markets its products has a set of unique conditions that impact competition, including healthcare coverage, forms and levels of reimbursement, presence of payor and provider structures and various competitors. Many factors may play a role in the selection of products and success of the company including specific features, aesthetics, quality, availability, service levels and price. Various competitors, from time to time, have instituted price-cutting programs in an effort to gain market share, and they may do so again in the future. In addition, reimbursement pressures may continue to persist in major markets, such as the U.S. These pressures have and may again significantly alter market dynamics. Increasingly, customers have access to manufacturers in low cost locations and are able to source certain products directly in 



Part I 
Item 1. Business

lieu of purchasing from Invacare or its traditional competitors, particularly for less complex products where price is the primary selection criterion. 
The company believes that successfully increasing its market share is dependent on its ability to provide value to its customers based on clinical benefits, quality, performance, and durability of the company's products and services. In addition, the company's cost reduction achievements are expected to improve the market competitiveness of its products. Customers also value the technical and clinical expertise of the company's sales force, the effectiveness of the company's distribution system, the strength of its dealer and distributor network, the availability of prompt and reliable service for its products, and the ease of doing business with the company. The company's focus on quality is paramount. By embracing quality in all aspects of the company's activities, the company believes that its products will be better aligned with customer needs and, brought to market more quickly, resulting in a better customer experience and economic return. 
SALES, MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION
Europe
The company's European operations primarily conduct manufacturing, marketing and distribution functions in Western Europe and coordinate export sales activities through local distributors for markets in Eastern Europe, Russia, Middle East and Africa. The company utilizes an employee sales force and independent distributors. In markets where the company has its own sales force, product sales are made to medical equipment dealers and directly to government agencies. Marketing functions are staffed by central and regional teams to optimize coverage and content. The company operates distribution centers in various locations to optimize cost and delivery performance.
Prior to the pandemic, company representatives attended more than 50 trade shows annually across the European and Middle eastern geographies. With the pandemic, most of these trade shows have been cancelled and the company has changed to webinars and digital events. The company builds brand awareness through a strong presence in social media (LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram) and has a dedicated blog that has achieved more than one million readers in 2020. In some European countries, the company sponsors key events and several individual wheelchair athletes and teams. In addition, every year the company conducts numerous marketing campaigns targeted to dealers, therapists, and end users to promote current and new products.

North America
In the United States, Invacare products are marketed primarily to clinical specialists in rehabilitation centers, long-term care facilities, hospice facilities, government agencies and residential care settings. The company markets to these medical professionals, who refer their patients to rehabilitation, HME, and government providers to obtain specific types of the company's medical equipment. The company sells its products to these providers.
In 2020, the North America sales force was primarily organized into three groups of specialized sales professionals focused on complex rehabilitation, post-acute care and respiratory products. Each team is focused on clinically complex products and solutions to support customer needs.
The company contributes extensively to editorial coverage in trade publications concerning the products the company manufactures. Company representatives attend numerous online trade shows and conferences on a national and regional basis in which Invacare products are displayed to providers, health care professionals, managed care professionals and consumers. The company also drives brand awareness through its website, as well as online communities of people who may use its products. 
The company raises consumer awareness of its products through a strong presence in social and digital media as well as its sponsorship of a variety of wheelchair sporting events and its support of various philanthropic causes benefiting consumers of the company's products. The company's sponsorship of several individual wheelchair athletes and teams continued in 2020, including top-ranked male and female racers and handcyclists and wheelchair basketball teams. In addition, the company supports disabled veterans with its continuous sponsorship of the National Veterans Wheelchair Games, the largest annual wheelchair sporting event in the world, although the event did not take place in 2020 as a result of the pandemic. These sporting events bring a competitive and recreational sports experience to military veterans who, due to spinal cord injury, neurological conditions or amputation, use various assistive technology devices for their mobility needs.
The company's products are distributed through a network of facilities and directly from some manufacturing sites to optimize cost, inventory and delivery performance.
All Other
All Other comprises revenue primarily from Australia and New Zealand and to a lesser extent from other regions of the Asia Pacific market. The New Zealand revenues 



Part I 
Item 1. Business

include rental of durable medical equipment. It uses an employee sales force and service representatives to support this revenue. Products are distributed throughout Asia Pacific from a regional distribution center in Thailand, with complex rehabilitation product assembled in Thailand and sourced from global sources via a network of distribution nodes designed to optimize cost, inventory and delivery performance.
Sales and marketing efforts in Asia Pacific region are managed within the region and leveraged from other regions of the company. Sponsorship efforts are focused at the grass roots level and around programs designed to introduce people with disabilities to sports as a pathway to inclusion. While efforts were suspended in 2020 due to the pandemic, historically Invacare Australia sponsored the Summer Down Under Series, which culminated in the Oz Day 10K classic wheelchair race on Australia Day; Invacare New Zealand sponsored the Halberg Junior Disability Games and worked with local organizations to improve access for people with disabilities. Invacare supports a number of sporting organizations in the region, primarily focused on those that introduce people to sports. 
PRODUCT LIABILITY COSTS
The company is self-insured in North America for product liability exposures through its captive insurance company, Invatection Insurance Company, which currently has a policy year that runs from September 1 to August 31 and insures annual policy losses up to $10,000,000 per occurrence and $13,000,000 in the aggregate. The company has additional layers of external insurance coverage, related to all lines of insurance, insuring up to $75,000,000 in aggregate losses per policy year arising from individual claims anywhere in the world that exceed the captive insurance company policy limits or the limits of the company's per-country foreign liability limits, as applicable. There can be no assurance that Invacare's current insurance levels will continue to be adequate or available at affordable rates.
Product liability reserves are recorded for individual claims based upon historical experience, industry expertise and other indicators. Additional reserves, in excess of the specific individual case reserves, are provided for incurred unreported claims based upon actuarial valuations at the time such valuations are conducted. Historical claims experience and other assumptions are taken into consideration by the company in estimating the ultimate reserves. For example, the actuarial analysis assumes that historical loss experience is an indicator of future experience, that the distribution of exposures by geographic area and nature of operations for ongoing operations is expected to be very similar to historical operations with no dramatic changes and that the government indices used to trend losses and exposures are 

appropriate. Estimated amounts used in the calculation of reserves are adjusted on a regular basis and can be impacted by actual loss awards and claim settlements. While actuarial analysis is used to help determine adequate reserves, the company is responsible for determining and recording adequate reserves in accordance with accepted loss reserving standards and practices and applicable accounting principles.
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND ENGINEERING
The company's strategy includes developing a cadence of meaningful new products in key markets and product areas. The intent is to have close collaboration in the development phase of new products with input from potential end users.

The company operates several vertically integrated centers of excellence, i.e., factories, in North America, each with specific capabilities: custom powered wheelchairs, seating products and respiratory therapy products (Elyria, OH); manual and passive manual wheelchairs and patient aids (Reynosa, MX); beds, institutional case goods and respiratory therapy products (Sanford, FL); manual recreational and sport wheelchair products (Pinellas Park, FL), passive manual and pediatric wheelchairs (Simi Valley, CA); and seating and positioning systems (Toronto, Canada). Products designed and produced in North American operations are sold in North America and are shipped as finished goods and as subcomponents to internal and external customers globally. 
Asia Pacific
Invacare Asia Pacific assembles components used primarily in rehabilitation products that serve Asia Pacific markets at a facility based in Thailand. The company operates a centralized distribution node in Thailand, with additional nodes in Australia and New Zealand, to supply customer needs while optimizing cost, inventory and service levels.
BUSINESS OPTIMIZATION ACTIONS
The company is executing a multi-year strategy to return the company to profitability by focusing its resources on products and solutions that provide greater healthcare value in clinically complex rehabilitation and post-acute care. The company's business optimization actions and growth plan balances innovative organic growth, product portfolio changes across all regions, and cost improvements in supply chain and administrative functions. Key elements of the business optimization and growth plans are:
•Globally, continue to drive all business segments and product lines based on their potential to achieve a leading market position and to support profitability goals;
•In Europe, leverage centralized innovation and supply chain capabilities while reducing the cost and complexity of a legacy infrastructure;
•In North America, adjust the portfolio to consistently grow profitability amid cost increases by adding new products, reducing costs and continuing to improve customers' experience;
•In Asia Pacific, remain focused on sustainable growth and expansion in the southeast Asia region; and,

•Take actions globally to reduce working capital and improve free cash flow.
As it navigates the uncertain business environment resulting from the pandemic, the company continues to allocate more resources to the business units experiencing increased demand and expects to continue taking actions to mitigate the potential negative financial and operational impacts on other parts of the company's business that have declined. In the medium-term, the company still expects to execute on its business improvement actions, such as the global IT modernization initiative which is expected to ultimately result in optimization of the operating structure.
The company believes that continued generation of earnings driven by operational performance, cash balances on hand, and expected free cash flow will support the company's on-going business improvement plans and enable it to address future debt maturities.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
The company is governed by regulations that affect the manufacture, distribution, marketing and sale of its products and regulate healthcare reimbursement that may affect its customers and the company directly. These policies differ among and within every country in which the company operates. Changes in regulations, guidelines, procedural precedents, enforcement and healthcare policy take place frequently and can impact the size, growth potential and profitability of products sold in each market.
In many markets, healthcare costs have been consistently increasing in excess of the rate of inflation and as a percentage of GDP. Efforts to control payor's budgets have impacted reimbursement levels for healthcare programs. Private insurance companies often mimic changes in government programs. Reimbursement guidelines in the home healthcare industry have a substantial impact on the nature and type of equipment consumers can obtain and thus, affect the product mix, pricing and payment patterns of the company's customers who are typically the medical equipment providers to end-users.
The company has continued its efforts to influence public policies that impact home-based and long-term non-acute healthcare. The company has been actively educating federal and state legislators about the needs of the patient communities it serves and has worked with policy authors to ensure the industry's healthcare consumer needs are represented. The company believes its efforts have given the company a competitive advantage. Customers and end-users recognize the company's advocacy efforts, and the company has the benefit of remaining apprised of emerging policy direction.

FDA
 The United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) regulates the manufacture, distribution and marketing of medical devices. Under such regulation, medical devices are classified as Class I, Class II or Class III devices, depending on the level of risk posed to patients, with Class III designating the highest-risk devices. The company's principal products are designated as Class I or Class II. In general, Class I devices must comply with general controls, including, but not limited to, requirements related to establishment registration and device listing, labeling, medical device reporting, and the Quality System Regulation (QSR). In addition to general controls, certain Class II devices must comply with design controls, premarket notification and clearance, and applicable special controls. Domestic and foreign manufacturers of medical devices sold in the U.S. are subject to routine inspections by FDA. In addition, some foreign governments have adopted regulations relating to the design, manufacture and marketing of health care products, and imposing similar controls as the FDA regulations.
Other Medical Device Regulators
Outside the U.S., it is customary for foreign governments to have a ministry of health or similar government body that regulates and enforces regulations relating to the design, manufacture, distribution and marketing of medical devices. In some cases, there are common standards for design and testing. In some cases, there are country-specific requirements. These regulations are not always harmonized with those from other jurisdictions and in some cases, the consequence in costs, time to enter a market or support a product may be significant.
The company is currently conducting a program to bring its products designed, manufactured and sold into the European Union market, into conformance with the EU MDR (Medical Device Regulations). The company is compliant for all class I devices. Class II devices will be completed on or before the required date of May 27, 2024 date.
2012 Consent Decree, Taylor Street and Corporate Facilities
In December 2012, the company became subject to a consent decree of injunction filed by FDA with respect to the company's Corporate Headquarters and its Taylor Street facility's operations in Elyria, Ohio. The consent decree initially limited the company's (i) manufacture and distribution of power and manual wheelchairs, wheelchair components and wheelchair sub-assemblies at or from its Taylor Street manufacturing facility, except in verified 

cases of medical necessity, (ii) design activities related to wheelchairs and power beds that take place at the impacted Elyria facilities and (iii) replacement, service and repair of products already in use and supplied from the Taylor Street manufacturing facility. Under the terms of the consent decree, in order to resume full operations, the company had to successfully complete independent, third-party expert certification audits at the impacted Elyria facilities, comprised of three distinct certification reports separately submitted to, and accepted by, the FDA; submit its own report to the FDA; and successfully complete a reinspection by the FDA of the company's Corporate and Taylor Street facilities. 
On July 24, 2017, following its June 2017 reinspection of the Corporate and Taylor Street facilities, the FDA notified the company that it was in substantial compliance with the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDA Act), FDA regulations and the terms of the consent decree and that the company was permitted to resume full operations at those facilities including the resumption of unrestricted sales of products made in those facilities.
The consent decree will continue in effect for at least five years from July 24, 2017, during which time the company's Corporate and Taylor Street facilities must complete two semi-annual audits in the first year following the lifting of the injunction and then an annual audit in each of the next four years performed by an independent company-retained audit firm. The expert audit firm will determine whether the facilities remain in continuous compliance with the FDA Act, regulations and the terms of the consent decree and issue post audit reports contemporaneously to the FDA and Invacare. The FDA has the authority to inspect these facilities and any other FDA registered facility, at any time.
In 2018, the company completed the two semi-annual independent expert audits and, in 2019 and 2020, the company completed the first two annual independent expert audit of the Corporate and Taylor Street facilities, as required under the consent decree, and in each case the facilities were found to remain in compliance with the FDA Act, the FDA regulations and the consent decree. The audit reports have been submitted to FDA. Following the 2020 independent audit, the FDA requested the company's corrective actions to address three of four issued minor observations. These corrective actions were provided to the FDA and there were no further requests concerning the audit or its results.
Under the consent decree, the FDA has the authority to order the company to take a wide variety of actions if the FDA finds that the company is not in compliance with the consent decree, FDA Act or FDA regulations, including requiring the company to cease all operations relating to Taylor Street products. The FDA also can order 



Part I 
Item 1. Business

the company to undertake a partial cessation of operations or a recall, issue a safety alert, public health advisory, or press release, or to take any other corrective action the FDA deems necessary with respect to Taylor Street products. 
The FDA also has authority under the consent decree to assess liquidated damages of $15,000 per violation per day for any violations of the consent decree, FDA regulations or the FDA Act. The FDA also may assess liquidated damages for shipments of adulterated or misbranded devices in the amount of twice the sale price of any such adulterated or misbranded device. The liquidated damages, if assessed, are limited to a total of $7,000,000 for each calendar year. The authority to assess liquidated damages is in addition to any other remedies otherwise available to the FDA, including civil money penalties.
For additional information regarding the consent decree, refer to the following sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K: Item 1. Business - Government Regulation; Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Other FDA Matters
As required, the company's facilities which produce products for sale in the U.S. are registered with the FDA. Those facilities are subject to inspections by the FDA at any time. Recent inspections of company facilities by or on behalf of the FDA are summarized in the following paragraphs.
From January 13, 2020 through January 31, 2020, FDA conducted a routine inspection under the Consent Decree of Invacare Headquarters and Taylor Street Operations. At the close of the inspection, three FDA Form 483 observations were issued. Invacare has responded to the FDA to address the 483 observations and the inspection was closed as No Action Indicated (NAI) meaning no objectionable conditions or practices were found during the inspection.
The company expects that substantially all of its facilities will be inspected by the FDA or other regulatory agencies from time to time. The frequency, duration, scope, findings and consequences of these inspections cannot be predicted.

From time to time, the company may undertake voluntary recalls or field corrective actions of the company's products to correct potential product safety issues that may arise, in furtherance of the company's high standards of quality, safety and effectiveness.
In December 2020, the company’s operations in Sanford, Florida and Elyria, Ohio underwent a successful MDSAP (Medical Device Single Audit Program) 

surveillance audit. No findings were issued as a result of this audit. 
Other Quality Accomplishments
In 2020, the company's main facilities in Europe, Asia and North America were again certified as meeting ISO 13485-2016 requirements, a stringent international standard for quality management systems, demonstrating its continued commitment to quality excellence.
National Competitive Bidding
In the United States, CMS is a significant payor and governs healthcare reimbursement for Medicare services. On January 1, 2011, CMS began its National Competitive Bidding ("NCB") program in nine metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) across the country ("Round 1") to reduce healthcare spending, pursuant to a 2003 federal law. On July 1, 2013, CMS expanded the program to an additional 91 MSAs ("Round 2"). These bid programs have resulted in new, lower Medicare payment rates in these 100 areas. In January 2016, CMS began the deployment of NCB rates to the remainder of the Medicare population that had not yet been impacted by the program. These were primarily less densely populated, rural areas. In 2016, CMS divided the United States into eight regions and applied the average reimbursement reduction per NCB product category in each region from Round 1 and Round 2 to the rural providers in those eight regions.
In November 2018, CMS announced that it was suspending the NCB program for approximately two years, from January 1, 2019 through approximately December 31, 2020, and in the interim will implement changes to the NCB program. CMS' November 2018 rule also modified payment rates for oxygen, based on Medicare's “budget neutrality” mandate. For the oxygen devices the company sells, the total Medicare payment rate remained substantially similar to 2018 payment rates.
On March 7, 2019, the CMS announced plans to consolidate the competitive bidding areas (CBAs) included in the Round 2 Recompete and Round 1 2017 Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies (DMEPOS) Competitive Bidding Program (CBP) into a single round of competition named Round 2021. 
On October 27, 2020, CMS revealed that the Agency would only move forward with off-the-shelf (OTS) back braces and OTS knee braces for Round 2021 of the CBP effective January 1, 2021 and extending through December 31, 2023. CMS removed the remaining 13 product categories for Round 2021 and delayed any changes for three years. 
The company's exposure to effects of NCB rate reductions and any similar reductions from private payors 



Part I 
Item 1. Business

or state agencies can increase the company's credit risk associated with customers whose revenue, based on reimbursement, may be significantly reduced. As reimbursement rates are reduced, the company's customers may experience pressure on profitability and liquidity. The company therefore remains focused on being judicious in its extension of credit to its customers and vigilant about collections efforts.
In addition, the consequence of reduced reimbursement has and may continue to compel customers to consider alternative sources of supply, which may be available at lower purchase prices, thereby reducing sales or the price at which customers will transact for certain products.
Although reductions in CMS payments are disruptive to the homecare industry, the company believes it can grow and thrive in this environment. The company expects to continue pursuing productivity initiatives intended to lower the costs to serve customers, in an effort to profitably meet lower customer price targets. The company also produces certain solutions, which can provide lower total cost of business for its customers. As an example, the company's respiratory therapy products can help offset reimbursement reductions by eliminating the need for routine home exchange services of pre-filled oxygen cylinders with end-users. Delivery costs can be a substantial element of cost for its customers. The company's HomeFill oxygen system, Platinum Mobile oxygen concentrator, as well as the company's oxygen concentrators, can provide effective convenient therapy for consumers and cost-effective equipment solutions for providers by eliminating customer's costs associated with home cylinder exchange. Similarly, the informatics capabilities the company launched for power wheelchairs and respiratory devices in 2017 enable customers to more cost effectively provide service and support their end-user customers. The company intends to continue developing solutions that help providers improve profitability and reduce the overall cost of care for payors.
BACKLOG
The company generally manufactures its products to meet near-term demands by shipping from stock or by building to order based on the specialized nature of certain products. As a result, the company does not ordinarily have a substantial backlog of orders for any particular product. However, at the end of 2020, the order backlogs in Europe and North America are at higher levels than normal as a result of strong demand for respiratory products driven by COVID-19 and supply chain constraints due to pandemic-related disruptions in supply chain, transportation and logistics which are affecting access to components and finished products.

HUMAN CAPITAL
As of December 31, 2020, the company had approximately 3,400 employees. The company believes that its employees are integral to its success and strive to create a rewarding culture through commitment to its core values of Integrity, Innovation, Leadership, Excellence and Accountability. The company's compensation programs are designed to attract, retain and motivate employees to be part of the company's success. The company provides wages that are competitive locally and consistent globally to reward employees for performance. The company's long-term incentive program is equity based to align leadership with the interests of shareholders.
