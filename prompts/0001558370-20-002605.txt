ITEM 1.  BUSINESS Overview
 MMA Capital Holdings, Inc. focuses on investments that generate positive environmental and social impacts and deliver attractive risk-adjusted total returns to our shareholders, with an emphasis on debt associated with renewable energy projects and infrastructure. Unless the context otherwise requires, and when used in this Report, the “Company,” “MMA,” “we,” “our” or “us” refers to MMA Capital Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries. We were originally organized as a Delaware limited liability company in 1996, converted to a Delaware corporation on January 1, 2019 and are externally managed by Hunt Investment Management, LLC (our “External Manager”), an affiliate of Hunt Companies, Inc. (Hunt Companies, Inc. and its affiliates are hereinafter referred to as “Hunt”). 
 Our objective is to produce attractive risk-adjusted returns by investing in the large, growing and fragmented renewable energy market in the United States (“U.S.”). We believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of these investment opportunities because of our External Manager’s origination network built off of extensive relationships and credit expertise gathered through years of experience. We also seek to increase the Company’s return on equity by prudently deploying debt and recycling equity out of lower yielding investments that are unrelated to renewable energy. 
 In addition to renewable energy investments, we continue to own a limited number of bond investments, loan receivables and real estate-related investments, as well as have subordinated debt with beneficial economic terms. Further, we have significant net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) that may be used to offset future federal income tax obligations, a portion of which were reported as deferred tax assets (“DTAs”) in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2019. We do not anticipate growing investments that are unrelated to renewable energy given current market conditions and, effective December 31, 2019, we no longer organize our assets and liabilities into discrete portfolios (at December 31, 2018 and in each Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that was filed in 2019, assets and liabilities of the Company were allocated to one of two portfolios, “Energy Capital” and “Other Assets and Liabilities”). 
 We operate as a single reporting segment.
 Renewable Energy Investments
 We invest in loans that finance renewable energy projects to enable developers, design and build contractors and system owners to develop, build and operate renewable energy systems throughout the U.S. Renewable energy debt in which we invest is primarily structured as senior secured fixed rate loans that are made through joint ventures or directly on our balance sheet. These loans, which are generally short term in nature, are typically made to project company borrowers when they are in the late stages of development or construction of their commercial, utility and community solar scale photovoltaic (“PV”) facilities that are located across different states and benefit from various state and federal regulatory programs. The short duration of loans in which we invest also helps us to efficiently manage interest rate risk, mitigate long-term risks such as credit exposure to off-take counterparties and provide us flexibility to target investments.
 We generally invest in renewable energy investments through the following joint ventures: Solar Construction Lending, LLC (“SCL”); Solar Permanent Lending, LLC (“SPL”); Solar Development Lending, LLC (“SDL”); these joint ventures together with our wholly owned subsidiary, Renewable Energy Lending, LLC (“REL”), are hereinafter referred to as the “Solar Ventures.” We are a 50% investor member in the renewable energy joint ventures in which we invest though, on occasion, we may become a minority investor through the execution of non-pro rata funding agreements in which our capital partner contributes a disproportionate amount of a capital call. At December 31, 2019, we were a minority investor in SDL and SCL.
 Lending Activities of the Solar Ventures
 The Solar Ventures typically lend on a senior secured basis collateralized by solar projects, but may also invest in subordinated loans and, revolving loans and may finance non-solar renewable technologies such as wind and battery storage, or provide equipment financing and other customized debt solutions for borrowers. The Solar Ventures target loans that are underwritten to generate internal rates of return (“IRR”) ranging from 10% to 15%, before expenses, with

origination fees that range from 1.0% to 3.0% on committed capital and fixed-rate coupons that range from 7.0% to 14.0%. These loans generally range in size from $2 million to over $50 million. 
 Since their inception in 2015, the Solar Ventures have invested in more than 160 project-based loans that total $2.3 billion of debt commitments for the development and construction of over 660 renewable energy project sites. When completed, these projects will contribute to the generation of over 6.2 gigawatts of renewable energy, thereby eliminating approximately 177 million metric tons of carbon emissions over their project lives. The Solar Ventures closed $999.0 million of commitments across 62 loans during 2019 as compared to $401.9 million and 35 loans during 2018.
 Through December 31, 2019, $1.3 billion of commitments across 111 project-based loans had been repaid with no loss of principal, resulting in a weighted-average IRR (“WAIRR”) of 17.2% that was on average higher than originally underwritten loan IRRs. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2019, 31 loans totaling $348.7 million of commitments had been repaid, resulting in a WAIRR of 20.8%. WAIRR is measured as the total return in dollars of all repaid loans divided by the total commitment amount associated with such loans, where (i) the total return for each repaid loan was calculated as the product of each loan’s IRR and its commitment amount and (ii) IRR for each repaid loan was established by solving for a discount rate that made the net present value of all loan cash flows equal zero. WAIRR has been higher than the net return on the Company's investments in the Solar Ventures because it is a measure of gross returns earned by the Solar Ventures on repaid loans and does not include the effects of: (i) operating expenses of the Solar Ventures; (ii) the preferred return earned by the Company’s former investment partner in REL through the second quarter of 2018; (iii) the amortization of the purchase premium paid by the Company to buyout our former investment partner’s interest in REL and (iv) the opportunity cost of idle capital. 
 At December 31, 2019, loans funded through the Solar Ventures had an aggregate unpaid principal balance (“UPB”) and total fair value (“FV”) of $654.4 million, a weighted-average remaining maturity of 10 months and a weighted-average coupon of 10.8%. At December 31, 2018, loans funded through the Solar Ventures had an aggregate UPB of $250.8 million, a weighted-average maturity of seven months and a weighted-average coupon of 9.2%. 
 Table 1 provides financial information about the composition of the Solar Ventures’ loan portfolio at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. 
 Table 1: Composition of the Solar Venture’s Loan Portfolio

 | At | | At 
 | December 31, | | December 31,
(in thousands) | 2019 | | 2018 
Late-stage development | $ | 298,609 | | $ | 74,224

Other loans associated with renewable energy | | 10,345 | | | 150 
Total UPB | $ | 654,360 | | $ | 250,786

      The Solar Ventures had $312.5 million of unfunded loan commitments to borrowers, of which $157.1 million was attributable to the Company based upon our interest in these ventures at December 31, 2019. The unfunded loan commitments are anticipated to be funded primarily by capital within the Solar Ventures through a combination of idle capital and existing loan redemptions. To the extent capital within the Solar Ventures is not sufficient to meet their funding obligations additional capital contributions by the members of the Solar Ventures would be required.
 Investment Interests and Related Carrying Values
 The carrying value and income-related information related to investments that we have made in, or related to, the Solar Ventures are further discussed below. In December 2019, the Company and our capital partner in SDL and SCL executed various non-pro rata funding agreements pursuant to which our capital partner contributed $73.0 million of $91.0 million SDL capital calls and $58.0 million of $59.0 million SCL capital calls, while the Company contributed the balance. As a consequence of these capital contributions, at December 31, 2019, through MMA Energy Holdings, LLC, the Company held ownership interests of 42.0%, 50.0%, 41.5% and 100% in SCL, SPL, SDL and REL, respectively.

 In addition to investments in the Solar Ventures, in the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company invested in a loan originated by our External Manager with a $2.1 million commitment made to a special purpose entity that is secured by land, which is subject to a 25-year ground lease to a community solar project, and by the equity interests in the borrower. The UPB of the funded portion of this loan, which bears interest at a fixed rate of 8.0% and matures in December 2022, was $0.5 million at December 31, 2019.

Table 2 provides financial information about the carrying value of the Company’s renewable energy investments at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. 
 Table 2:  Carrying Values of the Company’s Renewable Energy Investments

 | At | | At 
 | December 31, | | December 31,
(in thousands) | 2019 | | 2018 
Equity investments in the Solar Ventures | $ | 289,123 | | $ | 126,339
Loan receivable | | 500 | | | ─ 
Total carrying value | $ | 289,623 | | $ | 126,339

      The carrying value of the Company’s equity investments in the Solar Ventures increased $162.8 million during 2019 as a result of $142.0 million of net capital contributions made that were primarily sourced from draws on our revolving credit facility and equity recycled out of nonrenewable energy investments. Such increase was also driven in part by $20.8 million of equity in income in the Solar Ventures that was recognized during 2019.
 Investment Income and Return on Investment
 The Company applies the equity method of accounting to its equity investments in the Solar Ventures, which are not consolidated by the Company for reporting purposes. Accordingly, the Company recognizes its allocable share of the Solar Ventures’ net income based on the Company’s weighted-average percentage ownership during each reporting period. Separately, the Company recognizes interest income associated with the aforementioned loan using the interest method.
 Table 3 summarizes income recognized by the Company in connection with our renewable energy investments for the periods presented.
 Table 3:  Income Recognized from Renewable Energy Investments

 | For the year ended
 | December 31, 
(in thousands) | 2019 | | 2018
Equity in income from the Solar Ventures | $ | 20,758 | | $ | 6,894
Interest income and net fee income (1) | | 2,287 | | | 61 
Total investment income | $ | 23,045 | | $ | 6,955


(1) | The majority of interest income recognized in 2019 was attributable to a secured loan receivable from an affiliate of Hunt related to the Company’s acquisition of Hunt’s equity interest in SDL in the second quarter of 2019. This loan receivable was recharacterized as an equity investment in SDL in the fourth quarter of 2019.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The Company generated an unleveraged net return, on investment from our renewable energy investments of 11.4% and 6.6% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These returns were measured by dividing total annual investment income from renewable energy investments by the average carrying value of renewable energy investments on a trailing four quarter basis.
 Refer to the comparative discussion of our Consolidated Results of Operations for more information about income that was recognized in connection with the Company’s renewable energy investments.

 Leveraging our Renewable Energy Investments
 On September 19, 2019, MMA Energy Holdings, LLC (“MEH” or “Borrower”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a $125.0 million (the “Facility Amount”) credit agreement with various lenders that initially provided for a $70.0 million revolving credit facility, which was subsequently increased to $100.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2019. On February 28, 2020, the participating lenders of the revolving credit facility consented to increase the maximum Facility Amount to $175.0 million. On March 4, 2020, the committed amount of the revolving credit facility increased to $110.0 million upon the joinder of an additional lender. 
 Obligations associated with the revolving credit facility are guaranteed by the Company and are secured by specified assets of the Borrower and a pledge of all of the Company’s equity interest in the Borrower through pledge and security documentation. Availability and amounts advanced under the revolving credit facility, which may be used for various business purposes, are subject to compliance with a borrowing base comprised of assets that comply with certain eligibility criteria, and includes late-stage development, construction and permanent loans to finance renewable energy projects and cash.
 Borrowing on the revolving credit facility bears interest at the one-month London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), adjusted for statutory reserve requirements (subject to a 1.5% floor), plus a fixed spread of 2.75% per annum. The Borrower has also agreed to pay certain customary fees and expenses and to provide certain indemnities. In certain circumstances where the interest rate is unable to be determined, including in the event LIBOR ceases to be published, the administrative agent to the credit agreement will select a new rate in its reasonable judgment, including any adjustment to the replacement rate to reflect a different credit spread. The maturity date of the credit agreement is September 19, 2022, subject to a 12-month extension solely to allow refinancing or orderly repayment of the facility.  
 At December 31, 2019, the UPB and carrying value of amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility was $94.5 million and the Company recognized $1.2 million of related interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations during 2019. 
 The liquidity accessed by the Company through the revolving credit facility has increased the amount of capital invested in the Solar Ventures and reduced the amount of idle capital.
 Hunt Note
 At December 31, 2019, the Company had a secured loan receivable from Hunt (the “Hunt Note”) that had a carrying value of $53.6 million and bore interest at a rate of 5.0% per annum. On January 3, 2020, the Hunt Note was fully repaid. Deferred Tax Assets
 Deferred taxes arise from differences between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting versus income tax return purposes. DTAs are recognized if we assess that it is more likely than not that tax benefits, including NOLs and other tax attributes, will be realized prior to their expiration. 
 At December 31, 2019, the Company had pretax federal NOLs of $374.9 million that were available to reduce future federal income taxes. These NOLs will begin to expire in 2028. As of December 31, 2019, the Company concluded that, based on the weight of available evidence, it was more likely than not that the Company would utilize $210.2 million of these NOLs. Accordingly, during the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company recognized a $57.7 million net DTA. However, a $65.4 million valuation allowance remains in place at December 31, 2019 against the portion of our DTAs that, based on projection assumptions that are generally objectively verifiable, correspond to federal and state NOL carryforwards that we expect will expire prior to utilization based on our forecast of pretax book income at such reporting date. Refer to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 14, “Income Taxes,” for additional information about DTAs.
 Investments in Bonds 
 The Company also has one unencumbered tax-exempt municipal bond that finances the development of infrastructure for a mixed-use town center development in Spanish Fort, Alabama and is secured by incremental tax revenues generated from the development (this investment is hereinafter referred to as our “Infrastructure Bond”). At December 31, 2019,

the Infrastructure Bond had a stated fixed interest rate of 6.3% and had a UPB and fair value of $26.9 million and $25.3 million, respectively.
 At December 31, 2019, we held one subordinate unencumbered tax-exempt multifamily bond investment with a UPB and fair value of $4.0 million and $6.0 million, respectively.
 Real Estate-Related Investments
 At December 31, 2019, we were an equity partner in a real estate-related investment with an 80% ownership interest in a joint venture that owns a mixed-use town center development and undeveloped land parcels and whose incremental tax revenues secure our Infrastructure Bond (hereinafter, the “Infrastructure Venture”). The carrying value of this investment was $19.8 million at December 31, 2019. 
 At December 31, 2019, the Company maintained an 11.85% ownership interest in the South Africa Workforce Housing Fund (“SAWHF”). SAWHF is a multi-investor fund that will mature in April 2020 and is currently in the process of exiting its investments. The carrying value of the Company’s investment in SAWHF was $7.7 million at December 31, 2019.
 At December 31, 2019, we also owned one direct investment in real estate consisting of a parcel of land that is currently in the process of development. This real estate is located just outside the city of Winchester in Frederick County, Virginia. As of December 31, 2019, the carrying value of this investment was $8.4 million. On January 15, 2020, the Company invested $5.9 million in additional land improvements that were capitalized increasing the carrying value of our investment.
 Debt Obligations
 At December 31, 2019, the Company’s nonrenewable energy debt obligations included the subordinated debt, notes payable and other debt used to finance the Company’s 11.85% ownership interest in SAWHF and debt obligations to the Morrison Grove Management, LLC (“MGM”) principals. 
 The carrying value and weighted-average yield of the Company’s nonrenewable energy debt obligations was $107.3 million and 4.0%, respectively, at December 31, 2019. Refer to Table 10, “Debt,” for more information.
 Competition
 We face competition from banks, private equity, infrastructure funds and other renewable energy investors related to new investments. Also, the properties that collateralize our bonds and real estate related investments compete against other companies and properties that seek similar tenants and offer similar services.
 While we have historically been able to compete effectively as a result of our service, reputation, access to capital and longstanding relationships, many of our competitors benefit from substantial economies of scale in their business, have greater access to capital and other resources than we do and may have other competitive advantages over us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than we are able to. 
 Employees
 We have no employees. The Company engaged our External Manager to manage the Company’s continuing operations on January 8, 2018, and all former employees of the Company were at that time hired by the External Manager.
