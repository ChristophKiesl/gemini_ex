Overview 
 We are an oncology-focused biopharmaceutical company committed to delivering medicines that provide a better life for cancer patients. Our strategy is to focus our resources toward the development and commercialization of our product candidates in North America, while leveraging partnerships to support development and commercialization in other geographies. With the approval of our first commercial product, FOTIVDA® (tivozanib), in the United States, we have transitioned from a clinical development stage biopharmaceutical company to a commercial and clinical development stage biopharmaceutical company.
 On March 10, 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved FOTIVDA in the United States for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory advanced renal cell carcinoma following two or more prior systemic therapies. FOTIVDA is an oral, next-generation vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, or VEGFR, tyrosine kinase inhibitor, or TKI. The approval of FOTIVDA is based on our pivotal phase 3 randomized, controlled, multi-center, open-label clinical trial comparing tivozanib to an approved therapy, Nexavar® (sorafenib), in renal cell carcinoma, or RCC, patients whose disease had relapsed or become refractory to two or three prior systemic therapies, which we refer to as the TIVO-3 trial. The approval is also supported by three additional trials in RCC and includes safety data from over 1,000 clinical trial subjects. 
 We are actively preparing for the commercial launch of FOTIVDA in the United States. Our U.S. sales force, sales training, marketing, market access and medical affairs teams as well as distribution capabilities are in place and we expect to have full promotional capabilities and FOTIVDA available to patients by March 31, 2021.
 FOTIVDA is also approved and commercialized through our development partner EUSA Pharma (UK) Limited, or EUSA, in the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain and certain other countries in their territory, for the treatment of adult patients with advanced RCC who are VEGFR pathway inhibitor-naïve and are either untreated or who have failed prior therapy with interferon-alpha (IFN-a) or interleukin-2 (IL-2).
 Based on FOTIVDA’s demonstrated anti-tumor activity, tolerability profile and reduction of regulatory T-cell production, we are studying FOTIVDA in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of RCC and hepatocellular carcinoma, or HCC, in phase 2 clinical trials and we recently announced our entry into a collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb, or BMS, to conduct a phase 3 study of FOTIVDA in combination with OPDIVO® (nivolumab), BMS’s anti-PD-1 therapy, in patients with advanced relapsed or refractory RCC following prior immunotherapy exposure.
 Our pipeline of product candidates includes ficlatuzumab, a potent humanized immunoglobulin G1, or IgG1, monoclonal antibody that targets hepatocyte growth factor, or HGF. We have previously reported promising early clinical data on ficlatuzumab in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, or HNSCC, pancreatic cancer and acute myeloid leukemia, or AML. We are currently conducting a randomized phase 2 confirmatory study of ficlatuzumab for the potential treatment of HNSCC.
 Our pipeline of product candidates also includes worldwide rights to AV-380, a potent humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that targets growth differentiation factor 15, or GDF15. In December 2020, the FDA accepted our investigational new drug application, or IND, for AV-380 for the potential treatment of cancer cachexia, and we have initiated a phase 1 clinical trial in healthy subjects. 
 Our earlier-stage pipeline under development includes AV-203 and AV-353, both as potential oncology treatments. AV-203 is a potent humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that targets ErbB3 (also known as HER3) to which we expect to regain worldwide rights in September 2021. AV-353 is a potent IgG1 monoclonal antibody that targets the Notch 3 pathway.

Business Update Regarding COVID-19

The pandemic caused by an outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus, or the COVID-19 pandemic, that is affecting the U.S. and global economy and financial markets is also impacting our employees, patients, communities and business operations to varying degrees. In the paragraphs that follow, we have described impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our commercialization plans and clinical development programs, as applicable. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19, the actions taken to contain it or treat its impact and the economic impact on local, regional, national and international markets. Certain of our operations had been conducted remotely prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and we have now transitioned essentially all of our business operations to be conducted remotely in response to COVID-19. If the COVID-19 pandemic continues or becomes more severe, it may further impact our ability to maintain that level of productivity, to grow the company as we have anticipated and to execute our commercialization and other long-term business strategies. Management is actively monitoring this situation and the possible effects on our financial condition, liquidity, operations, suppliers, industry and workforce. For additional information on risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, please see “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic,” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our Product Candidates  
 The following summarizes our product candidates as of the date of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K, each of which is described in further detail below:
Tivozanib 
 Our pipeline includes our lead product tivozanib, an oral, next-generation VEGFR TKI. Tivozanib was approved by the FDA for marketing and sale in the United States in March 2021 and will be sold under the brand name FOTIVDA for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory advanced RCC following two or more prior systemic therapies.
 Tivozanib is a potent, selective inhibitor of VEGFRs 1, 2, and 3 with a long half-life designed to improve efficacy and tolerability. FOTIVDA has been shown to significantly reduce regulatory T-cell production in preclinical models. Tivozanib has been investigated in several tumor types, including renal cell, hepatocellular, colorectal, breast and ovarian cancers. We are currently executing studies with tivozanib both as a single agent and in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of RCC and HCC. 
 We have exclusive rights to develop and commercialize tivozanib in oncology in all countries outside of Asia and the Middle East under a license from Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd. (formerly Kirin Brewery Co., Ltd.), or KKC. We have sublicensed to EUSA the right to develop and commercialize tivozanib in our licensed territories outside of North America, including Europe (excluding Russia, Ukraine and the Commonwealth of Independent States), Latin America (excluding Mexico), Africa and Australasia. The EUSA sublicense excludes non-oncologic diseases or conditions of the eye. On August 1, 2019, KKC repurchased the non-oncology rights to tivozanib in our territory, excluding the rights that we sublicensed to EUSA. In September 2020, KKC initiated a phase 1 study of KHK4951, the reformulated tivozanib, in healthy volunteers and patients with wet age-related macular degeneration, or Wet AMD.
 U.S. Commercialization of Tivozanib in Relapsed or Refractory Advanced RCC 
 In March 2020, we submitted an NDA to the FDA based on our TIVO-3 trial and supported by data from three additional trials, including the TIVO-1 trial comparing tivozanib to sorafenib in first-line RCC, and two phase 2 trials, Study 902, the open-label, crossover clinical study of tivozanib for patients who progressed on sorafenib in the TIVO-1 trial, and Study 201, a placebo-controlled study in first-line RCC. On March 10, 2021, the FDA approved FOTIVDA in the United States for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory RCC following two or more prior systemic therapies.
 Our TIVO-3 trial is the first positive phase 3 study in RCC patients whose disease had relapsed or become refractory to two or three prior systemic therapies to meet its primary endpoint, as well as the first phase 3 study in RCC to systematically investigate a predefined subpopulation of patients who received prior checkpoint inhibitor therapy, a predominant standard of care for earlier lines of therapy. Key data from our TIVO-3 trial include the following:
  
• | Tivozanib demonstrated a 44% improvement in median progression-free survival, or PFS, the primary endpoint, with a median PFS in the tivozanib arm of 5.6 months compared with 3.9 months in the sorafenib arm, and 27% reduction in risk of progression or death compared to sorafenib (hazard ratio (HR)=0.73, p=0.0165).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Overall response rate, or ORR, for patients receiving tivozanib was 18% compared to 8% for patients receiving sorafenib (p=0.017).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
7

 
• | Median duration of response in patients receiving tivozanib was not reached (95% confidence interval (CI): 9.8, not reached (NR)) and in patients receiving sorafenib was 5.7 months (95% CI: 5.6, NR).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The final overall survival, or OS, hazard ratio was 0.97 (p=0.82), and the final median OS was 16.4 months for tivozanib and 19.2 months for sorafenib. The final OS hazard ratio of 0.97 was similar to those observed in other phase 3 studies in RCC comparing a prior FDA-approved VEGFR TKI to another VEGFR TKI.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Tivozanib also demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in median PFS for the prespecified subgroup of patients (approximately 26% of patients) who received prior checkpoint inhibitor therapy, with a hazard ratio of 0.55 (p=0.028), a 45% reduction in risk of progression or death compared to sorafenib and a median PFS in the tivozanib arm of 7.3 months compared with 5.1 months in the sorafenib arm. The ORR for patients in this subgroup receiving tivozanib was 24.4% compared to 7% receiving sorafenib. The final OS hazard ratio for this subgroup was 0.84 (HR < 1 favors tivozanib). Tivozanib also demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in median PFS for the prespecified subgroup of patients (approximately 45% of patients) who received two TKIs in earlier lines of treatment, with a hazard ratio of 0.57 (p=0.003), a 43% reduction in risk of progression or death compared to sorafenib and a median PFS in the tivozanib arm of 5.5 months compared with 3.7 months in the sorafenib arm. The ORR for patients in this subgroup receiving tivozanib was 15% compared to 8% receiving sorafenib. The final OS hazard ratio for this subgroup was 0.99.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Tivozanib was generally better tolerated than sorafenib with fewer dose reductions and interruptions due to adverse events. In the tivozanib arm, 46% of patients experienced Grade 3 or higher adverse events compared to 55% of patients in the sorafenib arm. Infrequent but severe adverse events reported in greater number in the tivozanib arm were thrombotic events similar to those observed in previous tivozanib studies. The most common adverse events in patients receiving tivozanib was fatigue and asthenia, adverse events known to reflect effective VEGF pathway inhibition, which has shown a correlation with better PFS outcomes.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe there is significant commercial opportunity for FOTIVDA in the United States. We estimate that the current U.S. market for relapsed or refractory RCC therapy is approximately $1.0 billion, including $700 million in the second line and $300 million in the third and fourth lines. As the TIVO-3 study is the first positive phase 3 study in RCC patients whose disease had relapsed or become refractory to two or three prior systemic therapies as well as the first phase 3 study in RCC to investigate a predefined subpopulation of patients who received prior immunotherapy, a predominant standard of care for earlier lines of therapy, we believe that FOTIVDA could become a standard of care in this relapsed or refractory setting. 
 During 2020 and early 2021, in preparation for the commercial launch of FOTIVDA in the United States, we built our commercial infrastructure including our sales, marketing, market access and medical affairs teams and distribution capabilities. In light of the restrictions necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic, we designed our strategic commercial approach to be optimized for remote as well as in-person customer engagement capabilities and expanded our digital marketing strategies. Our U.S. sales force, sales training, marketing, market access and medical affairs teams as well as distribution capabilities are in place and we expect to have full promotional capabilities by March 31, 2021. 
 Commercialization of Tivozanib in RCC Outside the United States
 First-Line Approval in Europe: In August 2017, the European Commission granted marketing authorization to EUSA for tivozanib in all 28 countries of the European Union, or the EU, (which included the United Kingdom at that time), Norway and Iceland based on the data from our active comparator-controlled supportive phase 3 trial, which we refer to as the TIVO-1 trial, comparing tivozanib to sorafenib (Nexavar®) in first-line RCC. Tivozanib is sold under the brand name FOTIVDA, and is approved for the first-line treatment of adult patients with RCC and for those who are VEGFR and mTOR pathway inhibitor-naïve following disease progression after one prior treatment with cytokine therapy for RCC. 
 In the updated Clinical Practice Guidelines for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of RCC by the European Society for Medical Oncology, or ESMO, published in February 2019, tivozanib has been added as a first-line treatment for patients with good or intermediate risk and as a second-line treatment for patients following first-line TKIs.

Commercial Launch of FOTIVDA: EUSA has received reimbursement approval for and commercially launched FOTIVDA in Germany, the United Kingdom and Spain as well as in some additional EU countries, exclusive of France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, which we refer to collectively as the EU5. In February 2018, November 2018 and February 2019, EUSA obtained reimbursement approvals from the United Kingdom’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, or the NICE, the German Federal Association of the Statutory Health Insurances, or GKV-SV, and Spain’s Ministry of Health, Consumer Affairs and Social Welfare, or MSCBS, respectively, for the first-line treatment of RCC. EUSA is working to secure reimbursement approval in and commercially launch FOTIVDA in additional European countries.
 First-Line Approval in New Zealand and South Africa: In July 2019, the New Zealand Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Authority approved FOTIVDA for the first-line treatment of adult patients with RCC and for adult patients who are VEGFR and mTOR pathway inhibitor-naïve following disease progression after one prior treatment with cytokine therapy for RCC. In September 2020, the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority approved FOTIVDA for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced RCC and for adult patients who are VEGFR and mTOR pathway inhibitor-naïve following disease progression after one prior treatment with cytokine therapy for advanced RCC.
 Clinical Development of Tivozanib in RCC
First-Line Phase 3 Trial (TIVO-1): We conducted the TIVO-1 trial, a global phase 3 clinical trial comparing the efficacy and safety of tivozanib with sorafenib, an approved therapy, for the first-line treatment of RCC. The trial met its primary endpoint of improving PFS with a median PFS in the tivozanib arm of 11.9 months compared with 9.1 months in the sorafenib arm. The trial also showed significant improvement in ORR of 33.1% for tivozanib versus 23.3% for sorafenib. The trial showed a favorable tolerability profile for tivozanib, as evidenced by fewer dose interruptions and dose reductions than sorafenib. However, the trial showed a non-statistically significant trend favoring the sorafenib treatment group in OS in the intent to treat population. The protocol-specified final OS analysis at 24 months since the last patient enrolled showed a median OS for the tivozanib arm of 28.8 months versus a median OS for the sorafenib arm of 29.3 months (HR=1.245, p=0.105). An OS hazard ratio assesses the relative risk of death for the entirety of the data set and the median OS is a point in time value of the OS when half of the patients within each arm are still alive. Subsequently, in connection with EUSA’s application for the use of tivozanib as a first-line treatment for RCC to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, in February 2016, which was approved in August 2017 and is further discussed below, the survival status of additional patients was taken into account and the updated median OS for the tivozanib arm was 28.2 months and the updated median OS for the sorafenib arm was 30.8 months (HR=1.147, p=0.276). We believe that an imbalance in subsequent therapy, which was more prevalent in patients treated in certain countries such as Russia and the Ukraine, combined with the significant activity seen with tivozanib treatment following sorafenib contributed to the discordance in the efficacy results in the TIVO-1 trial between the PFS and ORR benefit, which significantly favored tivozanib, and the OS, which trended in favor of sorafenib. In 2012, we submitted an NDA to the FDA seeking U.S. marketing approval for tivozanib. In June 2013, the FDA issued a complete response letter, which we refer to as the 2013 CRL, informing us that it would not approve tivozanib for the first-line treatment of RCC based solely on the data from this single pivotal trial (TIVO-1), and recommended that we perform an additional clinical trial with a PFS primary endpoint and adequately sized to assure the FDA that tivozanib does not adversely affect OS. A post hoc analysis was conducted to evaluate differences in the use of second-line therapy between geographic regions and the impact on the OS results. When analyzing results from treatment centers in North America and the EU only where the imbalance in subsequent therapy was substantially reduced, the benefit in PFS was preserved and the HR for PFS was 0.84 (HR<1 favors tivozanib).  
 Second-Line TIVO-1 Extension Study - One-sided crossover from sorafenib to tivozanib (Study 902): We completed a TIVO-1 extension study, which we refer to as the 902 trial, in which patients with RCC received tivozanib as second-line treatment subsequent to disease progression on the sorafenib treatment arm in the TIVO-1 first-line RCC trial. We presented the results at the 2015 American Society of Clinical Oncology, or ASCO, Annual Meeting. In March 2018, long-term follow-up results from the 902 trial were published in the European Journal of Cancer under the title “Efficacy of Tivozanib Treatment after Sorafenib in Patients with Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma: Crossover of a Phase 3 Study,” reporting a median PFS of 11.0 months, a median OS of 21.6 months and an 18% ORR, further supporting the rationale for our current phase 3 TIVO-3 trial discussed below.  
 
9

Third-Line and Fourth-Line Phase 3 Trial (TIVO-3): In May 2016, we initiated enrollment in the TIVO-3 trial. The TIVO-3 trial is the first positive phase 3 study in the third- and fourth-line treatment of patients with RCC as well as the first phase 3 study in RCC to investigate a predefined subpopulation of patients who received prior immunotherapy, a predominant standard of care for earlier lines of therapy. The trial enrolled a total of 350 patients and was designed to address the FDA’s concern about the negative OS trend in TIVO-1. TIVO-3, together with the previously completed TIVO-1 and 902 trials of tivozanib in the first-line and second-line treatment of RCC, is designed to support a regulatory submission of tivozanib in the United States as a treatment for RCC in relapsed or refractory patients. Our TIVO-3 trial design, which we reviewed with the FDA, provides for a randomized, controlled, multi-center, open-label phase 3 clinical trial, with subjects randomized 1:1 to receive either tivozanib or sorafenib. Subjects enrolled in the trial must have failed two systemic therapies, including a VEGFR TKI. Patients may have received prior immunotherapy, including immune checkpoint (PD-1) inhibitors, reflecting the evolving treatment landscape. The primary objective of the TIVO-3 trial is to show improved PFS. Secondary endpoints include OS, safety and ORR. The trial’s sites are located exclusively in North America and Europe. The TIVO-3 trial does not include a crossover design; accordingly, the protocol does not provide for patients who progress on one therapy to cross over to the other therapy. 
 On November 5, 2018, we announced that the TIVO-3 trial met its primary endpoint of improving PFS, with a median PFS in the tivozanib arm of 5.6 months compared with 3.9 months in the sorafenib arm. Tivozanib demonstrated a 44% improvement in median PFS and 27% reduction in risk of progression or death compared to sorafenib (HR=0.73, p=0.02). Approximately 26% of patients received checkpoint inhibitor therapy in earlier lines of treatment. Patients who received prior checkpoint inhibitor therapy had a 45% reduction in risk of progression or death. The secondary endpoint of ORR for patients receiving tivozanib was 18% compared to 8% for patients receiving sorafenib (p=0.02). Median duration of response in patients receiving tivozanib was not reached and in patients receiving sorafenib was 5.7 months. Tivozanib was generally better tolerated than sorafenib, as indicated by fewer dose reductions and interruptions. Grade 3 or higher adverse events were consistent with those observed in previous tivozanib trials. Infrequent but severe adverse events reported in greater number in the tivozanib arm were thrombotic events similar to those observed in previous tivozanib studies. The most common adverse events in patients receiving tivozanib was fatigue and asthenia, adverse events known to reflect effective VEGF pathway inhibition, which has shown a correlation with better PFS outcomes. In December 2019, previously reported data from the TIVO-3 trial was published in The Lancet Oncology.
 RCC PD-1 Phase 1b/2 Combination Trial with OPDIVO® (TiNivo): In March 2017, we initiated enrollment in a phase 1b/2 clinical trial of tivozanib in combination with OPDIVO (nivolumab), BMS’s anti-PD-1 therapy, in the first-line and the second-line treatment of RCC, which we refer to as the TiNivo trial. The TiNivo trial enrolled a total of 28 patients. We sponsored the trial, for which BMS supplied nivolumab. The TiNivo trial was led by the Institut Gustave Roussy in Paris under the direction of Professor Bernard Escudier, MD, Chairman of the Genitourinary Oncology Committee. The phase 1b portion of the TiNivo trial enrolled six patients and demonstrated that the combination of tivozanib and nivolumab was able to be dosed at the full dose and schedule of single agent tivozanib, with no dose limiting toxicities observed.  
 The phase 2 portion of the trial, which enrolled an additional 22 patients split evenly between treatment naïve and previously treated patients, was designed to assess the safety, tolerability and anti-tumor activity of the full dose and schedule of the combination of tivozanib (1.5 mg daily for 21 days, followed by seven days off treatment) and nivolumab (240 mg every two weeks) as established in the phase 1b portion of the study. On September 30, 2019, we presented final results at the ESMO 2019 Congress. The final results showed that the combination required few dose reductions and showed additive or synergistic activity for ORR and PFS in both treatment naïve and previously treated patients with RCC with no apparent difference in activity despite the different line of treatment. Out of 25 patients who were treated with the full dose and schedule of oral tivozanib in combination with intravenous nivolumab, thirteen (52%) had received at least one prior systemic therapy, including two (8%) that had received prior PD-1 therapy, and twelve (48%) that were treatment naïve. The overall median PFS for the 25 patients was 18.9 months. The median PFS for the twelve previously untreated patients was 18.5 months and the median PFS for the thirteen previously treated patients had not yet been achieved as of the final data cut-off date of August 27, 2019. An ORR was observed in 14 patients (56%) (complete response plus partial response), including one treatment naïve patient (4%) achieving a complete response, and a disease control rate (complete response plus partial response plus stable disease) was observed in 24 patients (96%). Of the two patients (8%) who received prior PD-1 therapy, one achieved a partial response and the other achieved stable disease. Treatment-related Grade 3/4 adverse events occurred in 80% of patients, the most common of which was hypertension, and only 17% of patients required a dose reduction.
In November 2020, we announced that previously reported results from the TiNivo trial were published in Annals of Oncology in an article titled “TiNivo: Safety and Efficacy of Tivozanib-Nivolumab Combination Therapy in Patients with Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma”. 
 RCC PD-1 Phase 3 Combination Trial with OPDIVO® (TiNivo-2):  On March 12, 2021, following the FDA’s approval of FOTIVDA, we announced our plans to advance our trials of the combination of tivozanib and nivolumab in RCC pursuant to a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with BMS to evaluate FOTIVDA in combination with OPDIVO (nivolumab) in a randomized, open-label, controlled phase 3 TiNivo-2 trial in patients with advanced relapsed or refractory RCC following prior immunotherapy exposure, which we refer to as the TiNivo-2 trial. The TiNivo-2 trial is expected to enroll approximately 326 patients 
 
10

with advanced RCC who have progressed following prior immunotherapy treatment. The trial plans to enroll across clinical sites in the United States, Europe and Latin America. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive either FOTIVDA (1.34 mg/QD for 21 days followed by 7 days off treatment) in combination with OPDIVO (480 mg every 4 weeks) or FOTIVDA alone. The TiNivo-2 trial’s primary endpoint will assess PFS, with key secondary endpoints to include overall survival, overall response rate and duration of response, and safety. The study design was submitted to the FDA for review and we expect feedback from the FDA regarding the study design in the second quarter of 2021.
 Clinical Development of Tivozanib in HCC
HCC PD-L1 Combination Trial with IMFINZI® (DEDUCTIVE): In September 2019, we opened enrollment in an open-label, multi-center, randomized phase 1b/2 clinical trial of tivozanib in combination with IMFINZI (durvalumab), a human monoclonal antibody directed against programmed death-ligand 1, or PD-L1, as a first-line treatment for patients with advanced, unresectable HCC who have not received prior systemic therapy, which we refer to as the DEDUCTIVE trial. Pursuant to the clinical supply agreement that we entered into with a wholly-owned subsidiary of AstraZeneca PLC, or AstraZeneca, in December 2018, we serve as the study sponsor, each party contributes the clinical supply of its study drug, key decisions are made by both parties by consensus and external study costs are otherwise shared equally. 
 The DEDUCTIVE trial is being led by the Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center under the direction of Dr. Renuka Iyer. A total of seven patients with advanced or metastatic HCC were enrolled in the phase 1b portion of the study, which was designed to determine the recommended phase 2 dose and assess preliminary safety and efficacy of the tivozanib/durvalumab combination. The DEDUCTIVE trial progressed to phase 2 following the successful completion of the phase 1b portion of the trial, where 1.0 mg of tivozanib was administered for 21 days followed by seven days off treatment together with 1,500 mg of durvalumab every 28 days. The combination was well-tolerated, with no dose limiting toxicities. The combination demonstrated a 29% partial response (PR) rate and 71% disease control rate (PR + stable disease), which was similar to what was observed in the bevacizumab and atezolizumab combination trial in a similar disease setting. We anticipate completion of enrollment in the ongoing phase 2 portion of the study, which is expected to enroll up to an additional 30 subjects, in 2021. The primary outcome measure of the DEDUCTIVE trial is incidence of treatment emergent adverse events and the secondary outcome measures include ORR, PFS and OS. In January 2021, we presented preliminary results from the phase 1b portion of the DEDUCTIVE trial in a poster session at the 2021 American Society of Clinical Oncology Gastrointestinal, or ASCO GI, Cancers Symposium. 
 Twelve clinical trial sites have been initiated for the DEDUCTIVE trial. At certain sites enrollment has been suspended at times due to COVID-19 related restrictions. We cannot guarantee the future pace of enrollment. Further, certain trial functions, including trial monitoring, will continue to be conducted remotely where possible. We do not yet know whether remote management of these functions will prove to be sufficient. 
 We believe we have sufficient clinical supply of tivozanib manufactured to complete the DEDUCTIVE trial. The DEDUCTIVE trial also requires treatment with durvalumab, which is administered intravenously and supplied by AstraZeneca. Any interruptions in the supply or delivery of study drug for the trial would impact patient treatment. The extent and impact of any future disruptions on enrollment, patient treatment and trial management of our DEDUCTIVE trial due to the COVID-19 pandemic are uncertain and may change with the local and global fluctuations in the incidence of COVID-19. 
 NCCN-AVEO Phase 1b/2 Trial. In February 2020, final results from a multicenter, investigator-sponsored phase 1b/2 clinical trial of tivozanib in previously untreated patients with advanced, unresectable HCC were published in the British Journal of Cancer under the title, “A Multicentre Phase 1b/2 Study of Tivozanib in Patients with Advanced Inoperable Hepatocellular Carcinoma.” The trial was led by the Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center under the direction of Dr. Iyer and was approved and funded by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Oncology Research Program from general research support provided by us. The trial was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tivozanib in advanced HCC, and enrolled a total of 27 patients at three trial sites. In the phase 1b portion of the trial, which used a modified 3 + 3 dose escalation design, 8 patients were dosed with tivozanib starting at 1.0 mg or 1.5 mg daily for 21 days followed by 7 days off treatment. No dose-limiting toxicities were seen in cycle one in patients treated with 1.0 mg, and tivozanib at 1.0 mg daily was selected for the phase 2 expansion portion of the trial. The phase 2 trial’s primary endpoint of median PFS and 24-week PFS probability were 24 weeks and 58%, respectively. Of 19 evaluable patients in the trial, a partial response was seen in 4 of 19 patients (21%) and stable disease in 8 of 19 patients (42%), for a disease control rate of 63%. Median OS was 9.0 months. A significant decrease in soluble plasma VEGFR-2 was also observed, suggesting adequate target engagement. There were no significant changes in hepatitis B or hepatitis C viral load during study treatment and adverse events were consistent with those observed in previous tivozanib trials.

 On June 1, 2019, Dr. Wendy Swetzig at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine presented data at the 2019 ASCO Annual Meeting from an investigator-sponsored phase 2 clinical trial of tivozanib in patients with recurrent, platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, including fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer. The trial was one of several studies funded by a grant we provided to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. The trial was designed to measure the safety and activity of tivozanib in ovarian cancer and enrolled a total of 31 patients, 30 of which were treated with tivozanib. With four patients showing a partial response and twelve patients with stable disease, the clinical benefit rate (partial response + stable disease) was reported to be 53.3%. The trial concluded that tivozanib is active in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer, without substantial toxicity.
Ficlatuzumab
 Ficlatuzumab is a potent humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that blocks cMET receptor, or cMET, signaling by binding HGF, the natural ligand of cMET, which is believed to trigger many activities that are involved in cancer development and metastasis. We have seen promising results for ficlatuzumab as a potential treatment of HNSCC, pancreatic cancer and AML in early clinical trials. The estimated number of annual new cases of head and neck cancer, pancreatic cancer and AML in the United States is 57,600, 53,260 and 19,940, respectively (American Cancer Society, Cancer Facts & Figures 2020). In September 2020, we made the decision to fund additional clinical manufacturing of ficlatuzumab to enable a potential registrational phase 3 clinical trial in HNSCC after final results from the open-label, randomized phase 2 study are available, as well as to enable additional potential development in pancreatic cancer and AML. In September 2020, we regained full global rights to ficlatuzumab, as a result of our former development partner Biodesix, Inc., or Biodesix, exercising its Opt-Out rights under the Biodesix Agreement, each as defined below. For more information, see “Part I, Item 1. Business – Strategic Partnerships – Ficlatuzumab” below.
 Development in HNSCC. We and our previous partner, Biodesix, funded an investigator-sponsored phase 1 clinical trial of ficlatuzumab in combination with ERBITUX® (cetuximab) in HNSCC. In June 2017, preliminary results from the phase 1 trial were presented at the 2017 ASCO Annual Meeting. The trial of ficlatuzumab in combination with the EGFR inhibitor cetuximab in patients with cetuximab-resistant, metastatic HNSCC demonstrated activity with an overall response rate of 17% (two partial responses out of twelve patients), a disease control rate of 67% and prolonged PFS and OS compared to historical controls of cetuximab alone. A randomized, phase 2, multicenter, investigator-initiated trial, or the Phase 2 HNSCC Trial, to confirm these findings was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2017. The Phase 2 HNSCC Trial is being conducted at seven academic centers under the direction of Julie E. Bauman, MD, MPH, Chief, Division of Hematology/Oncology at the University of Arizona Cancer Center. The trial was designed to enroll approximately 60 patients randomized to receive either ficlatuzumab alone or ficlatuzumab and cetuximab, and enrollment was completed in the fourth quarter of 2020. We expect to receive top line data from the Phase 2 HNSCC Trial in the middle of 2021, and we expect to announce a phase 3 clinical trial decision for ficlatuzumab in that timeframe. We have initiated manufacturing of the clinical supply for this potential phase 3 clinical trial.
 Development in pancreatic cancer. We and our previous partner, Biodesix, funded an investigator-sponsored phase 1b/2 clinical trial of ficlatuzumab in combination with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer. The trial was initiated in December 2017 to test the safety and tolerability of ficlatuzumab when combined with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine in previously untreated metastatic pancreatic ductal cancer, or PDAC. In January 2020, results from the phase 1b portion of the trial were presented at the 2020 ASCO GI Cancers Symposium. The trial, which was based on preclinical findings demonstrating a synergistic effect of the combination in a preclinical model of PDAC, was designed to determine maximum tolerated dose of ficlatuzumab when combined with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. Secondary outcome measures include response rate and PFS. A total of 24 patients enrolled in the trial, which was conducted under the direction of Kimberly Perez, M.D. at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. The average number of 28-day treatment cycles received was 7.5 (range 1-15), with three patients remaining on active treatment at the end of the trial. The combination showed a 29% partial response rate and a 92% disease control rate (partial response and stable disease), which was promising relative to data observed for gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel alone. Treatment with this regimen was associated with significant hypoalbuminemia and edema, and therefore a follow-up safety study is under consideration to evaluate ficlatuzumab in combination with an alternate cytotoxic regimen.
 Development in AML. We and our previous partner, Biodesix, have also funded an investigator-sponsored phase 1b/2 clinical trial of ficlatuzumab in combination with cytarabine in AML, which we refer to as the CyFi-1 trial, which showed a favorable complete response rate in the 18 primary refractory AML patients enrolled in the trial and an acceptable tolerability profile. Based on the encouraging findings from the CyFi-1 trial, we designed a randomized phase 2 clinical trial evaluating ficlatuzumab in combination with high-dose cytarabine versus high-dose cytarabine alone in patients with AML, which we referred to as the CyFi-2 trial. However, in March 2020, we discontinued the CyFi-2 trial prior to the initiation of patient enrollment due to the urgent shift in priorities among clinical trial sites toward efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, which had impacted the trial enrollment timeline and the feasibility of completing the study within the shelf-life of the current ficlatuzumab clinical trial drug supply.

We continue to evaluate additional opportunities for the further clinical development of ficlatuzumab. The expansion of the ficlatuzumab clinical program, beyond what we are currently committed to, will require additional manufacturing efforts and costs. 
 AV-380 
 
AV-380 is a potent humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that targets GDF15, which is associated with cachexia and has been linked to immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment. We are developing AV-380 for the potential treatment or prevention of cachexia. Cachexia is defined as a multi-factorial syndrome of involuntary weight loss characterized by an ongoing loss of skeletal muscle mass (with or without loss of fat mass) that cannot be fully reversed by conventional nutritional support and leads to progressive functional impairment. It is estimated that cachexia affects approximately 9 million individuals in North America, Europe and Japan (J Cachexia Sarcopenia Muscle 2010). Cachexia is associated with various cancers, and it is estimated that approximately 50% of all cancer patients suffer from cachexia and 30% of all cancer patients die due to cachexia (World J Gastrointest Oncol 2015; J Cachexia Sarcopenia Muscle 2010). We believe AV-380 has the potential to address a significant unmet need. Cachexia also affects patients with chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, anorexia nervosa, AIDS and other diseases.  
 We believe that AV-380 represents a unique approach to treating cachexia because it has been demonstrated in preclinical studies to address key underlying mechanisms of the syndrome. Our research suggests that greater than 70% of cancer patients have increased GDF15 expression, starting at the pre-cachectic stage. If GDF15 inhibitors such as AV-380 are proven clinically successful, we believe there is a significant market opportunity with potential application in multiple tumor types in combination with multiple anti-cancer treatment standards. In addition to our patents and patent applications covering our proprietary AV-380 antibody program, we have in-licensed certain patents and patent applications from St. Vincent’s Hospital Sydney Limited in Sydney, Australia, which we refer to as St. Vincent’s. We have milestone and royalty payment obligations under our license agreement with St. Vincent’s.  
 In December 2020, the FDA accepted our IND filing for AV-380 for the potential treatment of cancer cachexia and, in the first quarter of 2021, we initiated a phase 1 clinical trial in healthy subjects.
 AV-203
 AV-203 is a potent humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that targets ErbB3 (also known as HER3). In March 2016, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with CANbridge Life Sciences Ltd., or CANbridge, which we refer to as the CANbridge Agreement, under which we granted CANbridge the exclusive right to develop, manufacture and commercialize AV-203 in all countries outside of North America. In December 2017, CANbridge filed an IND application in China seeking regulatory authorization to initiate clinical trials of AV-203, which CANbridge refers to as CAN017, in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, or ESCC. In August 2018, the National Medical Products Administration, or NMPA (formerly the China Food and Drug Administration), approved this IND application but a clinical trial was never initiated.
 In March 2021, CANbridge exercised its right to terminate for convenience the CANbridge Agreement. Under the terms of the CANbridge Agreement, we expect the transfer of the AV-203 program to be complete in September 2021 and, at that time, we will regain worldwide rights to the AV-203 program.
 AV-353
 AV-353 is a potent IgG1 monoclonal antibody that targets the Notch 3 pathway. The Notch 3 pathway is important in cell-to-cell communication involving gene regulation mechanisms that control multiple cell differentiation processes during the entire life cycle. Scientific literature has implicated the Notch 3 receptor pathway in multiple diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, such as pulmonary arterial hypertension, and neurodegenerative conditions. AV-353 is being studied by collaborators at the Mayo Clinic in pre-clinical models of triple negative breast cancer.
 Competition
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive. Our future success depends on our ability to maintain a competitive advantage with respect to our product candidates. 
 Our core competitors include pharmaceutical and biotech organizations, as well as academic research institutions, clinical research laboratories and government agencies that are pursuing research activities in the same therapeutic areas as us. Many of our competitors have greater financial, technical and human resources than we do. Additionally, many competitors have greater experience in product discovery and development, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals and commercialization capabilities, which may provide them with a competitive advantage.
 
13

We believe that our ability to compete will depend on our ability to execute on the following objectives:
  
• | design, develop and commercialize products that are superior to other products in the market in terms of, among other things, safety, efficacy and/or convenience;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | obtain patent and/or other proprietary protection for our processes and product candidates;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | obtain required regulatory approvals;
--+--------------------------------------


• | obtain favorable reimbursement, formulary and guideline status; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | collaborate with others in the design, development and commercialization of our products.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Established competitors may invest heavily to discover and develop novel compounds that could make our product candidates obsolete. In addition, any new product that competes with an approved product must demonstrate compelling advantages in efficacy, convenience, tolerability and/or safety in order to obtain approval, to overcome price competition and to be commercially successful. If we are not able to compete effectively, our business will not grow and our financial condition and operations will suffer.
 Tivozanib 
 The competitive landscape and treatment regimens for RCC and HCC continue to rapidly evolve, particularly given the entrance of immune checkpoint inhibitor combination therapies and the potential entrance of immune checkpoint inhibitor and VEGFR TKI combination therapies into the RCC treatment landscape. The utilization of such regimens may affect sequencing of certain drugs and combinations across different lines of therapy. Additionally, there are several therapies in clinical development for RCC and HCC that may alter the competitive landscape for the treatment of these cancers. As such, it is difficult to predict how these changes will inform our perspective on the key competitors of tivozanib in RCC and HCC in the future.  
 RCC. We believe the key competitors for FOTIVDA in relapsed or refractory RCC include the following FDA-approved treatments: Cabometyx (cabozantinib), marketed by Exelixis, Inc., or Exelixis; Afinitor (everolimus), marketed by Novartis International Pharmaceutical, Ltd., or Novartis; Inlyta (axitinib), marketed by Pfizer Inc., or Pfizer; Opdivo (nivolumab), marketed by BMS; Nexavar (sorafenib), marketed by Bayer Healthcare AG, or Bayer; Novartis’ Votrient (pazopanib); Pfizer’s Sutent (sunitinib); and Pfizer’s Torisel (temsirolimus), all as single-agent therapies; along with the combination of Lenvima (lenvatinib), marketed by Eisai Co., Ltd., or Eisai, and Novartis’ Afinitor (everolimus). Additionally, there are a number of therapies in development for relapsed or refractory RCC, including Merck & Co., Inc., or Merck’s, belzutifan as a single agent, the combination of Eisai’s Lenvima (lenvatinib) and Merck’s belzutifan and the combination of Roche Holding Ltd., or Roche’s, Tecentriq (atezolizumab) and Exelixis’ Cabometyx (cabozantinib). 
 HCC. We believe the key competitors for tivozanib in advanced HCC include the following FDA-approved treatments: Roche’s Tecentriq (atezolizumab) and Avastin (bevacizumab) in combination and BMS’s Yervoy (ipilimumab) and Opdivo (nivolumab) in combination; as well as Bayer’s Nexavar (sorafenib); Bayer’s Stivarga (regorafenib); Eisai’s Lenvima (lenatinib); Exelixis’ Cabometyx (cabozantinib); Cyramza (ramucirumab), marketed by Eli Lilly and Company, or Eli Lilly; BMS’s Opdivo (nivolumab); and Merck’s Keytruda (pembrolizumab), all as single agents. Additionally, there are a number of therapies in clinical development for advanced HCC and it is difficult to predict which will be the key competitors to tivozanib in this indication. 
Ficlatuzumab
 We believe the products that currently compete with ficlatuzumab are primarily those that are approved and in development that target the HGF/cMET pathway.  
 FDA-approved treatments or therapies in clinical development which target the HGF/cMET pathway, though not exclusively, include Pfizer’s PF-2341066 (Xalkori, crizotinib), Exelixis’ XL-184 (Cometriq/Cabometyx, cabozantinib), Mirati Therapeutics, Inc.’s glesatinib, Incyte Corporation, or Incyte’s, and Novartis’ INCB-028060, Amgen Inc., or Amgen’s, and BioPharma Global, or BioPharma’s, AMG-337, Eli Lilly’s merestinib (LY2801653), AstraZeneca’s and Hutchison MediPharma Limited’s savolitinib, Merck KGaA’s Tepmetko (tepotinib), AbbVie Inc.’s ABBV-299 and Betta Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd.’s BPI-9016.  
 AV-380 
 In the United States, a significant unmet need exists for patients afflicted with cachexia, as Megace is the only approved agent for the treatment of cachexia. A number of agents with unique mechanisms of action are in various stages of clinical development in cachexia or muscle wasting. We believe the key competitors for our AV-380 program are other companies pursuing the GDF15 pathway for cachexia or as an anti-cancer therapeutic, including NGM Biopharmaceuticals Inc., Pfizer and CatalYm GmbH’s clinical GDF15 program focused on immunosuppression.
 
14

AV-203
 We believe the most direct competitors to our AV-203 program are monoclonal antibodies that specifically target the ErbB3 receptor. The clinical stage agents that are known to target ErbB3 receptors include Daiichi Sankyo, Inc.’s and Amgen Inc.’s patritumab (AMG-888), Elevation Oncology’s seribantumab, Merus N.V.’s MCLA-128, AstraZeneca’s sapitinib, Celldex Therapeutics Inc.’s CDX-3379, Sihuan Pharmaceutical Holdings Group Ltd.’s pirotinib and Roche’s duligotuzumab. 
 AV-353
 Currently, there are no ongoing clinical trials of Notch 3-specific inhibitors, nor any approved Notch 3-specific inhibitors in oncology; however, a number of agents for applications in oncology are being explored which target the Notch 3 receptor and may inhibit other Notch receptors.
 Strategic Partnerships and Collaboration Agreements
 We have established various strategic partnerships and collaboration agreements with leading pharmaceutical companies for our product candidates and programs in our portfolio. Under each of our strategic partnerships, we are entitled to receive or required to pay upfront, milestone payments and/or royalties.

 Tivozanib 
 Kyowa Kirin Co. (KKC)
 In December 2006, we entered into a license agreement with KKC, or the KKC Agreement, under which we obtained an exclusive, sublicensable license to develop, manufacture and commercialize tivozanib in all territories in the world except for Asia and the Middle East, where KKC retained the rights to tivozanib. Under the KKC Agreement, we obtained exclusive rights to tivozanib in our territory under certain KKC patents, patent applications and know-how for the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of all human diseases and conditions. On August 1, 2019, we entered into an amendment to the KKC Agreement pursuant to which KKC repurchased the non-oncology rights to tivozanib in our territory, excluding the rights we have sublicensed to EUSA under the EUSA Agreement. We have upfront, milestone and royalty payment obligations to KKC under the KKC Agreement, and following the amendment, KKC also has upfront, milestone and royalty payment obligations to us related to non-oncology development by KKC in our territory. Pursuant to the amendment to the KKC Agreement, KKC was required to make a non-refundable upfront payment to us in the amount of $25.0 million that we received in September 2019 and KKC waived a one-time milestone payment of $18.0 million otherwise payable by us upon our obtaining marketing approval for tivozanib in the United States.  
 If we sublicense any of our rights to tivozanib to a third-party, as we have done with EUSA pursuant to the EUSA Agreement, the sublicense defines the payment obligations of the sublicensee, which may vary from the milestone and royalty payment obligations under our KKC Agreement relating to rights we retain. We are required to pay KKC a fixed 30% of amounts we receive from our sublicensees, including upfront license fees, milestone payments and royalties, but excluding amounts we receive in respect of research and development reimbursement payments or equity investments, subject to certain limitations. 
 Certain research and development reimbursement payments by EUSA were not subject to sublicense revenue payments to KKC. For example, if EUSA elects to opt-in to the TIVO-3 trial, the additional research and development reimbursement payment from EUSA of 50% of the total trial costs, up to $20.0 million, would also not be subject to a sublicense revenue payment to KKC, subject to certain limitations. We would, however, owe KKC 30% of other, non-research and development payments we may receive from EUSA pursuant to the EUSA Agreement, including reimbursement approvals for RCC in up to five specified EU countries, marketing approvals for RCC in three specified non-EU licensed territories, EU marketing approval filings and corresponding marketing approvals by the EMA for up to three additional indications beyond RCC, and sales-based milestones and royalties. The $2.0 million milestone payments we earned in each of February 2018, November 2018 and February 2019 upon EUSA’s reimbursement approval for FOTIVDA as a first-line treatment for RCC in the United Kingdom, Germany and Spain, respectively, were subject to the 30% KKC sublicense fee, or $0.6 million each.
 We are also required to pay tiered royalty payments on net sales we make of FOTIVDA in our North American territory, which 
 
15

range from the low to mid-teens as a percentage of net sales. The royalty rate escalates within this range based on increasing FOTIVDA sales. Our royalty payment obligations in a particular country in our territory begin on the date of the first commercial sale of FOTIVDA in that country, and end on the later of 12 years after the date of the first commercial sale of FOTIVDA in that country or the date of the last to expire of the patents covering tivozanib that have been issued in that country. 
 Pursuant to the amendment to the KKC Agreement, KKC is also required to make milestone payments to us of up to an aggregate of $390.7 million upon the successful achievement of certain development and sales milestones of tivozanib in non-oncology indications. In August 2020, KKC paid us a $2.8 million development milestone upon acceptance by the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency of Japan of KKC’s IND for a non-oncology formulation of tivozanib. In September 2020, KKC initiated a phase 1 study of KHK4951, the reformulated tivozanib, in healthy volunteers and patients with Wet AMD. In addition, KKC is required to make tiered royalty payments to us on net sales of tivozanib in non-oncology indications in our territory, which range from high single digit to low double digits as a percentage of net sales. The royalty rate escalates within this range based on increasing tivozanib sales, subject to certain adjustments. KKC’s royalty payment obligations in a particular country in our territory begin on the date of the first commercial sale of tivozanib in that country, and end on the later of the expiration date of the last valid claim of a patent application or patent owned by KKC covering tivozanib or 10 years after the date of the first commercial sale of tivozanib in non-oncology indications in that country.
 If KKC sublicenses any of its non-oncology rights to tivozanib to a third-party, KKC is required to pay us a percentage of amounts received from the respective sublicensees related to our territory, including upfront license fees, milestone payments and royalties, but excluding amounts received in respect of research and development reimbursement payments or equity investments, subject to certain limitations. 
 We and KKC each have access to and can benefit from the other party’s clinical data and regulatory filings with respect to tivozanib and biomarkers identified in the conduct of activities under the KKC Agreement, as related to oncology development. Under the KKC Agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize tivozanib in our territory.
 The KKC Agreement will remain in effect until the expiration of all of our royalty and sublicense revenue obligations, determined on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, unless terminated earlier. If we fail to meet our obligations under the KKC Agreement and are unable to cure such failure within specified time periods, KKC can terminate the KKC Agreement, resulting in a loss of our rights to tivozanib and an obligation to assign or license to KKC any intellectual property or other rights we may have in tivozanib, including our regulatory filings, regulatory approvals, patents and trademarks for tivozanib. 
 EUSA
In December 2015, we entered into a license agreement with EUSA, or the EUSA Agreement, under which we granted to EUSA the exclusive, sublicensable right to develop, manufacture and commercialize tivozanib in the territories of Europe (excluding Russia, Ukraine and the Commonwealth of Independent States), Latin America (excluding Mexico), Africa and Australasia for all diseases and conditions in humans, excluding non-oncologic diseases or conditions of the eye. EUSA is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to seek regulatory approval for and commercialize tivozanib throughout its licensed territories for RCC. EUSA has responsibility for all activities and costs associated with the further development, manufacture, regulatory filings and commercialization of tivozanib in its licensed territories. 
 EUSA made research and development reimbursement payments to us of $2.5 million upon the execution of the EUSA Agreement in 2015, and $4.0 million in September 2017 upon its receipt of marketing authorization from the European Commission in August 2017 for FOTIVDA (tivozanib) for the treatment of RCC. In September 2017, EUSA elected to opt-in to co-develop the TiNivo trial. As a result of EUSA’s exercise of its opt-in right, it became an active participant in the ongoing conduct of the TiNivo trial and is able to utilize the resulting data from the TiNivo trial for regulatory and commercial purposes in its territories. EUSA made an additional research and development reimbursement payment to us of $2.0 million upon its exercise of its opt-in right. This payment was received in October 2017, in advance of the completion of the TiNivo trial, and represents EUSA’s approximate 50% share of the total estimated costs of the TiNivo trial. 
 We are also eligible to receive a research and development reimbursement payment from EUSA of $20 million of our total TIVO-3 trial costs if EUSA chooses to opt-in to use the TIVO-3 dataset to seek an expanded RCC indication in the EU, or for other regulatory or commercialization purposes. The leadership of EUSA has informed us that it is interested in exercising its opt-in right with respect to our TIVO-3 data and seeking an expanded label under the EUSA Agreement, but has requested to more closely align the payment stream under which it would satisfy its $20 million reimbursement obligation with the occurrence of the incremental value creation for EUSA. We are currently in negotiations with EUSA regarding the structuring of this payment stream. We cannot be certain that we will arrive at mutually acceptable terms, or that EUSA will ultimately exercise the opt-in.
 
16

We are entitled to receive milestone payments of $2.0 million per country upon reimbursement approval, if any, for RCC in each of countries in the EU5 and, to date, we have received payments upon reimbursement approval for RCC in the UK (February 2018), Germany (November 2018) and Spain (February 2019). We are also entitled to receive $2.0 million for the grant of marketing approval for RCC, if any, in three of the licensed countries outside of the EU, as mutually agreed by the parties, the first two of which were obtained in New Zealand in July 2019 and South Africa in September 2020.
We are also eligible to receive a payment of $2.0 million per indication in connection with a filing by EUSA with the EMA for marketing approval, if any, for tivozanib for the treatment of each of up to three additional indications and $5.0 million per indication in connection with the EMA’s grant of marketing approval for each of up to three additional indications, as well as up to $335.0 million upon EUSA’s achievement of certain sales thresholds. Upon commercialization, we are eligible to receive tiered double digit royalties on net sales, if any, of licensed products in its licensed territories ranging from a low double digit up to mid-twenty percent depending on the level of annual net sales. In November 2017, we began earning sales royalties upon EUSA’s commencement of the first commercial launch of FOTIVDA (tivozanib) with the initiation of product sales in Germany. EUSA has received reimbursement approval for and commercially launched FOTIVDA in Germany, the United Kingdom, and Spain as well as in additional non-EU5 countries. 
 The research and development reimbursement payments under the EUSA Agreement are not subject to the 30% sublicensing payment payable to KKC, subject to certain limitations. We would, however, owe KKC 30% of other, non-research and development payments we may receive from EUSA pursuant to the EUSA Agreement, including any reimbursement approvals for RCC in the EU5, marketing approvals for RCC in three specified non-EU licensed territories, EU marketing approval filings and corresponding marketing approvals by the EMA for up to three additional indications beyond RCC, and sales-based milestones and royalties, as set forth above. The $2.0 million milestone payments we earned in each of February 2018, November 2018 and February 2019 upon EUSA’s reimbursement approval for FOTIVDA in the United Kingdom, Germany and Spain, respectively, were subject to the 30% KKC sublicense fee, or $0.6 million, each.
 The term of the EUSA Agreement continues on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the last to occur of (a) the expiration of the last valid patent claim for such product in such country, (b) the expiration of market or regulatory data exclusivity for such product in such country or (c) the tenth anniversary of the effective date. Either party may terminate the EUSA Agreement in the event of the bankruptcy of the other party or a material breach by the other party that remains uncured, following receipt of written notice of such breach, for a period of (a) thirty (30) days in the case of breach for nonpayment of any amount due under the EUSA Agreement, and (b) ninety (90) days in the case of any other material breach. EUSA may terminate the EUSA Agreement at any time upon one hundred eighty (180) days’ prior written notice. In addition, we may terminate the EUSA Agreement upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice if EUSA challenges any of the patent rights licensed under the EUSA Agreement. 
 EUSA has reported to us that to date, it has not experienced a decrease in sales trends or interruptions in supply or distribution of FOTIVDA during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on FOTIVDA sales is difficult to predict.
 Ficlatuzumab
 Biodesix
 In April 2014, we entered into a worldwide co-development and collaboration agreement, or the Biodesix Agreement, with Biodesix to develop and commercialize ficlatuzumab, our potent humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that targets HGF. In September 2020, we regained full global rights to ficlatuzumab, effective December 2, 2020, when Biodesix exercised its “Opt-Out” rights (as defined below) under the Biodesix Agreement. 
 The Biodesix Agreement generally provided for each party to contribute 50% of all clinical, regulatory, manufacturing and other costs to develop ficlatuzumab and to share equally in any future revenue from development or commercialization. Under the Biodesix Agreement, prior to the first commercial sale of ficlatuzumab, each party had the right to elect to discontinue its funding obligation for further development or commercialization efforts with respect to ficlatuzumab in exchange for reduced economics in the program, which is referred to as an “Opt-Out.” Pursuant to the terms of the Biodesix Agreement, as a result of Biodesix’s election to Opt-Out, Biodesix will (i) continue to be responsible for reimbursement of development costs with respect to the ongoing phase 2 investigator-sponsored clinical trial of ficlatuzumab in combination with ERBITUX® (cetuximab) in HNSCC, (ii) cease to be entitled to 50% sharing of profits resulting from commercialization of ficlatuzumab, (iii) be entitled to a low double digit royalty on future product sales and 25% of future licensing revenue (excluding contributions to research and development expenses), less approximately $2.5 million that Biodesix would be required to pay to us pursuant to the October 2016 amendment to the Biodesix Agreement and (iv) remain responsible for development obligations under the Biodesix Agreement with respect to VeriStrat®. We and Biodesix also remain obligated to negotiate a commercialization agreement to delineate our respective rights and obligations in the event of any commercialization of VeriStrat® with ficlatuzumab. As a result of Biodesix’s decision to Opt-Out, we now have worldwide licensing 
 
17

rights and sole decision-making authority with respect to further development and commercialization of ficlatuzumab. The payment obligations between the parties under the Biodesix Agreement are in effect until completion of the Phase 2 HNSCC Trial.
 AV-380
 St. Vincent’s Hospital 
 In July 2012, we entered into a license agreement with St. Vincent’s, or the St. Vincent’s Agreement, under which we obtained an exclusive, worldwide sublicensable right to develop, manufacture and commercialize products for therapeutic applications that benefit from inhibition or decreased expression or activity of MIC-1, which is also known as GDF15. We believe GDF15 is a novel target for cachexia, and we are exploiting this license in our AV-380 program for cachexia. Under the St. Vincent’s Agreement, we have non-exclusive rights to certain related diagnostic products and research tools and also have a right of first negotiation to obtain an exclusive license to certain improvements that St. Vincent’s or third parties may make to licensed therapeutic products. We are obligated to use diligent efforts to conduct research and clinical development and commercially launch at least one licensed therapeutic product.
 In 2012, we paid St. Vincent’s an upfront license fee of $0.7 million. In August 2015, in connection with the execution of the license agreement with Novartis, or the Novartis Agreement, we amended and restated the St. Vincent’s Agreement and paid St. Vincent’s an additional upfront fee of $1.5 million. As of December 31, 2019, we are required to make future milestone payments, up to an aggregate total of $14.4 million, upon the earlier of the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones or a specified date for the first indication, and upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones for the second and third indications, for licensed therapeutic products, some of which payments may be increased by a mid to high double digit percentage rate for milestone payments made after we grant any sublicense, depending on the sublicensed territory. 
 In February 2017, Novartis agreed to pay $1.8 million out of its then future payment obligations to us under the former Novartis Agreement. These funds were used to satisfy a $1.8 million time-based milestone obligation that we owed to St. Vincent’s in March 2017. In December 2018, we entered into a new agreement with Novartis to further establish and clarify the terms on which the AV-380 program was to be returned to us, or the AV-380 Transfer Agreement. The $2.3 million payment we received from Novartis in January 2019 pursuant to the AV-380 Transfer Agreement was used to cover a $2.3 million time-based milestone obligation that became due to St. Vincent’s in January 2019. See “Part I, Item 1. Business – Our Product Candidates – AV-380” and Note 4 “Collaborations and License Agreements – Out-License Agreements – Novartis”, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding details of the AV-380 Transfer Agreement.   
 In addition, we will be required to pay St. Vincent’s tiered royalty payments equal to a low-single-digit percentage of any net sales we or our sublicensees make from licensed therapeutic products. The royalty rate escalates within the low-single-digit range during each calendar year based on increasing licensed therapeutic product sales during such calendar year. Our royalty payment obligations for a licensed therapeutic product in a particular country end on the later of 10 years after the date of first commercial sale of such licensed therapeutic product in such country or expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim of the licensed patents covering such licensed therapeutic product in such country and are subject to offsets under certain circumstances. 
 The St. Vincent’s Agreement remains in effect until the later of 10 years after the date of first commercial sale of licensed therapeutic products in the last country in which a commercial sale is made, or expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim of the licensed patents, unless we elect, or St. Vincent’s elects, to terminate the St. Vincent’s Agreement earlier. We have the right to terminate the St. Vincent’s Agreement on six months’ notice if we terminate our GDF15 research and development programs as a result of the failure of a licensed therapeutic product in preclinical or clinical development, or if we form the reasonable view that further GDF15 research and development is not commercially viable, and we are not then in breach of any of our obligations under the St. Vincent’s Agreement. 
 AV-203
 CANbridge
In March 2016, we entered into the CANbridge Agreement under which we granted CANbridge the exclusive right to develop, manufacture and commercialize AV-203, a potent humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that targets ErbB3 (also known as HER3), for the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease in all countries outside of North America. 
 
18

Upon entry into the CANbridge Agreement, CANbridge paid us an upfront fee of $1.0 million in April 2016, net of foreign withholding taxes. CANbridge also reimbursed us for $1.0 million in certain AV-203 manufacturing costs that we previously incurred. CANbridge paid this manufacturing reimbursement in two installments of $0.5 million each, one in March 2017 and one in September 2017, net of foreign withholding taxes, following CANbridge’s validation of the manufacturing process for real drug substance. In December 2017, CANbridge filed an IND application with the NMPA for a clinical study of AV-203 in ESCC. In August 2018, CANbridge obtained regulatory approval of its IND application from the NMPA for a clinical study of AV-203 in ESCC and, accordingly, we earned a $2.0 million development and regulatory milestone payment that was received from CANbridge in August 2018. 
 
A percentage of any milestone and royalty payments received by us under the CANbridge Agreement, or under future partnership agreements related to the AV-203 program, excluding upfront and reimbursement payments, are due to Biogen Idec International GmbH, or Biogen, as a sublicensing fee under our option and license agreement with Biogen dated March 18, 2009, as amended. The $2.0 million development and regulatory milestone we earned in August 2018 for regulatory approval from the NMPA of an IND application for a clinical study of AV-203 in ESCC was subject to this sublicense fee, or $0.7 million, which was paid to Biogen in October 2018.
 
In March 2021, CANbridge exercised its right to terminate for convenience the CANbridge Agreement. Under the terms of the CANbridge Agreement, we expect the transfer of the AV-203 program to be complete in September 2021 and, at that time, we will regain worldwide rights to the AV-203 program.
 
Biogen Idec International GmbH
 
In March 2009, we entered into an exclusive option and license agreement with Biogen regarding the development and commercialization of our discovery-stage ErbB3-targeted antibodies for the potential treatment and diagnosis of cancer and other diseases in humans outside of North America. In March 2014, we amended our agreement with Biogen, and regained worldwide rights to AV-203. Pursuant to the amendment, we were obligated to in good faith use reasonable efforts to seek a collaboration partner to fund further development and commercialization of ErbB3-targeted antibodies. We satisfied this obligation in March 2016 upon entering into the CANbridge Agreement. We are obligated to pay Biogen a percentage of milestone payments we receive under a partnership agreement related to the AV-203 program and single-digit royalty payments on net sales related to the sale of AV-203, up to a cumulative maximum amount of $50.0 million. 
 
The $2.0 million development and regulatory milestone we earned in August 2018 in connection with CANbridge’s regulatory approval from the NMPA of an IND application for a clinical study of AV-203 in ESCC was subject to this sublicense fee, or $0.7 million, which was paid to Biogen in October 2018.
 
Intellectual Property Rights 
 Patent Rights
 We continue to build a strong intellectual property portfolio, and, whenever possible, we seek to have multiple tiers of patent protection for our product candidates.
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in granting a patent. A U.S. patent term may be shortened, if a patent is terminally disclaimed by its owner, over another patent.
 The patent term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for a patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent term extensions cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. We expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering tivozanib and on any patents covering our product candidates that may obtain FDA approval in the future.
 
19

Tivozanib
 With respect to tivozanib, we have exclusively licensed from KKC its patents that cover the molecule and its therapeutic use for the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of any and all oncologic diseases and conditions in humans and a crystal form of the molecule. As discussed in “—Strategic Partnerships—Tivozanib–Kyowa Kirin Co. (KKC)” above, pursuant to the amendment to the KKC Agreement in August 2019, KKC repurchased the non-oncology rights of tivozanib in our licensed territories, excluding the rights which are currently sublicensed to EUSA.
 With respect to tivozanib, we have the following in-licensed patents:
  
• | U.S.: 2 granted patents with expirations ranging from 2022 to 2023
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Europe: 2 granted patents with expirations ranging from 2022 to 2023
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Canada: 1 granted patent expiring in 2022
--+------------------------------------------


• | Australia: 1 granted patent expiring in 2022
--+---------------------------------------------

 With respect to the U.S. patents, the first patent covers the tivozanib molecule and its therapeutic use and is expected to expire in 2022. The second patent covers a crystalline form of tivozanib that is the active pharmaceutical ingredient in our tivozanib product candidate and is expected to expire in 2023. In view of the length of time that tivozanib has been under regulatory review at the FDA, a patent term extension of up to five years may be available under the Hatch-Waxman Act. Although we plan to apply for patent term extensions on each patent, only one patent may be extended, and, when appropriate, we will have to elect which patent is to be extended. If a five-year extension were to be granted, if applied to the first patent, the term could be extended to April 2027, and if applied to the second patent, the term could be extended to November 2028. 
 With respect to the European patents, Supplementary Protection Certificates, or SPCs, have been granted for the European patent covering the tivozanib molecule in Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain and Sweden, extending the term of the patents in each of these countries up to April 2027. SPC applications are pending in Denmark and Great Britain for the corresponding patents in those countries that cover the tivozanib molecule, which, if granted, could extend the term of the patent in each of those countries up to 2027. An SPC has been granted for the patent covering the crystalline form of tivozanib in Ireland extending the term of that patent to October 2028.  
 Additionally, we have filed an international (PCT) patent application directed to our clinical protocol for using tivozanib to treat refractory cancers, including, following therapy with checkpoint inhibitors. If nationalized, we expect that a patent granted on a patent application in this family would expire in 2039. 
 Ficlatuzumab
 With respect to our anti-HGF platform, including ficlatuzumab, we have six U.S. patents covering our anti-HGF antibodies, nucleic acids and expression vectors encoding the antibodies, host cells, methods of making the antibodies, and methods of treatment using the antibodies. With respect to our anti-HGF platform we have:

• | U.S.: 6 granted patents with expirations ranging from 2027 to 2028
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Europe: 1 granted patent expiring in 2027
--+------------------------------------------


• | Japan: 2 granted patents expiring in 2027
--+------------------------------------------


• | Canada: 1 granted patent expiring in 2027
--+------------------------------------------


• | Australia: 1 granted patent expiring in 2027
--+---------------------------------------------

AV-380 Platform
 With respect to our anti-GDF15 platform, including AV-380, we have exclusively licensed certain patent rights from St. Vincent’s, which include a granted U.S. patent directed to a method of increasing appetite and/or body weight upon administering an effective amount of an anti-GDF15 antibody, which is expected to expire in 2029.
 With respect to the licensed patent rights, we have:
  
• | U.S.: 1 granted patent, and 1 pending patent application, if granted, with expirations ranging from 2025 to 2029
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Europe: 2 granted patents expiring in 2025
--+-------------------------------------------

--+---------------------------------------------

 Additionally, we own three issued U.S. patents and a pending U.S. patent application covering our anti-GDF15 antibodies and methods of treating cachexia and inhibiting loss of muscle mass associated with cachexia using our anti-GDF15 antibodies. These patents and patent application, if granted, would be expected to expire in 2033. 
 We also have three pending U.S. patent applications directed to methods of treating or preventing congestive heart failure or chronic kidney disease using an anti-GDF15 antibody, and methods of treating a subject with cancer anorexia-cachexia syndrome with an anti-cancer agent and an anti-GDF15 antibody. These patent applications, if granted, would be expected to expire in 2035.
 With respect to our anti-GDF15 platform, we have:
  
• | U.S.: 3 granted patents, and 4 pending patent applications, if granted, with expirations ranging from 2033 to 2035

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Australia: 1 granted patent, and 1 pending patent application, if granted, with expirations ranging from 2033 to 2035
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AV-203 Platform
 With respect to our anti-ErbB3 platform, including AV-203, we have five issued U.S. patents and one pending U.S. patent application covering our anti-ErbB3 antibodies, nucleic acids and expression vectors encoding the antibodies, host cells, methods of making the antibodies and methods of treatment using our anti-ErbB3 antibodies, which are expected to expire from 2031 to 2032. With respect to our anti-ErbB3 platform we have:

• | U.S.: 5 granted patents, and 1 pending patent application, if granted, with expirations ranging from 2031 to 2032
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Europe: 1 granted patent, and 1 pending patent application, if granted, with expirations ranging from 2031 to 2032

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Many pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and academic institutions are competing with us in the field of oncology and filing patent applications potentially relevant to our business. With regard to ficlatuzumab, we are aware of one United States patent and its foreign counterparts that contain broad claims related to anti-HGF antibodies having certain binding properties and their use. In the event that the owner of these patents were to bring an infringement action against us, we may have to argue that our product, its manufacture or use does not infringe a valid claim of the patent in question. Furthermore, if we were to challenge the validity of any issued United States patent in court, we would need to overcome a statutory presumption of validity that attaches to every United States patent. This means that in, order to prevail, we would have to present clear and convincing evidence as to the invalidity of the patent’s claims. There is no assurance that a court would find in our favor on questions of infringement or validity.
 
21

Over the years, we have found it necessary or prudent to obtain licenses from third-party intellectual property holders. Where licenses are readily available at reasonable cost, such licenses are considered a normal cost of doing business. In other instances, however, we may have used the results of freedom-to-operate studies to guide our research away from areas where we believed we were likely to encounter obstacles in the form of third-party intellectual property. For example, where a third-party holds relevant intellectual property and is a direct competitor, a license might not be available on commercially reasonable terms or available at all.
 In spite of our efforts to avoid obstacles and disruptions arising from third-party intellectual property, it is impossible to establish with certainty that our technology platform or our product programs will be free of claims by third-party intellectual property holders. Even with modern databases and on-line search engines, literature searches are imperfect and may fail to identify relevant patents and published applications. Even when a third-party patent is identified, we may conclude upon a thorough analysis, that we do not infringe the patent or that the patent is invalid. If the third-party patent owner disagrees with our conclusion and we continue with the business activity in question, patent litigation may be initiated against us. Alternatively, we might decide to initiate litigation in an attempt to have a court declare the third-party patent invalid or non-infringed by our activity. In either scenario, patent litigation typically is costly and time-consuming, and the outcome is uncertain. The outcome of patent litigation is subject to uncertainties that cannot be quantified in advance, for example, the credibility of expert witnesses who may disagree on technical interpretation of scientific data. Ultimately, in the case of an adverse outcome in litigation, we could be prevented from commercializing a product or using certain aspects of our technology platform as a result of patent infringement claims asserted against us. This could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 To protect our competitive position, it may be necessary to enforce our patent rights through litigation against infringing third parties. Litigation to enforce our own patent rights is subject to the same uncertainties discussed above. In addition, however, litigation involving our patents carries the risk that one or more of our patents will be held invalid (in whole or in part, on a claim-by-claim basis) or held unenforceable. Such an adverse court ruling could allow third parties to commercialize our products or our platform technology, and then compete directly with us, without making any payments to us.
 Trademarks
 We seek trademark protection in the United States and other jurisdictions where available and when appropriate. We have filed applications and obtained registrations for several trademarks intended for use in the marketing of tivozanib, including the trademark FOTIVDA, which we have registered in the United States and over 20 other jurisdictions, and for which we have filed applications in additional countries. We own U.S. and EU registrations for a logo containing FOTIVDA in combination with a flame design. We own U.S. registrations for AVEO and AVEO (in stylized letters) trademarks that we use in connection with our business in general. We have also registered AVEO as a trademark in over 20 other jurisdictions.
 
22

Manufacturing 
 
We or our partners currently contract with and rely on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates and intend to do so in the future for both clinical and commercial needs. We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of our product candidates. We currently have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. Although we rely on third-party contract manufacturers, we have personnel with extensive manufacturing experience to oversee the relationships with our contract manufacturers. All manufacturing occurs at facilities that comply with FDA requirements and the requirements of regulatory agencies from the other jurisdictions where we have obtained approval.
 
One of our contract manufacturers has manufactured what we believe to be sufficient quantities of tivozanib drug product (capsules) to support our ongoing and planned clinical trials and commercial launch. A separate contract manufacturer, using our proprietary manufacturing process, has manufactured what we believe to be sufficient lots of drug substance. This drug substance may be used to manufacture tivozanib drug product (capsules) for any future clinical and commercial needs. 
 
In preparation for the commercial launch of FOTIVDA in the United States, we engaged a separate contract manufacturer to bottle, package, label and serialize commercial supply of FOTIVDA on an as-needed basis. We rely on a separate third-party to distribute commercial supply of FOTIVDA in the United States. 
 
We have engaged a separate third-party contract manufacturer to initiate clinical manufacture of ficlatuzumab to supply a potential phase 3 clinical trial in HNSCC, as well as to enable additional potential development in pancreatic cancer and AML. We currently have sufficient clinical trial supply for AV-380 to support our phase 1 clinical trial. The same contract manufacturer we engaged to initiate clinical manufacturing of ficlatuzumab will be manufacturing any future clinical supply needs for AV-380.
 
To date, third-party manufacturers have met the needs for manufacturing clinical trial supplies for all our pipeline products. There are alternate manufacturers with capability to supply for current clinical or potential future commercial needs. Contracting with additional contract manufacturers may require significant lead-times and result in additional costs. 
 Government Regulation and Product Approval 
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the EU, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, sales, pricing, reimbursement, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 
Review and Approval of Drugs and Biologics in the United States
 
In the United States, the FDA approves and regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and related regulations. Biological products are licensed for marketing under the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and subject to regulation under the FDCA and related regulations. An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug or biological product in the United States must typically secure the following:
 
 
• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must take effect before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCPs, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each proposed indication;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA for a drug candidate product and a biological licensing application, or BLA, for a biological product requesting marketing for one or more proposed indications;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
23

 
• | review of the request for approval by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or similar foreign standards, which we refer to as cGMPs,to assure the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA or BLA; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies
 Before an applicant begins testing a compound with potential therapeutic value in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the purity and stability of the manufactured substance or active pharmaceutical ingredient and the formulated product, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the safety and activity of the product candidate for initial testing in humans and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, and long-term toxicity studies, may continue after the IND is submitted.
 The IND and IRB Processes
 An IND is a request for FDA authorization to administer an investigational product candidate to humans. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration of any new drug or biologic that is not the subject of an approved NDA or BLA. In support of a request for an IND, applicants must submit a protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. The FDA requires a 30-day waiting period after the filing of each IND before clinical trials may begin. This waiting period is designed to allow the FDA to review the IND to determine whether human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. At any time during this 30-day period, or thereafter, the FDA may raise concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND and impose a clinical hold or partial clinical hold. In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin.
 Following commencement of a clinical trial under an IND, the FDA may also place a clinical hold or partial clinical hold on that trial. Clinical holds are imposed by the FDA whenever there is concern for patient safety and may be a result of new data, findings, or developments in clinical, nonclinical, and/or chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC). A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND. For example, a specific protocol or part of a protocol is not allowed to proceed, while other protocols may do so. No more than 30 days after imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, the FDA will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the basis for the hold. Following issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, an investigation may only resume after the FDA has notified the sponsor that the investigation may proceed. The FDA will base that determination on information provided by the sponsor correcting the deficiencies previously cited or otherwise satisfying the FDA that the investigation can proceed.
 A sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived. When a foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with certain regulatory requirements of the FDA in order to use the study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. The FDA’s regulations are intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical studies, as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data. They further help ensure that non-IND foreign studies are conducted in a manner comparable to that required for IND studies.
 In addition to the foregoing IND requirements, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the trial at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the trial protocol and informed consent information to be provided to trial subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. An IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, or DSMB, or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access that only the group maintains to available data from the trial. Suspension or termination of 
 
24

development during any phase of clinical trials can occur if it is determined that the participants or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Other reasons for suspension or termination may be made by us based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate.
 Information about clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website. 
 Expanded Access to an Investigational Drug for Treatment Use
 Expanded access, sometimes called “compassionate use,” is the use of investigational new drug products outside of clinical trials to treat patients with serious or immediately life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no comparable or satisfactory alternative treatment options. FDA regulations allow access to investigational drugs under an IND by the company or the treating physician for treatment purposes on a case-by-case basis for: individual patients (single-patient IND applications for treatment in emergency settings and non-emergency settings); intermediate-size patient populations; and larger populations for use of the drug under a treatment protocol or Treatment IND Application. 
 When considering an IND application for expanded access to an investigational product with the purpose of treating a patient or a group of patients, the sponsor and treating physicians or investigators will determine suitability when all of the following criteria apply: patient(s) have a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition, and there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy to diagnose, monitor, or treat the disease or condition; the potential patient benefit justifies the potential risks of the treatment and the potential risks are not unreasonable in the context or condition to be treated; and the expanded use of the investigational drug for the requested treatment will not interfere initiation, conduct, or completion of clinical investigations that could support marketing approval of the product or otherwise compromise the potential development of the product.
 On December 13, 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act, established (and the 2017 Food and Drug Administration Reauthorization Act later amended) a requirement that sponsors of one or more investigational drugs for the treatment of a serious disease(s) or condition(s) make publicly available their policy for evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access for individual patients. 
 In addition, on May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act, but the manufacturer must develop an internal policy and respond to patient requests according to that policy.
 Human Clinical Studies in Support of an NDA or BLA
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written trial protocols detailing, among other things, the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated.
 The clinical investigation of an investigational drug or biological product is generally divided into four phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined. The four phases of an investigation are as follows:
  
• | Phase 1. Phase 1 studies include the initial introduction of an investigational new drug or biological product into humans. These studies are designed to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the investigational drug or biological product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. Phase 2 includes the controlled clinical trials conducted to preliminarily or further evaluate the effectiveness of the investigational drug or biological product for a particular indication(s) in patients with the disease or condition under trial, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks associated with the drug or biological product. Phase 2 clinical trials are typically well-controlled, closely monitored and conducted in a limited patient population.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. Phase 3 clinical trials are generally controlled clinical trials conducted in an expanded patient population generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the drug or biological product has been obtained, and are intended to further evaluate dosage, clinical

effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational drug or biological product, and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 4. Post-approval studies may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. In addition, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug; and any clinically important increase in the case of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies often complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the candidate products well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, purity and potency of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 Finally, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, an application or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. Sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests and other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA, and the FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time.
 Submission and Review of an NDA or BLA by the FDA
 In order to obtain approval to market a drug or biological product in the United States, a marketing application must be submitted to the FDA that provides data establishing the safety and effectiveness of the proposed drug product for the proposed indication, and the safety, purity and potency of the biological product for its intended indication. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug product and the safety, purity and potency of the biological product to the satisfaction of the FDA.
 The application is the vehicle through which applicants formally propose that the FDA approve a new product for marketing and sale in the United States for one or more indications. Every new product candidate must be the subject of an approved NDA or BLA before it may be commercialized in the United States. Under federal law, the submission of most applications is subject to an application user fee, which for federal fiscal year 2021 is $2,875,842 for an application requiring clinical data. The sponsor of an approved application is also subject to an annual program fee, which for fiscal year 2021 is $336,432. Certain exceptions and waivers are available for some of these fees, such as an exception from the application fee for products with orphan designation and a waiver for certain small businesses. If an application is withdrawn prior to the FDA acceptance for filing, 75% of these fees may be refunded to the sponsor. If an application is withdrawn after filing, a lower portion of these fees may be refunded in certain circumstances.
 Following submission of an NDA or BLA, the FDA conducts a preliminary review of the application generally within 60 calendar days of its receipt and strives to inform the sponsor by the 74th day after the FDA’s receipt of the submission to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept the application for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of NDAs and BLAs. Under that agreement, 90% of applications seeking approval of New Molecular Entities, or NMEs, are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date on which FDA accepts the NDA for filing, and 90% of applications for NMEs that have been designated for “priority review” are meant to be reviewed within six months of the filing date. The review process and the Prescription Drug User Fee Act goal date may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission.
 
26

Before approving an application, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured. These pre-approval inspections may cover all facilities associated with an NDA or BLA submission, including drug component manufacturing (e.g., active pharmaceutical ingredients), finished drug product manufacturing and control testing laboratories. The scheduling and execution of such pre-approval inspections may be impacted or delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a REMS. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the product is a new molecular entity. Under the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, the FDA must implement a protocol to expedite review of responses to inspection reports pertaining to certain applications, including applications for products in shortage or those for which approval is dependent on remediation of conditions identified in the inspection report.
 The FDA may refer an application for a novel product to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 The FDA’s Decision on an NDA or BLA
 On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the application and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 If the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess the drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, Priority Review and Regenerative Advanced Therapy Designations
 The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition. These programs are referred to as Fast Track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review designation and regenerative advanced therapy designation.
 Specifically, the FDA may designate a product for Fast Track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the treatment of a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For Fast Track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track product’s application before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a Fast Track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a Fast Track application does not begin until the last section of the application is submitted. In addition, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
 
27

Second, a product may be designated as a Breakthrough Therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to Breakthrough Therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross‑disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner.
 Third, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a product that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case‑by-case basis, whether the proposed product represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment‑limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months.
 Finally, with passage of the Cures Act in December 2016, Congress authorized the FDA to accelerate review and approval of products designated as regenerative advanced therapies. A product is eligible for this designation if it is a regenerative medicine therapy that is intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. The benefits of a regenerative advanced therapy designation include early interactions with FDA to expedite development and review, benefits available to breakthrough therapies, potential eligibility for priority review and accelerated approval based on surrogate or intermediate endpoints.
 Accelerated Approval Pathway
 The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product for a serious or life‑threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Products granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval.
 For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a product.
 The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a product, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of products for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit. Thus, the benefit of accelerated approval derives from the potential to receive approval based on surrogate endpoints sooner than possible for trials with clinical or survival endpoints, rather than deriving from any explicit shortening of the FDA approval timeline, as is the case with priority review.
 The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post‑approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. As a result, a product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post‑marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of phase 4 or post‑approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post‑approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post‑marketing studies, would allow the FDA to initiate expedited proceedings to withdraw approval of the product. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.

Post-Approval Regulation
 Drugs and biologics manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
 In addition, manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, suspension of the approval, or complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. If a company is found to have promoted off-label uses, it may become subject to adverse public relations and administrative and judicial enforcement by the FDA, the Department of Justice, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products.
 Generic Drugs
 In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress established an abbreviated regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve generic drugs that are shown to contain the same active ingredients as, and to be bioequivalent to, drugs previously approved by the FDA pursuant to NDAs. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the agency. An ANDA is a comprehensive submission that contains, among other things, data and information pertaining to the active pharmaceutical ingredient, bioequivalence, drug product formulation, specifications and stability of the generic drug, as well as analytical methods, manufacturing process validation data and quality control procedures. ANDAs are “abbreviated” because they generally do not include preclinical and clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Instead, in support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference-listed drug, or RLD.
 Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, the FDA may not approve an ANDA until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. For the purposes of this provision, a new chemical entity, or NCE, is a drug that contains no active moiety that has previously been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An active moiety is the molecule or ion responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance. In cases where such NCE exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with 
 
29

the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval. The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application.
 Patent Term Restoration and Extension
 A patent claiming a new drug product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted on a patent covering a product is typically one-half the time between the effective date of a clinical investigation involving human beings is begun and the submission date of an application, plus the time between the submission date of an application and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple products for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The United States Patent and Trademark Office reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA.
Biosimilars
 The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ACA, which was signed into law on March 23, 2010, included a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 or BPCIA. The BPCIA established a regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve biosimilars and interchangeable biosimilars. As of January 1, 2021, the FDA has approved 29 biosimilar products for use in the United States. No interchangeable biosimilars, however, have been approved. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars. Additional guidance is expected to be finalized by FDA in the near term.
 Under the BPCIA, a manufacturer may submit an application for licensure of a biologic product that is “biosimilar to” or “interchangeable with” a previously approved biological product or “reference product.” In order for the FDA to approve a biosimilar product, it must find that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the reference product and proposed biosimilar product in terms of safety, purity and potency. For the FDA to approve a biosimilar product as interchangeable with a reference product, the agency must find that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product, and (for products administered multiple times) that the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic.
 Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date of approval of the reference product. The FDA may not approve a biosimilar product until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was approved. Even if a product is considered to be a reference product eligible for exclusivity, another company could market a competing version of that product if the FDA approves a full BLA for such product containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
 Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. A company must request orphan drug designation before submitting an NDA or BLA for the candidate product. If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan drug designation does not shorten the PDUFA goal dates for the regulatory review and approval process, although it does convey certain advantages such as tax benefits and exemption from the PDUFA application fee.
 If a product with orphan designation receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will receive orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve another sponsor’s marketing application for the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Orphan exclusivity does not block the approval of a different product for the same rare disease or condition, nor does it block the approval of the same product for different indications. If a drug or biologic designated as an orphan drug ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan drug application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity. Orphan exclusivity will not bar 
 
30

approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same drug or biologic for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand.
 Pediatric Exclusivity
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent and orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA or BLA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application.  
 FDA Approval and Regulation of Companion Diagnostics
 If safe and effective use of a therapeutic depends on an in vitro diagnostic, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of that diagnostic, known as a companion diagnostic, at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product. In August 2014, the FDA issued final guidance clarifying the requirements that will apply to approval of therapeutic products and in vitro companion diagnostics. According to the guidance, if the FDA determines that a companion diagnostic device is essential to the safe and effective use of a novel therapeutic product or indication, the FDA generally will not approve the therapeutic product or new therapeutic product indication if the companion diagnostic device is not approved or cleared for that indication.  
 Under the FDCA, in vitro diagnostics, including companion diagnostics, are regulated as medical devices. In the United States, the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post‑market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. 
 
The FDA previously has required in vitro companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to the product candidate to obtain pre-market approval, or PMA, simultaneously with approval of the therapeutic product candidate. The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee. For federal fiscal year 2021, the standard fee is $365,657 and the small business fee is $91,414.
 Review and Approval of Drug Products in the European Union
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of drug products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, the company would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. The approval process ultimately varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. 
 Clinical Trial Approval in the EU
 Pursuant to the currently applicable Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and the Directive 2005/28/EC on GCP, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the EU has been implemented through national legislation of the member states. Under this system, an applicant must obtain approval from the competent national authority of an EU member state in which the clinical trial is to be conducted, or in multiple member states if the clinical trial is to be conducted in a number of member states. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. The clinical trial application, or CTA, must be accompanied by an investigational medicinal product dossier with supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC and Directive 2005/28/EC and corresponding national laws of the member states and further detailed in applicable guidance documents.
 
31

In April 2014, the EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, which is set to replace the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. The new Clinical Trials Regulation will become directly applicable to and binding in all 28 EU Member States without the need for any national implementing legislation. It will overhaul the current system of approvals for clinical trials in the EU. Specifically, the new legislation aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical trials in the EU. Under the new coordinated procedure for the approval of clinical trials, the sponsor of a clinical trial will be required to submit a single application for approval of a clinical trial to a reporting EU Member State (RMS) through an EU Portal. The submission procedure will be the same irrespective of whether the clinical trial is to be conducted in a single EU Member State or in more than one EU Member State.  
 
The Regulation was published on June 16, 2014 but has not yet become effective. In January 2020, the website of the European Commission reported that the implementation of the Clinical Trials Regulation was dependent on the development of a fully functional clinical trials portal and database, which would be confirmed by an independent audit, and that the new legislation would come into effect six months after the European Commission publishes a notice of this confirmation. The website indicated that the audit was expected to commence in December 2020. In late 2020, the EMA indicated that it plans to focus on the findings of a system audit; improving the usability, quality and stability of the clinical trial information system; and knowledge transfer to prepare users and their organizations for the new clinical trial system. The EMA has indicated that the system will go live in December 2021.
 
As in the United States, parties conducting certain clinical trials must post clinical trial information in the EU at the EudraCT website: https://eudract.ema.europa.eu.
 
PRIME Designation in the EU
 In March 2016, the EMA launched an initiative to facilitate development of product candidates in indications, often rare, for which few or no therapies currently exist. The PRIority MEdicines, or PRIME, scheme is intended to encourage drug development in areas of unmet medical need and provides accelerated assessment of products representing substantial innovation reviewed under the centralized procedure. Products from small- and medium-sized enterprises, or SMEs, may qualify for earlier entry into the PRIME scheme than larger companies. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and accelerated marketing authorization application assessment once a dossier has been submitted. Importantly, a dedicated Agency contact and rapporteur from the CHMP or Committee for Advanced Therapies, or CAT, are appointed early in PRIME scheme facilitating increased understanding of the product at EMA’s Committee level
 Marketing Authorization
 In the EU, marketing authorizations for medicinal products may be obtained through several different procedures founded on the same basic regulatory process.
 The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU Member States. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicinal products produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases. It is optional for those products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients. Under the centralized procedure in the EU, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation may be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases. These are defined as circumstances in which a medicinal product is expected to be of a “major public health interest.” Three cumulative criteria must be fulfilled in such circumstances: the seriousness of the disease, such as severely disabling or life-threatening diseases, to be treated; the absence or insufficiency of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach; and anticipation of high therapeutic benefit. In these circumstances, the EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days.
 The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more other concerned EU Member States of an assessment of an application for marketing authorization conducted by one EU Member State, known as the reference EU Member State. In accordance with this procedure, an applicant submits an application for marketing authorization to the reference EU Member State and the concerned EU Member States. This application is identical to the application that would be submitted to the EMA for authorization through the centralized procedure. The reference EU Member State prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. The resulting assessment report is submitted to the concerned EU Member States which, within 90 days of receipt, must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a concerned EU Member State cannot approve the assessment report and related materials due to concerns relating to a potential serious risk to public health, disputed elements may be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all EU Member States.

A marketing authorization may be granted only to an applicant established in the EU. Regulation No. 1901/2006 provides that, prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the EU, an applicant must demonstrate compliance with all measures included in a Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, approved by the Pediatric Committee of the EMA, covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted a product-specific waiver, class waiver, or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP.
 Regulatory Data Protection in the European Union
 In the EU, new chemical entities approved on the basis of a complete independent data package qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, as amended, and Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended. Data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the EU from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application for a period of eight years. During the additional two‑year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization application can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic medicinal product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall ten‑year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to authorization, is held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. 
 Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity in the EU
 Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 and Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000 provide that a product can be designated as an orphan medicinal product by the European Commission if its sponsor can establish that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of: (1) a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the EU when the application is made, or (2) a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the EU and that without incentives the medicinal product is unlikely to be developed. For either of these conditions, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the EU or, if such method exists, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition.
 Once authorized, orphan medicinal products are entitled to ten years of market exclusivity in all EU Member States and, in addition, a range of other benefits during the development and regulatory review process, including scientific assistance for trial protocols, authorization through the centralized marketing authorization procedure covering all member countries and a reduction or elimination of registration and marketing authorization fees. However, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the ten-year period with the consent of the marketing authorization holder for the original orphan medicinal product or if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities. Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if the product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product. The period of market exclusivity may, in addition, be reduced to six years if it can be demonstrated on the basis of available evidence that the original orphan medicinal product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
 Orphan drug exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same drug or biologic for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. This is the case despite an earlier court opinion holding that the Orphan Drug Act unambiguously required the FDA to recognize orphan exclusivity regardless of a showing of clinical superiority.
 Regulatory Requirements After Marketing Authorization
 Following marketing authorization of a medicinal product in the EU, the holder of the authorization is required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products. These include compliance with the EU’s stringent pharmacovigilance or safety reporting, as well as rules potentially requiring post-authorization studies and additional monitoring obligations. In addition, the manufacturing of authorized medicinal products, for which a separate manufacturer’s license is mandatory, must also be conducted in strict compliance with the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidance, including Directive 2001/83/EC, Directive 2003/94/EC, Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and the European Commission Guidelines for Good Manufacturing Practice. These requirements include compliance with EU cGMP standards when manufacturing medicinal products and active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients outside of the EU with the intention to import the active pharmaceutical ingredients into the EU. Finally, the marketing and promotion of authorized drugs, including industry-sponsored continuing medical education and advertising directed toward the prescribers of drugs and/or the general public, are strictly regulated in the EU notably under Directive 2001/83EC, as amended, and EU Member State laws. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is prohibited across the EU.

Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
 On June 23, 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom voted in favor of leaving the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit. Following protracted negotiations, the United Kingdom left the EU on January 31, 2020. Under the withdrawal agreement, there is a transitional period until December 31, 2020 (extendable by up to two years). On December 24, 2020, the United Kingdom and the EU entered into a Trade and Cooperation Agreement. The agreement sets out certain procedures for approval and recognition of medical products in each jurisdiction. Since the regulatory framework for pharmaceutical products in the United Kingdom covering quality, safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from EU directives and regulations, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime that applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the United Kingdom.
 Furthermore, while the Data Protection Act of 2018 in the United Kingdom that “implements” and complements the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, has achieved Royal Assent on May 23, 2018 and is now effective in the United Kingdom, it is still unclear whether transfer of data from the European Economic Area, or EEA, to the United Kingdom will remain lawful under GDPR. The Trade and Cooperation Agreement provides for a transitional period during which the United Kingdom will be treated like an EU member state in relation to processing and transfers of personal data for four months from January 1, 2021. This may be extended by two further months. After such period, the United Kingdom will be a “third country” under the GDPR unless the European Commission adopts an adequacy decision in respect of transfers of personal data to the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom has already determined that it considers all of the EU 27 and EEA member states to be adequate for the purposes of data protection, ensuring that data flows from the United Kingdom to the EU/EEA remain unaffected. 
 General Data Protection Regulation
 The collection, use, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data regarding individuals in the EU, including personal health data, is subject to the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, including requirements relating to processing health and other sensitive data, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, providing notification of data breaches, and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the EU, including the United States, and permits data protection authorities to impose large penalties for violations of the GDPR, including potential fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues, whichever is greater. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. Compliance with the GDPR will be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase the cost of doing business or require companies to change their business practices to ensure full compliance.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Thus, even if a product candidate is approved, sales of the product will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, the product. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication.
 In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable marketing approvals. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product candidate could reduce physician utilization once the product is approved and have a material adverse effect on sales, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor.
 
34

In the EU, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies or so-called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. EU member states may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the EU have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the EU. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various EU member states, and parallel trade, i.e., arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any products, if approved in those countries.
 Healthcare Law and Regulation
 Healthcare providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims laws, reporting of payments to physicians and teaching physicians and patient privacy laws and regulations and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain business and/or financial arrangements. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include: 

• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, or the FCA, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false, fictitious or fraudulent or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
35


 
• | Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making, or offering or promising to make improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or otherwise seeking favorable treatment;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published in January 2013, which impose obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal false statements statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing •or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal transparency requirements known as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, under the ACA, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, within the United States Department of Health and Human Services, information related to payments and other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to healthcare items or services that are reimbursed by third-party payors, including private insurers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Further, some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and transfers of value to other health care providers and health care entities, or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 Healthcare Reform
 A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and other medical products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system in the United States. By way of example, the United States and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare. In March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the ACA, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for products under government health care programs. 
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used. Further, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. 
 Moreover, since enactment of the ACA, there have been, and continue to be, numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the law. For example, with enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the TCJA, which was signed by President Trump on December 22, 2017, Congress repealed the “individual mandate.” The repeal of this provision, which requires most Americans to carry a minimal level of health insurance, became effective in 2019. The Trump Administration also took executive actions to undermine or delay implementation of the ACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. One Executive Order directs federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA 
 
36

that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. The second Executive Order terminates the cost-sharing subsidies that reimburse insurers under the ACA.  
 In addition, on December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate portion of the ACA is an essential and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore because the mandate was repealed as part of the TCJA, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. On November 10, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral argument in this case and is expected to issue a ruling sometime this year. Litigation and legislation over the ACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results.
 Finally, there have been both federal and state actions designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example, the Trump Administration finalized a rulemaking that allows states or certain other non-federal government entities to submit importation program proposals to FDA for review and approval. Applicants would be required to demonstrate their importation plans pose no additional risk to public health and safety and will result in significant cost savings for consumers. At the same time, the FDA issued draft guidance that would allow manufacturers to import their own FDA-approved drugs that are authorized for sale in other countries (multi-market approved products). It remains to be seen whether these Executive Orders and actions will be modified or rescinded by the Biden Administration.  
 At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.
 There have been, and likely will continue to be, additional legislative and regulatory proposals at the foreign, federal, and state levels directed at broadening the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenues from product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain marketing approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates.
