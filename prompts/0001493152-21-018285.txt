ITEM 1. BUSINESS
The Company Background and Nature of Business
 
eWellness Healthcare Corporation (the “eWellness”, “Company”, “we”, “us”, “our”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 7, 2011.
 
The Company believes that it was the first physical therapy telehealth company to offer real-time distance monitored assessments and treatments. Our business model was to have large-scale employers use our PHZIO platform as a fully PT monitored corporate musculoskeletal treatment (“MSK”) wellness program. The Company’s PHZIO home physical therapy assessment and exercise platform was designed to achieve a market presence in the $30 billion physical therapy market, the $4 billion MSK market and the $8 billion corporate wellness industry. PHZIO is the first real-time remote monitored 1-to-many MSK physical therapy platforms for home use.
 
On November 12, 2016, the Company entered into a Services Agreement with Bistromatics, Inc., a company incorporated under the laws of Canada (“Bistromatics”). Pursuant to the Bistromatics Agreement, Bistromatics agreed to provide operational oversight of the Company’s Phzio System including development, content editing, client on boarding, clinic training, support & maintenance, billing, hosting and oversight and support of CRM and helpdesk system. The Company agreed to pay a monthly base fee of $50,000 monthly until Bistromatics has successfully signed and collected the first monthly service fee for 100 Physical Therapy Clinics to start using our Platform. When, and if, Bistromatics provides the Company with evidence of the 100 Physical Therapy Clinics, the monthly service fee would increase to $100,000. Bistromatics was granted the right to convert any outstanding monthly fee amounts became in arrears for 60 days into common stock at the same terms as the next round of financing or the Company’s common stock market price, whichever is higher. Bistromatics also had the right to appoint 40% of the directors and pursuant to this right, Darwin Fogt and Curtis Hollister, founders of Bistromatics, were appointed as board members.
 
Largely as a result of the Company’s inability to continue to raise capital through the issuance of convertible notes to institutional investors and the fact that the price of the Company’s Common Stock on the OTC had significantly declined, principally as a result of the conversion by the institutional investors of their notes, the Company’s ability to continue to adequately fund the growth of its telemedicine operations notwithstanding the fact that the telemedicine industry was flourishing during the COVID-19 Pandemic.
 
On May 22, 2020, the Company received and accepted the resignations of Brandon Rowberry and Rochelle Pleskow as independent directors. Their letters of resignation state the reason for their resignations were to permit them to pursue other business opportunities and further stated that they have had no disagreements with the operations, policies or practices of the Company. Also, on May 22, 2020, the Company received a letter of resignation from Darwin Fogt resigning as CEO, President and director of the Company and a separate letter of resignation from Curtis Hollister, resigning as CTO and director of the Company. Messrs. Fogt and Hollister continue to serve are executive officers and principals of Bistromatics Inc.
 
Pursuant to communications between the Company and Darwin Fogt and Curtis Hollister regarding their resignations, which resignations were accepted by the Company’s Board on June 1, 2020, Messrs. Fogt and Hollister represented to the Company that Bistromatics and its management will continue to provide support services to the Company’s PHZIO System, In addition, both Darwin Fogt and Curtis Hollister confirmed that they have had no disagreements with the operations, policies or practices of the Company.
 
In connection with the resignation of Darwin Fogt as CEO, the Company’s Board of Directors appointed Douglas MacLellan, who has served as the Company’s Chairman since May 2013, as Chief Executive Officer in addition to continuing to serve as the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
 
On September 15, 2020, the Company and Bistromatics signed an agreement that would transfer all worldwide marketing and Intellectual Property Rights or claims to the Company’s Phzio, Phzio TeleRehab and MSK 360 platforms to Bistromatics in return for a 15% ownership in Bistromatics. This agreement would eliminate all past due fees payable to Bistromatics of $746,832 and transfer the assets and liabilities of the three Phzio entities to Bistromatics. The transfer of rights was completed on December 31, 2020.
