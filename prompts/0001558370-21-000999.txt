ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY

Westwater Resources, Inc. is a 44-year-old public company focused on battery graphite development. Originally incorporated in 1977 as Uranium Resources, Inc. to mine uranium in Texas, our company has been reborn as an energy materials developer. Westwater is focused on battery-ready graphite materials after its acquisition of Alabama Graphite Corp. (“Alabama Graphite”) and its Coosa Graphite Project (“Coosa Project”) in Alabama in April 2018. Westwater recently discovered significant vanadium concentrations at the Coosa Project and has developed an exploration plan to further investigate the size and extent of those concentrations. 
Our principal executive offices are located at 6950 South Potomac Street, Suite 300, Centennial, Colorado 80112
, and our telephone number is (303) 531-0516. Our website is located at www.westwaterresources.net. Information contained on our website or that can be accessed through our website is not incorporated by reference into this report. As of February 11, 
2021, the Com
pany and its subsidiaries had 11 employees.
OUR STRATEGY

Our strategy is to increase shareholder value by expanding into the battery materials marketplace. The acquisition of the Coosa Project graphite mineral properties from Alabama Graphite in April 2018 provides the Company with the opportunity to develop critical raw materials utilized by the growing market for electric battery storage for automobiles, trucks and buses
, consumer electronics, as well as grid-based storage devices. In 2020, the global battery market consumed an estimated 290,000 tonnes of graphite, and is projected to grow at an annual rate of 20.0% over the next 10-year period, according to Roskill Information Services Ltd. 
​
Our goal for the graphite business is to develop a battery-graphite manufacturing business in Alabama that produces 
low-cost, high-quality
, and high-margin 
graphite products for battery manufacturers. We began operation of a pilot-scale processing plant in 2020, designed to both manufacture battery graphite materials in quantities suitable for potential customer testing and inform a definitive Feasibility Study scheduled for the first half of 2021. We anticipate that this is to be followed by construction of a commercial scale processing facility beginning in late 2021 and continuing through 2022 that purifies readily available graphite flake concentrates from various sources to >99.95% pure carbon. Once purified, the graphite will be further processed into three advanced component products with enhanced conductivity performance needed by battery manufacturers. These advanced graphite products are purified micronized graphite (“ULTRA-PMGTM”), delaminated expanded graphite (“ULTRA-DEXDGTM”) and coated spherical purified graphite (“ULTRA-CSPGTM”). At the same time, 
subject to the availability of financing, we plan to begin developing the Coosa Graphite mine (planned for start-up in 
eight years) on our 40,000-plus-acre mineral-rights holdings that can serve as a hedge against future feedstock costs and provide in-house quality assurance and quality control (“QA/QC”) for raw-material inputs.
Our project pipeline is prioritized with a goal of achieving sustainable production over time with our graphite, project so as to take advantage of rising and/or high price environments for battery materials. We may adjust near-term and long-term business priorities in accordance with market conditions.
​
Our broad base of mining, processing and manufacturing expertise from graphite, base and precious metals to energy materials is our key competitive advantage. Westwater possesses a unique combination of 
battery-materials knowledge and extensive project-execution experience, coupled with decades of capital markets

expertise which makes 
our business a powerful presence in the new energy marketplace. We intend to advance the Company’s project towards production, while prudently managing our cash and liquidity position for financial flexibility.
KEY BUSINESS AND CORPORATE DEVELOPMENTS IN 2020
Sale of Uranium Business
On December 31, 2020, 
Westwater, its wholly owned subsidiary URI Neutron Holdings II, Inc. (“Neutron Holdings”), and enCore Energy Corp. (“enCore”) entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) pursuant to which Westwater and Neutron Holdings agreed to sell their subsidiaries engaged in the uranium business in Texas and New Mexico (the “Uranium Subsidiaries”) to enCore on the terms and subject to the conditions in the Purchase Agreement (the “Transaction”). The Transaction closed December 31, 2020.
At the closing of the Transaction, enCore delivered $0.7 million in cash and issued $1.8 million worth of its common shares to Westwater, valued at the volume weighted average price of enCore’s common shares for the ten trading days ending on and including December 30, 2020, and Westwater and Neutron Holdings transferred all of the equity interests in the Uranium Subsidiaries to enCore along with a copy of a database relating to the Grants Mineral Belt located in New Mexico. In addition, enCore delivered to Westwater a 2% net smelter return royalty on production from the uranium properties held by Uranco, Inc. in New Mexico at the time of the closing, and a 2.5% net profits interest on the profits from operations of Neutron Energy, Inc.’s Juan Tafoya and Cebolleta Projects. Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, enCore also replaced the indemnification obligations of Westwater for certain reclamation surety bonds held in the name of URI, Inc., and Westwater assigned and transferred to enCore all rights to cash collateral held to secure such indemnity obligations.
Also, at the closing, Westwater delivered $0.3 million in cash to enCore, which amount will be delivered in escrow to the lender under the loan made to URI, Inc. in May 2020 pursuant to the Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP Loan”) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”). The escrowed amount will be released to Westwater upon, and subject to, forgiveness of the PPP Loan under the terms of the CARES Act. In the event that all or a portion of the PPP Loan is ineligible for forgiveness, the lender will retain the escrowed amount up to the amount of the unforgiven portion of the PPP Loan, plus interest. No assurance is provided that URI, Inc. will obtain forgiveness of the PPP Loan in whole or in part.
Graphite Product Development with Dorfner Anzaplan
Westwater announced on November 21, 2019 that it engaged Dorfner Anzaplan of Hirschau, Germany to advance the development of processes needed to purify graphite concentrates and to produce the Company’s battery grade products: ULTRA-PMGTM, ULTRA-DEXDGTM and ULTRA-CSPGTM. Dorfner Anzaplan is an internationally recognized and highly regarded organization that specializes in high-purity industrial and strategic metals businesses. It employs state-of-the-art analytical methods and facilities and employs innovative processing technologies to provide effective solutions tailored to its clients’ requirements.
​
Dorfner Anzaplan and other engineering consultants have collaborated with Westwater to scale up laboratory sample production to pilot scale production rates through new work executed through the second quarter of 2020 that:

● | Defined the method, equipment and operating parameters and requirements for graphite purification;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7




● | Defined operating parameters and equipment for processes required to manufacture Westwater’s battery graphite products; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Designed and executed Westwater’s pilot program.
--+-------------------------------------------------

​
One important result of this effort to date has been the development of a new processing method for the purification of graphite. The Company has filed a Provisional Patent Application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Purification is the critical first step in manufacturing battery graphite products.
​
Westwater’s pilot scale program utilizes approximately 30 metric tons of graphite concentrate feedstock received from our supplier, with whom we have executed a long-term agreement to supply graphite concentrate under a cap and collar pricing arrangement. This graphite concentrate shipment to Dorfner Anzaplan’s facility in Germany was previously announced in an October 9, 2020 press release. The pilot operation resulting from this work program with Dorfner Anzaplan and other engineering consultants is providing various product sizes of each of the Company’s three principal battery-grade conductivity enhancement products to potential clients to advance the prospective clients’ commodity evaluation and pre-qualification programs. This large-scale sample testing effort is the next step in the development schedule of the Coosa Graphite Project as it advances to a commercial production decision. The pilot facility has begun operation and production of Westwater’s battery products. Operation of the pilot program is expected to continue through the second quarter of 2021.

Turkish Government Taking of Temrezli and Sefaatli Licenses and Westwater’s Arbitration Filing
On January 27, 2020, Westwater filed a Claimant’s Memorial (the “Memorial”) in its arbitration proceeding against the Republic of Turkey (“Turkey”). The Memorial relates to Westwater’s request for arbitration submitted to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (“ICSID”) in December 2018 as a result of Turkey’s unlawful actions against Westwater’s investments at the Temrezli and Sefaatli uranium projects owned by Westwater’s Turkish subsidiary Adur Madencilik Limited Sirketi.
The Memorial sets forth the basis for Westwater’s claims under the treaty between the United States and Turkey concerning the reciprocal encouragement and protection of investments and international law generally, as well as the basis for the jurisdiction of the tribunal constituted on May 1, 2019 following ICSID’s registration of Westwater’s request for arbitration. The Memorial also establishes the reparations owed by Turkey for breach of its international obligations towards Westwater, consisting of no less than $36.5 million, plus costs and post-award interest, as compensation for Westwater’s resulting loss of its investment. Accompanying the Memorial is an expert report regarding the reparations owed to Westwater. In determining the amount of Westwater’s loss, the expert report considered (i) the projected future cash flows from the expropriated projects, discounted to present value by a risk-adjusted discount rate, (ii) valuations from transactions for similar projects, and (iii) in the case of the Sefaatli project, the amounts invested in the project.
On March 11, 2020, Turkey filed a request to bifurcate the arbitration proceeding, and on March 30, 2020, Westwater filed a response in opposition to Turkey’s request for bifurcation. On April 28, 2020, the arbitral tribunal denied Turkey’s bifurcation request.
 On May 13, 2020, Turkey filed with the arbitral tribunal a request, which Westwater elected not to oppose, to extend the date on which their Counter-Memorial must be filed (and to change dates for subsequent pleadings as well as document production and witness identification deadlines), which the tribunal approved on June 3, 2020. As a result of these decisions by the tribunal, Turkey filed its Counter-Memorial on September 14, 2020. The hearing on the substantive issues and damages is scheduled for September 13-17, 2021.
Additional information regarding the ICSID arbitration proceeding is presented in Part II, Item 1 below.
Vanadium Target Identification 
In late November 2018, Westwater announced the discovery of significant concentration of vanadium mineralization at several locations, hosted in the graphitic schists at the Company’s Coosa, Alabama Project. Westwater subsequently commenced the first of a four-phase exploration program designed to determine the extent, character and quality of the vanadium mineralization at Coosa. As announced by the Company on February 19, 2019, the first phase demonstrated widespread positive values for vanadium that extended beyond the Coosa graphite deposit, as defined in the 2015 Preliminary Economic Assessment for the Coosa Project. The second phase of this project is expected to begin during the first half of 2021. Scope for this effort includes drilling various targets to expand our knowledge of the geology, examining the core and/or cuttings for mineral constituents, and adding to our geologic model. In addition, vanadium mineralization is expected to be evaluated using extractive metallurgy techniques to ascertain any economic potential.

Global Pandemic and our Actions to Ensure Safety
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization designated COVID-19 as a global pandemic. The pandemic spread outside of China during the first quarter of 2020 and has impacted businesses throughout the world. In the U.S., many state and local governments have, based on local conditions, either recommended or 

10



mandated actions to slow the transmission of COVID-19. These measures range from limitations on crowd size to mandatory orders for non-essential citizens to “shelter in place” or “stay at home” until further direction. Borders between many countries have been closed to contain the spread of COVID-19. Uncertainty with respect to the economic effects of the pandemic has introduced significant volatility in the financial markets.
​
This pandemic, and the resultant uncertain economic conditions it has created, could adversely affect our operations, major facilities, or employees’ health. Westwater has the following priorities while managing business activities during this period of volatility and uncertainty:
​

● | First, to ensure the health and safety of employees and the communities where they work.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Second, to work with business partners to maintain the advanced graphite product development schedule.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Third, to ensure adequate financial liquidity to support key operations and business activities.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Westwater’s corporate business activities are largely unaffected at this time. Westwater has reduced utilization of its offices and remote working arrangements were instituted to ensure that some employees were able to work remotely using systems that already were in place. Westwater’s continued focus on the health and safety of employees, the safety of operations, and the safety of the communities in which our employees live and work remains paramount. To that end, and where remote working was not practical, Westwater eliminated unnecessary travel, instituted health protocols for working together, and ensured that employees are permitted to take time off due to illness or the illness of those around them without penalty. As a result, our corporate business activities will continue on as before, without interruption.
​
To the extent that the COVID-19 pandemic continues or worsens, local governments or governmental agencies may impose additional restrictions. The result of COVID-19 and those restrictions could result in a number of adverse impacts to Westwater’s business, including but not limited to additional disruption to the economy, additional work restrictions, and supply chains being interrupted, slowed, or rendered inoperable. As a result, it may be challenging to obtain and process raw materials to support business needs, and individuals could become ill, quarantined, or otherwise unable to work and/or travel due to health reasons or governmental restrictions. Also, governments may impose other laws, regulations or taxes which could adversely impact Westwater’s business, financial condition or results of operations. The potential effects of COVID-19 could also impact Westwater in a number of other ways including, but not limited to, laws and regulations affecting business, the availability of future borrowings, the cost of borrowings, and potential impairment of the carrying value of long-lived tangible assets.

OVERVIEW OF THE BATTERY GRAPHITE INDUSTRY
Graphite is the name given to a common form of the element carbon. Occurring naturally as a mineral in numerous deposits around the world, graphite is used in many industrial applications. These end uses take advantage of the graphite’s natural characteristics of high lubricity, high resistance to corrosion, ability to withstand high temperatures while remaining highly stable, and excellent conductivity of heat and electricity.
In recent years, graphite has become an essential component in the production of all types of electrical storage batteries. This role will continue to be important as demand for these batteries increases, with the world’s growing electric-vehicle and energy-storage needs. Natural battery-ready graphite products are derived from flake 

11



graphite that has been transformed through a series of specialty downstream processes into various battery graphite products. These processes include, but are not limited to:
● Purification to battery-grade carbon as graphitic (Cg) content of ≥ 99.95%,
● Micronization (sizing);
● Intercalation (expansion), and delamination (sheering);
● Spheronization (shaping), and classification (sorting); and
● Surface treatment (carbon coating).
Natural flake graphite is increasingly supplanting the use of synthetic graphite in battery applications, for cost and performance reasons. Through a series of sophisticated and precise processing steps, flake-graphite concentrates are transformed into high-value end products for the battery industry. These products, such as purified micronized graphite and delaminated expanded graphite, are used as conductivity-enhancement additives for the manufacture of cathodes for a number of battery material families. Coated spherical purified graphite is used for the manufacture of anodes in Lithium-Ion batteries. Additional high-performance, battery-ready graphite materials can also be produced, using these three products as a starting point.
The global battery market consumed 182,400 tonnes in 2018 and was growing at a rate of 16.1% over the previous ten years (Roskill, 2019). The greatest share of this market is made up of four battery-market segments that require advanced battery-graphite products:
● Lithium-Ion batteries — these are rechargeable lithium-based batteries used in everything from cellphones and hand tools to laptop computers and electric vehicles.
● Alkaline Power Cells — these are the most popular consumer batteries in the world, with more than 10 billion units produced worldwide each year (Roskill, 2019).

● | Lead Acid batteries — these are the workhorse batteries used in automobiles and back-up power supplies and other energy-storage applications where weight is less important than capacity, and make up about 80% of the storage capacities in gigawatt hours (GWh) of all batteries presently sold worldwide (Sanders, 2018).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Primary Lithium batteries — these are non-rechargeable, lightweight lithium-based batteries like those used in flashlights, smoke detectors, and applications where long life and lightweight matters most.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All of these batteries use graphite as a critical, non-substitutable constituent. According to analysts, batteries accounted for an estimated 290,000 tonnes of graphite consumption in 2020. Demand for batteries grew by a compound annual growth rate of 16.1% between 2008 and 2018 (Roskill, 2019). Based on Roskill’s base case scenario for electric vehicle demand, this rate of growth could increase to 20.2% over the next decade, with graphite consumption in batteries reaching 1,900,000 tonnes in 2028, of which well over 1,000,000 tonnes is projected to be natural graphite. Consumption of graphite in Lithium-Ion batteries currently accounts for around 84% of the battery market for graphite but this could rise to 95-98% by 2028. Competition between natural and synthetic graphite is expected to continue in Lithium-Ion batteries with the choice reducing to price, performance and availability. Also, synthetic graphite and natural graphite blends are becoming a popular choice for EV 

12



application to optimize performance and cost by taking advantage of each graphite attribute such as cycle life, energy density and cost. Synthetic graphite consumption by anode manufacturers is expected to grow because of the concentration of the industry in China; however, natural flake graphite demand is forecast to grow at a higher rate because of natural graphite’s performance and cost efficiencies.
In addition, natural graphite flake costs in China have gone up as well as purification costs due to increased environmental costs (hydrofluoric acid handling cost). In fact, China has become one of the major importers for natural graphite flake relying upon less expensive African sources. China does not have a cost advantage when it comes to natural graphite and also poses a geopolitical risk particularly to EU and US regions. The existing capacity of spherical natural graphite for Lithium-Ion batteries is estimated at 131,800 tonnes which is significantly smaller than that of spherical artificial graphite whose existing capacity is 638,500 tonnes as of 2020. To support natural graphite demand in the future, additional 446,700 tonnes of natural graphite capacity is in construction with another 622,000 tonnes of capacity planned. It is also important to note that over 85% of the additional capacity is planned in China whereas North America accounts for only 6.7% of additional capacities, highlighting one main reason that graphite is designated on The US Critical Minerals list as well as designated on The EU’s Critical Raw Materials list.
Overall battery consumption is rising at an accelerated growth rate due to recent and robust developments in electric-automobile markets, personal electronic devices and electrical grid storage, an enabling technology for wind and solar power installation. The global shift towards low- and zero-emissions vehicles and power sources will continue to drive increasing demand for graphite-battery materials for the foreseeable future. Recent developments in this sector include:
● The United Kingdom and France have announced a prohibition on the sale of gasoline- and diesel-powered vehicles by 2040. Electric vehicles using battery storage are the only viable technology that can satisfy the demands for new cars mandated by these nations;
● China, the largest new-car market in the world, has mandated that 8% of all new cars sold are to be plug-in hybrid, battery electric or fuel-cell powered;
● Many major automobile companies have developed, or are developing, an electric-based technology to replace internal-combustion engines;
● Governments around the world continue to incentivize electric-vehicle ownership through subsidies and other incentives;
● The installed base of wind and solar power electrical-generating systems is increasing every year. Grid battery storage is the answer to increasing system reliability and unlocking the value of these power sources; and
● As a result of these catalysts, and according to Roskill, the Lithium-Ion battery market is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of over 20%.
A significant challenge for battery manufacturers is that the primary source of battery-grade graphite is China, presenting the global battery industry with significant risks, including supply chain management risks, economic risks and environmental unsustainability. Also, critical domestic production is absent in the United States. A Presidential Executive Order signed September 30, 2020 includes graphite on its list of minerals critical to the safety and security of the United States. With little current domestic natural graphite production of any kind, the United States is presently required to source most of its battery graphite from China.

.
Westwater has developed graphite-purification technology and advanced product-development processes to meet the demands of these customers, as well as the large base of existing consumers for battery-graphite materials. Westwater is developing methodologies and facilities to produce high- purity, battery-graphite products in the State of Alabama. These products are designed to address all major battery sectors. In addition, the processes we intend to use are environmentally sustainable and permittable in the United States, where a robust regulatory environment complements our core values to reliably deliver safe, well-made products to our customers.
OVERVIEW OF THE VANADIUM INDUSTRY
Vanadium is a lightweight metal used in the construction industry, in high strength steel alloys, and in some large grid storage batteries. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), about 73,000 metric tonnes of vanadium per year were consumed worldwide in 2019 approximately 80% of which was utilized by the steel industry, where additions of the metal to conventional steel materials adds strength and corrosion resistance. Importantly for Westwater, demand for Vanadium Flow batteries is increasing as solar and wind power generators seek to make their installations more reliable electricity providers. Market research firm Roskill predicts that there will be a 45% increase in demand for vanadium, mostly in China.
Currently, about 85% of all vanadium is produced in South Africa, China and Russia. There is no significant production of vanadium currently in the United States.
COMPETITION
There is global competition for graphite, capital, customers and the employment and retention of qualified personnel. In the production and marketing of graphite, there are a number of producing entities globally, some of which are government controlled and several of which are significantly larger and better capitalized than we are. For instance, more than 80% of the battery grade graphite products globally are produced in China. Globally, some of these organizations also have substantially greater financial, technical, manufacturing and distribution resources than Westwater.
With respect to sales of graphite, the Company expects to compete primarily based on price. We will market graphite directly to users of the product. We are in direct competition with supplies available from various sources worldwide. We believe we compete with multiple graphite exploration, development and production companies.
OVERVIEW OF WESTWATER RESOURCES’ COOSA GRAPHITE PROJECT (“THE “COOSA PROJECT”)
Westwater acquired Alabama Graphite in 2018 as part of a strategic decision to refocus the Company to supply battery manufacturers with low-cost, high-quality, and high-margin graphite products. As a result of that business transaction, Westwater became the owner of the Coosa Graphite Project, which was the principal asset of Alabama Graphite. Westwater believes that graphite has an important strategic place in the global economy as a high-demand commodity as electrical storage systems for wind and solar power, and as the electrification of our transportation systems becomes more widespread. The principal asset acquired was the Coosa Project, which includes the Coosa graphite deposit located near Rockford, Alabama, 50 miles southeast of Birmingham. The Coosa deposit is located in an area that has been a past producer of graphite, utilizing a geology trend spanning tens of thousands of acres, known as the “Alabama Graphite Belt.” The State of Alabama remains a business-

14



friendly jurisdiction, exemplified by the state successfully securing a $1 billion commitment from Daimler Benz to build a Lithium-Ion battery factory near its automobile assembly plant in the state. In addition, several other automobile manufacturers have sited plants in Alabama as a result of this favorable business climate.
Westwater’s graphite business plan will accelerate product development and market development by purchasing readily available graphite flake from qualified suppliers, for which a procurement contract is currently in place, to serve as plant feedstock while the Coosa graphite mine is being permitted and developed. Development of a mine at the Coosa graphite deposit, planned for start-up in the next eight years, will serve as an in-house source of graphite feedstock, a hedge against future feedstock cost increases, and will provide in-house QA/QC for raw-material inputs. The Company plans to finish operation of a pilot program in the 2nd quarter of 2021. Materials produced in the pilot program, estimated at 12 or more metric tonnes over three different products, will be used for customer development and product qualification, and pilot-plant operating data will serve as the foundation for the design and construction of a commercial scale processing facility. As part of the planned facility, the graphite is purified, and then the material is further processed into the three advanced component products which provide graphite materials with enhanced conductivity performance for battery manufacturers: Purified Micronized Graphite, Delaminated Expanded Graphite, and Coated Spherical Purified Graphite. WWR is working with a number of potential customers.
Description of the Graphite Deposit
The Coosa graphite deposit is located at the southern end of the Appalachian mountain range, in Coosa County, Alabama. The deposit area is approximately 52 miles south-southeast of the city of Birmingham, and 23 miles south-southwest of the town of Sylacauga. The project mineral tenure is comprised of approximately 41,965 acres of privately-owned mineral rights that the Company holds under a long-term lease.
The Coosa graphite deposit is hosted in high-grade metamorphic rocks. Graphitic material is present in two types of schist, a quartz-graphite schist that generally has grades greater than 1% Cg and a quartz-biotite-graphite-schist that has grades generally less than 1% Cg. The uppermost 60-100 feet of the graphite-bearing rocks have been weathered and oxidized such that they could be easily mined by simple excavation equipment without any blasting. As currently defined, mining will mainly be centered on these weathered units.
A mineral resource estimate for the Coosa deposit, as set forth in a Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) completed by Alabama Graphite in 2015, demonstrated an overall concentration of non-reserve mineralized material of 157.8 million short tons averaging 2.48%, at a graphitic carbon cut- off grade of 1% Cg. This estimate is based on assay data from 69 core drill holes, totaling 20,414 feet.
Mining Method
The Coosa graphite deposit is expected to be mined by conventional small-scale open-pit mining methods through several shallow pits (less than 100 feet deep each) that will be developed over life of the project. At full-scale production, the mining rate will be approximately 577,000 short tons per annum, at an average grade of 3.2% Cg. Mine operations will employ small conventional loading and haulage equipment, including a 6.0 cubic yard excavator and 45-ton articulated haul trucks. Mineralized material will be ripped with a bulldozer to prepare the mineralized material for mining with the excavator. Additional support to the mine and plant will be provided by graders and smaller dozers to maintain access roads, stockpiles and overburden storage areas.

Concentrate Plant
Mineralized material from the Coosa Project mine is projected to have an average grade of 3.2% Cg, and will contain impurities consisting of quartz, muscovite, iron oxides and calcite. Most of the impurities are present on the surfaces of the graphite flakes and can be easily removed during a metallurgical process known as flotation. Flotation processing maximizes the removal of these impurities while avoiding degradation of graphite flakes.
The concentration plant will consist of two-stage crushing, rod and ball-mill grinding, and multi-stage flotation units. The plant will operate 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, 52 weeks per year. The concentrator operating availability is expected to be on the order of 93%. The concentrator plant capacity has been planned to handle approximately 577,000 short tons of material to produce 16,500 tonnes per annum of final concentrated product, with minimum 95% Cg and a 90% graphite recovery rate. The flotation concentrate will be transported to a purification plant for secondary processing and cleaning to produce the ultra-pure final products.
Purification and Post-Processing Activities
The purification of the graphite concentrate is expected to be performed using a proprietary, patent pending purification process that is being tested by Dorfner Anzaplan and other engineering consultants, utilizing the purchased feedstock we intend to use until the mine starts production, expected in the next eight years. The operation of the pilot process will further inform the design of the full-scale purification process to be built beginning in 2021. Once the graphite is purified to a minimum graphite carbon content of 99.95%, we will then process it through a combination of sizing, expansion, spheronization and coating to the advanced graphite products we intend to sell.
The Company has developed a new method for the purification of graphite concentrate. The process uses a combination of technologies including a caustic bake, acid leach and thermal finishing, a process that allows for a smaller and more sustainable environmental footprint than that of a hydrofluoric leaching system as used by other battery companies. This unique application developed by Westwater is the subject of a Provisional Patent Application that has been filed before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
Products and Business Development
The Company is working to develop products for all potential major battery markets. Unlike many of its peers, the Company believes that no battery market should be ignored, as is often the case with most publicity currently focused on Lithium-Ion batteries. Lead-acid, alkaline and primary-lithium battery manufacturers have significantly shorter and less stringent qualification requirements compared to large-scale Lithium-Ion battery applications.
The advanced graphite products which the Company intends to develop and sell are:
● Purified Micronized Graphite. Conductivity enhancement materials for both the rechargeable and single use Lithium-Ion, Primary-Lithium, Lead-Acid, and Alkaline battery markets;
● Delaminated Expanded Graphite. Conductivity enhancement materials for both the rechargeable and single use Lithium-Ion, Primary-Lithium, Lead-Acid, and Alkaline battery markets;

● Coated Spherical Purified Graphite. For Lithium-Ion battery anodes. 95% of a Lithium-Ion battery’s anode is coated spherical purified graphite and there is 10-30 times more specialty anode graphite required for the production of these batteries than there is Lithium in a Lithium-Ion battery.
The Company has initiated discussions with several battery manufacturers (including automobile manufacturers) for the purposes of evaluating the Company’s battery-graphite products, with the goal of executing multi-year supply agreements. To date, the Company has executed Non-Disclosure Agreements with potential customers and is working to place test samples with potential customers.

United States
Graphite extraction and processing is regulated by the federal and state governments. Compliance with such regulations has a material effect on the economics of our operations and the timing of project development. Our primary regulatory costs have been related to obtaining licenses and operating permits from federal and state agencies before the commencement of production activities, as well as the cost for maintaining compliance with licenses and permits once they have been issued. The current environmental and technical regulatory requirements for the graphite extraction and processing industry are well established. However, the regulatory process can make permitting difficult and timing unpredictable.
U.S. regulations pertaining to graphite extraction and processing continually evolve in the U.S. However, at this time we do not anticipate any adverse impact from these regulations that would be unique to our operations.

Graphite Mine Development Permits
Graphite mining and processing in Alabama requires various permits, including those for any emissions to air, water, or other aspects of the environment. Permits may be required from the State of Alabama, the U.S. Environmental Protection agency, The Army Corps of Engineers, and other State and Federal Agencies as identified in the Company’s Definitive Feasibility Study presently underway, Specifically for the mine, mine permit may be required in accordance with the Alabama Surface Mining Act of 1969. It is administrated by the Alabama Department of Labor (“DoL”). DoL issues mining permits, ensures that mine sites are properly bonded for reclamation purposes, and makes periodic inspections. A streamlined permit application process reduces the start-up time for new operations, and expedites permit renewals. A mining permit is filed by completing the “Application for Surface Mining Permit and Comprehensive Reclamation Plan” along with the $250 permit fee. The applicant must also post a cash, surety or negotiable bond in the amount of $2,500 per acre area to be disturbed payable to “Commissioner, Alabama Department of Labor”. The Coosa graphite mine may be subject to the US National Environmental Policy Act process, with potential review by various federal agencies that may include US Environmental Protection Agency, the Army Corp of Engineers, and others.
Water Rights
In Alabama, any surface or groundwater withdrawals are managed through the Alabama Water Use Reporting Program. The Alabama Water Resources Act and associated regulations establish the requirements for water withdrawals. The process begins with the submittal of an application form called a “Declaration of Beneficial Use” and other required information to the Office of Water Resources (“OWR”) within the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs. Once application information is reviewed and determined to be complete, OWR will issue what is called a Certificate of Use (“COU”) that lists the applicant’s name and information concerning all registered surface and/or groundwater withdrawal points and their withdrawal information. Entities with a capacity to withdraw more than 100,000 gallons per day are required to register with OWR and obtain a COU. The COU certify that proposed water use will not interfere with an existing water use and is beneficial.
