Item 1. Business
OVERVIEW
We are a diversified, growth-oriented master limited partnership (“MLP”) formed in 2012 by MPC to own, operate, develop and acquire midstream energy infrastructure assets. We are engaged in the gathering, processing and transportation of natural gas; the gathering, transportation, fractionation, storage and marketing of NGLs; and the gathering, transportation and storage of crude oil and refined petroleum products.
Our assets include infrastructure to support MPC including approximately 2,900 miles of crude oil and refined product pipelines across nine states. We own a barge dock facility with approximately 78 mbpd of crude oil and refined product throughput capacity, as well as crude oil and product storage facilities (tank farms) with approximately 4,533 mbbls of available storage capacity. We also own a butane cavern with approximately 1,000 mbbls of available storage capacity. Effective March 31, 2016, the Partnership acquired MPC’s inland marine business, comprised of 18 tow boats and 205 tank barges. This business is operated through HSM and the related assets, liabilities and results of operations are collectively referred to as the “Predecessor.” On December 4, 2015, we completed the merger with MarkWest (the “MarkWest Merger”), which is one of the largest processors of natural gas in the United States and the largest processor and fractionator in the Marcellus and Utica shale plays. These assets include gathering and processing infrastructure of more than 5,600 miles of gas and NGL pipelines, 54 gas processing plants, 14 NGL fractionation facilities and two condensate stabilization facilities.
MPC is our sponsor and a large source of our revenues. We have multiple transportation and storage services agreements with MPC. These agreements are long-term, fee-based agreements with minimum volume commitments and, therefore, MPC will continue to be an important source of our revenues for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, as a result of the MarkWest Merger, we also have long-term relationships with a diverse set of producer customers in many natural gas resource plays including the Marcellus Shale, Utica Shale, Huron/Berea Shale, Haynesville Shale, Woodford Shale, Granite Wash formation and the Permian Basin.
As of February 13, 2017, MPC owned our general partner, MPLX GP LLC (“MPLX GP”), and the associated incentive distribution rights, in addition to an approximate 23.5 percent limited partner interest (including the Class B units on an as-converted basis) in us. Given MPC’s significant interest in us, and its stated intent to grow its midstream business, MPC has recently announced plans to offer its MLP-qualifying assets estimated to generate $1.4 billion of annual EBITDA from its portfolio of midstream assets. MPC expects to offer us these assets as soon as practicable in 2017, subject to market conditions, requisite approvals and regulatory clearances, including tax. In conjunction with the completion of the announced dropdowns, MPC also expects to exchange its economic interests in MPLX GP for newly issued MPLX LP units in order to optimize the Partnership’s cost of capital. We also have significant organic growth opportunities to expand midstream services throughout major shale plays in the United States. Furthermore, we may pursue third-party midstream acquisitions independently or with MPC to complement our existing geographic footprint or expand our activities into new areas. MPC is under no obligation, however, to offer to sell us additional assets or to pursue acquisitions cooperatively with us, and we are under no obligation to acquire any such additional assets or pursue any such cooperative acquisitions.
Finally, we have an investment grade credit profile that provides the Partnership strong financial flexibility in order to fund growth projects and execute its strategic plans.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
On March 14, 2016, the Partnership entered into a Membership Interests Contribution Agreement (the “Contribution Agreement”) with MPLX GP, MPLX Logistics Holdings LLC and MPC Investment LLC (“MPC Investment”), each a wholly-owned subsidiary of MPC, related to the acquisition of HSM, MPC’s inland marine business, from MPC. Pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, the transaction was valued at $600 million consisting of a fixed number of common units and general partner units. The general partner units maintained MPC’s two percent general partner interest in the Partnership. The acquisition closed on March 31, 2016. MPC waived distributions in the first quarter of 2016 on MPLX LP common units issued in connection with this transaction.
The inland marine business, which transports light products, heavy oils, crude oil, renewable fuels, chemicals and feedstocks in the Midwest and U.S. Gulf Coast regions, accounted for nearly 60 percent of the total volumes MPC shipped by inland marine vessels as of March 31, 2016. The Partnership accounts for HSM as a reporting unit of the L&S segment. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 4 for more information on this transaction.
On May 13, 2016, MPLX LP completed the private placement of approximately 30.8 million 6.5 percent Series A Convertible Preferred units (the "Preferred units") for a cash purchase price of $32.50 per unit. The aggregate net proceeds of approximately $984 million from the sale of the Preferred units were used for capital expenditures, repayment of debt and general partnership purposes. The Preferred units rank senior to all common units with respect to distributions and rights upon liquidation. The holders of the Preferred units are entitled to receive cumulative quarterly distributions equal to $0.528125 per unit commencing for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, with a prorated amount from the date of issuance. Following the second anniversary of the issuance of the Preferred units, the holders of the Preferred units will receive as a distribution the greater of $0.528125 per unit or the amount of per unit distributions paid to common units. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 9 for more information on this transaction.
On August 4, 2016, MPLX LP entered into a Second Amended and Restated Distribution Agreement (the “Distribution
Agreement”) providing for the continuous issuance of MPLX LP common units, in amounts, at prices and on terms to be
determined by market conditions and other factors at the time of any offerings (such continuous offering program, or at-the-market program, referred to as the “ATM Program”). MPLX LP expects to use the net proceeds from sales under the ATM
Program for general partnership purposes including repayment of debt and funding for acquisitions, working capital
requirements and capital expenditures.
During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Partnership issued an aggregate of 26 million common units under the ATM Program generating net proceeds of approximately $776 million. As of December 31, 2016, $717 million of common units remains available for issuance through the ATM Program under the Distribution Agreement.
On September 1, 2016, the Partnership and various affiliates initiated a series of reorganization transactions in order to simplify the Partnership’s ownership structure and its financial and tax reporting requirements (the "Class A Reorganization"). In connection with these transactions, all of the issued and outstanding MPLX LP Class A units, all of which were held by MarkWest Hydrocarbon (MarkWest Hydrocarbon, Inc. prior to the Class A Reorganization), were either distributed to or purchased by MPC in exchange for $84 million in cash and a fixed number of MPLX LP common units and MPLX LP general partner units. Following these preparatory transactions, all of the MPLX LP Class A units were exchanged on a one-for-one basis for newly issued common units representing limited partner interests in MPLX LP. MPC also contributed $141 million to facilitate the repayment of intercompany debt between MarkWest Hydrocarbon and MarkWest. As a result of these transactions, the MPLX LP Class A units were eliminated, are no longer outstanding and no longer participate in distributions of cash from the Partnership. Cash that is derived from or attributable to MarkWest Hydrocarbon’s operations is now treated in the same manner as cash derived from or attributable to other operations of the Partnership and its subsidiaries. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 8 for more information on this transaction.
On October 11, 2016, the Cornerstone Pipeline became fully operational and in December 2016, the Hopedale pipeline connection was completed. This project is reported within our L&S segment. This pipeline is designed to transport condensate and natural gasoline from origination facilities in Harrison County, OH, to a tank farm in East Sparta, OH, where the condensate and natural gasoline can then continue on to MPC’s refinery in Canton, OH. The completion of this key organic growth project has created transportation and marketing options for Utica and Marcellus shale production. Additional pipelines are currently under construction and will provide further distribution to the Midwest and Canada.
On January 3, 2017, MPC announced its plans to offer the Partnership the opportunity to acquire assets contributing an estimated $1.4 billion of annual EBITDA in 2017. These planned dropdowns are subject to market conditions, requisite approvals and regulatory clearances, including tax clearance.
5

On December 5, 2016, MPC offered up to 100 percent of MPLX Terminals LLC (“MPLX Terminals”), Hardin Street Transportation LLC (“Hardin Street Transportation”) and Woodhaven Cavern LLC (“Woodhaven Cavern”) to MPLX. MPLX Terminals owns and operates light products terminals. Hardin Street Transportation owns and operates various private crude oil and refined product pipeline systems and associated storage tanks. Woodhaven Cavern owns and operates butane and propane storage caverns. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017, pending requisite approvals.
The Partnership's plans for funding these dropdowns would likely include debt and equity in approximately equal proportions, with the equity financing to be funded through transactions with MPC. In February 2017, we issued an additional $2.25 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, as described below. In addition to the expected dropdowns, MPC announced its intentions to offer to exchange its IDRs for MPLX LP units in conjunction with the completion of the dropdowns in order to reduce the Partnership's cost of capital.
On January 25, 2017, we announced the board of directors of our general partner had declared a distribution of $0.5200 per unit that was paid on February 14, 2017 to unitholders of record on February 6, 2017.
On February 6, 2017, the Partnership and Antero Midstream Partners LP (“Antero Midstream”) formed a strategic joint venture to support Antero Resources Corporation (“Antero Resources”) in the Marcellus Shale. Antero Midstream Partners released to the joint venture its dedication from Antero Resources of approximately 195,000 gross operated acres located in Tyler, Wetzel and Ritchie counties of West Virginia. The joint venture will support the ongoing development of incremental gas processing required by Antero Resources in the Marcellus Shale. The joint venture is also investing in fractionation capacity at MarkWest's Hopedale Complex in Ohio and has an option to invest in future fractionation expansions that support Antero Resources’ liquids production. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 24 for additional information.
On February 10, 2017, the Partnership completed a public offering of $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.125 percent unsecured senior notes due March 2027 (the “2027 Senior Notes”) and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.200 percent unsecured senior notes due March 2047 (the “2047 Senior Notes” and, collectively with the 2027 Senior Notes, the “New Senior Notes”). The 2027 Senior Notes and the 2047 Senior Notes were offered at a price to the public of 99.834 percent and 99.304 percent of par, respectively. The Partnership intends to use the net proceeds from this offering for general partnership purposes, which may include, from time to time, acquisitions (including the previously announced planned dropdown of assets from MPC, the acquisition of the Ozark pipeline, and the acquisition of a partial, indirect equity interest in the Bakken Pipeline system) and capital expenditures. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 24 for additional information.
On February 13, 2017, the Partnership announced that it has entered into an asset purchase agreement with Enbridge Pipelines (Ozark) LLC (“Enbridge Ozark”), under which an affiliate of Pipe Line Holdings has agreed to purchase the Ozark pipeline for approximately $220 million from Enbridge Ozark. The Ozark pipeline is a 433-mile, 22-inch crude oil pipeline originating in Cushing, Oklahoma, and terminating in Wood River, Illinois, capable of transporting approximately 230,000 barrels per day. This purchase transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 24 for additional information.
On February 15, 2017, the Partnership closed on its previously announced intent to participate in a joint venture with Enbridge Energy Partners L.P. (“Enbridge Energy Partners”) to acquire a 9.1875 percent indirect interest in the Dakota Access Pipeline
(“DAPL”) and Energy Transfer Crude Oil Company Pipeline (“ETCOP”) projects, collectively referred to as the Bakken
Pipeline system, from Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. (“ETP”) and Sunoco Logistics Partners, L.P. (“SXL”) for $500 million.
Furthermore, MPC expects to become a committed shipper on the Bakken Pipeline system under terms of an on-going open
season. The Bakken Pipeline system is currently expected to deliver in excess of 470,000 barrels per day of crude oil from the Bakken/Three Forks production area in North Dakota to the Midwest through Patoka, Illinois and ultimately to the Gulf Coast. ETP and SXL collectively own a 75 percent interest in each of the two joint ventures that are developing the Bakken Pipeline system. MPLX LP and Enbridge Energy Partners intend to form a new joint venture to acquire 49 percent of ETP and SXL’s 75 percent indirect interest in the Bakken Pipeline system. MPLX LP will own 25 percent of this new joint venture with Enbridge, which results in its 9.1875 percent indirect ownership interest in the Bakken Pipeline system. The Partnership expects to account for its investment using the equity method of accounting. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 24 for additional information.

BUSINESS STRATEGIES
Our primary business objectives are to enhance unitholder returns through the generation of stable cash flows. We intend to accomplish these objectives by executing the following strategies:
Maintain Long-Term Integrated Relationships with Our Producer Customers. We develop long-term integrated relationships with our producer customers. Our relationships are characterized by an intense focus on customer service and a deep understanding of our producer customers’ requirements coupled with the ability to increase the level of our midstream services in response to their midstream requirements. Through collaborative planning, we construct midstream infrastructure and provide unique solutions that are critical to the ongoing success of our producer customers’ development plans. As a result of delivering high-quality midstream services, MarkWest has been a top-rated midstream service provider since 2006 as determined by an independent research provider.
Grow through Acquisitions. In addition to the MarkWest Merger and HSM acquisition, we plan to continue pursuing acquisitions of complementary assets from MPC as well as third parties, such as the Ozark pipeline acquisition and the acquisition of the joint venture interest in the Bakken Pipeline system. As discussed above, we announced that we expect to acquire assets from MPC with an estimated $1.4 billion of annual EBITDA as soon as practicable, subject to requisite approvals, and regulatory clearance, including tax. We may also pursue third-party midstream acquisitions independently or with MPC that complement our existing geographic footprint or expand our activities into new areas.
Increase Operating Cash Flow and Pursue Organic Growth Opportunities. We intend to increase operating cash flow by continuing to grow in our primary areas of operation to meet anticipated demand for additional midstream services. In addition, we intend to increase operating cash flow by evaluating and capitalizing on organic investment opportunities that may arise in our areas of operations and increasing the utilization of our existing facilities by providing additional services for new and existing customers. We will evaluate organic growth projects both within our geographic footprint as well as in new areas that we consider strategic. With the support of MPC as our sponsor, we have the ability to develop incremental infrastructure to support growth across the hydrocarbon value chain. 
Focus on Fee-Based Businesses. We are focused on generating stable cash flows by providing fee-based midstream services to our customers. For the full year ending December 31, 2017, we expect fee-based contracts to be approximately 95 percent of our net operating margin (for more information on net operating margin, which is a non-GAAP measure, see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Non-GAAP Financial Measures).
Sustain Long-Term Growth. Our goal is to maintain an attractive distribution growth profile over the long term. Since the Initial Offering, we have increased our distribution for 16 consecutive quarters, which represents a compound annual growth rate of 18.6 percent over the minimum quarterly distribution. Our goal is to also optimize our cost of capital by maintaining an investment grade credit profile, providing visibility to future growth, and eliminating IDR distributions to MPC. On January 3, 2017, we announced that we expect to exchange MPLX LP units for MPC’s economic interests in MPLX GP, including IDR’s, in conjunction with the completion of the MPC asset acquisitions described above. We believe our plans, along with the support of our sponsor, provide multiple avenues to support our distribution growth profile over the long-term.
Maintain Safe and Reliable Operations. We believe that providing safe, reliable and efficient services is a key component in generating stable cash flows, and we are committed to maintaining and improving the safety, reliability and efficiency of our operations. We intend to continue promoting a high standard for safety and environmental stewardship.
COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS
We believe we are well positioned to execute our business strategies based on the following competitive strengths:
Strategically Located Assets. Our L&S segment assets are primarily located in the Midwest and Gulf Coast regions of the United States and our G&P segment assets are primarily located in the Northeast and Southwest regions of the United States.

• | Our L&S assets are strategically located and collectively comprise approximately 81 percent of total United States crude distillation capacity and approximately 81 percent of total United States finished products demand for the year ended December 31, 2016, according to the EIA. These assets are integral to the success of MPC’s operations, which include seven refineries in the Midwest and Gulf Coast regions of the United States with an aggregate crude oil refining capacity of approximately 1.8 million barrels per calendar day.


• | Our G&P segment is focused on regions of natural gas supply growth. We are one of the largest processors and

7

fractionators in the United States.

◦ | We are the largest processor and fractionator in the Marcellus and Utica shale plays. As of February 13, 2017, our assets in the northeastern United States have combined processing capacity of approximately 6.1 bcf/d and combined fractionation capacity of approximately 518 mbpd as well as an integrated NGL pipeline network and extensive logistics and marketing infrastructure. We believe our significant asset base and full-service midstream model provides us with strategic competitive advantages in capturing and contracting for gathering, processing and fractionating of new supplies of natural gas as production in the Northeast continues to increase.


◦ | We also have a significant presence in the southwestern portion of the United States with an existing strong competitive position; access to a significant reserve or customer base with a stable or growing production profile; ample opportunities for long-term continued organic growth; ready access to markets; and close proximity to other expansion opportunities. We have 1.4 bcf/d of processing capacity in the southwestern portion of the United States.

Leading Midstream Positions Drive Investment Opportunities. Our organic growth capital plan range for 2017 is $1.4 billion to $1.7 billion, which does not include the anticipated dropdowns or acquisitions previously discussed or their respective subsequent capital spending. The G&P segment capital plan includes investments that are expected to support producer customers. During 2017, we expect to complete 400 mmcf/d of additional natural gas processing capacity and 120 mbpd of additional fractionation capacity (of which 60 mbpd of fractionation capacity has already been completed), primarily in the Marcellus Shale. The L&S segment capital plan includes the development of various crude oil and refined petroleum products infrastructure projects, including a build out of Utica Shale infrastructure in connection with the recently completed Cornerstone Pipeline, a butane cavern and a tank farm expansion. We also have large organic growth prospects associated with the anticipated growth of MPC’s operations and third-party activity in our areas of operation that will provide attractive returns and cash flows. We also plan to pursue acquisitions of other midstream assets on a standalone basis or cooperatively with MPC.
Strategic Relationship with MPC. We have a strategic relationship with MPC and MPC views us as integral to its operations and is aligned with our success. We believe MPC to be the largest crude oil refiner in the Midwest and the third-largest in the United States based on crude oil refining capacity. MPC is well-capitalized, with investment grade credit ratings, and owns our general partner, an approximate 23.5 percent limited partner interest (including the Class B units on an as-converted basis) as of February 13, 2017 and all of our incentive distribution rights. We expect to acquire a portfolio of midstream assets from MPC, as recently announced in its plan to dropdown an estimated $1.4 billion of EBITDA in 2017, subject to regulatory and tax clearance. In conjunction with the completion of the announced dropdowns, MPC also expects to exchange its economic interest in MPLX GP for newly issued MPLX LP units in order to optimize the Partnership’s cost of capital. We believe that our relationship with MPC will provide us with significant growth opportunities, as well as a base of stable cash flows.
High-Quality, Well-Maintained Asset Base. We continually invest in the maintenance and integrity of our assets and have developed various programs to help us efficiently monitor and maintain them. For example, we utilize MPC’s patented integrity management program that employs state-of-the-art mechanical integrity inspection and repair programs to enhance the safety of certain of our pipelines.
Stable and Predictable Cash Flows. We generate a substantial majority of our revenue through long-term, fee-based agreements. We believe our long-term contracts, which we define as contracts with remaining terms of four years or more, lend greater stability to our cash flow profile. The table below provides long-term contract details by segment as of December 31, 2016:

 | Remaining contract term | % of volumes
L&S segment | 6 years | 72 | %
G&P segment | 4 to 19 years | 85 | %

Financial Flexibility. As of December 31, 2016, we had $234 million of cash and $2.5 billion available on our revolving credit facilities. We believe that we will have the financial flexibility to execute our growth strategy through excess cash reserves, borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities and access to the debt and equity capital markets. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 17 and Note 8 for additional information regarding our recent transactions related to debt and common unit offerings.

ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE
The following diagram depicts our organizational structure and MPC’s ownership interests in us as of February 13, 2017. 
10

We are an MLP with outstanding common units, Preferred units, and Class B units.

• | Our common units are publicly traded on the NYSE under the symbol “MPLX.”


• | The Preferred units rank senior to all common units with respect to distributions and rights upon liquidation. The holders of the Preferred units are entitled to receive cumulative quarterly distributions equal to $0.528125 per unit commencing for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, with a prorated amount from the date of issuance. Following the second anniversary of the issuance of the Preferred units, the holders of the Preferred units will receive as a distribution the greater of $0.528125 per unit or the amount of per unit distributions paid to common units. The purchasers may convert their Preferred units into common units, at any time after the third anniversary of the issuance date or prior to liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Partnership, in full or in part, subject to minimum conversion amounts and conditions. After the fourth anniversary of the issuance date, the Partnership may convert the Preferred units into common units at any time, in whole or in part, subject to certain minimum conversion amounts and conditions, if the closing price of MPLX LP common units is greater than $48.75 for the 20 day trading period immediately preceding the conversion notice date. The conversion rate for the Preferred units shall be the quotient of (a) the sum of (i) $32.50, plus (ii) any unpaid cash distributions on the applicable Preferred unit, divided by (b) $32.50. The holders of the Preferred units are entitled to vote on an as-converted basis with the common unitholders and will have certain other class voting rights with respect to any amendment to the partnership agreement that would adversely affect any rights, preferences or privileges of the Preferred units. In addition, upon certain events involving a change in control the holders of Preferred units may elect, among other potential elections, to convert their Preferred units to common units at the then change of control conversion rate.


• | All of the Class B units were issued to and are held by M&R MWE Liberty LLC and certain of its affiliates (“M&R”), an affiliate of The Energy & Minerals Group (“EMG”). Each Class B unit of MarkWest issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the MarkWest Merger was converted into the right to receive one Class B unit of MPLX LP. Each Class B unit of MPLX LP will convert into 1.09 common units of MPLX LP and the right to receive $6.20 in cash, and the conversion of the Class B units will occur in equal installments, the first of which occurred on July 1, 2016 and the second of which will occur on July 1, 2017. Class B units (i) share in our taxable income and losses, (ii) are not entitled to participate in any distributions of available cash prior to their conversion and (iii) do not have the right to vote on, approve or disapprove, or otherwise consent to or not consent to any matter (including mergers, unit exchanges and similar statutory authorizations) other than those matters that disproportionately and adversely affect the rights and preferences of the Class B units. Upon conversion of the Class B units, the right of M&R and certain of its affiliates to vote as a common unitholder of the Partnership will be limited to a maximum of five percent of the Partnership’s outstanding common units. Upon the conversion of each tranche of Class B units, M&R will have the right with respect to such converted units to participate in the Partnership’s underwritten offerings of our common units including continuous equity or similar programs in an amount up to 20 percent of the total number of common units offered by the Partnership. In addition, M&R may freely transfer such converted units, and M&R will have the right to demand that we conduct up to three underwritten offerings beginning in 2017, but restricted to no more than one offering in any twelve-month period. M&R is not permitted to transfer its Class B units without the prior written consent of our general partner’s board of directors.

INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
We provide diversified services in the midstream sector across the hydrocarbon value chain. The types of midstream services provided by both our L&S and G&P segments are as follows:
L&S:
Our L&S assets are integral to the success of MPC’s operations related to transportation and storage across the hydrocarbon value chain.

• | Logistics. Crude oil is the primary raw material for transportation fuels and the basis for many products including plastics and petrochemicals, in addition to heating oil for homes once it is refined and prepared for use. While many forms of transportation are used to move this product to storage hubs and refineries, we believe pipelines and marine vessels are among the safest, most efficient and cost-effective ways to move this resource to refineries and to market. Pipelines bring advantaged North American crude oil from the upper Great Plains, Texas and Canada to numerous refiners. Pipelines and marine vessels are also used to effectively move refined products from refineries to customers and end markets.


• | Storage. The hydrocarbon market is often volatile and the ability to take advantage of fast moving market conditions is enhanced by our ability to store crude oil and other hydrocarbon-based products at our tank farms and butane cavern. Storage facilities provide flexibility and logistics optionality, which enhances MPC’s ability to maximize returns for refined products.

G&P:
The midstream natural gas industry is the link between the exploration for and production of natural gas and the delivery of its hydrocarbon components to end-use markets, and the components of this value chain are graphically depicted and further described below:

• | Gathering. The natural gas production process begins with the drilling of wells into gas-bearing rock formations. At the initial stages of the midstream value chain, a network of pipelines known as gathering systems directly connect to wellheads in the production area. These gathering systems transport raw, or untreated, natural gas to a central location for treating and processing. A large gathering system may involve thousands of miles of gathering lines connected to thousands of wells. Gathering systems are typically designed to be highly flexible to allow gathering of natural gas at different pressures and scalable to allow gathering of additional production without significant incremental capital expenditures.


◦ | Compression. Natural gas compression is a mechanical process in which a volume of natural gas at a given pressure is compressed to a desired higher pressure, which allows the natural gas to be gathered more efficiently and delivered into a higher pressure system, processing plant or pipeline. Field compression is typically used to allow a gathering system to operate at a lower pressure or provide sufficient discharge pressure to deliver natural gas into a higher pressure system. Since wells produce at progressively lower field pressures as they deplete, field compression is needed to maintain throughput across the gathering system.


◦ | Treating and dehydration. To the extent that gathered natural gas contains contaminants, such as water vapor, carbon dioxide and/or hydrogen sulfide, such natural gas is dehydrated to remove the saturated water and treated to separate the carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide from the gas stream.


• | Processing. Natural gas has a widely varying composition depending on the field, formation reservoir or facility from which it is produced. Processing removes the heavier and more valuable hydrocarbon components, which are extracted as a mixed NGL stream that includes ethane, propane, butanes and natural gasoline (also referred to

12

as “y-grade”). Processing aids in allowing the residue gas remaining after extraction of NGLs to meet the quality specifications for long-haul pipeline transportation and commercial use.

• | Fractionation. Fractionation is the separation of the mixture of extracted NGLs into individual components for end-use sale. It is accomplished by controlling the temperature and pressure of the stream of mixed NGLs in order to take advantage of the different boiling points and vapor pressures of separate products. Fractionation systems typically exist either as an integral part of a gas processing plant or as a central fractionator, often located many miles from the primary production and processing complex. A central fractionator may receive mixed streams of NGLs from many processing plants. A fractionator can fractionate one product or in a central fractionator, multiple products. We operate fractionation facilities at certain processing facilities that separate ethane from the remainder of the y-grade stream. We also operate central fractionation facilities that separate y-grade into propane, butanes and natural gasoline.


• | Storage, transportation and marketing. Once the raw natural gas has been treated or processed and the raw NGL mix has been fractionated into individual NGL components, the natural gas is delivered to downstream transmission pipelines and NGL components are stored, transported and marketed to end-use markets. We market NGLs domestically as well as for export to international markets. NGLs are transported via pipeline, railcar, including unit trains, and truck. Each pipeline system typically has storage capacity located both throughout the pipeline network and at major market centers to help temper seasonal demand and daily operational or supply-demand shifts. We have caverns for propane storage in the northeastern United States.

Historically, the majority of the domestic on-shore natural gas supply has been produced from conventional reservoirs that are characterized by large pockets of natural gas that are accessed using vertical drilling techniques. In the past decade, the supply of natural gas production from the conventional sources has declined as these reservoirs are being depleted. Due to advances in well completion technology and horizontal drilling techniques, unconventional sources, such as shale and tight sand formations, have become the most significant source of current and expected future natural gas production. The industry as a whole is characterized by regional competition, based on the proximity of gathering systems and processing/fractionation plants to producing natural gas wells, or to facilities that produce natural gas as a byproduct of refining crude oil. Due to the shift in the source of natural gas production, midstream providers with a significant presence in the shale plays will likely have a competitive advantage. Well-positioned operations allow access to all major NGL markets and provide for the development of export solutions for producers. This proximity is enhanced by infrastructure build-out and pipeline projects.
Basic NGL products and their typical uses are discussed below. The following basic NGL products are sold in our G&P segment.

• | Ethane is used primarily as feedstock in the production of ethylene, one of the basic building blocks for a wide range of plastics and other chemical products.


• | Propane is used for heating, engine and industrial fuels, agricultural burning and drying and as a petrochemical feedstock for the production of ethylene and propylene.


• | Normal butane is mainly used for gasoline blending, as a fuel gas, either alone or in a mixture with propane, and as a feedstock for the manufacture of ethylene and butadiene, a key ingredient of synthetic rubber.


• | Isobutane is primarily used by refiners to enhance the octane content of motor gasoline.


• | Natural gasoline is principally used as a motor gasoline blend stock or petrochemical feedstock.

The other primary products also produced and sold in our G&P segment are discussed below.

• | Ethylene is primarily used in the production of a wide range of plastics and other chemical products.


• | Propylene is primarily used in manufacturing plastics, synthetic fibers and foams. It is also used in the manufacture of polypropylene, which has a variety of end-uses including packaging film, carpet and upholstery fibers and plastic parts for appliances, automobiles, housewares and medical products.

OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS
We conduct our operations in the following operating segments: L&S and G&P. Our assets and operations in each of these segments are described below.
L&S:
The L&S segment includes transportation and storage of crude oil, refined products and other hydrocarbon-based products, primarily in the Midwest and Gulf Coast regions of the United States. These assets consist of a network of common carrier crude oil and refined product pipeline systems and associated storage assets and an inland marine business. We believe our network of petroleum pipelines is one of the largest in the United States, based on total annual volumes delivered. We also own a butane cavern in Neal, West Virginia with approximately 1,000 mbbls of liquefied petroleum gas storage capacity. Our marine business owns and operates boats, barges, and third-party chartered equipment and includes a Marine Repair Facility (“MRF”), which is a full service marine shipyard located on the Ohio River adjacent to MPC’s Catlettsburg, Kentucky refinery. We have completed the Cornerstone pipeline project, which is the building block for other projects that we expect to become a critical solution for the industry to move condensate and NGLs out of the Marcellus and Utica regions into refining centers in the Midwest and connect to the pipelines to Canada. We are also constructing a butane cavern in Robinson, Illinois, which will be a 1,400-mbbl hard rock mined storage cavern. Our L&S assets are integral to the success of MPC’s operations.
We generate revenue in the L&S segment primarily by charging tariffs for transporting crude oil, refined products and other hydrocarbon-based products through our pipelines and at our barge dock and fees for storing crude oil and refined products at our storage facilities. Our marine business generates revenue under a fee-for-capacity contract with MPC. We are also the operator of additional crude oil and refined product pipelines owned by MPC and third parties for which we are paid operating fees. For the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately 92 percent of L&S segment revenue and other income was generated from MPC. In this segment, we do not take ownership of the crude oil or products that we transport and store for our customers, and we do not engage in the trading of any commodities. However, we could be required to purchase or sell crude oil volumes in the open market to make up negative or positive imbalances.
The following is a summary of the significant assets owned by the L&S segment:

G&P:
Natural Gas Gathering 
We operate several natural gas gathering systems that have a combined 5,439 mmcf/d throughput capacity in six states. The scope of gathering services that we provide depends on the composition of the raw, or untreated, gas at our producer customers’ wellheads. For dry gas, we gather and, if necessary, treat the gas and deliver it to downstream transmission systems. For wet gas that contains heavier and more valuable hydrocarbons, we gather the gas for processing at a processing complex. The capacities of these gathering systems are supported by long-term fee-based agreements with major producer customers.
Natural Gas Processing
Our natural gas processing complexes remove the heavier and more valuable hydrocarbon components from natural gas. This allows the residue gas remaining after extraction of the NGLs to meet the quality specifications for long-haul transmission pipeline transportation or commercial use.
We currently operate five complexes in the Marcellus Shale, including: processing, gathering, and C2+ fractionation at the Houston Complex located in Washington County, Pennsylvania (the “Houston Complex”); processing and de-ethanization at the Majorsville Complex located in Marshall County, West Virginia (the “Majorsville Complex”); processing and de-ethanization at the Mobley Complex located in Wetzel County, West Virginia (the “Mobley Complex”); processing and de-ethanization at the Sherwood Complex located in Doddridge County, West Virginia (the “Sherwood Complex”); and processing, gathering, and C2+ fractionation at the Keystone Complex located in Butler County, Pennsylvania (the “Keystone Complex”). Further, we operate one condensate stabilization facility with two mbpd of capacity near the Houston Complex.
MarkWest Utica EMG, our joint venture with an affiliate of EMG, operates two complexes in the Utica Shale, including: processing and de-ethanization at the Cadiz Complex in Harrison County, Ohio (the “Cadiz Complex”) and processing at the Seneca Complex in Noble County, Ohio (the “Seneca Complex”). We also operate a C3+ fractionation complex at the 
15

Hopedale Complex located in Harrison County, Ohio (the “Hopedale Complex”). Ohio Condensate, our joint venture with Summit, operates one condensate stabilization facility with 23 mbpd of capacity.
We operate four processing complexes in the Appalachia region, including: the Kenova Complex located in Wayne County, West Virginia (the “Kenova Complex”); the Boldman Complex located in Pike County, Kentucky (the “Boldman Complex”); the Cobb Complex located in Kanawha County, West Virginia (the “Cobb Complex”); and the Langley Complex located in Langley, Kentucky (the “Langley Complex”). Further, we operate a C3+ fractionation complex at the Siloam Complex in South Shore, Kentucky (the “Siloam Complex”).
We also operate four complexes in the Southwest region, including: processing and gathering at the Carthage Complex located in Panola County, Texas (the “Carthage Complex”); processing and gathering at the Western Oklahoma Complex located in Custer and Beckham Counties, Oklahoma (the “Western Oklahoma Complex”); processing at the Hidalgo Complex located in Culberson County, Texas (the “Hidalgo Complex”); and treating, processing and C2+ fractionation at the Javelina Complex located in Corpus Christi, Texas (the “Javelina Complex”). We also own a non-operating interest in the Centrahoma processing complex.
The following table summarizes our current and planned processing assets:

(1) | We do not provide gathering services for these producer customers.


(2) | In the fourth quarter of 2016, Chesapeake executed a purchase and sale agreement to sell the majority of its upstream and midstream assets in the Devonian Shale located in West Virginia and Kentucky. The new owner continues to utilize our processing facilities in the Southern Appalachian Operations.

NGL Gathering
Once natural gas has been processed at a natural gas processing complex, the heavier and more valuable hydrocarbon components, which have been extracted as a mixed NGL stream, can be further separated into their component parts through the process of fractionation. We operate several NGL gathering pipelines for these mixed NGL streams that have a combined 818 mbpd throughput capacity in five states.
C3+ NGL Fractionation Complexes
Our NGL fractionation facilities separate the mixture of extracted NGLs into individual purity product components for end-use sale. All NGLs, other than purity ethane as discussed below, produced at our Majorsville Complex, Mobley Complex and Sherwood Complex are gathered to the Houston Complex or to the Hopedale Complex through a system of NGL pipelines to allow for fractionation into purity NGL products. We can also gather NGLs produced at a third-party’s processing facilities to the Houston, Hopedale and Keystone Complexes for fractionation.
Our fractionation facilities for propane and heavier NGLs are supported by long-term, fee-based agreements with our key producer customers. The following tables summarize our current and planned fractionation assets at these facilities:

Facility | Existing propane and heavier NGLs + capacity (mbpd) | Market outlets | | Geographic Region
Keystone Complex | 47 | | Railcar and truck loading | | Marcellus Operations 
Hopedale Complex(1) | 180 | | Key interstate pipeline accessRailcar and truck loadingMarine vessels | | Marcellus and Utica Operations

Total | 322 | | | | 


(1) | The Hopedale Complex is jointly owned by MarkWest Ohio Fractionation Company, L.L.C. (“Ohio Fractionation”) and MarkWest Utica EMG. Ohio Fractionation is a subsidiary of MarkWest Liberty Midstream & Resources, L.L.C (“MarkWest Liberty Midstream”). MarkWest Liberty Midstream and MarkWest Utica EMG are entities that operate in the

17

Marcellus and Utica regions, respectively. We account for MarkWest Utica EMG as an equity method investment. See discussion in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 5.
Ethane Recovery, Transportation and Associated Market Outlets
As a result of the volume of natural gas production from the liquids-rich areas of the Marcellus and Utica Shales, we have begun recovering ethane from the natural gas stream for producer customers, which allows them to meet residue gas pipeline quality specifications and downstream pipeline commitments. Depending on market conditions, producer customers may also benefit from the potential price uplift received from the sale of their ethane. The following table summarizes our current and planned de-ethanization assets, which are, or are expected to be, supported by a network of purity ethane pipelines:

Facility | Existing ethane capacity (mbpd) | Ethane expansion capacity under construction (mbpd) | | Expected in-service of expansion capacity | Geographic Region
Keystone Complex | 14 | | 20 | | Q3 2017 | Marcellus Operations
Harmon Creek Complex | — | | 20 | | 2018 | Marcellus Operations

Javelina Complex | 18 | | — | | N/A | Southwest Operations
Total | 202 | | 80 | | | 

We have connections to several downstream ethane pipeline projects from many of our systems as follows:

• | We transport purity ethane produced at the Majorsville Complex and the Sherwood Complex to the Houston Complex on a FERC pipeline. Beginning in April 2016, purity ethane produced at the Mobley Complex began being transported on this same FERC pipeline to the Houston Complex.


• | We deliver purity ethane to Sunoco Logistics Partners L.P.’s (“Sunoco”) Mariner West pipeline (“Mariner West”) from the Houston Complex and from the Keystone Complex.


• | We deliver purity ethane to Enterprise Products Partners L.P.’s Appalachia-to-Texas Express (“ATEX”) pipeline from the Houston Complex and the Cadiz Complex.


• | Sunoco developed the Mariner East project (“Mariner East”), a pipeline and marine project that originates at our Houston Complex. Beginning in December 2014, Mariner East began transporting propane to Sunoco’s terminal near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (“Marcus Hook Facility”) where it is loaded onto marine vessels and delivered to international markets. Beginning in May 2016, Mariner East began transporting purity ethane in addition to propane to the Marcus Hook Facility.


• | Sunoco has announced phase two of Mariner East (“Mariner East II”) with plans to construct a pipeline from our Houston and Hopedale Complexes in western Pennsylvania and eastern Ohio, respectively, to transport propane and butane to the Marcus Hook Facility where it will be loaded onto marine vessels and delivered to domestic and international markets. The Mariner East II pipeline is expected to be operational in late 2017.

A significant portion of our business comes from a limited number of key customers. For the year ended December 31, 2016, revenues earned from one customer are significant to the segment, accounting for 17 percent of G&P segment revenue and 12 percent of consolidated revenue and other income. Additionally, revenues earned from a second customer are significant to the segment, accounting for 15 percent of G&P segment revenue and 10 percent of consolidated revenue and other income.

OUR TRANSPORTATION AND STORAGE SERVICES AGREEMENTS WITH MPC
Our L&S assets are strategically located within, and integral to, MPC’s operations. We have entered into multiple transportation and storage services agreements with MPC. Under these long-term, fee-based agreements, we provide transportation and storage services to MPC and, other than on our marine transportation service agreement, MPC has committed to provide us with minimum quarterly throughput volumes on crude oil and refined products pipelines systems and minimum storage volumes of crude oil, products and butane. MPC has also committed to provide a fixed fee for 100 percent of available capacity for boats, barges and third-party chartered equipment under the marine transportation service agreement. All of our transportation services agreements for our crude oil and refined products pipeline systems include a 5-15 year term with various automatic renewal terms ranging from multiple 2-5 year terms unless terminated by either party no later than six months prior to the end of the term. Our butane cavern storage services agreement includes a 10-year term but does not automatically renew. Our storage services agreements for our tank farms include a three-year term and automatically renew for additional one-year terms unless terminated by either party no later than six months prior to the end of the term. Our marine transportation service agreement includes an initial six-year term and automatically renews up to two additional five-year terms unless terminated by either party no later than twelve months prior to the end of the current term.
The following table sets forth additional information regarding our transportation and storage services agreements:

(2) | MPC has committed to utilize 100 percent of our available capacity of tanks and barges.

Under all of our transportation services agreements, except for our marine agreement, if MPC fails to transport its minimum throughput volumes during any quarter, then MPC will pay us a deficiency payment equal to the volume of the deficiency multiplied by the tariff rate then in effect (the “Quarterly Deficiency Payment”). Under these transportation services agreements, the amount of any Quarterly Deficiency Payment paid by MPC may be applied as a credit for any volumes transported on the applicable pipeline system in excess of MPC’s minimum volume commitment during any of the succeeding four or eight quarters, after which time any unused credits will expire. Upon the expiration or termination of a transportation services agreement, MPC will have the opportunity to apply any such remaining credit amounts until the completion of any such four-quarter or eight-quarter period, as applicable. Any such remaining credits may be used against any volumes shipped by MPC on the applicable pipeline system, without regard to any minimum volume commitment that may have been in place during the term of the agreement.
19

MPC’s obligations under these transportation and storage services agreements will not terminate if MPC no longer controls our general partner.
OPERATING AND MANAGEMENT SERVICES AGREEMENTS WITH MPC AND THIRD PARTIES 
Operating Agreements
Through MPL, we operate various pipeline systems owned by MPC and third parties under existing operating services agreements that MPL has entered into with MPC and third parties. Under these operating services agreements, MPL receives an operating fee for operating the assets, which include certain MPC wholly-owned or partially-owned crude oil and refined product pipelines, and for providing various operational services with respect to those assets. MPL is generally reimbursed for all direct and indirect costs associated with operating the assets and providing such operational services. These agreements generally range from one to five years in length and automatically renew. Most of the agreements are indexed for inflation.
As noted above, MPL receives an annual fee for operating certain pipeline systems owned by MPC. This fee is currently $16 million and will be adjusted annually for inflation. MPC has agreed to indemnify MPL against any and all damages arising out of the operation of MPC’s pipeline systems unless such occurrence is due to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of MPL. MPL has agreed to indemnify MPC against any and all damages arising out of MPL’s gross negligence or willful misconduct in the operation of the pipeline systems. The initial term of this agreement was for one year and automatically renews from year-to-year unless terminated by either party.
Our existing operating services agreements include an operating agreement with Red Butte Pipe Line Company, which is owned by a third party. Under this agreement, MPL receives an operating fee for operating certain pipelines in Wyoming and Montana. The term of this agreement is through December 2018.
MPL maintains and operates four undivided joint interest pipeline systems including Capline, Centennial, Lou-Lex and Muskegon. MPL receives an operating fee for each of these systems, which is subject to adjustment for inflation. In addition, we are reimbursed for specific costs associated with operating each pipeline system. The length and renewals terms for each agreement vary.
Management Services Agreements
The Partnership has two management services agreements with wholly-owned subsidiaries of MPC under which it provides certain management services to MPC with respect to certain of MPC’s retained pipeline assets. The Partnership received $1 million in fees under these agreements in 2016. The Partnership may adjust annually for inflation and based on changes in the scope of management services provided.
The Partnership also receives engineering and construction and administrative management fee revenue and other direct personnel costs for operating some joint venture entities.
The Partnership, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, HSM, has a management services agreement with MPC under which HSM provides management services to assist MPC in the oversight and management of the marine business. HSM receives a fixed annual fee for providing the required management services. This fee is adjusted annually on the anniversary of the contract for inflation and any changes in the scope of the management services provided. The Partnership received $21 million in fees under this agreement in 2016. This agreement expires on June 30, 2020. 
OTHER AGREEMENTS WITH MPC
We have the following additional agreements with MPC:

• | Omnibus Agreement. As of October 31, 2012, we entered into an omnibus agreement with MPC that addresses our payment of a fixed annual fee to MPC for the provision of executive management services by certain executive officers of our general partner and our reimbursement to MPC for the provision of certain general and administrative services to us, as well as MPC’s indemnification of us for certain matters, including certain environmental, title and tax matters. In addition, we will indemnify MPC for certain matters under this agreement.


• | Employee Services Agreements. We have four employee services agreements with MPC. Two of the employee services agreements with MPC were entered into effective October 1, 2012, under which we agreed to reimburse MPC for the provision of certain operational and management services to us in support of our pipelines, barge dock, butane cavern

20

and tank farms within the L&S segment. Effective December 28, 2015, we entered into an additional employee services agreement with MPC, which requires that we reimburse MPC for certain operational and management services to us in support of our G&P segment and certain of our other operations. Lastly, we are party to an employee services agreement dated January 1, 2015, pursuant to which HSM reimburses MPC for employee benefit expenses along with certain operation and management services provided in support of HSM’s areas of operation. The agreement is effective until December 31, 2019. Prior to January 1, 2015, this agreement did not exist.
OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH MPC
One of our competitive strengths is our strategic relationship with MPC, which we believe to be the largest crude oil refiner in the Midwest and the third-largest in the United States based on crude oil refining capacity. MPC owns and operates seven refineries and associated midstream transportation and logistics assets in PADD II and PADD III, which consist of states in the Midwest and Gulf Coast regions of the United States, along with an extensive wholesale and retail refined product marketing operation that serves markets primarily in the Midwest, Gulf Coast and Southeast regions of the United States. MPC markets refined products under the Marathon brand through an extensive network of retail locations owned by independent entrepreneurs, and under the Speedway brand through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Speedway LLC, which operates what we believe to be the nation’s second largest chain of company-owned and operated retail gasoline and convenience stores. In addition, MPC sells refined products in the wholesale markets. MPC had consolidated revenues of approximately $63 billion in 2016. Marathon Petroleum Corporation’s common stock trades on the NYSE under the symbol “MPC.”
MPC’s operations necessitate large-scale movements of crude oil and feedstocks to and among its refineries, as well as large-scale movements of refined products from its refineries to various markets. To this end, MPC has an extensive portfolio of midstream assets that can potentially be sold and/or contributed to us, providing us with a competitive advantage. As of December 31, 2016, these midstream assets included investments in crude oil and refined product pipelines, an ocean vessel joint venture, light product and asphalt terminals, a fuels distribution business and certain refinery assets.
MPC retains a significant interest in us through its ownership of our general partner, an approximate 23.5 percent limited partner interest (including the Class B units on an as-converted basis) in us and all of our incentive distribution rights as of February 13, 2017. We believe MPC will promote and support the successful execution of our business strategies given its significant interest in us and its stated intention to use us to grow its midstream business. This includes an expectation for MPC to offer us assets contributing an estimated $1.4 billion of annual EBITDA by the end of 2017, subject to market and other conditions. The transactions are expected to support increased limited and general partner distributions and provide value creation for investors. 
We also may pursue acquisitions cooperatively with MPC which has the balance sheet flexibility and the ability to incubate projects for us to purchase later. However, MPC is under no obligation to offer to sell us additional assets or to pursue acquisitions cooperatively with us, and we are under no obligation to buy any such additional assets or pursue any such cooperative acquisitions.
OUR G&P CONTRACTS WITH THIRD PARTIES
We generate the majority of our revenues in the G&P segment from natural gas gathering, transportation and processing; NGL gathering, transportation, fractionation, marketing and storage; and crude oil gathering and transportation. We enter into a variety of contract types. In many cases, we provide services under contracts that contain a combination of more than one of the arrangements described below. We provide services under the following types of arrangements:

• | Fee-based arrangements – Under fee-based arrangements, we receive a fee or fees for one or more of the following services: transportation and storage of crude oil; gathering, processing and transmission of natural gas; gathering, transportation, fractionation and storage of NGLs; and gathering and transportation of crude oil. The revenue we earn from these arrangements is generally directly related to the volume of natural gas, NGLs or crude oil that flows through our systems and facilities and is not normally directly dependent on commodity prices. In certain cases, our arrangements provide for minimum annual payments or fixed demand charges. Fee-based arrangements are reported as Service revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Income. In certain instances when specifically stated in the contract terms, we purchase product after fee-based services have been provided. Costs to purchase such products are reported as Purchased product costs and revenue from the sale of such products is reported as Product sales and recognized on a gross basis as we are the principal in the transaction.


• | Percent-of-proceeds arrangements – Under percent-of-proceeds arrangements, we gather and process natural gas on behalf of producers, sell the resulting residue gas, condensate and NGLs at market prices and remit to

21

producers an agreed-upon percentage of the proceeds. In other cases, instead of remitting cash payments to the producer, we deliver an agreed-upon percentage of the residue gas and NGLs to the producer (take-in-kind arrangements) and sell the volumes we retain to third parties. Revenue from these arrangements is reported on a gross basis where we act as the principal, as we have physical inventory risk and do not earn a fixed dollar amount. The agreed-upon percentage paid to the producer is reported as Purchased product costs on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Revenue is recognized on a net basis when we act as an agent and earn a fixed dollar amount of physical product and do not have risk of loss of the gross amount of gas and/or NGLs. Percent-of-proceeds revenue is reported as Product sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

• | Keep-whole arrangements – Under keep-whole arrangements, we gather natural gas from the producer, process the natural gas and sell the resulting condensate and NGLs to third parties at market prices. Because the extraction of the condensate and NGLs from the natural gas during processing reduces the Btu content of the natural gas, we must either purchase natural gas at market prices for return to producers or make cash payment to the producers equal to the energy content of this natural gas. Certain keep-whole arrangements also have provisions that require us to share a percentage of the keep-whole profits with the producers based on the oil to gas ratio or the NGL to gas ratio. Sales of NGLs under these arrangements are reported as Product sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income and are reported on a gross basis as we are the principal in the arrangement. Natural gas purchased to return to the producer and shared NGL profits are recorded as Purchased product costs in the Consolidated Statements of Income.


• | Percent-of-index arrangements – Under percent-of-index arrangements, we purchase natural gas at either (1) a percentage discount to a specified index price, (2) a specified index price less a fixed amount or (3) a percentage discount to a specified index price less an additional fixed amount. We then gather and deliver the natural gas to pipelines where we resell the natural gas at the index price or at a different percentage discount to the index price. Revenue generated from percent-of-index arrangements are reported as Product sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income and are recognized on a gross basis as we purchase and take title to the product prior to sale and are the principal in the transaction.

In many cases, we provide services under contracts that contain a combination of more than one of the arrangements described above. When fees are charged (in addition to product received) under keep-whole arrangements, percent-of-proceeds arrangements or percent-of-index arrangements, we record such fees as Service revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Income. When commodities are obtained as a result of providing our services, Product sales is recorded at the time the commodity is sold. The terms of our contracts vary based on gas quality conditions, the competitive environment when the contracts are signed and customer requirements.
Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling, including fuel costs, are included in Product sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income, except under contracts where we are acting as an agent. Shipping and handling costs associated with product sales are included in Purchased product costs on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Taxes collected from customers and remitted to the appropriate taxing authority are excluded from revenue. Cost of revenues and depreciation represent those expenses related to operating our various facilities and are necessary to provide both Product sales and Service revenue. Reimbursements for third-party charges, such as electricity, are recorded net in Cost of revenues.
The terms of our contracts vary based on gas quality conditions, the competitive environment when the contracts are signed and customer requirements. Our contract mix and, accordingly, our exposure to natural gas and NGL prices may change as a result of changes in producer preferences, our expansion in regions where some types of contracts are more common and other market factors, including current market and financial conditions which have increased the risk of volatility in oil, natural gas and NGL prices. Any change in mix may influence our long-term financial results.

The following table does not give effect to our active commodity risk management program. For further discussion of how we manage commodity price volatility for the portion of our net operating margin that is not fee-based, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 16. We manage our business by taking into account the partial offset of short natural gas positions primarily in the Southwest region of our G&P segment. The calculated percentages for net operating margin for percent-of-proceeds, percent-of-index and keep-whole contracts reflect the partial offset of our natural gas positions. The calculated percentages are less than one percent for percent-of-index due to the offset of our natural gas positions and, therefore, not meaningful to the table below. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we calculated the following approximate percentages of our net operating margin from the following types of contracts:

 | Fee-Based | | Percent-of-Proceeds(1) | | Keep-Whole(2)
L&S(3) | 100 | % | | — | % | — | %
G&P(3)(4) | 90 | % | | 9 | % | 1 | %
Total | 93 | % | | 6 | % | 1 | %


(1) | Includes condensate sales and other types of arrangements tied to NGL prices.


(2) | Includes condensate sales and other types of arrangements tied to both NGL and natural gas prices.


(3) | Detail on contract types above.


(4) | Includes unconsolidated affiliates (See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 5).

COMPETITION
Within our L&S segment, as a result of our contractual relationship with MPC under our transportation and storage services agreements, and our connections to MPC’s refineries, we believe that our crude oil and refined product pipelines will not face significant competition for MPC’s crude oil or products transportation requirements.
If MPC’s customers reduced their purchases of products from MPC due to the increased availability of less expensive products from other suppliers or for other reasons, MPC may only ship the minimum volumes through our pipelines (or pay the shortfall payment if it does not ship the minimum volumes), which would cause a decrease in our revenues. MPC competes with integrated petroleum companies, which have their own crude oil supplies and distribution and marketing systems, as well as with independent refiners, many of which also have their own distribution and marketing systems. MPC also competes with other suppliers that purchase refined products for resale. Competition in any particular geographic area is affected significantly by the volume of products produced by refineries in that area and by the availability of products and the cost of transportation to that area from distant refineries.
In our G&P segment, we face competition for natural gas gathering and in obtaining natural gas supplies for our processing and related services; in obtaining unprocessed NGLs for gathering and fractionation; and in marketing our products and services. Competition for natural gas supplies is based primarily on the location of gas gathering systems and gas processing plants, operating efficiency and reliability and the ability to obtain a satisfactory price for products recovered. Competitive factors affecting our fractionation services include availability of capacity, proximity to supply and industry marketing centers and cost efficiency and reliability of service. Competition for customers to purchase our natural gas and NGLs is based primarily on price, delivery capabilities, flexibility and maintenance of high-quality customer relationships.
Our competitors include:

• | natural gas midstream providers, of varying financial resources and experience, that gather, transport, process, fractionate, store and market natural gas and NGLs;


• | major integrated oil companies and refineries;


• | medium and large sized independent exploration and production companies;


• | major interstate and intrastate pipelines; and


• | other marine and land-based transporters of natural gas and NGLs.

Some of our competitors operate as MLPs and may enjoy a cost of capital comparable to and, in some cases, lower than ours. Other competitors, such as major oil and gas and pipeline companies, have capital resources and contracted supplies of natural gas substantially greater than ours. Smaller local distributors may enjoy a marketing advantage in their immediate service areas. 
23

We believe that our customer focus, demonstrated by our ability to offer an integrated package of services and our flexibility in considering various types of contractual arrangements, allows us to compete more effectively. Additionally, we believe we have critical connections to a strong sponsor and the key market outlets for NGLs and natural gas. In the Marcellus and Utica regions, our early entrance in the liquids-rich corridors of the Marcellus and Utica shale plays through our strategic gathering and processing agreements with key producers enhances our competitive position to participate in the further development of these resource plays. In the Southern Appalachia region, our operational experience of more than 20 years as the largest processor and fractionator and our existing presence in the Appalachian Basin provide a significant competitive advantage. In the Southwest region, our major gathering systems are less than 15 years old, located primarily in the heart of shale plays with significant long-term growth opportunities and provide producers with low-pressure and fuel-efficient service, which differentiates us from many competing gathering systems in those areas. The strategic location of our assets, including those connected to MPC, and the long-term nature of many of our contracts also provide a significant competitive advantage.
INSURANCE
Our assets may experience physical damage as a result of an accident or natural disaster. These hazards can also cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage and business interruption. We are insured under MPC and other third-party insurance policies. The MPC policies are subject to shared deductibles.
SEASONALITY
The volume of crude oil and refined products transported on our pipeline systems, at our barge dock and stored at our storage assets is directly affected by the level of supply and demand for crude oil and refined products in the markets served directly or indirectly by our assets. Many effects of seasonality on the L&S segment’s revenues will be mitigated through the use of our fee-based transportation and storage services agreements with MPC that include minimum volume commitments.
Our G&P segment can be affected by seasonal fluctuations in the demand for natural gas and NGLs and the related fluctuations in commodity prices caused by various factors such as changes in transportation and travel patterns and variations in weather patterns from year to year. However, we manage the seasonality impact through the execution of our marketing strategy. We have access to up to 50 million gallons of propane storage capacity in the Southern Appalachia region provided by an arrangement with a third party which provides us with flexibility to manage the seasonality impact. Overall, our exposure to the seasonal fluctuations in the commodity markets is declining due to our growth in fee-based business.
REGULATORY MATTERS
Our operations are subject to extensive regulations. The failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or to obtain, maintain and comply with requisite permits and authorizations can result in substantial penalties and other costs to the Partnership. The regulatory burden on our operations increases our cost of doing business and, consequently, affects our profitability. However, we do not believe that we are affected in a significantly different manner by these laws and regulations than are our competitors. Due to the myriad of complex federal, state, provincial and local regulations that may affect us, directly or indirectly, reliance on the following discussion of certain laws and regulations should not be considered an exhaustive review of all regulatory considerations affecting our operations.
Pipeline Control Operations. The majority of our pipeline systems are operated from central control rooms. These control centers operate with a SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) system equipped with computer systems designed to continuously monitor operational data. Monitored data includes pressures, temperatures, gravities, flow rates and alarm conditions. These systems include real-time transient leak detection system monitors throughput and alarms if pre-established operating parameters are exceeded. These control centers operate remote pumps, motors and valves associated with the receipt and delivery of products, and provide for the remote-controlled shutdown of pump stations on the pipeline systems. These systems also include fully functional back-up operations maintained and routinely operated throughout the year to ensure safe and reliable operations.
Common Carrier Liquids Pipeline Operations. Certain of our liquids pipeline systems are common carriers subject to regulation by various federal, state and local agencies. FERC regulates interstate transportation on liquids pipeline systems under the Interstate Commerce Act (“ICA”), Energy Policy Act of 1992 (“EPAct 1992”) and the rules and regulations promulgated under those laws. The ICA and its implementing regulations require that tariff rates for interstate service on these pipelines, including interstate pipelines that transport crude oil, natural gas liquids (including purity ethane) and refined petroleum products (collectively referred to as “petroleum pipelines”), be just and reasonable and must not be unduly discriminatory or confer any undue preference upon any shipper. The ICA requires that interstate petroleum pipeline 
24

transportation rates and terms and conditions of service be filed with the governing agency, which is FERC, and publicly posted on the company’s website. Under the ICA, interested persons may challenge new or changed rates or services. FERC is authorized to investigate such charges and may suspend the effectiveness of a newly filed rate or service for up to seven months. A successful protest to a new rate or service could result in a petroleum pipeline paying refunds, together with interest, for the period that the rate or service was in effect. A successful complaint to an existing rate or service could result in a petroleum pipeline paying reparations, together with interest, for the period beginning two years prior to the date of the complaint until the just and reasonable rate or service was established. FERC may also investigate, upon complaint or on its own motion, existing rates and related rules and may order a pipeline to change them prospectively.
EPAct 1992 deemed certain interstate petroleum pipeline rates then in effect to be just and reasonable under the ICA. These rates are commonly referred to as “grandfathered rates.” Our rates in effect for the 365 day period ending on the date of the passage of EPAct 1992 for interstate transportation service were deemed just and reasonable and therefore are grandfathered. New rates have since been established after EPAct 1992 for certain pipeline systems, and the rates for certain of our products pipelines have subsequently been approved as market-based rates. FERC may change grandfathered rates upon complaint only after it is shown that a substantial change has occurred since enactment in either the economic circumstances or the nature of the services that were a basis for the rate.
EPAct 1992 required FERC to establish a simplified and generally applicable ratemaking methodology for interstate petroleum pipelines. As a result, FERC adopted an indexing rate methodology which, as currently in effect, allows petroleum pipelines to change their rates within prescribed ceiling levels that are tied to changes in the PPI. FERC’s indexing methodology is subject to review every five years. During the five-year period commencing July 1, 2011 and ending June 30, 2016, petroleum pipelines charging indexed rates are permitted to adjust their indexed ceilings annually by PPI plus 2.65 percent. During the five-year period commencing July 1, 2016, petroleum pipelines charging indexed rates are permitted to adjust their indexed ceilings annually by PPI plus 1.23 percent. The indexing methodology is applicable to existing rates, including grandfathered rates, with the exclusion of market-based rates and settlement rates (unless permitted under the settlement). A pipeline is not required to raise its rates up to the index ceiling, but it is permitted to do so and rate increases made under the index are presumed to be just and reasonable unless a protesting party can demonstrate that the portion of the rate increase resulting from application of the index is substantially in excess of the pipeline’s increase in costs. However, FERC is currently evaluating when and how indexed adjustments to rates can be challenged. Therefore, we cannot guarantee FERC will not make changes to its current policy regarding challenges in the future. Under the indexing rate methodology, in any year in which the index is negative, pipelines must file to lower their rates if those rates would otherwise be above the rate ceiling, unless the pipelines request and receive a waiver from FERC permitting them not to apply the negative index adjustment.
While petroleum pipelines often use the indexing methodology to change their rates, petroleum pipelines may elect to support proposed rates by using other methodologies such as cost-of-service ratemaking, market-based rates and settlement rates. A pipeline can follow a cost-of-service approach when seeking to increase its rates above the rate ceiling provided that the pipeline can establish that there is a substantial divergence between the actual costs experienced by the pipeline and the rate resulting from application of the index. A pipeline can charge market-based rates if it establishes that it lacks significant market power in the affected markets. In addition, a pipeline can establish rates under settlement if agreed upon by all current shippers. We have used index rates, settlement rates and market-based rates to change the rates for our different FERC regulated petroleum pipeline systems.
FERC issued a policy statement in May 2005 stating that it would permit interstate petroleum pipelines, among others, to include an income tax allowance in cost-of-service rates to reflect actual or potential tax liability attributable to a regulated entity’s operating income, regardless of the form of ownership. Under FERC’s policy, a tax pass-through entity seeking such an income tax allowance must establish that its partners or members have an actual or potential income tax liability on the regulated entity’s income. Whether a pipeline’s owners have such actual or potential income tax liability is subject to review by FERC on a case-by-case basis. Although this policy is generally favorable for pipelines that are organized as pass-through entities, it still entails rate risk due to the case-by-case review requirement. Finally, FERC’s income tax policy continues to be the subject of various appeals by shippers, before FERC and the courts. We cannot guarantee that FERC or the courts will not make changes to the policy in the future.
Intrastate services provided by certain of our liquids pipeline systems are subject to regulation by state regulatory authorities. Much of the state regulation is complaint-based, both as to rates and priority of access. The state regulators could limit our ability to increase our rates or to set rates based on our costs or could order us to reduce our rates and could require the payment of refunds to shippers.
FERC and state regulatory agencies generally have not investigated rates on their own initiative when those rates are not the subject of a protest or a complaint by a shipper. MPC has agreed not to contest our tariff rates for the term of our transportation 
25

and storage services agreements with MPC, but we do not have any these types of agreements with other third parties. FERC or a state commission could investigate our rates on its own initiative or at the urging of a third party if the third party is either a current shipper or is able to show that it has a substantial economic interest in our tariff rate level.
If our rate levels were investigated, the inquiry could result in a comparison of our rates to those charged by others or to an investigation of our costs, including:

• | the overall cost of service, including operating costs and overhead;


• | the allocation of overhead and other administrative and general expenses to the regulated entity;


• | the appropriate capital structure to be utilized in calculating rates;


• | the appropriate rate of return on equity and interest rates on debt;


• | the rate base, including the proper starting rate base;


• | the throughput underlying the rate; and


• | the proper allowance for federal and state income taxes.

If FERC or a state commission were to determine that our rates were or had become unjust and unreasonable, we could be ordered to reduce rates prospectively and pay refunds and/or reparations to shippers.
Because some of our pipelines are common carrier pipelines, we may be required to accept new shippers who wish to transport on our pipelines. It is possible that new shippers, current shippers or other interested parties may decide to challenge our tariff rates and/or the terms of service for our pipelines, including proration rules.
FERC-Regulated Natural Gas Pipelines. Our natural gas pipeline operations are subject to federal, state and local regulatory authorities. Specifically, we have FERC gas tariffs on file for MarkWest New Mexico, L.L.C. and MarkWest Pioneer with respect to our Hobbs Pipeline and the Arkoma Connector Pipeline. These pipelines are subject to regulation by FERC, and it is possible that we may have additional gas pipelines that may require such tariffs and may be subject to similar regulation in the future. FERC regulation of jurisdictional natural gas pipelines extends to various matters including:

• | rates and rate structures;


• | return on equity;


• | recovery of costs;


• | the services that our regulated assets are permitted to perform;


• | the acquisition, construction, expansion, operation and disposition of assets;


• | affiliate interactions; and


• | to an extent, the level of competition in that regulated industry.

Under the Natural Gas Act (“NGA”), FERC has authority to regulate natural gas companies that provide natural gas pipeline transportation services in interstate commerce. As noted in the list above, FERC’s authority to regulate those services includes the rates charged for the services, terms and conditions of service, certification and construction of new facilities, the extension or abandonment of services and facilities, the maintenance of accounts and records, the acquisition and disposition of facilities, the initiation and discontinuation of services and various other matters. Natural gas companies may not charge rates that have been determined to be unjust and unreasonable, or unduly discriminatory by FERC. In addition, FERC prohibits FERC-regulated natural gas companies from unduly preferring, or unduly discriminating against, any person with respect to pipeline rates or terms and conditions of service or other matters. The rates and terms and conditions for the Hobbs Pipeline and the Arkoma Connector Pipeline can be found in their respective FERC-approved tariffs. Pursuant to FERC’s jurisdiction, existing rates and/or other tariff provisions may be challenged (e.g., by complaint) and rate increases proposed by the pipeline or other tariff changes may be challenged (e.g., by protest). We also cannot be assured that FERC will continue to pursue its approach of pro-competitive policies as it considers matters such as pipeline rates and rules, rights of access, capacity and other issues that impact natural gas facilities. Any successful complaint or protest related to our facilities could have an adverse impact on our revenues.
As noted above (under “Common Carrier Liquids Pipeline Operations”), FERC is reviewing its policies with respect to the inclusion of income tax allowances in cost-of-service rates. A Notice of Inquiry into these issues was issued by FERC on 
26

December 15, 2016. The outcome of this inquiry could affect the rates that interstate natural gas pipelines are permitted to charge.
Energy Policy Act of 2005. On August 8, 2005, President Bush signed into law the Domenici-Barton Energy Policy Act of 2005 (“2005 EPAct”). Under the 2005 EPAct, FERC may impose civil penalties of up to $1 million per day for each current violation of the NGA. The 2005 EPAct also amends the NGA to add an anti-market manipulation provision, which makes it unlawful for any entity to engage in prohibited behavior in contravention of rules and regulations to be prescribed by FERC. FERC issued Order No. 670 to implement the anti-market manipulation provision of the 2005 EPAct. This order makes it unlawful for gas pipelines and storage companies that provide interstate services to: (i) directly or indirectly, use or employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of FERC; (ii) make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any such statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading; or (iii) engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person. The anti-market manipulation rule and enhanced civil penalty authority reflect an expansion of FERC’s enforcement authority.
Standards of Conduct. FERC has adopted affiliate standards of conduct applicable to interstate natural gas pipelines and certain other regulated entities, defined as “Transmission Providers.” Under these rules, a Transmission Provider becomes subject to the standards of conduct if it provides service to affiliates that engage in marketing functions (as defined in the standards). If a Transmission Provider is subject to the standards of conduct, the Transmission Provider’s transmission function employees (including the transmission function employees of any of its affiliates) must function independently from the Transmission Provider’s marketing function employees (including the marketing function employees of any of its affiliates). The Transmission Provider must also comply with certain posting and other requirements.
Market Transparency Rulemakings. In 2007, FERC issued Order 704, as amended and clarified in subsequent orders on rehearing, whereby wholesale buyers and sellers of more than 2.2 MMBtu of physical natural gas in the previous calendar year, including interstate and intrastate natural gas pipelines, natural gas gatherers, natural gas processors and natural gas marketers, are now required to report, on May 1 of each year, aggregate volumes of natural gas purchased or sold at wholesale in the prior calendar year to the extent such transactions utilize, contribute to or may contribute to the formation of price indices. It is the responsibility of the reporting entity to determine which transactions should be reported based on the guidance of Order 704.
Gas-Electric Coordination. In 2015, FERC issued Order 587-W and adopted new standards designed to improve coordination between the gas and electric industries. Among other things, the new standards revise the nomination timelines used by interstate natural gas pipelines. Interstate natural gas pipelines were required to implement the new standards in 2016. FERC continues to evaluate other measures to improve coordination between the gas and electric industries, and the adoption of any such measures may impact FERC’s regulation of jurisdictional natural gas pipelines.
Intrastate Natural Gas Pipeline Regulation. Some of our intrastate gas pipeline facilities are subject to various state laws and regulations that affect the rates we charge and terms of service. Although state regulation is typically less onerous than FERC, state regulation typically requires pipelines to charge just and reasonable rates and to provide service on a non-discriminatory basis. The rates and service of an intrastate pipeline generally are subject to challenge by complaint. Additionally, FERC has adopted certain regulations and reporting requirements applicable to intrastate natural gas pipelines (and Hinshaw natural gas pipelines) that provide certain interstate services subject to FERC’s jurisdiction. We could become subject to such regulations and reporting requirements in the future to the extent that any of our intrastate pipelines were to begin providing, or were found to provide, such interstate services.
Additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry periodically arise before Congress, FERC and the courts. We cannot predict the ultimate impact of these or the above regulatory changes to our natural gas operations. We do not believe that we would be affected by any such action materially differently than other midstream natural gas companies with whom we compete.
Natural Gas Gathering Pipeline Regulation. Section 1(b) of the NGA exempts natural gas gathering facilities from the jurisdiction of FERC if the primary function of the facilities is gathering natural gas. There is, however, no bright-line test for determining the jurisdictional status of pipeline facilities. We own a number of facilities that we believe establish the pipeline’s status as a gatherer not subject to FERC jurisdiction. The distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services is the subject of litigation from time to time, so we cannot provide assurance that FERC will not at some point assert that these facilities are within its jurisdiction or that such an assertion would not adversely affect our results of operations and revenues. In such a case, we would possibly be required to file a tariff with FERC, provide a cost justification for the transportation charge and obtain certificate(s) of public convenience and necessity for the FERC-regulated pipelines, and comply with additional FERC requirements.
27

In the states in which we operate, regulation of gathering facilities and intrastate pipeline facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, open access, non-discriminatory take requirement and complaint-based rate regulation. For example, some of our natural gas gathering facilities are subject to state ratable take and common purchaser statutes and regulations. Ratable take statutes and regulations generally require gatherers to take, without undue discrimination, natural gas production that may be tendered to the gatherer for handling. Similarly, common purchaser statutes and regulations generally require gatherers to purchase gas without undue discrimination as to source of supply or producer. These statutes are designed to prohibit discrimination in favor of one producer over another producer or one source of supply over another source of supply. Although state regulation is typically less onerous than at FERC, these statutes and regulations have the effect of restricting our right as an owner of gathering facilities to decide with whom we contract to purchase or gather natural gas.
Natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny at both the state and federal levels now that FERC has taken a less stringent approach to regulation of the gathering activities of interstate pipeline transmission companies and a number of such companies have transferred gathering facilities to unregulated affiliates. Our gathering operations could be adversely affected should they be subject in the future to the application of state or federal regulation of rates and services or regulated as a public utility. Our gathering operations also may be or become subject to safety and operational regulations and permitting requirements relating to the design, siting, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of gathering facilities. Additional rules and legislation pertaining to these matters are considered or adopted from time to time. We cannot predict what effect, if any, such changes might have on our operations, but the industry could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes.
Currently, PHMSA is evaluating possible changes to the scope and applicability of 49 C.F.R. Part 192, which governs construction standards and operation of natural gas gathering pipelines. The changes being considered include, but are not limited to, more stringent construction standards for remote facilities, as well as additional record-keeping requirements. Depending upon the nature of the final rule-making, those could have an impact upon MPLX LP operations.
Natural Gas Processing. Our natural gas processing operations are not presently subject to FERC or state rate regulation. There can be no assurance that our processing operations will continue to be exempt from FERC regulation in the future. In addition, although the processing facilities may not be directly related, other laws and regulations may affect the availability of natural gas for processing, such as state regulation of production rates and maximum daily production allowables from gas wells, which could impact our processing business.
NGL Pipelines. We have constructed various NGL product pipelines to transport NGL products, some of which are regulated by FERC, and we may elect to construct additional such pipelines in the future that may be subject to these same regulatory requirements. Pipelines providing transportation of NGLs in interstate commerce are subject to the same regulatory requirements as common carrier petroleum pipelines. See “Common Carrier Liquids Pipeline Operations” above. We have several NGL pipelines that carry NGLs owned by us between our processing and fractionation facilities that cross state lines. We do not have FERC tariffs on file for these pipelines because we believe they are not subject to FERC requirements or that they would otherwise meet the qualifications for a waiver from FERC’s filing and reporting requirements. We cannot, however, provide assurance that FERC will not, at some point, either at the request of other entities or on its own initiative, assert that some or all of these pipelines are subject to FERC requirements for interstate petroleum pipelines and not exempt from its filing and reporting requirements. We also cannot provide assurance that such an assertion would not adversely affect our results of operations. In the event FERC were to determine that these NGL pipelines are subject to FERC requirements for common carrier pipelines or otherwise would not qualify for a waiver from FERC’s applicable regulatory requirements, we would likely be required to file a tariff with FERC for the pipelines, provide a cost justification for their transportation rates, and provide service to all potential shippers without undue discrimination, and we may also be subject to fines, penalties or other sanctions. Our NGL pipelines are subject to safety regulation by the DOT under 49 C.F.R. Part 195 for operators of hazardous liquid pipelines. Currently, PHMSA is evaluating possible changes to the scope and applicability of 49 C.F.R. Part 195m, including, among other things, expansion of reporting obligations, additional inspection requirements, and expansion of the use of leak detection systems. Depending upon the nature of the final rule-making, those could have an impact upon MPLX LP operations. Our NGL pipelines and operations may also be or become subject to state public utility or related jurisdiction which could impose additional safety and operational regulations relating to the design, siting, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of NGL gathering facilities.
Propane Regulation. National Fire Protection Association Pamphlets No. 54 and No. 58, which establish rules and procedures governing the safe handling of propane or comparable regulations, have been adopted as the industry standard in all of the states in which we operate. In some states these laws are administered by state agencies and in others they are administered on a municipal level. With respect to the transportation of propane by truck, we are subject to regulations promulgated under the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Act. These regulations cover the transportation of hazardous materials and are administered by the 
28

DOT. We conduct ongoing training programs to help ensure that our operations are in compliance with applicable regulations. We maintain various permits that are necessary to operate our facilities, some of which may be material to our propane operations. We believe that the procedures currently in effect at all of our facilities for the handling, storage and distribution of propane are consistent with industry standards and are in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations.
Marine Transportation. Our marine transportation business is subject to regulation by the USCG, federal laws, including the Jones Act, state laws and certain international conventions, as well as numerous environmental regulations. The majority of our vessels are subject to inspection by the USCG and carry certificates of inspection. The crews employed aboard the vessels are licensed or certified by the USCG. We are required by various governmental agencies to obtain licenses, certificates and permits for our vessels.
Our marine transportation business competes principally in markets subject to the Jones Act, a federal cabotage law that restricts domestic marine transportation in the United States to vessels built and registered in the United States, and manned and owned by United States citizens. We presently meet all of the requirements of the Jones Act for our vessels. The loss of Jones Act status could have a significant negative effect on us. The requirements that our vessels be United States built and manned by United States citizens, the crewing requirements and material requirements of the USCG, and the application of United States labor and tax laws increases the cost of United States flag vessels when compared with comparable foreign flag vessels. Our marine transportation business could be adversely affected if the Jones Act were to be modified so as to permit foreign competition that is not subject to the same United States government imposed burdens. Since the events of September 11, 2001, the United States government has taken steps to increase security of United States ports, coastal waters and inland waterways. We believe that it is unlikely that the current cabotage provisions of the Jones Act would be modified or eliminated in the foreseeable future.
The Secretary of Homeland Security is vested with the authority and discretion to waive the Jones Act to such extent and upon such terms as the Secretary may prescribe whenever the Secretary deems that such action is necessary in the interest of national defense. In response to the effects of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the Secretary waived the Jones Act generally for the transportation of petroleum products from September 1 to September 19, 2005 and from September 26, 2005 to October 24, 2005. In June 2011, the Secretary waived the Jones Act for the transportation of petroleum released from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and in November 2012 waived the Jones Act for the transportation of refined petroleum products in the Northeast following Hurricane Sandy. Waivers of the Jones Act, whether in response to natural disasters or otherwise, could result in increased competition from foreign tank vessel operators, which could negatively impact our marine transportation business.
Pipeline Interconnections. One or more of our plants include pipeline interconnections to, or incidental gathering pipelines (also known as “stub lines”) that connect the plants to, interstate pipelines. These pipeline interconnections are an integral part of our facilities and are not currently being used, nor can they be used in the future, by any third party due to their origin points at our proprietary facilities. Therefore, we believe these pipeline interconnections are part of our plant facilities and are not subject to the jurisdiction of FERC. In the event that FERC were to determine that these pipeline interconnections were subject to its jurisdiction, we believe the pipelines would qualify for a waiver from most FERC reporting and filing requirements, including the obligation to file a FERC tariff. In the event that FERC were to determine that the pipeline interconnections did not qualify for such waivers, we would likely be required to file a tariff with FERC for the pipeline interconnections, provide a cost justification for their transportation rates and provide service to all potential shippers without undue discrimination. In such event, we may experience increased operating costs and reduced revenues.
Security. Certain of our facilities have been preliminarily classified as subject to the Department of Homeland Security Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards. In addition, we have several facilities that are subject to the United States Coast Guard’s Maritime Transportation Security Act, and a number of other facilities that are subject to the Transportation Security Administration’s Pipeline Security Guidelines and are designated as “Critical Facilities.” The Transportation Security Administration Security Guidelines are subject to change without formal regulatory proposal and review. We have an internal inspection program designed to monitor and ensure compliance with all of these requirements. We believe that we are in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the security of our facilities.
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION
General
Our processing and fractionation plants, storage facilities, pipelines and associated facilities are subject to multiple obligations and potential liabilities under a variety of federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental 
29

protection. Such environmental laws and regulations may affect many aspects of our present and future operations, including for example, requiring the acquisition of permits or other approvals to conduct regulated activities that may impose burdensome conditions or potentially cause delays, restricting the manner in which we handle or dispose of our wastes, limiting or prohibiting construction or other activities in environmentally sensitive areas such as wetlands or areas inhabited by endangered species, requiring us to incur capital costs to construct, maintain and/or upgrade processes, equipment and/or facilities, restricting the locations in which we may construct our compressor stations and other facilities and/or requiring the relocation of existing stations and facilities, and requiring remedial actions to mitigate any pollution that might be caused by our operations or attributable to former operations. Spills, releases or other incidents may occur in connection with our active operations or as a result of events outside of our reasonable control, which incidents may result in non-compliance with such laws and regulations. Any failure to comply with these legal requirements may expose us to the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial or corrective actions and the issuance of orders enjoining or limiting some or all of our operations.
We believe that our operations and facilities are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and the cost of continued compliance with such laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. We cannot assure, however, that existing environmental laws and regulations will not be reinterpreted or revised or that new environmental laws and regulations will not be adopted or become applicable to us. For instance, the EPA is currently taking a closer look at pipeline maintenance operations, and the result of this closer review may yield modified emission calculations and/or regulations relating to such activities. Generally speaking, the trend in environmental law is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may be perceived to adversely affect the environment, which may cause significant delays in obtaining permitting approvals for our facilities, result in the denial of our permitting applications, or cause us to become involved in time consuming and costly litigation. Thus, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for compliance with environmental laws and regulations, permits and permitting requirements or remedial actions pursuant to such laws and regulations, and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate. Revised or additional environmental requirements may result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from our customers, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. We may not be able to recover some or any of these costs from insurance. Such revised or additional environmental requirements may also result in substantially increased costs and material delays in the construction of new facilities or expansion of our existing facilities, which may materially impact our ability to meet our construction obligations with our producer customers.
Under the omnibus agreement, MPC has agreed to indemnify us for all known and certain unknown environmental liabilities that are associated with the ownership or operation of our assets that we acquired from MPC and due to occurrences on or before the closing of the Initial Offering. Indemnification for any unknown environmental liabilities will be limited to liabilities due to occurrences on or before the closing of the Initial Offering and identified prior to the fifth anniversary of the closing of the Initial Offering, and will be subject to an aggregate deductible of $500,000 before we are entitled to indemnification for losses incurred. Any other liabilities for which MPC has agreed to indemnify us are not subject to a deductible before we are entitled to indemnification. There is no limit on the amount for which MPC has agreed to indemnify us under the omnibus agreement once we meet the deductible, if applicable. Neither we nor our general partner have any contractual obligation to investigate or identify any such unknown environmental liabilities. We have agreed to indemnify MPC for events and conditions associated with the ownership or operation of our assets due to occurrences after the closing of the Initial Offering and for environmental liabilities associated with or arising from our ownership or operation of the assets on or after the closing of the Initial Offering, in each case, to the extent MPC is not required to indemnify us for such liabilities. Pipe Line Holdings has agreed to indemnify MPC for events and conditions associated with the operations of the Pipe Line Holdings assets that occur after the closing of the Initial Offering. Liabilities for which we and Pipe Line Holdings have agreed to indemnify MPC pursuant to the omnibus agreement are not subject to a deductible before MPC is entitled to indemnification. There is no limit on the amount for which we or Pipe Line Holdings has agreed to indemnify MPC under the omnibus agreement.
Hazardous Substances and Wastes
A comprehensive framework of environmental laws and regulations governs our operations as they relate to the possible release of hazardous substances or non-hazardous or hazardous wastes into soils, groundwater and surface water and measures taken to mitigate pollution into the environment. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended (“CERCLA”), also known as the “Superfund” law, as well as comparable state laws, impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include current and prior owners or operators of a site where a release occurred and companies that transported or disposed or arranged for the transport or disposal of the hazardous substances released from the site. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to strict joint and several liability for the costs of removing or remediating hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for restoration costs and 
30

damages to natural resources. Additionally, neighboring landowners and other third parties can file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment. While we generate materials in the course of our operations that may be regulated as hazardous substances under CERCLA or similar state statutes, we do not believe that we have any current material liability for cleanup costs under such laws or for third-party claims. We also may incur liability under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended (“RCRA”), and comparable or more stringent state statutes, which impose requirements relating to the handling and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous wastes. In the course of our operations, we generate some amount of ordinary industrial wastes, such as paint wastes, waste solvents and waste oils that may be regulated as hazardous wastes. While we are required to comply with RCRA requirements relating to hazardous wastes, currently our operations generate minimal quantities of such hazardous wastes. However, it is possible that some wastes generated by us that are currently classified as non-hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes, resulting in the wastes being subject to more rigorous and costly transportation, storage, treatment and disposal requirements.
We currently own or lease, and have in the past owned or leased, properties that have been used over the years for natural gas gathering, processing and transportation, for NGL fractionation or for the storage, gathering and transportation of crude oil. Although waste disposal practices within the NGL industry and other oil and natural gas related industries have been enhanced and improved over the years, it is possible that petroleum hydrocarbons and other non-hazardous or hazardous wastes may have been disposed of by prior owners or operators on or under these various properties owned or leased by us during the operating history of those facilities. These properties and wastes disposed thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under these laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes or property contamination, including groundwater contamination or to perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination. We do not believe that there presently exists significant surface and subsurface contamination of our properties by petroleum hydrocarbons or other wastes for which we are currently responsible.
Ongoing Remediation and Indemnification from Third Parties
The prior third-party owner or operator of our Cobb, Boldman, Kenova, Kermit and Majorsville facilities, has been, or is currently involved in, investigatory or remedial activities with respect to the real property underlying these facilities. These investigatory and remedial obligations arise out of a September 1994 “Administrative Order by Consent for Removal Actions” with EPA Regions II, III, IV and V; and with respect to the Boldman Complex, an “Agreed Order” entered into by the third-party owner/operator with the Kentucky Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Cabinet in October 1994. The third party or, in the case of the Kermit Complex, its successor in interest, has accepted sole liability and responsibility for, and indemnifies us against, any environmental liabilities associated with the EPA Administrative Order, the Kentucky Agreed Order or any other environmental condition related to the real property prior to the effective dates of our lease or purchase of the real property that are not contributed to by us. In addition, the third party, or in the case of the Kermit Complex, its successor in interest, has agreed to perform all the required response actions at its expense in a manner that minimizes interference with our use of the properties. We understand that to date, all actions required under these agreements have been or are being performed and, accordingly, we do not believe that the remediation obligation of these properties will have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.
The prior third-party owner and/or operator of certain facilities on the real property on which our rail facility is constructed near Houston, Pennsylvania has been, or is currently involved in, investigatory or remedial activities related to acid mine drainage (“AMD”) with respect to the real property underlying these facilities. These investigatory and remedial obligations arise out of an arrangement entered into between the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection and the third party, which has accepted liability and responsibility for, and indemnifies us against, any environmental liabilities associated with the AMD that are not exacerbated by us in connection with our operations. In addition, the third party has agreed to perform all of the required response actions at its expense in a manner that minimizes interference with our use of the property. We understand that to date, all actions required under these agreements have been or are being performed and, accordingly, we do not believe that the remediation obligation of these properties will have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.
We are also entitled to indemnification from MPC for assets we acquired from MPC in our Initial Offering, as further described above under “General”. In addition, from time to time, we have acquired, and we may acquire in the future, facilities from third parties that previously have been or currently are the subject of investigatory, remedial or monitoring activities relating to environmental matters. The terms of each acquisition will vary, and in some cases we may receive contractual indemnification from the prior owner or operator for some or all of the liabilities relating to such matters, and in other cases we may agree to accept some or all of such liabilities. We do not believe that the portion of any such liabilities that the Partnership may bear with respect to any such properties previously acquired by the Partnership will have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.

Water Discharges
Our operations can result in the discharge of pollutants, including crude oil and refined products. Regulations under the Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 (“Clean Water Act”), Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA-90”) and analogous state laws impose restrictions and controls on the discharge of pollutants into federal and state waters. Such discharges are prohibited, except in accord with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or the analogous state agency. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements under federal law and some state laws require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a hydrocarbon tank spill, oil overflow, rupture or leak. For example, the Clean Water Act requires us to maintain Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure (“SPCC”) plans at many of our facilities. We maintain numerous discharge permits for facilities and vessels as required under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program of the Clean Water Act and have implemented systems to oversee our compliance efforts. Any unpermitted release of pollutants, including oil, NGLs or condensates, could result in administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as significant remedial obligations. In addition, the Clean Water Act and analogous state law may also require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water from certain types of facilities, but these requirements are subject to several exemptions specifically related to oil and natural gas operations and facilities. The Clean Water Act also prohibits the discharge of dredge and fill material in regulated waters, including wetlands, unless authorized by a permit. We conduct regular review of the applicable laws and regulations, and maintain discussions with the various federal, state and local agencies with regard to the application of those laws and regulations to our facilities, including the permitting process and categories of applicable permits for storm water or other discharges, stream crossings and wetland disturbances that may be required for the construction or operation of certain of our facilities in the various states. In June 2015, the EPA and the United States Army Corps of Engineers finalized significant changes to the definition of the term “waters of the United States” (“WOTUS”) used in numerous programs under the Clean Water Act. This final rulemaking is referred to as the “Clean Water Rule.” The Clean Water Rule has been challenged in multiple federal courts by many states, trade groups, and other interested parties, and in October 2015, a United States Court of Appeals issued a nationwide stay of the Clean Water Rule. The Clean Water Rule, as written, expands permitting, planning and reporting obligations and may extend the timing to secure permits for pipeline and fixed asset construction and maintenance activities. The Clean Water Rule does contain new language intended to address concerns that the proposed rule included storm water conveyances and storage structures as WOTUS, and we continue to review how that new language will apply under specific circumstances. Court challenges of the Clean Water Rule will continue through 2017.
In addition, the transportation and storage of crude oil and refined products over and adjacent to water involves risk and subjects us to the provisions of OPA-90 and related state requirements. Among other requirements, OPA-90 requires the owner or operator of a tank vessel, a facility or a pipeline to maintain an emergency plan to respond to releases of oil or hazardous substances. Also, in case of any such release, OPA-90 requires the responsible company to pay resulting removal costs and damages. OPA-90 also provides for civil penalties and imposes criminal sanctions for violations of its provisions. We operate facilities at which releases of oil and hazardous substances could occur. We have implemented emergency oil response plans for all of our components and facilities covered by OPA-90 and we have established SPCC plans for facilities subject to Clean Water Act SPCC requirements.
Construction or maintenance of our plants, compressor stations, pipelines, barge dock and storage facilities may impact wetlands, which are also regulated under the Clean Water Act by the EPA, the United States Army Corps of Engineers and state water quality agencies. Regulatory requirements governing wetlands (including associated mitigation projects) may result in the delay of our projects while we obtain necessary permits and may increase the cost of new projects and maintenance activities. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws. However, there is no assurance that we will not incur material increases in our operating costs or delays in the construction or expansion of our facilities because of future developments, the implementation of new laws and regulations, the reinterpretation of existing laws and regulations, or otherwise, including, for example, increased construction activities, potential inadvertent releases arising from pursuing borings for pipelines, and earth slips due to heavy rain and/or other cause.
Hydraulic Fracturing
We do not conduct hydraulic fracturing operations, but we do provide gathering, processing and fractionation services with respect to natural gas and NGLs produced by our producer customers as a result of such operations. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, sand and additives under pressure into targeted subsurface formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. Hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions, but several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, the EPA has issued final Clean Air Act regulations governing performance standards, including standards 
32

for the capture of air emissions released during hydraulic fracturing, and issued in May 2014 its Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to solicit input on the possible Toxic Substances Control Act reporting of the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. Also, in March 2015, the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) published its final rule setting new standards for hydraulic fracturing on onshore federal and Indian lands. The final rules have been challenged and, in June 2016, the United States District Court for Wyoming set aside these BLM rules, holding that the BLM lacked the statutory authority to regulate the hydraulic fracturing process. In addition, Congress has from time to time considered legislation to provide for additional regulation of hydraulic fracturing, and some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, laws and/or regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure and well construction requirements on natural gas drilling activities or prohibit hydraulic fracturing altogether, similar to the State of New York. Local governments also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. In the event that new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to natural gas drilling activities or to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where our producer customers operate, those customers could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such hydraulic fracturing-related requirements and experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of production or development activities, which could reduce demand for our gathering, transportation and processing services and/or our NGL fractionation services.
In addition, certain governmental reviews are underway that focus on potential environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. The White House Council on Environmental Quality is coordinating an administration-wide review of hydraulic fracturing practices. Most notably, in December 2016, the EPA released its final assessment of the impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water. These studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing that could delay or curtail production of natural gas, and thus reduce demand for our midstream services.
Air Emissions
The Clean Air Act and comparable state laws restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources, including processing plants and compressor stations, and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. These laws and any implementing regulations may require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit requirements, utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions, or aggregate two or more of our facilities into one application for permitting purposes. We may be required to incur capital expenditures in the future for installation of air pollution control equipment and encounter construction or operational delays while applying for, or awaiting the review, processing and issuance of new or amended permits, and we may be required to modify certain of our operations which could increase our operating costs. For example, the EPA issued final regulations in October 2015 to revise the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ozone to 70 parts per billion, or ppb, for both the eight-hour primary and secondary standards protective of public health and public welfare. These standards, which are currently again under review, could require states to implement new more stringent regulations, which could apply to our operations and those of our producer customers. Compliance with these or other new regulations could, among other things, require installation of new emission controls on some of our equipment, result in longer permitting timelines, and significantly increase our capital expenditures and operating costs, which could adversely impact our business. Federal and state regulators and agencies are also currently taking a closer look at pipeline maintenance operations and any emissions and permits that may be related to such activities. The result of this closer review may yield modified emission calculations and/or regulations relating to such activities or potentially enforcement actions by the agencies for unaccounted for or unpermitted emissions. EPA has finalized revisions to regulations or interpretations of regulations regarding aggregation of facilities for permitting purposes and performance standards for methane emissions from new and modified oil and gas production and natural gas processing and transmission facilities, any of which could require additional capital expenditures, increase our operating costs or otherwise restrict our operations. Additionally, in 2015, EPA finalized regulations to revise existing refinery air emissions standards, which require additional controls, lower emission standards and require ambient air monitoring. These revised refinery standards affect MPC’s refineries from which we receive significant revenues. MPC has been required in the past, and will be required in the future, to incur significant capital expenditures to comply with new legislative and regulatory requirements relating to its operations. To the extent these capital expenditures have a material effect on MPC, they could have a material effect on our business and results of operations. We have been in discussions with various state agencies in the areas in which we operate with respect to their guidance, policies, rules and regulations regarding the permitting process, source determination, categories of applicable permits and control technology that may be required for the construction or operation of certain of our facilities. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable air permitting and control technology requirements.

Climate Change
As a consequence of an EPA administrative conclusion that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) into the ambient air endangers public health and welfare, the EPA adopted regulations establishing the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) construction and Title V operating permit programs for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources that already are potential major sources of certain principal, or criteria, pollutant emissions. In addition, the EPA is gathering information regarding existing facilities in various industries, including information collection requests (“ICRs”) issued in December 2016 to various oil and gas production and midstream facilities, which may be used to support potential future regulation of GHGs. Although the EPA’s PSD and Title V permit programs are limited to large stationary sources of criteria pollutant emissions, states may seek to adopt their own permitting programs under state laws that require permit reviews of large stationary sources emitting only GHGs. If we were to become subject to Title V and PSD permitting requirements due to non-GHG criteria pollutants, or if the EPA implemented more stringent permitting requirements relating to GHG emissions without regard to non-GHG criteria pollutants, or if states adopt their own permitting programs that require permit reviews based on GHG emissions, we may be required to install “best available control technology,” to the extent such technology is available, to limit emissions of GHGs from any new or significantly modified facilities that we may seek to construct in the future. In addition, we may experience substantial delays or possible curtailment of construction or projects in connection with applying for, obtaining or maintaining preconstruction and operating permits, we may encounter limitations on the design capacities or size of facilities, and we may incur material increases in our construction and operating costs. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas sources in the United States, including, among others, certain onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production and onshore oil and natural gas processing, fractionation, transmission, storage and distribution facilities, which includes certain of our operations. In addition, in 2015, the EPA issued rules expanding the petroleum and natural gas system sources for which annual GHG emissions reporting is required to include GHG emissions reporting beginning in the 2016 reporting year for certain onshore gathering and boosting systems consisting primarily of gathering pipelines, compressors and process equipment used to perform natural gas compression, dehydration and acid gas removal. We are monitoring GHG emissions from certain of our facilities in accordance with current GHG emissions reporting requirements in a manner that we believe is in substantial compliance with applicable reporting obligations. Additionally, in 2015 the EPA finalized rules to limit GHG emissions from new and existing power plants, although the United States Supreme Court issued a stay of these rules in February 2016 while the rules are under review by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The requirements could increase the cost of electricity and natural gas for our operations and ultimately states could impose additional GHG emission reduction requirements. In sum, requiring reductions in GHG emissions at our facilities could result in increased costs to (i) operate and maintain our facilities, (ii) install new emission controls at our facilities and (iii) administer and manage any GHG emissions programs, including acquiring emission credits or allotments. These requirements may also significantly affect MPC’s refinery operations and may have an indirect effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Also, Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, and while there has not been federal climate legislation adopted in the United States in recent years, it is possible that such legislation could be enacted in the future. In the absence of federal climate legislation in the United States, a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking and/or reducing GHG emissions by means of cap and trade programs that typically require major sources of GHG emissions, such as electric power plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those GHGs. If Congress were to undertake comprehensive tax reform in the coming year, it is possible that such reform may include a carbon tax, which could impose additional direct costs on operations and reduce demand for oil, natural gas, NGLs and products derived therefrom. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emission allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements including the imposition of a carbon tax. The EPA issued final rules in May 2016 aimed at minimizing fugitive emissions and establishing methane emission standards for new and modified oil and gas production and natural gas processing and transmission facilities as part of the Administration’s efforts to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by up to 45 percent from 2012 levels by 2025. This rule is currently being challenged in court by various affected states. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, oil and natural gas produced by our exploration and production customers that, in turn, could reduce the demand for our services and thus adversely affect our cash available for distribution to our unitholders.
Endangered Species Act and Migratory Bird Treaty Act Considerations
The federal Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) and analogous laws regulate activities that may affect endangered or threatened species, including their habitats. If endangered species are located in areas where we propose to construct new gathering or transportation pipelines or processing or fractionation facilities, such work could be prohibited or delayed in certain of those locations or during certain times, when our operations could result in a taking of the species. We also may be obligated to 
34

develop plans to avoid potential takings of protected species, the implementation of which could materially increase our operating and capital costs. Existing laws, regulations, policies and guidance relating to protected species may also be revised or reinterpreted in a manner that further increase our construction and mitigation costs or restricts our construction activities. Additionally, construction and operational activities could result in inadvertent impact to a listed species and could result in alleged takings under the ESA, exposing the Partnership to civil or criminal enforcement actions and fines or penalties. Moreover, as a result of a settlement approved by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in September 2011, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (“FWS”) is required to make a determination on listing numerous species as endangered or threatened under the ESA by completion of the agency’s 2017 fiscal year. For example, in April 2015, the FWS published a final rule listing the Northern Long Eared Bat as threatened under the ESA. In another example, in March 2014, the FWS announced the listing of the lesser prairie chicken as a threatened species under the ESA. In addition, in January 2017, FWS announced that it will list the rusty patched bumblebee as an endangered species effective in February 2017. All of these species, along with the other endangered species such as the Indiana Bat and American Burying Beetle, are in areas in which we operate. The listing of these or other species as threatened or endangered in areas where we conduct operations or plan to construct pipelines or facilities may cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in delays in, or prohibit, the construction of our facilities or limit our customer’s exploration and production activities, which could have an adverse impact on demand for our midstream operations.
The Migratory Bird Treaty Act implements various treaties and conventions between the United States and certain other nations for the protection of migratory birds. In accordance with this law, the taking, killing or possessing of migratory birds covered under this act is unlawful without a permit. If there is the potential to adversely affect migratory birds as a result of our operations or construction activities, we may be required to obtain necessary permits to conduct those operations or construction activities, which may result in specified operating or construction restrictions on a temporary, seasonal, or permanent basis in affected areas and thus have an adverse impact on our ability to provide timely gathering, processing or fractionation services to our exploration and production customers.
Pipeline Safety Matters
Our assets are subject to increasingly strict safety laws and regulations. The transportation and storage of natural gas and crude oil and refined products involve a risk that hazardous liquids may be released into the environment, potentially causing harm to the public or the environment. In turn, such incidents may result in substantial expenditures for response actions, significant government penalties, liability to government agencies for natural resources damages and significant business interruption. The DOT has adopted safety regulations with respect to the design, construction, operation, maintenance, inspection and management of our pipeline assets. These regulations contain requirements for the development and implementation of pipeline integrity management programs, which include the inspection and testing of pipelines and the correction of anomalies. These regulations also require that pipeline operation and maintenance personnel meet certain qualifications and that pipeline operators develop comprehensive spill response plans.
We are subject to regulation by the DOT under the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, also known as the HLPSA. The HLPSA delegated to the DOT the authority to develop, prescribe and enforce minimum federal safety standards for the transportation of hazardous liquids by pipeline. Congress also enacted the Pipeline Safety Act of 1992, also known as the PSA, which added the environment to the list of statutory factors that must be considered in establishing safety standards for hazardous liquid pipelines, required regulations be issued to define the term “gathering line” and establish safety standards for certain “regulated gathering lines,” and mandated that regulations be issued to establish criteria for operators to use in identifying and inspecting pipelines located in High Consequence Areas (“HCAs”), defined as those areas that are unusually sensitive to environmental damage, that cross a navigable waterway, or that have a high population density. In 1996, Congress enacted the Accountable Pipeline Safety and Partnership Act, also known as the APSPA, which limited the operator identification requirement mandate to pipelines that cross a waterway where a substantial likelihood of commercial navigation exists, required that certain areas where a pipeline rupture would likely cause permanent or long-term environmental damage be considered in determining whether an area is unusually sensitive to environmental damage, and mandated that regulations be issued for the qualification and testing of certain pipeline personnel. In the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement, and Safety Act of 2006, also known as the PIPES Act, Congress required mandatory inspections for certain U.S. crude oil and natural gas transmission pipelines in HCAs and mandated that regulations be issued for low-stress hazardous liquid pipelines and pipeline control room management. We are also subject to the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty and Job Creation Act of 2011, which reauthorized funding for federal pipeline safety programs through 2015, increased penalties for safety violations, established additional safety requirements for newly constructed pipelines and required studies of certain safety issues that could result in the adoption of new regulatory requirements for existing pipelines.
The DOT has delegated its authority under these statutes to the PHMSA, which administers compliance with these statutes and has promulgated comprehensive safety standards and regulations for the transportation of natural gas by pipeline (49 Code of 
35

Federal Regulations (“CFR”) Part 192), as well as hazardous liquids by pipeline (49 CFR Part 195), including regulations for the design and construction of new pipeline systems or those that have been relocated, replaced or otherwise changed (Subparts C and D of 49 CFR, Part 195); pressure testing of new pipelines (Subpart E of 49 CFR Part 195); operation and maintenance of pipeline systems, including inspecting and reburying pipelines in the Gulf of Mexico and its inlets, establishing programs for public awareness and damage prevention, managing the integrity of pipelines in HCAs and managing the operation of pipeline control rooms (Subpart F of 49 CFR Part 195); protecting steel pipelines from the adverse effects of internal and external corrosion (Subpart H of 49 CFR Part 195); and integrity management requirements for pipelines in HCAs (49 CFR 195.452). In addition, on October 18, 2010, PHMSA issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on a range of topics relating to the safety of natural gas, crude oil and other hazardous liquids pipelines. On October 13, 2015, PHMSA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking which purposes changes to 49 CFR Part 195, followed shortly by proposed changes to 49 CFR Part 192, and is currently evaluating recommendations regarding potential changes to both Parts 192 and 195. We do not anticipate that we would be impacted by these regulatory initiatives to any greater degree than other similarly situated competitors.
We monitor the structural integrity of our pipelines through a program of periodic internal assessments using high resolution internal inspection tools, as well as hydrostatic testing and direct assessment, that conforms to federal standards. We accompany these assessments with a review of the data and repair anomalies, as required, to ensure the integrity of the pipeline. We then utilize sophisticated risk algorithms and a comprehensive data integration effort to ensure that the highest risk pipelines receive the highest priority for scheduling subsequent integrity assessments. We use external coatings and impressed current cathodic protection systems to protect against external corrosion. We conduct all cathodic protection work in accordance with National Association of Corrosion Engineers standards. We continually monitor, test and record the effectiveness of these corrosion inhibiting systems.
Pipeline Permitting
Pipeline construction and expansion is subject to government permitting and involves numerous regulatory environmental, political and legal uncertainties, most of which are beyond our control. We believe our operations are in substantial compliance with our permits.
Facility Safety
At manned facilities, the workplaces associated with the processing and storage facilities and the pipelines we operate are also subject to oversight pursuant to the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended, (“OSHA”), as well as comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard-communication standard requires that we maintain information about hazardous materials used or produced in operations, and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. We believe that we have conducted our operations in substantial compliance with OSHA requirements, including general industry standards, record-keeping requirements and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances.
At unmanned facilities, the EPA’s Risk Management Planning requirements at regulated facilities are intended to protect the safety of the surrounding public. The application of these regulations, which are often unclear, can result in increased compliance expenditures.
In general, we expect industry and regulatory safety standards to become stricter over time, resulting in increased compliance expenditures. While these expenditures cannot be accurately estimated at this time, we do not expect such expenditures will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, PHMSA and one or more state regulators, including the Texas Railroad Commission, have recently sought to expand the scope of their regulatory inspections to include certain in-plant equipment and pipelines found within NGL fractionation facilities and associated storage facilities in order to assess compliance with hazardous liquids pipeline safety requirements. These recent actions by PHMSA are currently subject to judicial and administrative challenges by one or more midstream operators; however, to the extent that such challenges are unsuccessful, midstream operators of NGL fractionation facilities and associated storage facilities may be required to make operational changes or modifications at their facilities to meet standards beyond current requirements. These changes or modifications may result in additional capital costs, possible operational delays and increased costs of operation.
Product Quality Standards
Refined products and other hydrocarbon-based products that we transport are generally sold by us or our customers for consumption by the public. Various federal, state and local agencies have the authority to prescribe product quality

specifications for products. The EPA has established sulfur specifications for natural gasoline sold as certified ethanol denaturant effective January 1, 2017. The EPA has also proposed product quality specification for natural gasoline used for blendstock in ethanol flex fuel. Changes in product quality specifications or blending requirements could reduce our throughput volumes, require us to incur additional handling costs or require capital expenditures. For example, different product specifications for different markets affect the fungibility of the products in our system and could require the construction of additional storage. In addition, changes in the product quality of the products we receive on our product pipeline systems could reduce or eliminate our ability to blend products.
