Dover Motorsports, Inc. is a public holding company that is a marketer and promoter of motorsports entertainment in the United States. Through our subsidiaries, we own and operate Dover International Speedway® in Dover, Delaware and Nashville Superspeedway® near Nashville, Tennessee. Our Dover facility was scheduled to promote the following six events during 2020, all of which were under the auspices of the premier sanctioning body in motorsports - the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (“NASCAR”):
 

· | 2 NASCAR Cup Series events (May and August);
--+---------------------------------------------


· | 2 NASCAR Xfinity Series events (May and August);
--+-------------------------------------------------


· | 1 NASCAR Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series event (May); and
--+------------------------------------------------------------


· | 1 NASCAR ARCA Menards Series East event (August).
--+--------------------------------------------------

 
Due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, our May NASCAR weekend was postponed and the three events originally scheduled for that weekend were held in combination with our already scheduled August NASCAR weekend events. On July 25, 2020, Delaware state officials notified us that due to public safety and health concerns, they would not approve our request to host a limited number of fans at our August NASCAR weekend. As a result, all of our 2020 events were held with no fans in attendance during the third quarter of 2020.
 
In contrast, in 2019 and 2018 we held six events, all with fans in attendance. A NASCAR Cup Series event, a NASCAR Xfinity Series event and a NASCAR Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series event were held at Dover International Speedway during the second quarter of 2019 and 2018. A NASCAR Cup Series event, a NASCAR Xfinity Series event and a NASCAR ARCA Menards Series East event were held at Dover International Speedway during the fourth quarter of 2019 and 2018.
 
In 2021, we are scheduled to once again promote these six events, with three events at Dover International Speedway in May and three events at Nashville Superspeedway in June. We have not promoted a major motorsports event at our Nashville Superspeedway since 2011. On June 3, 2020, we announced that we would be moving one of our NASCAR Cup Series events historically held at Dover International Speedway to Nashville Superspeedway beginning in 2021. We entered into a four-year sanction agreement to promote a NASCAR Cup Series event in Nashville for the 2021 to 2024 racing seasons. We also entered into a one-year sanction agreement to promote a NASCAR Cup Series event at Dover International Speedway for the 2021 season. Total revenues from these event weekends were approximately 98% of total revenues in 2020, and approximately 96% in 2019 and 2018.
 
The 2020 global outbreak of COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020 and has resulted in travel restrictions, business closures, government-imposed stay-at-home orders and the implementation of “social distancing,” limitations on the size of gatherings, cancellations of events and certain other measures to prevent the further spread of the virus. The continued spread of COVID-19 has also led to unprecedented global economic disruption and volatility in financial markets, a rise in unemployment levels, decreases in consumer confidence levels and spending, and an overall worsening of U.S. economic conditions. It remains highly uncertain how long the pandemic and the resulting economic challenges and restrictions on day-to-day life will last. New or renewed restrictions may be implemented in response to the virus spread rate in the United States and evolving conditions, including overall uncertainty about the timing of widespread availability of vaccines. For those reasons, we are unable to predict the long-term impact of the pandemic on our business at this time. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our results will depend on future developments, but the continued spread of COVID-19 and associated economic impacts could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows. In particular, if restrictions related to COVID-19 limit our ability to host fans at our scheduled 2021 events, our admissions and event-related revenues will be adversely impacted.

We hosted the Firefly Music Festival (“Firefly”) on our property in Dover, Delaware for eight consecutive years and it was scheduled to return on June 18-21, 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 event was cancelled. The inaugural three day festival with 40 musical acts was held in July 2012 and the 2019 event was held in June 2019 with approximately 120 musical acts. The promoter of the Firefly event is Goldenvoice, a company of AEG Presents, LLC, a subsidiary of Anschutz Entertainment Group, Inc.  AEG Presents is one of the world’s largest presenters of live music and entertainment events. Our amended agreement grants them two 5-year options to extend our facility rental agreement through 2032 in exchange for a rental commitment to secure our property.  In addition to the facility rental fee, we also receive a percentage of the concession sales we manage at the events. There has been no decision yet regarding whether Firefly will be held in 2021. If Firefly is not held in 2021, due to government-imposed restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic or other reasons, our business will be adversely affected.
 
We generate revenues primarily from the following sources:
 

· | rights fees obtained for television and radio broadcasts of our events;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | ticket sales;
--+--------------


· | sponsorship payments;
--+----------------------


· | luxury suite rentals;

· | hospitality tent rentals and catering;
--+---------------------------------------


· | concessions and vendor commissions for the right to sell concessions and souvenirs at our facilities;

· | expo space rentals; and
--+------------------------


· | track and facility rentals and other event-related revenues.

We began our motorsports operations in 1969 in Dover, Delaware. Our predecessor, Dover Downs, Inc., was also engaged in harness horse racing operations and later ran our other gaming operations. As a result of several restructurings, our operations were segregated into two main operating subsidiaries - Dover International Speedway, Inc., incorporated in 1994, encompassed our motorsports operations, and Dover Downs, Inc., incorporated in 1967, conducted our gaming operations.
 
Effective March 31, 2002, we spun-off our gaming business which was then owned by our subsidiary, Dover Downs Gaming & Entertainment, Inc. (“Gaming”).  On a tax-free basis, we made a pro rata distribution of all of the capital stock of Gaming to our stockholders.  Our continuing operations subsequent to the spin-off consist solely of our motorsports activities and property rentals. 
 
On August 17, 2017, we entered into an agreement with an entity owned by Panattoni Development Company (the “buyer”) relative to the sale of approximately 147 acres of land at a purchase price of $35,000 per acre. On March 2, 2018, we closed on the sale of the property with proceeds, less closing costs, of $4,945,000. Net proceeds after taxes were approximately $4,150,000 resulting in a gain of $2,512,000. On September 1, 2017, we also awarded to the buyer a three year option for approximately 88 additional acres at a purchase price of $55,000 per acre. That option agreement has been amended twice since: first, on February 9, 2018, to extend its term and to add additional acreage; and second, on June 25, 2019, in connection with the buyer’s exercise of its option on two parcels, we adjusted the acreage and further extended the term of the option on a third parcel.  The buyer paid to us $500,000 for the extension of this option until March 1, 2022, and this non-refundable payment would be credited to the purchase price at the closing of that option parcel. On July 26, 2019, the buyer closed on the sale of the first two parcels, comprising approximately 133 acres, which yielded to us proceeds, less closing costs, of $6,397,000.  Net proceeds after taxes were approximately $5,314,000 resulting in a gain of $4,186,000. On July 29, 2020, the buyer closed on the sale of the third parcel of approximately 97 acres at our Nashville property. Proceeds from the sale, less closing costs, were $6,460,000. Net proceeds after taxes were approximately $5,290,000 resulting in a gain of $4,843,000. The buyer’s deposit previously paid to us was credited to the purchase price. In November 2020, we entered into an agreement to sell an additional 350 acres of land at our Nashville facility for $14,355,000. The buyer paid us $500,000, which is non-refundable except in the event of a default by us that is not cured within the applicable cure period, and which would be credited to the purchase price at the closing of the sale of that parcel. The transaction is expected to be consummated on or before May 31, 2021. Assuming this option is exercised, the remaining Nashville Superspeedway property will consist of approximately 650 acres. None of the acreage sold or under agreement extends to the land on which our superspeedway is sited.

On February 28, 2019, we entered into an agreement to sell 7.63 acres of land at our Nashville facility for proceeds, less closing costs, of $267,000. The sale closed in the first quarter of 2019 and resulted in a gain of $139,000, which we have reported as gain on sale of land in our consolidated statement of earnings and comprehensive income.
 
During September 2018, we entered into negotiations to sell the last remaining parcel of land we owned near St. Louis. The sale resulted in a loss of $99,000, which we reported as loss on sale of land in our consolidated statement of earnings and comprehensive income. The sale closed in the first quarter of 2019 with proceeds, less closing costs, of $531,000.
 
Dover International Speedway
 
We have promoted NASCAR-sanctioned racing events for 52 consecutive years at Dover International Speedway and for many years have promoted six NASCAR-sanctioned events at the facility annually. Two races are in the NASCAR Cup Series professional stock car racing circuit, two races are in the NASCAR Xfinity Series racing circuit, one race is in the NASCAR Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series racing circuit, and one race is in the NASCAR ARCA Menards Series East racing circuit. Each of the NASCAR Xfinity Series events, the Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series event and the ARCA Menards Series East event at Dover International Speedway are conducted on the days before a NASCAR Cup Series event.
 
Dover International Speedway, widely known as the “Monster Mile®,” is a high-banked, one-mile, concrete superspeedway with permanent grandstand seating, after our current seating capacity adjustments, of approximately 54,000. Unlike some superspeedways, substantially all grandstand and skybox seats offer an unobstructed view of the entire track. The concrete racing surface made Dover International Speedway the first concrete superspeedway (one mile or greater in length) that conducts NASCAR Cup Series events. The superspeedway facility also features the Monster Bridge®. The climate controlled bridge spans across the width of the superspeedway at a height of 29 feet and houses 50-luxury seats, a refreshment bar and other amenities. The Monster Bridge is the only one of its kind in the motorsports industry.
 
Nashville Superspeedway
 
In April 2001, we opened Nashville Superspeedway – a motorsports complex approximately 35 miles from downtown Nashville in Wilson County, Tennessee. The facility was closed after the 2011 season, but will re-open for NASCAR Cup Series racing in 2021. The 1.33-mile concrete superspeedway has 25,000 permanent grandstand seats with an infrastructure in place for future expansion. The superspeedway, which includes lights to allow for nighttime racing, is the largest concrete track in NASCAR.
 
Agreements with NASCAR
 
Our previous sanction agreements with NASCAR were for the 2016-2020 seasons and NASCAR had communicated that the industry would be going back to annual sanction agreements. Pursuant to the typical sanction agreement, NASCAR grants its sanction to a promoter, such as Dover International Speedway, to organize, promote and hold a particular competition. The promoter sells tickets to the competition, sells or arranges for the sale of merchandise and concessions, and sells advertising, sponsorships and hospitality services. NASCAR arranges for the drivers, conducts the competition, including the right to require alterations to the promoter’s facility and the right to approve or disapprove any advertising or sponsorship of the promoter. NASCAR also has exclusive rights to exploit live broadcast and certain broadcast and intellectual property rights related to the competition, and exclusive rights to sponsorship and promotional rights relative to the series to which a particular competition belongs. The promoter must pay the sanction fee and purse monies and receives a share of the live broadcast revenue contracted for by NASCAR. The promoter is responsible for the condition of the facility, for compliance with laws, for control of the public, for fire and medical equipment and personnel, for security, for insurance and for providing facilities and services required by NASCAR officials and the live broadcast personnel.

Dover International Speedway, Inc. has entered into a sanction agreement with NASCAR pursuant to which it will organize and promote one NASCAR Cup Series event in 2021. On June 3, 2020, we announced that we would be moving one of our NASCAR Cup Series events historically held at Dover International Speedway to Nashville Superspeedway beginning in 2021. We entered into a four-year sanction agreement to promote a NASCAR Cup Series event in Nashville for the 2021 to 2024 racing seasons. Our business is substantially dependent on these two agreements. 
 
Under the terms of our sanction agreements, NASCAR retains 10% of the gross broadcast rights fees allocated to each NASCAR-sanctioned event as a component of its sanction fee. The remaining 90% is recorded as broadcasting revenue. The event promoter is required to pay 25% of the gross broadcast rights fees to the event as part of the awards to the competitors, which we record as operating expenses.
 
Competition 
 
Our racing events compete with other racing events sanctioned by various racing bodies and with other sports and recreational events scheduled on or around the same dates. Racing events sanctioned by different organizations are sometimes held on the same dates at different tracks. The quality of the competition, type of racing event, caliber of the event, sight lines, ticket pricing, location and customer conveniences and amenities, among other things, differentiate the motorsports facilities. We also compete with improving and expanding media coverage and content by network and cable broadcasters.
Seasonality 
 
We derive substantially all of our total revenues from television broadcast rights, admissions, and other event-related revenue attributable to two major motorsports event weekends. Our 2020 events were all held in August. Our 2019 and 2018 events were held in the spring and fall. Our 2021 major events will be held in May and June. As a result, our business is highly seasonal.
Employees 
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had 52 full-time employees and 8 part-time employees. We engage temporary personnel to assist during our motorsports racing season. We believe that we enjoy a good relationship with our employees.
Intellectual Property 
 
We have various registered and common law trademark rights, including, but not limited to, “Dover,” “Dover Motorsports,” “Dover International Speedway,” “Nashville Speedway,” “Nashville Superspeedway,” “Monster Mile,” “Miles the Monster,” “Velocity,” “Monster Bridge,” “The Most Exciting Seat in Sports!,” and “Concrete Monster.” We also have limited rights to use the names and logos of NASCAR, various sponsors, drivers and other businesses in connection with promoting our events and certain merchandising programs.  Due to the value of our intellectual property rights for promotional purposes, it is our intention to vigorously protect these rights, through litigation, if necessary.
Available Information
 
We file annual, quarterly and current reports, information statements and other information with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. The address of that site is www.sec.gov.
 
Internet Address
 
We maintain a website where additional information concerning our business and various upcoming events can be found. The address of our Internet website is www.dovermotorsports.com. We provide a link on our website, under Investor Relations, to our filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K, proxy statement, Section 16 reports, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports.
