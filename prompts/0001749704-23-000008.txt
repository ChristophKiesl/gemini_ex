Our Mission
Agiliti, Inc. is an essential service provider to the U.S. healthcare industry with solutions that help support a more efficient, safe and sustainable healthcare delivery system. We ensure healthcare providers have the critical medical equipment they need to care for patients—wherever and whenever it’s needed—with a service model that helps lower costs, reduce waste and maintain the highest quality standard of medical device management in the industry. We are motivated by a belief that every interaction has the power to change a life, which forms the cornerstone of how we approach our work and frames the lens through which we view our responsibility to make a difference for the customers, patients and communities we serve.
Overview
We believe we are one of the leading experts in the manufacturing, management, maintenance and mobilization of mission-critical, regulated, reusable medical devices. We offer healthcare providers a comprehensive suite of medical equipment management and service solutions that help reduce capital and operating expenses, optimize medical equipment utilization, reduce waste, enhance staff productivity and bolster patient safety.
We commenced operations in 1939, originally incorporated in Minnesota in 1954 and reincorporated in Delaware in 2001.
In our more than 80 years of experience ensuring healthcare providers have high-quality, expertly maintained equipment to serve their patients, we’ve established a nationwide operating footprint that supports our offering. This at-scale, local market service and logistics infrastructure positions us to reach customers across the entire healthcare continuum—from individual facilities to the largest and most complex healthcare systems. Our ability to rapidly mobilize, track, repair and redeploy equipment during times of peak need or emergent events has made us a service provider of choice for city, state and the federal government in the management of emergency equipment stockpiles.
Our diverse customer base includes more than 10,000 national, regional and local acute care hospitals, health systems and integrated delivery networks ("IDN") and alternate site providers (such as surgery centers, specialty hospitals, home care providers, long-term acute care hospitals and skilled nursing facilities). We serve the federal government as well as a number of city and state governments providing management and maintenance of emergency equipment stockpiles, and we are an outsourced service provider to medical device manufacturers supporting critical device remediation and repair services. We deliver our solutions through our nationwide network of more than 150 service centers and Centers of Excellence, a majority of which are certified to ISO 13485:2016. At our facilities, we employ a team of more than 800 specialized biomed repair technicians, more than 5,000 field-based service operators who work onsite within customer facilities or in our local service centers, and over 200 field sales and account managers. Our fees are primarily paid directly by our customers rather than by direct reimbursement from third-party payors, such as private insurers, Medicare or Medicaid.
Industry Challenges
The U.S. healthcare industry continues to face transformative pressure that affects how provider organizations conduct business and serve their patients. Across the healthcare system, providers face compounding financial and operational challenges, including cost pressure from payors, nursing and clinical staff shortages, rising costs of drugs and supplies, increasing regulatory oversight, and advances in medical technology that generally result in higher prices for newer equipment and a higher cost of managing that equipment over its lifecycle. Given there is little that providers can do to change external dynamics, there is increased focus on areas within their enterprise that they can control. In our experience, one area that most hospitals and health systems identify for operational and cost improvement is the management and maintenance of medical equipment.
Table of Contents

Healthcare facilities have been shown to own large quantities of reusable capital equipment ranging from multi-million dollar highly technical devices (e.g. MRIs) to lower cost, high volume devices (e.g. infusion pumps) required for patient care, treatment and diagnosis. In our experience, providers often face challenges in managing their medical equipment inventory effectively. For example, hospitals typically utilize roughly 42% of their owned medical equipment inventory at any given time, yet caregivers report that they routinely lack access to readily available patient-ready equipment. Nurses report spending an average of 20 minutes per shift searching for equipment, and often less than 37% of their time on direct patient care. Operational silos that naturally occur among hospital departments create inadvertent breakdowns within equipment management workflows, from the administrators who order equipment, to the support staff who clean/reprocess and deliver the equipment, to the nurses and doctors who use the equipment.
Further, the repair and maintenance of this highly technical equipment continues to increase in complexity and cost. Over a period of 15 years from 1995 to 2010 there was a 62% increase in the number of medical devices per hospital bed and a 90% increase in costs related to maintaining this equipment. Given the increasingly complex nature of these devices and stringent regulatory mandates guiding their upkeep, specialized technical knowledge is required to repair and maintain them. Most healthcare facilities struggle to employ the in-house capabilities and resources needed to ensure timely, routine maintenance and rapid testing, repair and turnaround of their medical inventory which may impact time-to-therapy and patient safety, while driving up capital replacement costs on equipment that could have otherwise been kept operational with proper maintenance.
Finally, the healthcare system experiences seasonality in patient volumes, resulting in peak-need demand for specialized medical equipment (e.g. ventilators, specialty beds, infusion pumps). Given the common breakdowns in managing and maintaining their inventory during times of normal operation, hospitals face additional burden on equipment availability during times of peak need and will procure supplemental equipment through additional acquisition channels to fill this gap.
These challenges drive up significant costs and time delays within individual hospital facilities, but when multiplied across several hospitals and alternate site facilities within an integrated delivery network, the losses increase significantly. An average 2,500 bed IDN has been shown to waste more than $11.0 million annually on inefficient equipment maintenance and unnecessary capital purchases, while clinicians lose valuable patient time and productivity hours managing equipment needs.
These dynamics, supported by the following trends, further support the essential nature of our work:
Focus on reducing costs and increasing operational efficiency. Hospitals and other healthcare facilities continue to experience substantial pressure to conserve capital, reduce operating expenses and become more operationally efficient. We expect these pressures to continue in the future and believe that we will always be on the right side of healthcare reform. Our comprehensive, end-to-end solutions offer customers a way to realize costs savings while enhancing operational improvements for medical equipment access and availability, thereby improving their organizational efficiency and financial viability.
Demand for better patient safety and outcomes. Hospitals across the U.S. are focused on improving patient safety and outcomes, which includes efforts to minimize hospital-acquired conditions (e.g. infections, patient falls and pressure injuries) and increase nursing time at the patient bedside. Hospitals turn to us to assist them in managing their equipment in ways that have been shown to help them to minimize these incidents and ensure equipment is available when and where it is needed for patient care, thereby improving patient safety and time to therapy, and supporting optimal patient outcomes.
Caregiver retention and satisfaction. Hospitals continue to experience pressure and risk related to nursing and other caregiver retention and job satisfaction pressures. According to McKinsey & Company, the United States is expected to face a nurse shortage of between 200,000 and 450,000 nurses by 2025. Adding non-patient care duties, such as searching for, cleaning and managing equipment, adds to nurse workload and contributes to clinician dissatisfaction and turnover. We expect that with these internal pressures, hospitals will increasingly turn to our programs to outsource healthcare technology management duties and related management processes to allow nurses more time to spend on patient care, resulting in improved job satisfaction.
Increased capital and operating expense pressures and regulatory compliance. Hospitals continue to experience restricted capital and operating budgets, while the cost and complexity of medical equipment increases. Furthermore, the increasing complexity and sophistication of medical equipment brings with it more recordkeeping requirements and regulatory scrutiny in its use and maintenance. We expect that hospitals will increasingly look to us to support the

Our Market Opportunities
We participate in the U.S. medical equipment services market comprised of the services we offer through our onsite managed services, clinical engineering services and equipment solutions service lines.
Per the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), as of 2021, healthcare spending reached $4.3 trillion, or $12,914 per person and accounted for 18.3% of the U.S. GDP. Spending is expected to grow at an average annual rate of 5.1% from 2021-2030, due to secular tailwinds including an aging population, rising acuity, and prevalence of chronic conditions.
There is a fundamental shift in the needs of health systems, hospitals and alternate site providers to move from supplemental and peak need sourcing of medical equipment toward more comprehensive onsite inventory management and maintenance solutions. As healthcare facilities look to balance the challenge of providing better care at lower costs, they are more open to third party partnerships that outsource critical but non-core support functions. The move toward full outsourcing is not unlike trends in similar services at hospitals including food service, laundry, professional staffing and technology.
We believe there are several key macro trends that will drive increased demand for our products and services:
Favorable demographic trends. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, individuals aged 65 and older in the United States comprise the fastest growing segment of the population. This segment is expected to grow to approximately 95 million individuals by 2060. This represents a 93.9% increase in the 65-and-older segment of the population as compared to 2016. As a result, over time, the number of patients and the volume of hospital admissions are expected to grow. The aging population and increasing life expectancy are driving demand for healthcare services.
Increase in chronic disease and obesity. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”), six in ten Americans live with at least one chronic disease, like heart disease and stroke, cancer, or diabetes. These conditions often require specialty equipment to support therapeutic intervention in inpatient and outpatient care settings. In addition, obesity in the U.S. increased to 41.9% of the population between 2017-2020, up from 30.5% between 1999-2000 (CDC). This population demands greater access to specialty bariatric equipment to support care and minimize the incidence of injury during a hospital stay.
Increased mergers & acquisitions. We have seen that hospitals and healthcare systems continue to expand their covered network and acquire alternate care delivery settings in order to care for patient populations in the most cost-effective way. In our experience, providers are increasingly seeking partners that provide comprehensive services and that can quickly adapt to changing health system infrastructure and growth. Working with one vendor that can operate at a nationwide and system-wide scale is attractive to cities, states, and IDNs who operate, manage, and maintain equipment inventories across multiple locations.
Centralizing shared services across the IDN. Health systems with duplicate services across multiple facilities in close proximity have an increased risk of unnecessary variation, greater costs, and suboptimal outcomes. Many health systems have centralized and consolidated non-clinical services as a shared service, including billing, reimbursement, supply chain, human resources, IT, etc. We have witnessed a growing trend among IDNs to centralize and consolidate equipment maintenance and logistics among member facilities. In our experience, because most health systems do not currently have the storage, technical or transportation resources for managing a shared equipment management function, they will seek third party support to optimize equipment utilization, redeploy equipment where needed and reduce overall equipment costs.
Increase in infection control risks. Infection control remains an essential priority for hospitals and health systems as a way to limit the spread of hospital-acquired infections. This has further escalated as a top priority due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Most focus in this area is around hand hygiene, the proper use of personal protective equipment ("PPE") and the reprocessing and sterilization of critical and semi-critical medical devices (e.g. surgical instruments, endoscopes). Often overlooked is the reprocessing of non-critical medical devices, such as infusion pumps and ventilators, that are commonly touched by caregivers and patients. If not properly cleaned and sanitized between patient use, these devices can pose increased infection control risks. We expect an increase in demand of onsite equipment management programs to address proper reprocessing of these types of devices and help lower infection risks and allow clinicians to spend more time at the patient bedside and less time cleaning equipment.

compliance. We leverage more than 800 technical resources from our over 150 local market service centers and Centers of Excellence to flex staff in and out of customer facilities on an as-needed basis, ensuring customers pay only for time spent directly servicing their equipment by an appropriately qualified technician. We use flex staffing for our supplemental clinical engineering solution and to augment support when additional technicians are needed to supplement our outsourced services during peak workload. We contract our Clinical Engineering Services with acute care and alternate site facilities across the U.S., as well as with the federal government and any medical device manufacturers that require a broad logistical footprint to support their large-scale service needs. Revenue attributable to such customers for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 represented 38% and 37% of our total revenue, respectively.
Equipment Solutions: Equipment Solutions primarily provides supplemental, peak need and per-case rental of general biomedical, specialty, and surgical equipment to acute care hospitals and alternate site providers in the U.S., including some of the nation’s premier healthcare institutions and integrated delivery networks. We contract for Equipment Solutions services directly with customers or through our contractual arrangements with hospital systems and alternate site providers. We consistently achieve high customer satisfaction ratings, as evidenced by our Net Promotor Score ("NPS") of 47 for the year ended December 31, 2022, by delivering patient-ready equipment within our contracted equipment delivery times and by providing technical support and educational in-servicing for equipment as-needed in clinical departments, including the emergency room, operating room, intensive care, rehabilitation and general patient care areas. We are committed to providing the highest quality of equipment to our customers, and we do so through the use of our comprehensive QMS which is based on the quality standards recognized worldwide for medical devices: 21 CFR 820 and ISO 13485:2016. This commitment ensures that customers have access to patient-ready equipment with the confidence of knowing it has been prepared and maintained to the highest industry standard to deliver optimal patient safety and outcomes. Revenue attributable to such customers for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 represented 39% and 34% of our total revenue, respectively.
Many of our customers have multiple contracts and have revenue reported in multiple service lines. Our contracts vary based upon service offering, including with respect to term (with most being multi-year contracts), pricing (daily, monthly and fixed fee arrangements) and termination (termination for convenience to termination for cause only). Many of our contracts contain customer commitment guarantees and annual price increases tied to the consumer price index. Standard contract terms include payment terms, limitation of liability, force majeure provisions and choice of law/venue.
Because we work closely with customers to provide a long-term, value-based solution versus a product-based, transactional approach, they are motivated to expand their relationships with us over time. We have demonstrated an ability to grow revenue up to 5-6x with existing customers as they move toward our full suite of highly complementary services. From the year ended December 31, 2015 to the year ended December 31, 2022, our top 50 customers that experienced the largest growth in revenue over the same period increased in revenue from an aggregate of approximately $21.8 million to approximately $153.9 million (with increases at each customer ranging from $1.5 million to $12.6 million and an average increase of $2.6, and with consistent growth across our three primary service lines), primarily driven by our efforts to expand our share of wallet within our existing customer base.
Further, the infrastructure and capabilities required to provide connected, responsive equipment lifecycle management is typically cost-prohibitive, even for large IDNs. Our nationwide network of clinical engineers, storage and repair facilities, vehicles and analytics tools gives us scale to provide cost-effective services for individual facilities, systems, regional IDNs, governments and device manufacturers.

Commitment to quality. Class I and II medical devices are designed, manufactured, and distributed from our Sizewise manufacturing facilities. Each of the United States-based facilities that produce finished goods is registered with the United States Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") and follows strict quality guidelines in accordance with 21 CFR 820 and ISO 13485:2016.
Agiliti also services and repairs medical devices manufactured by other OEMs. Third-party service providers like Agiliti are not required to register their sites with the FDA; therefore, there are no regulations that specifically apply to our maintenance of medical devices. We’ve made a commitment, however, to do the right thing for our customers and their patients by staffing a dedicated Quality team and implementing a QMS based on the quality standards recognized worldwide for medical devices: 21 CFR 820 and ISO 13485:2016. This commitment to quality ensures that patient safety and risk management are at the center of every product decision, and that our equipment is serviced to the highest standards in the industry. We have elected to have independent accredited registrars certify our robust QMS at over 110 of our local market service centers, government service centers, and Centers of Excellence to ISO 13485:2015. British Standards Institute (“BSI”) has certified over 110 of our local market service centers, government service centers, and Centers of Excellence to ISO 13485:2016. The Surgical Equipment Repair and Imaging Centers of Excellence are certified by Deutscher Kraftfahrzeug-Überwachungs-Verein e.V. (“Dekra”) and National Quality Assurance (“NQA”). Our manufacturing facilities are certified by Intertek. We believe that ISO 13485:2016 provides the stringent guidelines specific to medical devices to ensure that our fleet of equipment, as well as the equipment we service, is maintained to the highest quality standards. Our commitment to quality extends to our exclusive use of OEM parts to repair FDA 510(k) registered medical devices that we own, whenever available. Implementing optimal maintenance intervals and parts replacement extends equipment use life, thereby reducing waste and lowering risk of obsolescence. We believe that our robust QMS policies set us apart in our industry from those who may use less stringent quality practices on the equipment they own or maintain.
Superior customer service. We believe we have a long-standing reputation among our customers for outstanding service and quality. This reputation is largely attributable to our strong customer service culture, which is continuously reinforced by management’s commitment to, and significant investment in, hiring and training resources. We strive to seamlessly integrate our employees and solutions into the operations of our customers. We believe that our aggressive focus on the 
Table of Contents

overall customer experience has helped us achieve high customer satisfaction ratings, as evidenced by our NPS of 47 for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Low direct third-party payor reimbursement risk. Many healthcare providers rely on direct payment from patients or reimbursement from third-party payors. Our fees are primarily paid directly by our customers, rather than by third-party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid, managed care organizations or indemnity insurers. Accordingly, our exposure to uncollectible patient or reimbursement receivables or Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement changes is reduced, as evidenced by our bad debt expense of approximately 0.3%, 0.2%, and 0.3% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.
Values driven culture centered on doing the right thing for our many stakeholders. Our team operates on a set of shared aspirations that reflect the manner in which we approach our work and serve the needs of our customers, team members, shareholders and local communities.

Grow our customer base among customers that outsource. We believe there is a significant opportunity to further grow our business by winning new customer contracts for medical equipment management services in the U.S. Due to increasing pressures that providers are facing, we expect outsourcing to significantly accelerate. As a leader in our industry, we believe we are poised to take advantage of this continued shift.
Grow our serviceable market by contracting with those that insource today. We believe that as we reach additional potential customers with demonstrated value both in improved patient care and reduced costs, we can grow our total addressable market by contracting with new clients that were not previously outsourcing device management services. Further, this market is also experiencing tailwinds that make the total addressable market, the total contracted market, and our own contracts with ongoing customers poised to continue to expand. These tailwinds include increasing overall provider volumes, increasing use and complexity of medical devices, increasing outsourcing by hospitals, and additional factors that we believe will continue to drive growth.
Invest in complementary offerings that enhance customer relationships. As the medical device field becomes increasingly complex and the number of devices used per patient on average increases over time, we are constantly evaluating additional services and methods of approaching service delivery that increase value for our clients. As an example, this has recently taken the form of expanding our work with federal, state, and local governments to help them maintain and mobilize strategic stockpiles of ventilators and other critical medical equipment.
Opportunistically pursue accretive M&A. Due to our high and sustained value creation for customers and significant white space with existing customer relationships, we believe that pursuing opportunistic M&A will drive increasing returns through embedded customer relationships. From 2016-2022, we have successfully integrated ten acquisitions and will continue to opportunistically pursue additional inorganic growth.
Business Operations
Service Centers
As of December 31, 2022, we operated more than 150 local market service centers which allow us to provide our end-to-end healthcare technology management and service solutions to customers in virtually all markets throughout the United States. Each service center is responsible for supporting the equipment management needs of its local healthcare market across all sites of care. Each service center maintains an inventory of locally demanded equipment, parts, supplies and other items tailored to accommodate the needs of individual customers within its geographical area. Should additional or unusual equipment be required by one of our customers, a local service center can draw upon the resources of our other service centers. With access to more than one million owned or managed units of medical equipment (over 300,000 owned) available for customer use as of December 31, 2022, we believe we can most often obtain the necessary equipment within 24 hours.
Depending on market size and demands, our service centers are staffed by multi-disciplined teams of sales professionals, service representatives, customer service technicians, clinical engineering (biomedical) equipment technicians and surgical services technologists trained to deliver on our complete portfolio of customer solutions. Employees providing resident-based services through our on-site managed programs are supported by local site managers and/or the service centers in the markets where those customers are located.
Centers of Excellence
Our local market service center network is supported by strategically located Centers of Excellence. These centers focus on providing highly specialized clinical engineering service and support. The Centers of Excellence also provide overflow support, technical expertise, training programs and specialized service functions for our local service centers. All specialized depot work required by our manufacturer customers resides within these Centers of Excellence. Our Centers of Excellence are certified to ISO 13485:2016 by BSI, DEKRA, and Intertek as a quality commitment to our customers.
Centralized Functions
Our corporate office is located in Eden Prairie, Minnesota. We have centralized many of the key elements of our equipment and service offerings in order to create standardization and to maximize our operating efficiencies and uniformity of service. Some of the critical aspects of our business centralized within our corporate office include contract administration, marketing, purchasing, pricing, logistics, accounting and information technology.

Medical Equipment Fleet
We acquire, manufacture, or manage medical equipment to meet our customers’ needs in some of the following product areas: respiratory therapy, infusion therapy, newborn care, critical care, patient monitors, specialty beds and therapy surfaces (which includes fall management equipment, bariatrics equipment, pressure area management and wound therapy equipment, stretchers and wheelchairs) and surgical equipment. We believe we maintain one of the most technologically advanced and comprehensive equipment fleets in the industry, routinely acquiring new and certified pre-owned equipment to enhance our fleet. Our specialized equipment portfolio managers evaluate new products each year to keep abreast of current market technology and to determine whether to add new products to our equipment fleet. In making equipment purchases, we consider a variety of factors, including manufacturer credibility, repair and maintenance costs, anticipated user demand, equipment mobility and anticipated obsolescence. We generally do not enter into long-term fixed price contracts with suppliers of our equipment. As of December 31, 2022, we owned or managed more than a million units of medical equipment available for use by our customers of which over 300,000 were owned.
In 2022, our ten largest manufacturers of medical equipment supplied approximately 55% (measured in dollars spent) of our direct medical equipment purchases. In 2022, three of our largest medical equipment suppliers accounted for approximately 32% of our medical equipment purchases (measured in dollars spent).
COVID-19
COVID-19 placed our customers, business, teams and communities in uncharted waters. As demand for emergent acute care increased around the country, the global pandemic highlighted the importance of resilient supply chains and service networks and magnified the importance of our solutions. We are proud to have rapidly developed and deployed a response plan to ensure the safety of our team, while continuing to meet our customers’ evolving needs for patient-ready medical equipment when and where it was needed; notably, doing so without service interruptions.
We believe our value proposition now resonates with an even broader audience of customers as providers, IDNs and governments prepare for potential future surges in demand for acute care and the required equipment necessary to care for patients.
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Matters
Our environmental, social, and governance ("ESG") strategy is rooted in our belief that every interaction has the power to change a life. We are committed to making an impact through our work, managing ESG risks and opportunities, and shaping the long-term sustainability of our business. 
Our progress in 2022 was guided by our inaugural third-party materiality assessment conducted in 2021. This assessment helped define our ESG priorities and enhance our strategy for ESG governance, disclosure, and performance.
In 2022, we published an ESG fact sheet tracking a series of metrics—both quantitative and qualitative—that we believe address our most significant areas of impact and opportunity. These priorities, along with a more detailed account of our strategy, approach and progress, will be further addressed in our upcoming 2022 ESG Report, which we expect to publish mid-year 2023.
Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has formal oversight of ESG-related matters, and our executive team has responsibility for driving ESG strategy and reporting.
More information about our commitments to ESG can be found on our investor relations website at https://investors.agilitihealth.com/esg/corporate-citizenship/default.aspx

Marketing
We market our programs primarily through our direct sales force, which consisted of over 200 sales representatives as of December 31, 2022. We support our direct sales force with technical, clinical, surgical and financial specialists, who lead new business selling efforts to deliver comprehensive solutions for our customers. Our national accounts team also supports our direct sales force through its focus on securing national and regional contracts.
Our sales force uses a structured and consistent process to target customers where we can deliver significant financial and operational value over time. Each sales team member is responsible for identifying and prioritizing customer opportunities in their territory through the use of segmentation tools and market intelligence, leading to short- and long-term sales pipelines balanced across our comprehensive solutions. The sales force then engages customers directly with insights and tailored solutions that address specific customer challenges while using tools to demonstrate financial and operational savings. Our goal with this approach is to help customers with their most pressing challenges first and measure their return on value for each solution. We then work to connect additional solutions that add incremental and synergistic value for our customers, leading to an end-to-end approach to medical equipment management. Each activity our sales force initiates is aligned to our customer’s buying process and is designed to move the opportunity quickly through the sales process. Every step in the process is documented in a customer relationship management ("CRM") system, where we continually monitor and manage sales pipelines, balanced opportunity mix and sales forecasts.
The members of the sales force are compensated with a combination of base pay and variable incentive pay. The percentage of each individual’s overall compensation that is comprised of base pay versus variable incentive pay is dependent on the individual’s position. Sales force members whose primary responsibility is account management receive a higher percentage of base pay, while sales force members whose primary responsibility is the generation of new business receive a higher percentage of variable incentive pay. The actual variable incentive pay received by an individual is based on his or her achievement of certain performance metrics, including revenue, earnings and/or new business milestones.
We also market our end-to-end solutions through our website at www.agilitihealth.com and various social media and digital marketing channels, including a variety of trade publications and organizations with subscribers and members who are key decision makers for our solutions. In addition, we participate in numerous national and regional conventions where we interact with industry groups and opinion leaders. Information presented on our website is not incorporated by reference and should not be considered a part of this Reporting Statement.
In our marketing efforts, we primarily target key decision makers such as administrators, chief executive officers, chief financial officers, chief technology officers, chief medical officers and chief nursing officers as well as physicians, directors and managers of functional departments, such as supply chain, materials management, surgery, purchasing, pharmacy, biomedical services, and clinical engineering. We also promote comprehensive solutions to IDNs, hospitals, surgery centers, manufacturers and alternate site provider groups and associations.
Seasonality and Business Interruption
Quarterly operating results are typically affected by seasonal factors. Historically, our first and fourth quarters are the strongest, reflecting increased hospital census and patient acuity during the fall and winter months. However, COVID-19 has impacted the seasonality of our business. Our business can also be impacted by natural disasters, such as hurricanes and earthquakes, which affect our ability to transfer equipment to and from our customers, and equipment recalls, which can cause equipment to be removed from market use. We also see declines in our business in down economic cycles with high levels of unemployment. Our customers typically see weaker census and higher levels of indigent patients during these times, causing them to use fewer of our solutions.
Regulatory Matters
Regulation of Medical Equipment
Our customers are subject to documentation and safety reporting regulations and standards with respect to the medical equipment they use, including those established by the FDA, CMS and the National Fire Protection Association (“NFPA”). Various states and municipalities may also have similar regulations.
We monitor changes in regulations and standards to accommodate the needs of customers by providing specific product and manufacturer information upon request. Manufacturers of medical equipment are subject to regulation by agencies and 
Table of Contents

organizations such as the FDA, Underwriters Laboratories and the NFPA. We believe that all medical equipment we outsource conforms to these regulations.
The Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990 (“SMDA”), which amended the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), requires manufacturers, user facilities and importers of medical devices to report whenever they believe there is a probability that a medical device has caused or contributed to a death, illness, or injury. In addition, the SMDA requires the establishment and maintenance of adverse safety and effectiveness data and various other FDA reports. Manufacturers and importers are also required to report certain device malfunctions. We also work with our customers to assist them in meeting their reporting obligations under the FDCA, including those requirements added by the SMDA.
Besides the FDA, a number of states regulate medical device distributors and wholesalers either through pharmacy or device distributor licensure. Currently, we hold such licenses in 26 states. Some licensure regulations and statutes in additional states may apply to our activities. Although our failure to possess such licenses in these states for our existing operations may subject us to certain monetary fines, we do not believe the extent of such fines, in the aggregate, would be material to our liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.
In addition, we are required to provide information to manufacturers regarding the permanent disposal or any change in ownership of certain categories of medical outsourcing equipment. While we believe our medical equipment tracking systems are in compliance with these regulations, these regulations are subject to change and such changes could have an impact on how we conduct our business.
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) applies to certain covered entities, including health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and healthcare providers, as well as to business associates such as us. HIPAA regulations protect individually identifiable health information, including information in an electronic format, by, among other things, setting forth specific standards under which such information may be used and disclosed, providing patients’ rights to obtain and amend their health information, requiring notification to individuals, federal and state agencies and media outlets in the event of a breach of health information and establishing certain administrative requirements for covered entities. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health ("HITECH") Act created legal obligations for business associates and extended criminal and civil sanctions to business associates for violations of HIPAA requirements.
Because of our self-insured health plans, we are also a covered entity under the HIPAA regulations. Also, we may be obligated to comply with certain HIPAA requirements as a business associate of various healthcare providers. In addition, various state legislatures have enacted and may continue to enact additional privacy legislation that is not preempted by the federal law, which may impose additional burdens on us. Moreover, other federal privacy legislation may be enacted. Accordingly, we have made and, as new standards go into effect, we expect to continue to make administrative, operational and information infrastructure changes in order to comply with these requirements.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “Affordable Care Act”) has and will result in significant reforms to the U.S. healthcare system and the structure of the healthcare provider delivery system. The Affordable Care Act calls for additional transparency around payments made by the pharmaceutical and medical device industries to doctors and teaching hospitals, which may include gifts, food, travel and speaking or consultancy fees. All U.S. manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics or medical supplies, including distributors who hold title to such drugs, devices, biologics, or medical supplies, for which payment is available under government-funded health insurance programs (i.e., Medicare, Medicaid and the State Children’s Health Insurance Program) must report annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services any payment or gift, which represents a “transfer of value,” to a physician or teaching hospital, including detailed information about the nature and value of remuneration provided, and the identity of the receiving physician or teaching hospital. Additionally, states may require manufacturers to report information that is not required or is exempted under the federal reporting requirements. For example, a state may require manufacturers to report advertising expenditures, loans of medical devices, in-kind gifts to charities and payments to other recipients, group purchasing organizations ("GPOs") and retailers. We identify applicable state reporting requirements as they become effective.
We are subject to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of “remuneration” in return for, or to induce, the referral of business or ordering of services paid for by Medicare or other federal programs. “Remuneration” has been broadly defined to include anything of value, including gifts, discounts, credit arrangements, and in-kind goods or services. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside the healthcare industry. Violations can result in imprisonment, civil or criminal fines or exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental programs. Contracts 
Table of Contents

with healthcare facilities and other marketing practices or transactions may implicate the Anti-Kickback Statute. We have attempted to structure our contracts and marketing practices to comply with the Anti-Kickback Statute along with providing training to our employees. However, we cannot ensure that we will not have to defend against alleged violations from private entities or that OIG or other authorities will not find that our practices violate the Anti-Kickback Statute.
Although our business is not currently extensively regulated under healthcare laws, we are subject to certain regulatory requirements as discussed above and our customers are subject to direct regulation under the Federal False Claims Act, the Stark Law, the Anti-Kickback Law, rules and regulations of the CMS, and other federal and state healthcare laws and regulations. Promulgation of new laws and regulations, or changes in or re-interpretations of existing laws and regulations, could affect our business, operating results or financial condition. Our operations may be negatively impacted if we have to comply with additional complex government regulations.
Third-Party Reimbursement
Our fees are primarily paid directly by our customers rather than through direct reimbursement from third-party payors, such as Medicare or Medicaid. We do not bill the patient, the insurer or other third-party payors directly for services provided for hospital or alternate site provider inpatients or outpatients. Sometimes our customers are eligible to receive third-party reimbursement for our services. Consequently, the reimbursement policies of such third-party payors have a direct effect on the ability of healthcare providers to pay for our services and an indirect effect on our level of charges. Also, in certain circumstances, third-party payors may take regulatory or other action against service providers even though the service provider does not receive direct reimbursement from third-party payors.
Hospitals and alternate site providers face cost containment pressures from public and private insurers and other managed care providers, such as health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations and managed fee-for-service plans, as these organizations continue to place controls on the reimbursement and utilization of healthcare services. We believe that these payors have followed or will follow the government in limiting the services that are reimbursed and in exerting downward pressure on prices. In addition to promoting managed care plans, employers are increasingly self-funding their benefit programs and shifting costs to employees through increased deductibles, co-payments and employee contributions. Hospitals and healthcare facilities are also experiencing an increase in uncompensated care or “charity care,” which causes increased economic pressures on these organizations. We believe that these cost reduction efforts will place additional pressures on healthcare providers’ operating margins and will encourage efficient equipment management practices such as the use of our outsourcing and 360 on-site managed solutions.
Liability and Insurance
Our business entails the risk of claims related to the manufacturing, outsourcing, sale and service of medical equipment. In addition, our instruction of hospital and alternate site provider employees with respect to the use of equipment and our professional consulting services are sources of potential claims. We have not suffered a material loss due to a claim. However, any such claim, if made, could have a material adverse effect on our business. While we do not currently provide any services that require us to work directly with patients, expansion of services in the future could involve such activities and subject us to claims from patients.
We maintain a number of insurance policies, including commercial general liability coverage (product and premises liability insurance), automobile liability insurance, worker’s compensation insurance and professional liability insurance. We also maintain excess liability coverage. Our policies are subject to annual renewal. We believe that our current insurance coverage is adequate. Claims exceeding such coverage may be made and we may not be able to continue to obtain liability insurance at acceptable levels of cost and coverage.
Facilities
Our corporate headquarters are in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, where we lease 75,978 square feet of office space as of December 31, 2022. We also have domestic offices in Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, Nevada, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Road Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin
