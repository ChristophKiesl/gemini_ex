ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

ORGANIZATIONAL HISTORY
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 30, 2013 under the name “Bling Marketing, Inc.”  Until December 29, 2014, we were a wholesaler of jewelry, principally earrings, rings, and pendants (“BMI Business”). We recognized a minimal amount of sales from operations prior to the three months ended September 30, 2014. 
 
On December 26, 2014, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (“Merger Agreement”) with NuGene Inc., a California corporation (“NuGene”), and on December 29, 2014 (the “Closing Date”) we filed a certificate of merger in the State of California whereby our subsidiary, NG Acquisition Inc. (“Acquisition Sub”) merged with NuGene. As a result, NuGene (the surviving entity) became our wholly owned subsidiary. The transaction contemplated under the Merger Agreement was deemed to be a reverse merger. Under reverse merger accounting, our Company (the legal acquirer) is considered to have been acquired by NuGene. The assets, liabilities, and operations of NuGene have been brought forward at their book value and no goodwill has been recognized. 
 
NUGENE HISTORY AND BUSINESS
 
NuGene was incorporated in California in December 2006 and formed and funded by our founders, Ali Kharazmi and Mohammed Kharazmi, M.D. The initial focus of NuGene was to develop and market customized skin care products. As part of that focus, NuGene sought to leverage the working relationships developed by our founders with the plastic surgery community. NuGene directed significant time and resources on developing anti-aging and scar treatment/reduction products.
 
In 2007, we continued to focus on age defying products utilizing peptide complexes (see further description, below) and  nano-encapsulation for absorption into the skin (see further description, below). We introduced a limited product line under the NuGene name, and co-branded the products with an affiliated entity, Genetic Institute of Anti Aging, Inc. (“GIAA”), which is also owned by our founders. We utilized the services of a Korean based contract manufacturer to supply our products. This product line (the “GIAA Line”) was based on the use of peptides and did not utilize stem cells. We had very modest sales in 2007, with our sole customer being GIAA, a related party.
 
In 2008, we stopped production of the GIAA Line and sales were limited to selling remaining inventory through medical offices and through GIAA. With the GIAA Line discontinued, we spent the remainder of 2008 considering different formulations and methodologies for improved anti-aging products. In 2009 and 2010, we had limited activity and very limited sales. Our sales were mostly overseas and limited to the remaining inventory of the GIAA Line. We continued to explore how we might advance our formulations and methodologies. We expended funds on research and development, carried out mostly by scientists engaged by the Company.
 
In 2011, our founders decided to use adult adipose human stem cells (undifferentiated cells found throughout the body that multiply by cell division to replenish dying cells and regenerate tissues) as the foundation of the formulation for its products. During 2011, the Company developed a proprietary process to extract human adult stem cells from fat cells that the Company then used in its customized NuGene line made specifically for those client(s). Throughout 2011, we continued to provide autologous, or mature, fat-derived stem cells for use in clinical procedures, utilizing this technology. Through this process, the Company refined its ability to culture adult human stem cells to render human conditioned stem cell media at a proprietary concentration which is a primary ingredient in the NuGene line of cosmeceuticals.

In 2012, we completed our initial line of cosmeceutical products based on these adipose derived stem cells. We branded this advanced skin care line solely under the NuGene name (the “NuGene Line”). We were able to eliminate the unpleasant odor associated with stem cells by adding a fragrance with a very low incidence of allergic reaction. The packaging of this new product line bears no resemblance to the prior GIAA Line. We also manufactured the NuGene Line ourselves at a small laboratory facility that we leased from an affiliated entity owned by one of our founders. Throughout 2013, we continued to expand the product offerings of the NuGene Line. The Company focused its stem cell work in the surgical arena and orthopedic regeneration. These services were delivered to one client, which was an affiliated entity. Sales of the NuGene Line were limited as we were in an initial rollout and branding phase.
 
During 2014, we focused our efforts on transitioning to a cosmeceutical skincare business for mass distribution. With this transition and expanded attention to our consumer products, we sought to develop our marketing plan and distribution channels. By the end of 2014, we had wholesalers distributing products from the NuGene Line to medical offices and medical spas throughout the United States. In addition to the NuGene Line, we generated revenues from an affiliate, Advanced Surgical Partners (“ASP”) which is also owned by our former CEO and Chairman of the Board, Messrs. Ali and Mohammed Kharazmi, respectively. Revenues generated from ASP resulted from NuGene providing Plasma Rich Platelet and Stem Cell injections for orthopedic and plastic surgery procedures to ASP. We provided these products and services to ASP as we transitioned into the commercialization of our cosmeceutical product lines. We had no such product sales and provided no services to ASP subsequent to the Merger Agreement in December 2014.
 
The Company currently is principally engaged in marketing its NuGene Line of products. We will need to seek substantial additional funding to remain a going concern, maintain operations and to implement our business plan. Without adequate funding to support our operations for at least the next 12 months, our ability to expend funds on advertising, retain channels of distribution, retain supplier relationships, build inventory and recruit experienced sales personnel cannot be assured. Additionally, we were unsuccessful in several attempts to raise capital during 2015 and early 2016 and these failures have put our Company under significant financial strain. We continue to attempt to procure new sources of funding, whether from the issuance of debt or shares of our common stock or a combination of both. Even if we are able to obtain such additional funding, no assurance can be given that the amounts of funding we might secure will prove to be adequate or that we will be able to accomplish our goals within the timeframes projected. In addition, no assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain any additional financing on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise. If we are unable to obtain adequate funding, we may be unable to manage our existing outstanding debt, and may be required to significantly curtail or even discontinue our operations.
 
OVERVIEW
 
“Cosmeceuticals” refer to the combinations of cosmetics and pharmaceuticals that may offer medicinal or drug-like benefits. The term is more of a marketing term rather than a legal term, with the cosmetics industry having adopted the term in the late 1990’s. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) does not recognize the term. While drugs are subject to a review and approval process by the FDA, cosmetics and cosmeceuticals are not subject to the same stringent regulatory regime and scrutiny. As such, if a product has drug properties, it must be approved as a drug. However, cosmeceuticals are not subject to this review and approval process.
 
Cosmeceuticals offer consumers cosmetic-like treatments with active ingredients, which we believe give them pharmaceutical-like efficacy. Driven by aesthetic-consciousness, according to the May 2014 RNCOS research publication entitled, “Global Cosmeceuticals Market Outlook 2018” the global market for cosmeceutical products reached an estimated size of $35.1 billion in 2013. We believe that this market benefits from a younger generation of consumers as well as baby boomers who want to preserve their youthful looks. In our view the U.S. cosmeceutical market will continue to be favorably influenced by these groups who want beautiful and younger looking skin while aging.
 
Two of the fastest growing cosmeceuticals segments are the anti-aging and hair restoration markets which focus on mechanisms that influence the aging of skin and prevent/restore hair loss. Also according to the same RNCOS research, skin care garnered a material share of the cosmeceutical market in 2013 with a 60%, $21 billion worldwide market share, followed by hair care which represented a 14%, $4.75 billion market share. The global skincare cosmeceutical market is expected to reach $30.3 billion by 2018, accounting for a 62% share in the total cosmeceutical markets. In particular it is anticipated that with an aging baby boomer population and increased male grooming, skin whitening, facial care and sun-damaged products will drive the expected global demand.
 
The use of stem cell based media as a foundation for cosmeceutical products is designed to promote the anti-aging process. Every human being has stem cells in his or her body. These cells exist from the early stages of human development until the end of a person’s life. Throughout our lives, our body continues to produce stem cells that regenerate to produce differentiated cells that make up various aspects of the body such as skin, blood, muscles, and nerves. These are generally referred to as adult stem cells (non-embryonic). These cells are important for the purpose of medical therapies aiming to replace lost or damaged cells or tissues or to otherwise treat disorders. Our NuGene Line of products uses human adult stem cells culture media that we believe, when applied to human skin cells, may reduce the appearance of aging skin. We have not yet commenced widespread marketing efforts of the NuGene Line, however we are in the process of developing relationships with distributors to provide access to national and international channels of distribution.

STRATEGY
 
In our view, anti-aging products represent (and will continue to represent) a significant portion of the facial skincare market. In key markets, we believe that the facial skincare market is positioned for significant growth with limited downside risks from the overall condition of the economy. In order to make claims that products can diminish the signs of aging, marketers are constantly looking for new combinations of specialty ingredients. The category of skincare products based on biotechnology such as human stem cell is in our view just beginning to be developed, and therefore we expect that it has significant growth potential. Our goal is to leverage our knowledge in human adult stem cell technology to develop and commercialize advanced anti-aging skincare and hair growth products for the retail and professional channels. We intend to develop, manufacture, and market cosmetic skin care and hair products to address this significant market opportunity.
 
We plan to continue to sell our NuGene Line of products domestically and internationally through professional channels, including dermatologists, plastic surgeons, medical offices, and day and resort spas. We also expect to directly market our product through television sales-dedicated channels. We plan to promote brand awareness through advertising, our own sales personnel, other marketing and public relations. We will also partially rely upon the name recognition of Kathy Ireland secured under the License Agreement discussed below. We propose to further expand our sales efforts through our branded website (www.nugene.com) and additional online commerce channels.
 
In addition to our product enhancement and marketing activities, our success will also depend on our ability to develop and protect our proprietary technology. We intend to rely on a combination of patent, trade secret and know-how, copyright and trademark laws, as well as confidentiality agreements, licensing agreements and other agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Our success will also depend upon our ability to avoid infringing upon the proprietary rights of others.
 
OUR PRODUCTS
 
All of our products listed below have been formulated, fully developed and are currently being marketed. We have formulated and are testing other products which we expect to introduce (financial resources permitting) once we complete product testing and preparation of marketing materials. None of our products are licensed from third parties.  All of products are either protected by patents for which we have applied, or derived from trade secrets and proprietary formulas.

Wound Care-Wound Healing; Biopharma Products
 
In 2014, we initiated research and formulation for a new topical burn cream for treatment of burns that we expect may reduce infection and could improve healing time. Burns are the fourth most common type of trauma worldwide according to RNCOS research. Despite recent advances in wound management, infection continues to be a significant problem in treating burns. This has resulted in the routine use of prophylactic topical antimicrobial agents. The most common topical antimicrobial agent used is silver sulfadiazine cream. However, the side effects of delayed wound healing have remained a challenge to overcome.
 
Tissue healing research has demonstrated adipose-derived stem cell culture conditioned media exhibit human dermal fibroblast proliferation and enhanced secretion of type I, III collagen and fibronectin. These properties are well suited for dermal wound healing. In order to develop and bring this product to market, we intend to work with a contract manufacturer to combine the product with our stem cell media technology. The preclinical FDA work we will need to have completed consists of in vitro and in vivo efficacy studies, experimental toxicology testing, formulation study, storage condition, stability testing, and ensuring Good Manufacturing Practices are all followed in the manufacturing process. This topical product will require FDA approval and we can give no assurance that we will obtain that approval.
 
STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS AND LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS
 
kiWW License Agreement
 
In November 2014, we entered into a License Agreement with kathy ireland Worldwide® ("kiWW®") whereby we licensed the right to utilize the trademarks and rights to the name, likeness and visual representations of Kathy Ireland in connection with our cosmeceutical line of products containing adult human adipose stem cell derived or containing biologically active or biologically derived ingredients. The initial term of the license is for eight years and it may be renewed for up to an additional four years.
 
In accordance with the License Agreement, we are required to submit a Business Plan to kiWW® within ninety days of the effective date of the License Agreement. We have submitted our Business Plan to the Licensor within the required time frame and received the necessary approvals. The License Agreement defines the Licensed Products as those NuGene products containing stem cell derived or containing biologically active or biologically derived ingredients including: NuGene Face Wash, NuGene Universal Cream, NuGene Universal Serum, NuGene Light and Bright, NuGene Eye Serum, NuGene Anti-Hair Loss Serum, NuGene Regenerative Shampoo & Conditioner, and Advanced Infusion Serums as well as the following products which have not yet been commercially launched and/or developed: NuGene FaceMask, NuGene Melasma Serum, NuGene Acne Serum, NuGene Revitalizing Night Cream, NuGene Toner, NuGene Body Lotion, NuGene Specialty Soap, NuGene Neck and Décolleté Lotion, and other age defying products that are stem cell derived or which contain biologically active or biologically derived ingredients. On March 5, 2015, we announced the launch of the NuGene kathy ireland ® brand. The campaign includes a re-branded internet presence and new videos featuring Ms. Ireland. We have initiated the launch of a larger multi-media campaign to promote the product line.
 
NuGene is obligated to utilize commercially reasonable efforts to meet the following minimum totals of net sales of Licensed Products for the specified periods:

Once the minimum royalties, as noted above, are paid, we pay royalties in the amount of 5% of net sales of products under the License Agreement, and an additional royalty payment in the amount of 1% of net sales of products under the License Agreement sold to purchasers introduced to NuGene by kiWW.
 
Additionally, we are obligated to pay an annual Brand Participation fee to kiWW® which provides for general advertising, goodwill and promotion of the overall kathy ireland brand. NuGene paid kiWW $350,000 effective upon execution of the License. This onetime fee includes a "Brand Participation" fee for Contract Year 1. Brand Participation fees for Contract Years 2 through 8 are $50,000 annually with an additional 1% of the total gross sales of Licensed Products of the prior year beginning in Contract Year 4.
 
This description of the License Agreement is a summary and does not purport to describe all material conditions, obligations and payments that are the responsibility of NuGene to the Licensor. The description provided of the License Agreement in this Annual Report is qualified in its entirety by reference to the License Agreement attached as an Exhibit to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on January 6, 2015, and that agreement is incorporated herein by this reference as if fully set forth herein Report.
 
The Company and kiWW have recently been in discussions to address and resolve issues and problems under the License Agreement, which includes the Company’s failure to timely tender certain payments under the License Agreement.  In order to settle all disputes under the License Agreement and to confirm their commitment to each other under the License Agreement, on 03 February 2017 the Company finalized and executed a Confirmation and Continuation Agreement (the “Confirmation Agreement”) with kiWW. Pursuant to the Confirmation Agreement, the Company is obligated to provide the following consideration: (i) Pay the sum of $50,000 to settle a lawsuit in which the Company, kiWW, and other parties are named as defendants (the Company previously paid the $50,000 and the litigation has been dismissed); (ii) Issue to kiWW warrants in the form of a Common Stock Purchase Warrant to acquire 3,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock (the warrant expires five years from the date of issuance and is exercisable for $0.01 per share, with a cash-less exercise option); (iii) Issue to kiWW 500,000 restricted shares of the Company’s common stock, which will be subject to the same lock-up agreement placed on executives of the Company pursuant to the Company’s proposed public offering under this Registration Statement; and, (iv) Upon the earlier of 30 June 2017, or the closing of the Company’s proposed public offering under this Registration Statement, the Company shall pay to kiWW $50,000. Pursuant to the Confirmation Agreement, kiWW is obligated as follows: (x) kiWW agrees that the Company has performed, paid, and otherwise satisfied all of its obligations under the License Agreement for calendar year 2016; (ii) kiWW agrees that as of the end of calendar year 2016, the Company was not in breach of the License Agreement in any respect; and, (iii) kiWW ratifies and confirms the License Agreement, and that it shall continue in full force and effect.
 
Advisory Board
 
In an effort to improve our product line and retain the latest and most forward looking state of the art services, the Company has assembled an Advisory Board consisting of Board Certified Dermatologists and Plastic Surgeons consisting of medical professionals whom the Company believes are leaders in their respective fields. We anticipate that our Advisory Board members, among other things, will provide us with strategic and business development ideas, insight into major trends in the highly competitive cosmeceutical marketplace and input regarding their specific expertise.
COMPETITION 
 
NuGene experiences and will experience intense competition from companies developing cosmeceuticals with stem cell derived active ingredients as well other ingredients. Our pharmaceutical division competes or will compete with companies developing stem cell based pharmaceuticals. Our cosmeceutical line of products also competes with other companies that offer a plant derived stem cell skin care line or stem-cell derived extracts. Many of these companies have substantially greater financial, technological, research and development, marketing and personnel resources.

In order to successfully compete with larger and better funded brands, the Company employs a strategy of developing products that are either proprietary or have some unique characteristics. All of our products combine in-house advancements, proprietary, and patent pending technologies and formulations. We believe that our use of well accepted, adult human stem cell derived conditioned media obtained through adipose derived stem cells gives us a competitive advantage against competitors seeking to use controversial human stem cells derived from bone marrow and other sources. Our patent pending adipose derived stem cell culture process also provides us with a low cost, high yield output for production.


Adipose derived stem cells are also called mesenchymal, or in simpler terms, “adult stem cells”. Adult stem cells are limited to categorization by their tissue of origin. Stem cells which are present in fat are called adipose stem cells. This is entirely different from embryonic stem cells, which are found in embryos and subject to significant ethical issues. The foremost mechanism by which adult stem cells participate in repair of the human body is related to the secretion of trophic factors. They provide a microenvironment with the production of a wide range of growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines, all of which are broadly defined as the stem cell secretomes or biomolecules. The secretomes are well preserved in their biological conformation and effectiveness in the fat tissue or when cultured in a tissue culture plate.

NuGene uses adipose stem cells. These stem cells are cultivated in a plastic flask fed with a liquid solution mix composed of amino acids and other nutrients. This promotes the cells to attach to the flask, thrive, divide, and grow in an incubator which mimics the human body environment. This is process is called stem cell culture. In the process of dividing and growing, these stem cells secrete a vast array of secretomes or biomolecules which are functionally and structurally similar to the ones produced in their host tissue (fat). This solution, with secreted biomolecules, is called stem cell derived condition media. Since the source of the cells is fat, which is mesenchymal/adult in nature, this media is also called as adult stem cell derived conditioned media. This conditioned media is a pure solution of secretomes and does not contain any dead or live stem cells. This conditioned media is then processed and used in NuGene’s proprietary formulations, providing a competitive advantage to NuGene.

There are many large, integrated, and established pharmaceutical, specialty chemical, personal care, and health care companies that have greater capacity than us to develop and to commercialize types of products which would be competitive to ours. The Company believes that manufacturing, regulatory, distribution and marketing expertise will be increasingly important competitive factors in favor of the Company. In this regard, the Company believes that its management and contractors it has engaged provide it with a competitive advantage.
 
Our marketing strategy seeks to employ a dual approach of offering both a direct to consumer line of products and a professional line of product. Our consumer brand has the competitive advantage of using the Kathy Ireland name and brand. We will also employ the most efficient media buying and direct to consumer techniques to create awareness in the most cost efficient manner possible. Our professional line of products will benefit from Key Opinion Leader studies; clinical studies; and, the engagement of sales network professionals with a proven history of success in our market segment.
 
While we have experienced slow growth in the sales of our products, we believe that is a direct result of our lack of available cash. The proceeds we seek to obtain through the public offering under this Registration Statement should provide us with the cash resources to effectively market our products. We believe that we will be able to effectively compete on the basis of product quality and reliability, cost of production, technical capability, product innovation, and customer service. We believe that we will further improve our competitive position by utilizing contract manufacturers to further lower our overhead and cost of production.
 
GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION 
 
U.S. Government Regulation 
 
The health care industry is highly regulated in the United States. The federal government, through various departments and agencies, state and local governments, and private third-party accreditation organizations regulate and monitor the health care industry, associated products, and operations. The following is a general overview of the laws and regulations pertaining to our business. 
FDA Regulation of Stem Cell Treatment and Products 
 
The FDA regulates the manufacture of human stem cell treatments and associated products under the authority of the Public Health Safety Act (“PHSA”) and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”). Stem cell derived products can be regulated under FDA’s Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products Regulations (“HCT/Ps”), or may also be subject to FDA’s drug, biological product, or medical device regulations.
Cosmetic and Skin Care Regulation 
 
Depending upon product claims and formulation, skin care products may be regulated as cosmetics, drugs, devices, or combination cosmetics and drugs. We currently only market cosmetic skin care products and are evaluating entry into the pharmaceutical market. The FDA has authority to regulate cosmetics marketed in the United States under the FDCA and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (“FPLA”) and implementing regulations. The Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) regulates the advertising of cosmetics under the FTCA. 
 
The FDCA prohibits the marketing of adulterated and misbranded cosmetics. Cosmetic ingredients must also comply with the FDA’s ingredient, quality, and labeling requirements and the FTC’s requirements pertaining to truthful and non-misleading advertising. Cosmetic products and ingredients, with the exception of color additives, are not required to have FDA premarket approval. Manufacturers of cosmetics are also not required to register their establishments, file data on ingredients, or report cosmetic-related injuries to the FDA.

-

 

We are required to substantiate the safety and product claims of our cosmetic products and ingredients before marketing. The FDA or FTC may disagree with our characterization of one or more of the skin care products as a cosmetic or the product claims. This could result in a variety of enforcement actions which could require the reformulation or relabeling of our products, the submission of information in support of the product claims or the safety and effectiveness of our products, or more punitive action, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. If the FDA determines we have failed to comply with applicable requirements under the FDCA or FPLA, it can impose a variety of enforcement actions from public warning letters, injunctions, consent decrees, and civil penalties to seizure of our products, total or partial shutdown of our production, and criminal prosecutions. If any of these events were to occur, it could materially adversely affect us. If the FTC determines we have failed to substantiate our claims, it can pursue a variety of actions including disgorgement of profits, injunction from further violative conduct, and consent decrees.

Some types of skin-care products are regulated as both cosmetics and drugs under the FDCA. Examples of drug-cosmetic combination products are facial moisturizers that contain sunscreen and skin protectant hand lotions. Products that are both cosmetics and drugs because of ingredients or intended use must satisfy the regulatory requirements for both cosmetics and drugs. The drug requirements include either FDA premarket approval under an NDA or an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”), or, more typically, implicit approval through conformance with the applicable FDA final regulation (also known as an over-the-counter drug monograph) that specifies the conditions that must be met for the drug to be generally recognized as safe and effective.  
 
At present, we do not anticipate that any of the products we market will be regulated as a combination cosmetic and drug or solely as a drug or device. However, the FDA may disagree with such a determination which could result in a variety of enforcement actions and significant additional expenditure to comply with regulations which the FDA may deem applicable to such products. We are in the process of researching new products that may be classified as combination cosmetics and drugs which would require FDA approval. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 13 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Domestic State and Local Government Regulation 
 
Some states and local governments in the United States regulate the labeling, operation, sale, and distribution of our skin care products. To the extent additional state or local laws apply, we intend to comply with them.Foreign Government Regulation 
 
In general, we will need to comply with the government regulations of each individual country in which our products are to be distributed and sold. These regulations vary in complexity and can be as stringent, and on occasion even more stringent, than FDA regulations in the United States. The level of complexity and stringency is not always precisely understood today for each country, creating greater uncertainty for the international regulatory process. Furthermore, government regulations can change with little to no notice and may result in increased regulation of our product(s), resulting in a greater regulatory burden for us. We have not yet thoroughly explored the applicable laws and regulations that we will need to comply with in foreign jurisdictions. As a result, it is possible that we may not be permitted to sell our products in foreign markets or expand our business into one or more foreign jurisdictions.
THE SCIENCE BEHIND OUR PRODUCTS
 
Human Stem Cells
 
Cells are the basic living units that make up humans, animals, plants and other organisms. Stem cells have two important characteristics that distinguish them from other types of cells. First, they can renew themselves for long periods of time. Second, they are unspecialized and under certain conditions can be induced to become cells with special functions such as metabolically active cells of the liver or transparent and protective cells of the eye. Until recently, scientists have worked with two major kinds of stem cells, embryonic stem cells and adult stem cells each category of which has different properties and characteristics.
 
Adipose Stem Cell-Derived Media
 
We use human fat tissue (adipose tissue) to derive adult human stem cells. Adipose stem cell derived growth factors have been shown to contribute to exerting diverse regenerative effects on skin cells. These growth factors help in stimulating collagen synthesis and migration of dermal fibroblasts (a major contributor in skin repair, regeneration, and revitalization). Using a proprietary technique for the isolation of these cytokines from adipose derived stem cells, NuGene has been able to incorporate these proteins into its cosmeceutical line of products.
Peptides
 
Peptides are molecular links of amino acids that help your skin to produce the anti-wrinkle protein known as collagen. Peptides are closely related to proteins. Peptides and proteins are present in every living cell and are responsible for many biochemical activities including acting in enzymes, hormones, antibiotics, etc. Peptides are listed in many better skin care products, and they perform important functions in the skin. As people age, they lose collagen which results in sagging and wrinkled skin. Since collagen is a protein composed of long chains of amino acids linked together by peptide bonds, peptides play an important role in replacing lost collagen. As collagen breaks down, the protein chains break up into smaller chains of peptides. The resulting peptide chains send signals to the body to produce more collagen. Since peptides are small, they can penetrate the skin’s protective barriers. Applying peptides directly to the skin through good skin care products tricks the skin into thinking that it has lost collagen recently and needs to produce more. Research has identified a number of peptides which mimic the function of the naturally produced growth factors in the human body. The advantage of using peptides over growth factors in skin care formula is their stability, but they are not complete in structural integrity as expressed by proteins in vivo.

Production of Growth Factors
 
NuGene has been able to produce a sufficient quantity of biologically active growth factors derived from adipose stem cells to meet its current product requirements. With patent-pending technology, the process has achieved a high yield rate and superior quality of biomolecules. Our purification technique enables NuGene to have a high concentration of growth factors and cytokines in our skincare line.
Nano-encapsulation
 
One of the material challenges of the skincare science is the delivery of the active ingredients to the skin. At NuGene, we met this challenge by using proprietary nano-encapsulation technology. This technology allowed us to effectively deliver adipose stem cell derived cytokines and growth factors through embedding them within a nanosome or capsule. This added step enhances the penetration of these biomolecules into the skin cells. Additionally, it prevents these growth factors/cytokines from becoming degraded by proteases present in the mixture. We believe this enhances the effectiveness of our products.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 
We have invested, and continue to invest, significantly in intellectual properties, which consist of patents, trademarks, proprietary formulas and trade secrets, and URLs. We have a program to file applications for and obtain patents in the United States and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate. There are certain processes and applications which we wish to keep confidential; we do not seek patent protection for such items. We currently have four U.S. provisional patent applications, and four pending international applications based on the same four U.S. provisional patents. The principal claims made in these applications cover wound scar and burn treatment creams, the methods of preparing stem cells and the formulations for stem cell media containing products. There are currently no patents issued in favor of the Company.
 
The following summarizes our pending applications:
 

• | AK01 skin treatment formulations application describes and claims dermal treatment compositions include medium recovered from an adipose-derived stem cell culture where the medium is collected under defined conditions. The medium includes growth factors and other materials that, when transported to living portions of the skin, improve the condition of damaged or aged skin. The compositions include combinations of transport ingredients in controlled proportions for effective topical application.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | AK03-WO burn, scar, and wound treatment creams application describes and claims dermal treatment compositions include an emollient base, a conditioned medium, and a nanosilver particulate. The conditioned medium may be harvested from culture of human adipocyte-derived stem cells. The stem cells may be cultured in the presence of the nanosilver particulate. In other embodiments, the stem cells are cultured in medium that does not contain a nanosilver particulate. Instead the conditioned medium is compounded with the nanosilver particulate after the media is harvested from the stem cell culture.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | AK04 burn, scar, and wound healing aids and bandages application describes and claims bandages combining sterile dressings with a composition including a conditioned medium. The conditioned medium may be nanoencapsulated or may be dispersed in an emollient base and applied to the sterile dressing. The conditioned medium may be harvested from culture of human adipocyte-derived stem cells. The nanoencapsulated conditioned medium may be washed and resuspended before applying to the sterile dressing. The emollient base may include defined proportions of oils and emulsifying agents.

• | NG06 wound, wrinkle, and blemish treatment dressings application claims priority (benefits from the earlier filing of) two of the Company’s earlier U.S. Provisional applications. The NG06 application describes and claims inventions relating to electroactive dressings and bandages. These inventions combine electroactive sterile dressings and the Company's proprietary human adipose-derived stem cell culture media. Human adipose-derived stem cells produce a variety of growth-promoting and healing materials such as growth factors and cytokines. Electroactive wound dressings produce local electric fields by providing electrical half cells in proximity to treated skin. The inventions combine the benefits of the growth factors and the localized electric fields to a localized region of the body.

The device of the invention includes dressings having a cathode and an anode, each forming an electrical half-cell, and a conductive treatment gel containing HADSCC media. The treatment gel may also contain human adipose-derived stem cells. The method includes providing a treatment gel and a dressing, applying the treatment gel to the skin or to the dressing, and applying the dressing to the skin. Other embodiments include bandages combining sterile dressings with a composition including a conditioned medium. The conditioned medium may be nanoencapsulated or may be dispersed in an emollient base and applied to the sterile dressing.
 
EMPLOYEES
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had 10 employees, all of which were full time employees. None of our employees is represented by a labor union, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good. It is possible that the Company will outsource many functions so we cannot estimate whether there will be a significant increase in the number of employees. It is likely, however, that we will need to increase the number of employees in the general and administrative and business development areas over the next two years, as well as for our research and development activities.
DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY
 
Our corporate offices are currently located at 17912 Cowan, Suite A, Irvine, California, 92614. We sublease our sole corporate facilities from ASP, an affiliate of our Company, for approximately $17,109 per month (including common area maintenance), consistent with the amount that is charged to ASP by the property owner. On February 5, 2015, ASP entered into a new five-year lease for the property with the owner beginning July 1, 2015 and subsequently amended to begin June 1, 2015. The lease was subsequently amended to increase the square footage under lease beginning in January 2016. The lease includes annual increases in the monthly lease payments of approximately 3% each year.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
 
On July 10, 2015, Stemage Skin Care, LLC (the “Plaintiff”) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entitled “Stemage Skin Care LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company vs. NuGene International, Inc. et al.” (Civil Action No.8:15-cv-01078-AG-JCG). The complaint also names as defendants NuGene, Inc., Ali Kharazmi, Saeed Kharazmi, Kathy Ireland Worldwide, Stephen Roseberry, Steve Rosenblum and Erik Sterling. The complaint contains allegations of damage asserted to be grounded on: (i) copyright infringement; (ii) interference with contract; (iii) intentional interference with prospective economic advantage; (iv) negligent interference with prospective economic advantage; and (v) conspiracy. The complaint allegedly arises out of an August 20, 2012 agreement among the Plaintiff and kathy ireland inc. (“KI”) pursuant to which KI made Kathy Ireland available to perform “Ambassador Services” as defined within that agreement. That agreement effectively terminated in October 2014 and is the subject of a separate arbitration with KI and Kathy Ireland before the American Arbitration Association. On or around August 4, 2016 the Company settled the litigation. All parties to this litigation executed a settlement agreement resolving and waiving all claims, with a full dismissal, with prejudice, of the action. Pursuant to the settlement, in December 2016 the Company paid the total sum of $50,000 to the Plaintiff.
 
On July 31, 2015 Star Health & Beauty, LLC (“SH&B”) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia entitled “Star Health & Beauty, LLC vs. NuGene, Inc. and NuGene International, Inc. Defendants” (Case No. 1:15-cv-02634-CAP). The complaint alleges that our use of the NuGene name and trademark infringes on SH&B’s NUGEN name. SH&B seeks cancelation of our NuGene trademark, as well as unspecified monetary damages. In February, 2017 the parties agreed upon terms to settle the matter, subject to execution of a definitive written settlement agreement to include the following terms: (i) $60,000 to be paid by the Company to SH&B, in installments of $5,000 upon execution of a Settlement Agreement, $25,000 90-days thereafter, and $30,000 60-days thereafter; (ii) issuance of 125,000 shares of the Company’s common stock to SH&B upon execution of a Settlement Agreement; (iii) each side continues to use their names as the wish; (iv) full mutual releases of known and unknown claims; (v) each bears its respective cost of litigation; and, (vi) dismissal with prejudice of the action. The written Settlement Agreement is being finalized and should be executed within the next 30 days.
 
In May 2016, we were informed that the California Labor Commissioner scheduled a hearing in connection with two individuals that claimed our Company did not fulfill its obligations to pay a final paycheck. The two individuals are seeking back pay and penalties totaling approximately $31,000. A trial/hearing was scheduled for March 14, 2017 to decide each matter. In February 2017 we settled both matters. In exchange for a complete release from the first claimant, we will pay the first claimant a total of $9,000 in accordance with the following schedule: $4,500 on or before March 10, 2017; four additional payments of $1,000 each on the 15th day of April, May, June, and July 2017; and, a final payment of $500 on or before the 15th day of August. In exchange for a complete release from the second claimant, we will pay the second claimant a total of $4,000 on or before March 10, 2017.

On May 6, 2016, we were presented with a demand for payment of compensation for a former executive employee (the “Former Executive”) pursuant to his employment contract with our Company. The amount of the compensation claimed by the Former Executive totaled $49,998. The Company’s management is evaluating the merits of this matter. We believe that no amounts are due to the Former Executive and we have not accrued a liability as of December 31, 2016.
 
In December, 2016, we were informed by the four holders of our promissory notes totaling $480,000 (the “Holders”) that they would not honor their obligation to provide an additional $600,000 in similar financing. The Holders allege that certain breaches of the notes by the Company relieve them of their obligation. The Company firmly believes there is no merit whatsoever to the claims of the Holders. Rather than pursue litigation against the Holders, the Company has elected to pursue other sources of financing. However, should the Holders seek any acceleration or damages of any kind under the Notes, NuGene is committed to aggressively protect its rights, including though not limited to seeking damages from the Holders.


On February 24, 2017, we were informed that the Company will need to respond to a lawsuit filed by Habib American Bank (“Habib”) in the Superior Court of California, County of Orange. The action names Advanced Surgical Partners, LLC (“ASP”) as a defendant, as well as a number of additional named parties including though not limited to NuGene, Inc.; our Chairman of the Board, Mohammad Ali Kharazmi (“Ali”); and, our Chief Financial Officer and Board Member, Mohammad Saeed Kharazmi (“Saeed”). The action is based on a purported default under a commercial loan from Habib to ASP on or around January, 2008 (the “Loan”). According to the complaint, ASP currently owes Habib approximately $2.7 million under the Loan and that ASP has defaulted on the Loan. The Loan was arranged by Ali on behalf of ASP. Ali and Saeed are owners of, and control, ASP; they are also guarantors on the Loan. Additional family members of Ali and Saeed are alleged to be additional guarantors on the Loan, as are additional business entities owned by, or affiliated with, Ali and Saeed. The Loan is secured, in part, by the pledge of real estate owned by family members of Ali and Saeed (the “Pledged Real Estate”). A Deed of Trust was recorded by Habib against the Pledged Real Estate, and there appears to be more than sufficient equity in the Pledged Real Estate to pay off the Loan. NuGene is also alleged to be an additional guarantor on the Loan. A thorough search of NuGene records and files has failed to yield any documents or indication that NuGene was in fact a guarantor on the Loan. The Company has no documentation of the Loan or its purported guaranty, and there was no business relationship between ASP and NuGene which would suggest that a guaranty would have been provided. There was no prior knowledge by the Company of the existence of the Loan or the purported guaranty. Ali has steadfastly rejected the existence of the guaranty and has affirmatively assured the Company that he never authorized NuGene to guaranty the Loan, and that he never signed any documents on behalf of NuGene regarding the Loan. At this time, the Company intends to aggressively defend its rights and reject any status as a guarantor of the Loan. We believe that the Company’s risk and liability exposure under the Loan is minimal based upon (i) good faith and evidentiary defenses; and, (ii) the fact that there is more than adequate value/equity in the Pledged Real Estate to pay off the loan.
 
On April 4, 2017, Habib agreed to dismiss the Company from the litigation brought by Habib. A formal Settlement Agreement and Release has been executed by and between the Company and Habib.
 
Other than that described above, we are not currently a party to any other material legal proceedings. We are not aware of any pending or threatened litigation against us that in our view would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, or operating results. However, legal claims are inherently uncertain, and we cannot assure you that we will not be adversely affected in the future by legal proceedings.
