ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 Broadmark Realty Capital Inc. (“Broadmark Realty,” “the Company,” “we,” “us” and “our”), a Maryland corporation, is an internally managed commercial real estate finance company that has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with its taxable year ended December 31, 2019. Based in Seattle, Washington, we specialize in underwriting, funding, servicing and managing a portfolio generally consisting of short-term, first deed of trust loans to fund the construction and development of, or investment in, residential or commercial properties.
We generally operate in states that we believe to have favorable demographic trends and that provide more efficient and quicker access to collateral in the event of borrower default. As of December 31, 2022, our portfolio of 202 active loans had approximately $1.4 billion of total commitments and $931.0 million of principal outstanding across 162 borrowers in 20 states and the District of Columbia. We refer to loans that have outstanding commitments or principal balances that have not been repaid or retired, including loans in foreclosure, as “active loans.” Total commitments refer to the aggregate sum of outstanding principal balances, interest reserves and construction holdbacks which includes capital expenditures required to complete construction for defaulted loans that we are no longer required to pay. Historically, our loan portfolio was 100% equity funded, and we had no outstanding debt. On November 12, 2021, we closed the private placement of $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.0% senior unsecured notes due 2026. We may opportunistically issue debt and raise capital in the public and private markets from time to time based on market conditions to fund the growth of our portfolio and produce attractive returns for our stockholders. On February 19, 2021, we closed on a $135.0 million revolving credit facility, which has enabled us to use a larger percentage of our cash balances for lending activities.
 Properties securing our loans are generally classified as residential properties, commercial properties or land, and are typically not income producing. Each loan is generally secured by a first deed of trust lien on real estate. Our lending policy typically limits the committed amount of each loan to a maximum loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratio of up to 65% of the “as-complete” appraised value of the underlying collateral as determined by an independent appraiser at the time of the loan origination. Our lending policy also typically limits the initial outstanding principal balance of each loan to a maximum LTV of up to 65% of the “as-is” appraised value of the underlying collateral as determined by an independent appraiser at the time of the loan origination. At the time of origination, the difference between the initial outstanding principal and the total commitment is the amount held back for future release, subject to property inspections, progress reports and other conditions in accordance with the loan documents. Unless otherwise indicated, LTV is measured by the total commitment amount of the loan at origination divided by the “as-complete” appraisal. LTVs do not reflect interim activity such as construction draws or interest payments capitalized to loans, or partial repayments of the loan. As of December 31, 2022, the weighted average LTV was 60.6% across our active loan portfolio, based on the total commitment of the loan and “as-complete” appraisals as of origination or latest amendment of the loans. Loans in contractual default are designated as non-performing as we have some expectation that the repayment of the loan may not be realized in full. For our loans in contractual default status as of December 31, 2022, the weighted average LTV was approximately 124.8%, when measured by the sum of the principal outstanding, the estimated cost to complete and the accounts receivable for which collectability is reasonably assured, divided by the most recent “as-complete” appraisal. The weighted average LTV of our loans in contractual default net of our allowance for credit losses was approximately 84.9%. In addition, our loans are often personally guaranteed by the principals of the borrower or affiliated parties at our discretion to provide further credit support for the loan. The loan may also be secured by collateral through a pledge of the guarantor’s interest in other real estate or assets owned by the guarantor. Credit enhancements are excluded from the LTV calculation unless they are senior secured positions in real estate. As of December 31, 2022, a total of 40 loans were in contractual default, totaling $250.4 million in principal outstanding, or 26.9% of our aggregate principal outstanding. We are actively identifying resolutions for our non-performing loans but continue to face challenges in the current environment. We expect our non-performing loans to negatively affect our near-term financial performance.
 As of December 31, 2022, the average total commitment of our active loans was $7.0 million with a weighted average interest rate of 10.2%. The weighted average term outstanding of our active loans was 22 months, which we often elect to extend based on our evaluation of the expected timeline for completion of construction. We usually receive loan origination fees, or “points,” which as of December 31, 2022, had a weighted average fee of 2.7% of total commitment at origination, along with loan amendment and extension fees, each of which varies in amount based upon the term of the loan, the credit quality of the borrower and the loan otherwise satisfying our underwriting criteria. In addition, we charge late fees on past due receivables and receive reimbursements from borrowers for costs associated with services provided by us, such as closing costs, collection costs on defaulted loans and construction draw inspection fees.


Broadmark Realty Capital Inc.
 
Our typical borrowers include real estate investors, developers and other commercial borrowers. We do not lend to owner-occupants of residential real estate. Loan proceeds are generally used to fund the vertical construction, horizontal development, investment, land acquisition and refinancing of residential properties and commercial properties. We also make loans to fund the renovation and rehabilitation of residential and commercial properties. Our loans are generally structured with an initial advance at closing and additional loan installments disbursed to the borrower upon satisfactory completion of previously agreed stages of construction.
 A principal source of new transactions has been repeat business from our customers and their referral of new business. We also receive leads for new business from real estate brokers and mortgage brokers, a limited amount of advertising and through our website.
 We seek to preserve capital through our disciplined underwriting standards. We originate and fund loans generally secured by first deed of trust liens on residential and commercial real estate located in states that we believe have favorable demographic trends and that provide more efficient and quicker access to collateral in the event of borrower default.
We built our business on a deep knowledge of the residential and commercial real estate market combined with a risk management approach that is designed to protect and preserve capital. We believe our flexibility and ability to structure loans that address the needs of our borrowers without compromising our standards on risk, our expertise in the loan market and our focus on newly originated first deed of trust loans have been the basis for our success.
 We primarily compete on the basis of borrower relationships, loan structure, terms and service rather than on price. Additionally, starting in 2021, competitive pressures have led us in many cases to originate loans with terms that deviate from our historical practice. Increased competition and readily available sources of capital through 2021 and into mid 2022 led to lower interest rates on our originated loans in those periods, lower loan origination fees, absence of minimum interest provisions in our mortgage notes, and a change in our general requirement that all of our loans be secured by personal guarantees on a recourse basis.
In the latter part of the third quarter of 2022 and continuing into the fourth quarter of 2022, market interest rates have risen markedly and rapidly as a result of the Federal Reserve's actions to curb rising inflation. This led to a significant slowdown in real estate transactions and less capital available in the marketplace to finance real estate projects. Rising interest rates and macroeconomic uncertainties in the capital markets have led to a decrease in the availability of capital from traditional lenders for longer-term financing of completed construction and development projects, which may negatively affect our borrowers' ability to sell or refinance their loan collateral and repay our loans.
We have tightened our lending standards and, in some instances, we are not originating loans that have previously met our lending policy. We are focused on capital preservation and ensuring we are positioned to capture opportunities that emerge from this rapidly changing economic environment.
As a result of rising interest rates and associated pressures to service or refinance their debt capital, we have started to see many of our competitors slow or pause their loan origination activities. This may lead to decreased competition and pricing pressure on our loan origination activities, although there are no assurances that this will take place. In addition, we continue to believe that the demand/supply imbalance for residential construction-related real estate loans presents significant opportunities for us over the long-term to selectively originate high-quality first deed of trust loans on attractive terms.
 
Markets
 At December 31, 2022, we have active loans in 20 states and the District of Columbia with the majority of loans located in Washington, Colorado, Utah and Texas. We strategically focus on these states as they have exhibited strong population growth. At December 31, 2022, more than 70% of our portfolio was secured by properties located in states ranked in the top ten for migration for the two year period of 2021 and 2022 according to the Census Bureau, including Washington, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Texas, Florida and Idaho. Additionally, each of Washington, Colorado, Utah, Texas, Oregon and Idaho are non-judicial foreclosure states, which we believe encourages borrowers to comply with the loan terms and provides us the option to take control of the collateral more quickly in the event of borrower default.
Broadmark Realty Capital Inc.
 
Industry and Market Opportunity
 
Real estate investment is a capital-intensive business that typically relies heavily on debt capital to acquire, develop, improve, construct, renovate and maintain properties. We focus on providing construction, development and investment loans for the U.S. housing and real estate industries. Due to structural changes in banking, regulation and monetary policies over the last decade, there has been a reduction in the number of conventional lenders extending credit for acquisition, construction and development loans. We believe there continues to be a significant market opportunity to originate real estate loans secured by the underlying real estate as collateral. Our management team further believes that the demand for relatively small real estate loans to construct, develop or invest in residential or commercial real estate, located in states with favorable demographic trends presents a compelling opportunity to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns.
 As a result of limited residential housing supply, net migration trends and tightening of credit for our highly leveraged competitors, we believe the longer-term outlook for new housing demand in our markets remains strong. Per the U.S. Census Bureau, construction spending, measured as construction put in place, totaled $1.8 trillion in 2022, an increase of 10.2% over 2021. With the continued housing deficit expected in 2023 and beyond, as construction costs continue to stabilize and both buyers and sellers settling in on the normalcy of higher rates, we believe the back half of 2023 will be positive for the construction and real estate industry.
Business and Growth Strategy
 Our objective is to preserve and protect stockholder capital while producing attractive risk-adjusted returns primarily through dividends generated by current income from our loan portfolio. Our business strategy is to directly originate, fund, manage and service short-term loans secured by first mortgage liens on real property to enable us to generate attractive returns.
We believe our ability to react quickly and have flexibility in terms of structuring loans to meet the needs of borrowers, consistency and expediency in funding future construction draws, intimate knowledge of the relevant markets in which we operate and general focus on newly originated first deed of trust loans positions us to generate strong and consistent income. Our strategy to achieve our objective and grow our business includes the following:
 •continue to increase market share in existing states to satisfy unmet demand;
 •increase geographic footprint by focusing on states with favorable economic and demographic trends that provide efficient access to collateral in the event of borrower default;
 •capitalize on opportunities created by the long-term structural changes in the real estate lending market resulting from consolidation and increased regulatory oversight of commercial banks and savings institutions;
 •utilize the relative strength of our balance sheet to grow our customer and asset base while competitors with weaker balance sheets may be capital constrained;
 •maximize earnings generation from deployed capital through timely resolution of loans in contractual default;
 •optimize working capital through efficient cash management and the use of our revolving credit facility;
 •fund growth via strategic and structured capital sourcing to gradually lower our weighted average cost of capital while maintaining modest leverage relative to our peers;
 •remain flexible in order to capitalize on changing sets of investment opportunities that may be present in various points of an economic cycle; and
 •operate so as to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes and distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income.

Operations Overview
 Loan Origination and Due Diligence
 We are experienced in secured lending, with substantial combined real estate and financial services experience. Our senior management team spends a significant portion of its time on development of borrower relationships as well as on underwriting and structuring the loans in our portfolio. A principal source of our new transactions has been repeat business from existing and former customers and their referral of new business. We are a collateral-based lender and when underwriting a prospective loan, the primary focus of our analysis includes the current and finished property, the borrower’s experience and existing equity in the project and local market conditions. Prior to making a final decision on a loan application, we conduct extensive due diligence of the property as well as of the borrower and its principals.
 The mortgage loans that we originate generally meet the following criteria:
 •Collateral. New loans are generally secured by a first deed of trust lien on real estate.
 •Amount. The average total commitment of our active loans was $7.0 million at December 31, 2022. Our lending policy limits exposure to any single borrower or guarantor to 15% of our total assets.
 •Loan to Value. The LTV ratio for a loan at origination is typically no more than 65% of the “as-complete” or “as-stabilized” appraised value of the underlying collateral on the basis of total loan commitment. The maximum initial outstanding principal balance of the loan at origination is typically 65% of the “as-is” appraised value of the underlying collateral, in each case as determined by an independent appraiser at the time of the loan origination.
 •Interest rate. Our portfolio weighted average interest rate was 10.2% at December 31, 2022 with a late fee of 10% of the principal and receivables outstanding and a default interest rate of 24% per annum for loans in contractual default status.
 •Origination fees. Our portfolio weighted average fee was 2.7% of the total commitment at origination at December 31, 2022. In addition, if the term of the loan is extended, additional points are payable upon the extension.
 •Term. The weighted average term outstanding of our active loans was 22 months at December 31, 2022. We may agree to extend the maturity date (typically for one to three months) and charge an extension fee, so long as the borrower complies with all loan covenants and the loan otherwise satisfies our underwriting criteria.
 •Covenants. To timely pay all taxes, insurance, assessments, and similar charges with respect to the property; to maintain hazard insurance; and to maintain and protect the property.
 •Events of default. Include: (i) failure to make the required monthly interest-only loan payment when due; (ii) failure to repay the loan at maturity date if we have not agreed to extend maturity and (iii) breach of covenant.
 •Payment terms. Interest only is payable monthly in arrears. Principal is due in a “balloon” payment at the maturity date. Interest earned from an interest holdback is capitalized in the loan principal balance.
 •Escrow. Generally, none required, other than where it is required to obtain the necessary insurance to title.
 •Construction Holdbacks. Construction loans typically include a holdback for future construction draws which are funded in arrears following confirmation of work completion. 
 •Interest Reserves. Loans may also include funds witheld for interest reserves for the purpose of satisfying monthly interest payments over all or part of the term of the loan due to a lack of income generated by the real estate during construction.
 •Security. Each loan is evidenced by a promissory note, which is generally secured by a first deed of trust lien on real property owned by the borrower and is typically personally guaranteed on a recourse basis by the principals of the borrower and/or others, at our discretion. The guaranty may be collaterally secured by a pledge of the guarantor’s interest in the borrower or other real estate owned by the guarantor.
 •Insurance. Each loan is required to carry minimum insurance policies for general liability and builders' risk, which are verified as a part of the underwriting process and monitored on an ongoing basis.
 •Fees and Expenses. As is typical in real estate finance transactions, the borrower incurs all expenses in connection with securing the loan, including the cost of a property appraisal, the cost of an environmental assessment report, if any, the cost of a credit report and all title, recording and legal fees.

Broadmark Realty Capital Inc.
 
Upon receipt of a potential borrower’s executed loan application, we will commence the underwriting process. Before approving and funding a loan, we undertake extensive due diligence of the borrower, its principals, the guarantor(s) and the property that will be mortgaged to secure the loan. Such due diligence generally includes:
 •Borrower and Guarantor Information. Review of a borrower’s credit application, operating agreement or other organizational documents, and review of business and guarantor financial statements and tax returns.
 •Confirmatory Collateral Information. Review of an independent appraisal report, preliminary title report, tax records and documentation evidencing proper hazard insurance for improved property and other property information. Loans secured by existing commercial properties require a Phase I environmental site assessment.
 •Project Transaction Information. Review of the property purchase and sale agreement, title insurance, itemized construction budget, project schedule with milestones, building permits/entitlements, building plans, and building specifications and architectural renderings, resumes and recent projects of builder and architect and marketing plans and materials.
 •Physical Inspection. We perform a physical inspection of the property, which includes a check of the property’s location, characteristics, qualities, and potential value as represented by the borrower, as well as a review of the comparable properties identified in the independent appraisal report in order to confirm that the properties identified as comparable in the appraisal report are truly comparable.
Loan Servicing
 We service all of our loans internally, and manage loan payments, draw requests and loan accounting records. The loan draw process in particular is an important part of our business as it provides borrowers with quick access to capital in order to keep their projects moving and allows us to inspect the quality and pace of the borrower’s work. Once a borrower has submitted a draw request, we often will have the property physically inspected by an approved third-party to ensure that the work for which funding is being requested has been completed in a manner satisfactory to us. In addition, any required county and city inspections are completed, and a date-down endorsement of the title policy is typically provided by the title company indicating no liens have been placed on the property since its original issuance of the title insurance policy before funds are disbursed. If the request is made for the final draw of a project, a certificate of occupancy or sign-off by the city is required prior to disbursement. Although the process is thorough, we make a point of responding to draw requests as quickly as possible as timing is of paramount importance to a project’s success.
 In addition, we conduct periodic testing, process loan payoff requests, and collect past due and delinquent payments. In the case of a contractual loan default, we have broad authority to take such actions as we believe best in working out the defaulted loan, including selling the defaulted loan or foreclosing on the real property serving as collateral for the loan.
 Loan Funding
 We intend to fund our growth through issuance of debt and equity capital in the public and private markets and use of cash management tools such as our revolving credit facility.
Competition
 Real estate lending is a competitive business. We compete for lending opportunities with a variety of institutional lenders and investors, including “hard money” lenders, mortgage REITs, specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage banks, credit unions, insurance companies, mutual funds, pension funds, private equity real estate funds, hedge funds, institutional investors, investment banking firms, non-bank financial institutions, governmental bodies, family offices and high net worth individuals. New parties continue to enter the market resulting in increased competition and pricing pressure.
We primarily compete on the basis of borrower relationships, product offerings, loan structure, terms and service rather than on price. Our success depends on our ability to maintain and capitalize on relationships with borrowers and their representatives, offer creative structures and attractive loan terms and, most importantly, provide superior service.
Broadmark Realty Capital Inc.
 
Seasonality
 While we typically originate loans year-round, incremental loan disbursements are made with greater frequency during the spring, summer and fall, when weather is generally more favorable for construction, and borrowers complete previously agreed stages of construction, allowing developers to draw down on additional amounts of capital available under their loan agreements. As a result of these more frequent disbursements, we generally maintain greater total liquidity to fund disbursements during these seasons.
Human Capital
 Our culture is defined by our core values of integrity, collaboration, diversity, accountability, reliability and community. Our employees represent our greatest asset. We value our employees by investing in a healthy work-life balance, competitive compensation and benefit packages and a vibrant, team-oriented environment centered on open and compassionate communication. We strive to build and maintain a high-performing culture by creating a work environment that attracts and retains outstanding, engaged employees who embody our company mission of “Empowering real estate developers and investors to improve places and spaces in our communities.” The most significant human capital measures or objectives that we focus on in managing our business and our related human capital initiatives include the following:
•Demographics. As of December 31, 2022, we employed 63 full-time employees across the United States.
 •Diversity and Inclusion. We strive toward having a diverse team of employees, knowing we are better together with our combined wisdom and intellect. With a commitment to equality, inclusion and workplace diversity, we focus on understanding, accepting and valuing the differences between people. We value and embrace diversity in our employee recruiting, hiring and development practices. Of our employee population, as of December 31, 2022, approximately 43% are women and approximately 43% have self-identified as Hispanic or Latino, Native American, Pacific Islander, Asian, Black or African American, or of two or more races. We have a long-standing commitment to equal employment opportunity. We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment.
 •Compensation and Benefits. We provide a competitive compensation and benefits program to help meet the needs of our employees. In addition to salaries, these programs include discretionary annual bonuses and stock awards, a 401(k) Plan with an employer matching contribution and no service-based vesting requirement, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings, paid time off, family leave and an employee assistance program. 
 •Communication and Engagement. We strongly believe that our success depends on employees understanding how their work contributes to the Company’s overall strategy. To this end, we communicate with our workforce through a variety of channels and encourage open and direct communication, including semi-monthly company-wide calls with executives and frequent email corporate communications. To continuously monitor and improve employee performance and engagement, we conduct annual performance reviews. We also provide training to our people managers on management and leadership development.
 •Health, Safety and Wellness. In 2022 and continuing to the present, we have prioritized the health, safety, and wellness of our employees as we continue to adapt to the post-COVID world. To ensure their well-being, we have implemented a hybrid work schedule and provided necessary resources such as ergonomic equipment. We have also established policies and procedures to maintain a safe and healthy work environment. In addition, we make a point to regularly communicate with and be responsive to the needs and concerns of our employees.
 •Community Partnership. We match each employee’s financial contribution to eligible nonprofit organizations on a dollar-for-dollar basis, up to $1,000 per employee each calendar year, to increase the impact of their charitable gifts. Each employee also receives eight hours per calendar year of paid volunteer time off to use at the eligible non-profit(s) of his or her choice, and we donate $25 to the organization for each hour volunteered by our employees.
 Regulation and Compliance
 Our operations are subject, in certain circumstances, to supervision and regulation by state and U.S. federal government authorities and may be subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions. In addition, Broadmark Realty and our subsidiaries may rely on exemptions from various requirements of the Securities Act and the Investment Company Act. These exemptions are sometimes highly complex and may, in certain circumstances, depend on compliance by third parties who we do not control.
Broadmark Realty Capital Inc.
 
Regulation of Commercial Real Estate Lending Activities
 In general, commercial real estate lending is a highly regulated industry in the United States. Certain states have adopted laws or regulations that may, among other requirements, require licensing of lenders and financiers, prescribe disclosures of certain contractual terms, impose limitations on interest rates and other charges, and limit or prohibit certain collection practices and creditor remedies. We are required to comply with the applicable laws and regulations in the states in which we do business. We are also required to comply with, among other statutes and regulations, certain provisions of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act that are applicable to commercial loans, the USA Patriot Act and regulations promulgated by the Office of Foreign Asset Control.
Exemptions from Investment Management Regulation
 Although we reserve the right to modify our business methods at any time, we believe that none of the Company or our subsidiary that issues and holds the mortgages (the “Mortgage Subsidiary”) is currently required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. However, our business strategies may evolve over time.
 
Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is, or holds itself out as being, engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities, and owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of such issuer’s total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. Excluded from the term “investment securities” are, among other things, securities issued by majority-owned subsidiaries that are not themselves investment companies and are not relying on the exclusion from the definition of “investment company” set forth in Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act.
 The Company believes it will not be considered an investment company under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act because it will not engage primarily, or propose to engage primarily, or hold itself out as being engaged primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Rather, the Company is primarily engaged in the non-investment company business of its wholly owned subsidiaries.
 
The Company believes that it will not be considered an investment company under Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act. The Company is a holding company that conducts its operations and holds assets primarily through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including the Mortgage Subsidiary. The Mortgage Subsidiary is excluded from the definition of investment company pursuant to Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act, which provides an exclusion for companies engaged primarily in investment in mortgages and other liens on or interests in real estate. In order to qualify for this exclusion, the Mortgage Subsidiary must maintain, on the basis of positions taken by the SEC’s Division of Investment Management in interpretive and no-action letters, a minimum of 55% of the value of its total assets in mortgage loans and other related assets that are considered “mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate” (“Qualifying Interests”), and a minimum of 80% in Qualifying Interests and real estate-related assets. In the absence of SEC guidance that supports the treatment of other investments as Qualifying Interests, the Mortgage Subsidiary will treat those other investments appropriately as real estate-related assets or miscellaneous assets depending on the circumstances. With respect to the Company’s other subsidiaries that maintain this exclusion or another exclusion or exception under the Investment Company Act (other than Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) thereof), or otherwise do not meet the definition of “investment company,” the Company’s interests in these subsidiaries do not and will not constitute “investment securities.”
 
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is required to register under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, or under any state securities laws, based on their current activities.
