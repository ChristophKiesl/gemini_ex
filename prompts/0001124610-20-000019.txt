ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Overview
VMware, Inc. (“VMware”) originally pioneered the development and application of virtualization technologies with x86 server-based computing, separating application software from the underlying hardware. Information technology (“IT”) driven innovation continues to disrupt markets and industries. Technologies emerge faster than organizations can absorb, creating increasingly complex environments. IT is working at an accelerated pace to harness new technologies, platforms and cloud models, ultimately guiding their business through a digital transformation. To take on these challenges, we are working with customers in the areas of hybrid and multi-cloud, modern applications, networking, security and digital workspaces. Our software provides a flexible digital foundation to enable customers in their digital transformation.
We help customers manage their IT resources across private clouds and complex multi-cloud, multi-device environments by offering solutions across three categories: Software-Defined Data Center (“SDDC”), Hybrid and Multi-Cloud Computing and Digital Workspace—End-User Computing (“EUC”). This portfolio supports and addresses the key IT priorities of our customers including accelerating their cloud journey, modernizing their applications, empowering digital workspaces, transforming networking and embracing intrinsic security. VMware enables customers to digitally transform their operations as they ready their applications, infrastructure and employees for constantly evolving business needs. 
We incorporated in Delaware in 1998, were acquired by EMC Corporation (“EMC”) in 2004 and conducted our initial public offering of our Class A common stock in August 2007. In September 2016, Dell Technologies Inc. (“Dell”) acquired EMC. As a result, EMC became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dell, and we became an indirectly-held, majority-owned subsidiary of Dell. We are considered a “controlled company” under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”). As of January 31, 2020, Dell controlled approximately 80.9% of our outstanding common stock, including 31 million shares of our Class A common stock and all of our Class B common stock.
In December 2019, we completed the acquisition of Pivotal Software, Inc. (“Pivotal”), a subsidiary of Dell, to enhance our cloud native applications portfolio. The purchase of Pivotal was accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control and required that we recast our prior period financial statements and financial data to include Pivotal for all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as if the combination had been in effect since the inception of common control.
Effective with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we presented a new revenue line item entitled “subscription and SaaS revenue” on our consolidated statements of income. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation. Previously, subscription and software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) revenue was allocated between license revenue and services revenue. 
We refer to our fiscal years ended January 29, 2021, January 31, 2020 and February 1, 2019 as “fiscal 2021,” “fiscal 2020” and “fiscal 2019,” respectively. 
Total revenue in fiscal 2020 increased 12% to $10.8 billion. Total revenue is comprised of license revenue of $3.2 billion, subscription and SaaS revenue of $1.9 billion and services revenue of $5.8 billion. While sales of our VMware vSphere (“vSphere”) product have remained strong, the majority of our license sales originate from solutions across our broad portfolio beyond our compute products.
Our corporate headquarters are located at 3401 Hillview Avenue, Palo Alto, California, and we have 169 offices worldwide. 
Products and Technology Solutions
Software-Defined Data Center 
We were the first company to articulate a vision for SDDC, whereby infrastructure is increasingly virtualized and delivered as a service, enabling data center management to be entirely automated by software, from one unified platform. Traditional data centers are collections of technology silos where each application type has its own vertical stack consisting of a CPU and operating system, storage pool, networking, security, and management systems. Over time, costs to maintain data center infrastructure have increased as the data center environment has become more heterogeneous and complex, requiring greater resources to manage and maintain IT infrastructures. SDDC is designed to transform and modernize the data center into an on-demand service that addresses application requirements by abstracting, pooling and automating the services that are required from the underlying hardware. SDDC dramatically simplifies data center operations and lowers costs.
Our SDDC architecture consists of four main product categories, which are available separately or as part of our Software-Defined Data Center Suites or Platform:

• | Compute


• | Cloud Management


• | Networking


• | Storage and Availability

Compute
VMware vSphere, our flagship data center platform that utilizes our hypervisor software, provides the fundamental compute layer for VMware environments. A “hypervisor” is a layer of software that resides between the operating system and system hardware to enable compute virtualization. Users deploy the vSphere hypervisor when they implement vSphere, VMware Cloud Foundation or suite solutions that include vSphere, such as VMware vCloud Suite. 
We have continued to develop vSphere solutions to be compatible with new technologies and tools utilized by software developers and enterprises, including modern cloud-native applications. 
Cloud Management
Our comprehensive cloud management platform manages hybrid environments running a range of workloads from traditional to container. Cloud management solutions are available as both an on-premises platform or as a service under our VMware Cloud Services offering, providing businesses with automated operation, programmable provisioning and application monitoring. VMware Cloud Services optimize cloud usage and costs, improve cloud security and compliance, monitor application and cloud infrastructure, and automate the deployment, management and migration of applications and data across vSphere, non-vSphere, hybrid and multiple public clouds. VMware Cloud Services enable our customers to run, manage, connect and better secure their applications across hybrid and multiple public clouds, including Amazon Web Services (“AWS”), Microsoft Azure (“Azure”), Google Cloud Platform (“Google Cloud”) and IBM Cloud, as well as all devices in a common operating environment, regardless whether the underlying infrastructure is VMware-based.
Key products in the cloud management product portfolio include:

• | vRealize Operations—provides performance, capacity and configuration management for virtual or physical infrastructure as well as transparency and control over the costs and quality of IT services.


• | vRealize Automation—enables customers to rapidly deploy and provision cloud services.


• | Wavefront by VMware—provides a SaaS-based metrics monitoring and analytics platform for modern cloud-native applications.


• | CloudHealth by VMware—delivers a consistent cloud operations platform across AWS, Azure and Google Cloud, enabling customers to analyze and manage cloud costs, usage, security and performance centrally for native public clouds.

Networking
VMware networking products and services enable our customers to connect and operate their network consistently within and across the data center, the cloud and network edges. Our offerings also provide networking capabilities to virtual machines, containers and public cloud workloads. 
Key products within networking solutions include:

• | VMware NSX (“NSX”)—our network virtualization solution, abstracts physical networks and greatly simplifies the provisioning and consumption of networking and security resources. NSX can be layered into any environment, integrates with many automation, security and container solutions and is an integral part of our key offerings, including VMware Cloud Foundation, VMware Cloud on AWS and Pivotal Container Service.


• | VMware SD-WAN by VeloCloud—available as a service and as an on-premises software solution, enables simple, agile and more secure branch connectivity. Our SD-WAN solution serves as a platform for deploying virtual network services that integrate with local edge compute to manage and control application traffic from users and Internet-connected devices.


• | Network Insight—delivers intelligent operations and planning for software-defined networking and security across virtual, physical and multi-cloud environments.


• | VMware NSX Advanced Load Balancer by Avi Networks—provides consistent, multi-cloud load balancing, web application firewall and application insights across data centers and public clouds. We acquired Avi Networks, Inc., a provider of multi-cloud application delivery services in July 2019.

Storage and Availability
We provide many storage and availability products to offer cost-effective, holistic data storage and protection options to all applications running on the vSphere platform. These products are applicable to hyperconverged infrastructure as well as 
traditional infrastructure solutions designed to enable customers to deploy a broad range of hardware solutions. Key solutions include:

• | VMware vSAN (“vSAN”)—clusters server disks to create simple, shared storage designed for virtual machines in hyperconverged infrastructure.


• | VxRail—a hyperconverged infrastructure solution comprised of a fully integrated and pre-configured Dell EMC Appliance powered by vSAN and vSphere software.

Software-Defined Data Center Suites
Our SDDC products are available separately, and our compute and management products may also be purchased as part of a broader offering. The VMware vRealize Suite and VMware vCloud Suite are packaged solutions for building and managing a complete cloud infrastructure optimized for use with the vSphere platform:

• | VMware vRealize Suite—an enterprise-ready cloud management platform that enables customers to manage heterogeneous, multi-cloud environments.


• | VMware vCloud Suite—an integrated offering that brings together our vSphere hypervisor and our vRealize Suite multi-vendor multi-cloud management platform.

Software-Defined Data Center Platform—On Premises
VMware Cloud Foundation is a unified platform that combines our compute, storage and networking technologies with cloud management into an integrated stack that delivers enterprise-ready cloud infrastructure for private and public clouds. The offering includes lifecycle management capabilities to span the full stack. 
SDDC products can also be delivered through our VMware vCloud NFV, a fully integrated, modular, multi-tenant network functions virtualization (“NFV”) platform. It provides the compute, storage, networking and operations management and service assurance capabilities to enable operators to provide virtualized network services and drive NFV deployments with an architecture that will support 5G and Edge services in the future. 
Hybrid and Multi-Cloud Computing 
Our multi-cloud offering is based on consistent infrastructure and operations across the data center, public cloud and edge environments. This allows customers to benefit from a single deployment model with consistent security policies, visibility and governance for all applications, running on-premises and off-premises. It builds on our private and multi-cloud capabilities by offering customers the freedom to innovate in multiple clouds and is delivered through VMware Cloud Foundation, the VMware vRealize cloud management platform and a new set of VMware Cloud Services that we are developing. We continue to execute against our multi-cloud strategy as we drive and expand our cloud partnerships to offer our customers choice and flexibility. Our overarching cloud strategy contains three key components: (i) continue to expand beyond compute virtualization in the private cloud, (ii) extend the private cloud into the public cloud and (iii) connect and secure endpoints across a range of public clouds. Our multi-cloud strategy is designed to provide organizations with solutions that work across all clouds and devices. 
VMware Cloud Provider Program Services
We currently enable our customers to utilize vSphere-based multi-cloud computing capacity through our VMware Cloud Provider Program (“VCPP”) offerings. VCPP partners, a key component of our strategic priority to support multi cloud, constitute a global ecosystem of over 4,500 cloud providers in more than 120 countries who provide VMware-based cloud services. Our VCPP offering is directed at hosting and cloud computing providers, giving organizations the flexibility to choose between running applications in virtual machines on their own private clouds inside their data center or on public clouds hosted and managed by a VMware cloud provider. 
Software-Defined Data Center Platform—Multi Cloud
VMware Cloud Foundation can be used for on-premises private clouds and also can be extended to multi-cloud environments using VMware Cloud on AWS or VCPP offerings. VMware Cloud on AWS is an on-demand service that enables customers to run applications across vSphere-based cloud environments and provides access to a broad range of AWS services. This hybrid offering, a strategic alliance with AWS, integrates vSphere, vSAN and NSX along with VMware vCenter management and is optimized to run on dedicated, elastic, bare-metal AWS infrastructure. VMware Cloud on AWS is available to our VCPP and System Integrators and System Outsourcers partners through our VMware Cloud Provider—Managed Services Provider offering, which enables our partners to make VMware Cloud on AWS available to their end customers without having to create a similar service in their own data centers.
VMware Cloud Foundation is also offered as a service platform through a select number of our VCPP partners. For example, IBM, OVH US LLC (“OVH”) and Rackspace are VCPP partners who leverage our SDDC technologies to create 
cloud services addressing the needs of customers globally. IBM was our first VCPP partner to offer VMware Cloud Foundation as a service, enabling their customers to leverage our SDDC technologies on IBM Cloud in their worldwide cloud data centers.
VMware Cloud Services
VMware Cloud Services are SaaS offerings that optimize cloud usage and costs, improve cloud security and compliance, monitor application and cloud infrastructure, and automate the deployment, management and migration of applications and data across vSphere and non-vSphere environments and hybrid and multiple public clouds. VMware Cloud Services enable our customers to run, manage, connect and better secure their applications across hybrid and multiple public clouds, including AWS, Azure, Google Cloud and IBM Cloud, as well as all devices in a common operating environment, regardless whether the underlying infrastructure is VMware-based.
Digital Workspace—End-User Computing
Our EUC portfolio offers a digital workspace to enable our customers to more securely deliver access to applications and data for their end users from any device of the user’s choice and from any location. Our EUC solutions are designed to optimize simplicity and choice for end users, while providing more security and control to corporate IT organizations. IT organizations can enhance their enterprise security for corporate applications, data and endpoints utilizing our EUC solutions.
Our complete EUC solution consists of VMware Workspace ONE (“Workspace ONE”), our digital workspace platform that more securely delivers and manages any application on any device by integrating access control, application management and multi-platform endpoint management. Workspace ONE is powered by Unified Endpoint Management (formerly known as AirWatch) and VMware Horizon (“Horizon”) application and desktop virtualization, tied together with a common access control layer: 

• | Unified Endpoint Management—a platform built to manage and help secure endpoints across all major operating systems from a single management console, enabling customers to more effectively manage, secure and benefit from “bring your own device” programs.


• | Horizon—a virtual platform that provides a streamlined approach to delivering, protecting and managing virtual desktops and applications from one digital workspace, while containing costs and allowing end users to work anytime, anywhere and across any device.

While Unified Endpoint Management and Horizon are also offered separately, together this solution provides customers with a complete digital workspace solution that combines identity, mobile management, and application and desktop virtualization solutions. Through the continued expansion of our virtual desktop portfolio, we offer customers the opportunity to run virtual desktops as-a-service through multiple environments including the Azure platform, VMware Cloud on AWS and IBM Cloud.
Recent Acquisitions
In December 2019, we acquired Pivotal, a leading cloud-native platform provider, to unify VMware cloud native Kubernetes offerings and to bring together technology from Heptio, which we acquired in 2018, and the existing Pivotal offerings of Pivotal Cloud Foundry, Pivotal Application Service, and Pivotal Labs, collectively referred to as modern applications platform solutions. The combination of Pivotal and Heptio allows us to provide a modern, agile development process and a cloud-native platform to our customers that can be deployed on major private and public clouds. Pivotal’s offerings are core to the VMware Tanzu portfolio of products and services announced in fiscal 2020. The VMware Tanzu portfolio is designed to help enterprises build modern applications and simplify the use of Kubernetes in a multi-cloud environment. Our first Tanzu offerings became available in early fiscal 2021.

Key built-in security capabilities include single sign on functionality, conditional access and multi-factor authentication. In addition, Workspace ONE Intelligence delivers insights into the digital workspace environment, including analytics on user behaviors and device compliance, and automated remediation processes.

Technology Alliances
We have more than 1,000 technology partners with whom we bring offerings to the marketplace and over 4,500 active cloud provider partners. We classify our partners as follows:
Independent Hardware Vendors (“IHVs”)—we have established relationships with large system vendors, including Cisco, Fujitsu, HPE, IBM, Lenovo and Hitachi Vantara for certification and co-development, and we continue to work closely with Dell. We also work closely with Intel, Nvidia and other IHVs to provide input on product development to enable them to deliver hardware advancements that benefit virtualization users. We coordinate with the leading storage and networking vendors to ensure interoperability and enable our software to access their differentiated functionality.
Independent Software Vendors (“ISVs”)—we partner with leading systems management, infrastructure software and application software vendors, including healthcare, telecom, finance and retail leaders, to deliver value-added products that integrate with our products.
VMware Cloud Providers—we have established partnerships with over 4,500 active cloud providers, including Microsoft, Google, Oracle, CenturyLink, Fujitsu, IBM, KPN, NTT, OVH, Rackspace, Softbank, Telefonica, Tieto and Virtustream, to enable them to host and deliver enterprise-class multi clouds as a way for enterprises to extend their data centers to external clouds, while preserving security, compliance and quality of service. 
In addition to our base of active partnerships with cloud providers, we have a strategic alliance with AWS to build and deliver an integrated hybrid offering, VMware Cloud on AWS, that enables customers to run applications across vSphere-based private, public and multi-cloud environments.
Our Technology Alliance Partner (“TAP”) program facilitates collaborative solution creation and coordinated go-to-market activities for our greater than 1,000 technology partner ecosystem. Created exclusively for IHV and ISV partners, the TAP program gives technology partners the ability to test, integrate and package application software, infrastructure and hardware products with our products and services across the SDDC, Multi Cloud Computing, EUC and Modern Applications and Security areas—on premises or in the cloud.
Our ISVs and other alliance partners, developers and additional VMware community members continue to distribute software applications as virtual appliances. We invest significant capital in testing and certification of infrastructure to rigorously ensure our software is compatible with major hardware and software products.
Research and Development
We have made, and expect to continue to make, significant investments in research and development (“R&D”). We have assembled an experienced group of developers with expertise in software-defined data centers, hybrid and multiple public clouds, the modernization, migration and management of applications, networking, security, and digital workspaces. We also have strong ties to leading academic institutions around the world, and we invest in joint research with academia.
We prioritize our product development efforts through a combination of engineering-driven innovation and customer- and market-driven feedback. Our R&D culture places a high value on innovation, quality and open collaboration with our partners. We currently participate in numerous standards groups, and our employees hold a variety of standards organization leadership positions.
We continue to invest in our key growth areas while also investing in areas that we expect to be significant growth drivers in future periods. 
Sales and Marketing
We have a highly leveraged go-to-market strategy that includes a direct sales force, including a specialized sales force for our key growth products, and our channel partners.
We have established ongoing business relationships with our distributors. Our distributors purchase software licenses and software support from us for resale to end-user customers via resellers. These resellers are part of our VMware Partner Connect (formerly known as VMware Partner Network), a program which offers resellers pricing incentives, rebates, sales and product training through the VMware Partner Connect web portal, and access to the worldwide network of VMware distributors. In addition, our channel partner network includes certain systems integrators and resellers trained and certified to deliver consulting services and solutions leveraging our products.
We generally do not have long-term contracts or minimum-purchase commitments with our distributors, resellers, system vendors and systems integrators, and our contracts with these channel partners do not prohibit them from offering products or services that compete with ours.
End users can purchase our offerings through discrete purchases to meet their immediate needs or through the adoption of enterprise agreements (“EAs”). EAs are comprehensive volume license offerings that provide for multi-year maintenance and support at negotiated prices. EAs enable us to build long-term relationships with our customers as they commit to our virtual infrastructure solutions. Our sales cycle can vary greatly depending on numerous factors, including the size and complexity of the proposed offering and customer’s infrastructure footprint.
In establishing list prices for our products, we take into account, among other numerous factors, the value our products and solutions deliver and the cost of alternative virtualization, end-user computing and hardware solutions.
Our marketing efforts focus on communicating the benefits of our solutions and educating our customers, distributors, resellers, system vendors, systems integrators, the media and analysts about the advantages of our innovative virtualization technology, cloud services and digital workspace solutions. We raise awareness of our company and brands, market our products and generate sales leads through VMware and industry events, public relations efforts, marketing materials, advertising, direct marketing, social media initiatives, free downloads and our website. We have invested in multiple online communities that enable customers and partners to share and discuss sales and development resources, best practices implementation and industry trends among other topics. Our annual user conference, VMworld, is held in both the United States (“U.S.”) and Europe, while our vForum events are held in the Asia Pacific and Japan region. We also offer management presentations, seminars and webinars on our virtualization and EUC products and cloud services. We believe the combination of these activities strengthens our brand and enhances our leading positions in the industries in which we compete.
We continue joint marketing, sales, branding and product development efforts with Dell and other Dell companies to enhance the collective value we deliver to our mutual customers. Our collective business with Dell continued to create synergies that benefited our sales during fiscal 2020. Bookings through Dell sales channels have grown more rapidly than through non-Dell resellers and distributors, and Dell sales channels in aggregate comprise the largest route-to-market for our sales. We also have strategic partnerships with AWS, IBM and Microsoft to jointly provide the expertise, solutions and go-to-market capabilities to help our customers efficiently and more securely extend their proven software-defined solutions into public clouds, utilizing the tools and processes with which our customers are already familiar.
Our business is subject to seasonality in the sale of our products and services. For example, our fourth quarter revenue is affected by a number of seasonal factors, including year-end spending trends which impact the timing of renewals of our EAs and support and maintenance contracts.
Remaining Performance Obligations
Remaining performance obligations represent the aggregate amount of the transaction price in contracts allocated to performance obligations not delivered, or partially undelivered, as of the end of the reporting period. Remaining performance obligations include unearned revenue, multi-year contracts with future installment payments and certain unfulfilled orders against accepted customer contracts at the end of any given period.
As of January 31, 2020, the aggregate transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was $10.3 billion, of which approximately 54% is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next twelve months and the remainder thereafter.
As of February 1, 2019, the aggregate transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was $8.7 billion, of which approximately 55% was expected to be recognized as revenue during fiscal 2020, and the remainder thereafter.
Backlog
Backlog is comprised of unfulfilled purchase orders or unfulfilled executed agreements at the end of a given period and is net of related estimated rebates and marketing development funds. As of January 31, 2020, our total backlog was $18 million. Backlog primarily consists of licenses, maintenance and services. Our backlog related to licenses was $5 million, which we generally expect to deliver and recognize as revenue during the following quarter. The amount excluded from the remaining performance obligations because such contracts were subject to cancellation until fulfillment of the performance obligation occurs was not material as of January 31, 2020.
As of February 1, 2019, total backlog was approximately $449 million and backlog related to licenses was approximately $147 million. Backlog totaling $34 million as of February 1, 2019 was excluded from the remaining performance obligations because such contracts are subject to cancellation until fulfillment of the performance obligation occurs. 
The amount and composition of backlog will fluctuate period to period, and backlog is managed based upon multiple considerations, including product and geography. We do not believe that the amount of backlog is indicative of future sales or revenue or that the mix of backlog at the end of any given period correlates with actual sales performance of a particular geography or particular products or services.
Customers
Our product offerings allow customers to manage IT resources across private clouds and complex multi-cloud, multi-device environments. Customer deployments range in size from a single virtualized server for small businesses to thousands of virtual machines and managed devices for our largest enterprise customers.
During fiscal 2020, two distributors, who purchased software licenses and software support from us for resale to end-user customers directly or via resellers, each accounted for over 10% of our consolidated revenue. Arrow Electronics, Inc. and Tech Data Corporation accounted for 12% and 10%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue in fiscal 2020. Our distribution agreements are typically terminable at will by either party upon 30 to 90 days’ prior written notice to the other party, and neither party has any obligation to purchase or sell any products under the agreement.
During fiscal 2020, revenue from Dell, including purchases of products and services directly from us, as well as through our channel partners, accounted for 31% of our consolidated revenue. These purchases included Dell selling joint solutions as an OEM which accounted for 12% of revenue from Dell, or 4% of our consolidated revenue. The remaining revenue from Dell consisted of Dell acting as a distributor to other non-Dell resellers, reselling products and services as a reseller or purchasing products and services for its own internal use. On certain transactions, Dell Financial Services also provided financing to our end users at our end users’ discretion. 
Competition 
We face intense competition across all markets for our products and services. We believe that the key factors in our ability to successfully compete include the level of reliability, interoperability and new functionality of our product and service offerings; the ability of our product offerings to support multiple hardware platforms, operating systems, applications frameworks and public cloud platforms; our ability to anticipate customer needs in rapidly evolving markets for IT resources; the pricing of our product and service offerings; the ability to integrate open source technologies that are critical in private and public cloud computing architectures; the ability to attract and retain key employees; and the ability to maintain and expand our ecosystem of technology partners, service providers and sales channel partners. While we believe that we are a technology leader in virtualization and cloud infrastructure solutions and have a strong, favorable image with our customers, many of our current or potential competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources than we do. Additionally, the adoption of public cloud, micro-services, containers and open source technologies has the potential to erode our profitability.
We face competition from, among others:
Providers of public cloud infrastructure and SaaS-based offerings. As businesses increasingly utilize public cloud and SaaS-based offerings, they are building more of their new compute workloads off-premises and may also shift some of their existing workloads. As a result, the demand for on-premises IT resources is expected to slow, and our products and services will need to increasingly compete for customers’ IT workloads with off-premises public cloud and SaaS-based offerings. If our private, hybrid and multi-cloud products and services fail to address evolving customer requirements, the demand for our virtualization products and services may decline, and we could experience lower growth. Additionally, VCPP offerings from our partners may compete directly with infrastructure-as-a-service (“IaaS”) offerings from various public cloud providers such as AWS and Microsoft. Many of these cloud providers are partnering with on-premises hardware vendors to deliver their cloud platform as an on-premise solution, including Microsoft Azure Stack (“Azure Stack”) and AWS Outposts. In fiscal 2018, we entered into a strategic alliance with AWS to deliver a vSphere-based cloud service, VMware Cloud on AWS, running in AWS data centers available in certain geographies. In fiscal 2020, we also announced partnerships with Microsoft (Azure VMware 
Solution by CloudSimple), Google (Google Cloud VMware Solution by CloudSimple), and Oracle (Oracle Cloud VMware Solution) under the framework of our VCPP that enable customers to run native VMware-based workloads on Azure, Google Cloud and Oracle Cloud. Our partnerships with these public cloud providers may be seen as competitive with each other, with other VCPP partners and with AWS, while some VCPP partners may elect to include solutions such as VMware Cloud on AWS as part of their managed services provider offerings. In addition, in November 2018, when AWS announced AWS Outposts, we extended our collaboration with AWS by previewing offerings that will run on AWS Outposts. To the extent customers choose to operate native AWS environments (or similar non-VMware environments, such as Azure Stack) in their data centers in lieu of purchasing our on-premises and hybrid and multi-cloud products, our operating results could be materially adversely affected.
Providers of enterprise security offerings. With the close of VMware’s acquisition of Carbon Black in October 2019, we launched a new set of enterprise security solutions that includes the Carbon Black endpoint security platform and the intrinsic security elements of our existing NSX virtual networking, Workspace ONE end user and our compute offerings. The cybersecurity market is large, highly competitive, fragmented and subject to rapidly evolving technology, shifting customer needs and the frequent introductions of new solutions. Competitors in the end point security space include legacy antivirus solution providers such as McAfee and NortonLifeLock, established software and infrastructure providers such as Blackberry Limited (after recently purchasing Cylance, Inc.) and Microsoft as well as next-generation endpoint security providers such as CrowdStrike. In addition, new startup companies and established companies have entered or are currently attempting to enter the next-generation endpoint security market. While we believe that the intrinsic security elements in our existing offerings coupled with our Carbon Black endpoint security offerings and new combined offerings we expect to develop and introduce in the future will enable us to provide an integrated security offering with significant advantages over our competitors’ current offerings, our ability to gain traction and market share as a new entrant into this well-established market segment is uncertain. If our efforts to enter the enterprise security market segment are unsuccessful, our operating results could be materially adversely affected.
Large, diversified enterprise software and hardware companies. These competitors supply a wide variety of products and services to, and have well-established relationships with, our current and prospective end users. For example, small- to medium-sized businesses and companies in emerging markets that are evaluating the adoption of virtualization-based technologies and solutions may be inclined to consider Microsoft solutions because of their existing use of Windows and Office products. Some of these competitors have in the past and may in the future take advantage of their existing relationships to engage in business practices that make our products and services less attractive to our end users. For example, in August 2019, Microsoft modified its on-premises licensing terms to require end users who wish to deploy Microsoft software on certain dedicated hosted cloud services other than Microsoft’s Azure cloud service, including VMware Cloud on AWS, to purchase additional rights from Microsoft. Other competitors have limited or denied support for their applications running in VMware virtualization environments. In addition, these competitors could integrate competitive capabilities into their existing products and services and make them available without additional charge. For example, Oracle provides free server virtualization software intended to support Oracle and non-Oracle applications, Microsoft offers its own server, network, and storage virtualization software packaged with its Windows Server product as well as built-in virtualization in the client version of Windows and Cisco includes network virtualization technology in many of their data center networking platforms. As a result, our existing and prospective customers may elect to use products that are perceived to be “free” or “very low cost” instead of purchasing our products and services for certain applications where they do not believe that more advanced and robust capabilities are required.
Companies offering competing platforms based on open source technologies. Open source technologies for virtualization, containerization and cloud platforms, such as Xen, KVM, Docker, rkt, OpenShift, Mesos, Kubernetes and OpenStack, and other open source software-based products, solutions and services developed by enterprise IT vendors that target data center virtualization and private cloud, such as Red Hat (now a part of IBM) and Nutanix, may reduce the demand for our solutions, put pricing pressure on our offerings and enable competing vendors to leverage open source technologies to compete directly with us. In addition, one of the characteristics of open source software is that, subject to specified restrictions, anyone may modify and redistribute existing open source software and use it to compete in the marketplace. Such competition can develop with a smaller degree of overhead and lead time than traditional proprietary software companies require. New platform technologies and standards based on open source software are consistently being developed and can gain popularity quickly. Improvements in open source software could cause customers to replace software purchased from us with open-source software. We are delivering container technologies, such as PKS, and Cloud Native Application technologies portfolio with VMware Tanzu. We have also increased our level of commitment to open source projects and communities like the Cloud Native Computing Foundation that are designed to increase that rate at which customers adopt micro-services architectures. The adoption of distributed micro-service application architectures, and their alignment with container technologies, represents an emerging area of competition. As we continue to invest in these areas, we will experience increasing competitive overlap with other cloud native vendors like Red Hat and the large providers of public cloud infrastructure. Such competitive pressure 
or the availability of new open source software may result in reduced sales, price reductions, lower operating margins and increased sales and marketing expenses, any one of which may adversely affect our operating results.
Other industry alliances. Many of our competitors have entered into or extended partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer more comprehensive virtualization and cloud computing solutions than they individually had offered. We expect these trends to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or maintain their positions in the evolving virtualization infrastructure and enterprise IT solutions industry. These alliances may result in more compelling product and service offerings than we offer.
Our partners and members of our developer and technology partner ecosystem. We face competition from our partners. For example, third parties currently selling our products and services could build and market their own competing products and services or market competing products and services of other vendors. Additionally, as formerly distinct sectors of enterprise IT such as software-based virtualization and hardware-based server, networking and storage solutions converge, we also increasingly compete with companies who are members of our developer and technology partner ecosystem. For example, in July 2019, one of our important partners and customers, IBM, closed its acquisition of Red Hat, one of our competitors in the cloud native applications space. Consequently, we may find it more difficult to continue to work together productively on other projects, and the advantages we derive from our ecosystem could diminish. 
This competition could result in increased pricing pressure and sales and marketing expenses, thereby materially reducing our operating margins, and could also prevent our new products and services from gaining market acceptance, thereby harming our ability to increase, or causing us to lose, market share.
Intellectual Property 
As of January 31, 2020, over 3,300 patents of varying duration issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office have been granted or assigned to us. We also have been granted or assigned patents from other countries. These patents cover various aspects of our server virtualization and other technologies. We also have numerous pending U.S. provisional and non-provisional patent applications, and numerous pending foreign and international patent applications, that cover other aspects of our virtualization and other technologies.
We have federal trademark registrations in the U.S. for “VMWARE,” “VMWORLD,” “VSPHERE,” “VCLOUD,” “VCENTER SERVER,” “VMOTION,” “HORIZON,” “AIRWATCH,” “VREALIZE,” “VCLOUD,” “WORKSPACE ONE,” “ESX,” “VMWARE NSX,” “VMWARE CLOUD FOUNDATION,” “VELOCLOUD,” “CARBON BLACK,” “BITNAMI” and “PIVOTAL” and numerous other trademarks. We have also registered trademarks in several foreign countries.
We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights and our brand.
We enforce our intellectual property rights in the U.S. and several foreign countries. Despite our efforts, the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to preclude misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights, and our ability to police such misappropriation or infringement is uncertain, particularly in countries outside of the U.S. patent filings are intended to provide the holder with a right to exclude others from making, using, offering to sell, selling or importing into the U.S. products covered by the claims of granted patents.
Our granted U.S. patents, and any future patents (to the extent they are issued), may be contested, circumvented or invalidated in the future. Moreover, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing these patents. Therefore, the exact effect of our patents and the other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property cannot be predicted with certainty.
Employees
As of January 31, 2020, we had approximately 31,000 employees in 169 offices worldwide, less than 5% of which were contracted through Dell. None of our employees are represented by labor unions, and we consider current employee relations to be good.
We contract with Dell subsidiaries for support from Dell personnel who are managed by us on a full-time basis. These individuals are located in countries in which we do not currently have an operating subsidiary and are predominantly dedicated to our sales and marketing efforts. We use contractors from time to time for temporary assignments and in locations in which we do not currently have operating subsidiaries. In the event that these contractor resources were not available, we do not believe that this would have a material adverse effect on our operations.
