ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

General
GameStop Corp. (“GameStop,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company”) is a global family of specialty retail brands that makes the most popular technologies affordable and simple. Within our family of brands, we are the world’s largest omnichannel video game retailer, the largest AT&T® (“AT&T”) authorized retailer, the largest Apple© (“Apple”) certified products reseller, a Cricket WirelessTM reseller (“Cricket,” an AT&T brand) and the owner of www.thinkgeek.com, one of the world’s largest sellers of collectible pop-culture themed products. As of January 28, 2017, GameStop's retail network and family of brands include 7,535 company-operated stores in the United States, Australia, Canada and Europe.
We are a Delaware corporation which, through a predecessor, began operations as a specialty retailer of video games in November 1996. Our corporate office is located in Grapevine, Texas.
Our fiscal year is composed of the 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Saturday closest to the last day of January. Fiscal year 2016 consisted of the 52 weeks ended on January 28, 2017 ("fiscal 2016"). Fiscal year 2015 consisted of the 52 weeks ended on January 30, 2016 ("fiscal 2015"). Fiscal year 2014 consisted of the 52 weeks ended on January 31, 2015 ("fiscal 2014").
Our Reportable Segments
We operate our business in four geographic Video Game Brands segments: United States, Canada, Australia and Europe; and a Technology Brands segment. Financial information about our segments is included in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Note 16, "Segment Information," of the notes to the consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Video Game Brands
The Video Game Brands segments include 6,013 stores, 3,944 of which are included in the United States segment. There are 322, 464, and 1,283 stores in the Canadian, Australian and European segments, respectively. The stores in our four Video Game Brands segments operate primarily under the names GameStopTM (“GameStop”), EB GamesTM (“EB Games”), and Micromania. Each of the Video Game Brands segments consists primarily of retail operations, with all stores engaged in the sale of new and pre-owned video game systems, software and accessories, which we refer to as video game products. Our Video Game Brands stores sell various types of digital products, including downloadable content, network points cards, prepaid digital, prepaid subscription cards and digitally downloadable software and also sell certain mobile and consumer electronics products and collectible products. Through our omnichannel sales process, our customers can buy video game products and other merchandise online, reserve merchandise online and then pick it up in stores, or order products that may not be in-stock in stores and have it shipped to their homes. We operate e-commerce sites in eight countries, under the brand names of GameStop, EB Games, Micromania and ThinkGeek, that allow our customers to buy video game products, collectibles and other merchandise online. The network also includes: www.kongregate.com, a leading browser-based game site; Game InformerTM (“Game Informer”) magazine, the world's leading print and digital video game publication; and iOS and Android mobile applications. Within our Video Game Brands segments, we operate 86 pop culture themed stores selling collectibles, apparel, gadgets, electronics, toys and other retail products for technology enthusiasts and general consumers, with 62 collectibles stores in international markets operating under the Zing Pop Culture brand and 24 stores in the United States operating under the ThinkGeek brand.

Technology Brands
Our Technology Brands segment includes our Spring Mobile and Simply Mac businesses. Spring Mobile operates 1,403 AT&T branded wireless retail stores and 69 Cricket branded pre-paid wireless stores. The AT&T branded stores sell both pre and post-paid AT&T services, DIRECTV service and wireless products, as well as related accessories and other consumer electronics products. Pre-paid AT&T services, wireless devices and related accessories are sold through the Cricket branded stores. Simply Mac operates 50 Simply Mac© branded stores which sell Apple products, including desktop computers, laptops, tablets and smart phones and related accessories and other consumer electronics products. As an authorized Apple reseller, Simply Mac also offers certified training, warranty and repair services to its customers.
Our Strategy
During the past few years, we have transformed from the world’s largest specialty retailer of physical video game products into a family of retail brands selling many of the world’s most popular technologies and pop-culture products. Our vision is to continue to expand our business as a global family of specialty retail brands. Our mission is to continue to be the world’s largest omnichannel retailer of new and pre-owned and value video game products, to continue to grow sales of digital products, to expand the sales of collectible products through our video game stores and www.thinkgeek.com, to increase the number of our pop culture-themed stores and to strategically grow our Technology Brands segment to further diversify our revenue streams. Our goal is to have 50% or more of our operating earnings for the 52 weeks ending February 1, 2020 (“fiscal 2019”) come from sources other than "physical gaming," which we define as our traditional revenue streams including new video game hardware, new video game software, pre-owned and value video game products, video game accessories, PC entertainment software, interactive game figures, strategy guides and revenue from PowerUp Pro loyalty members receiving Game Informer magazine in print form. 
We have a broad-based executive management team with substantial experience in the retail sector in merchandising, marketing, supply chain management, store operations and real estate. Following on the success of extending our core competencies into our mobile business, our strategy is to leverage our management team and core competencies to identify other retail concepts that we can acquire and rapidly expand. We believe our core competencies include the following:

• | Real estate knowledge, including extensive relationships with landlords, portfolio management, negotiating skills and risk mitigation;


• | Human resource management, including hiring, training, systems and processes, particularly in multi-unit management of small, limited staffing, specialty retail stores with expert staff in assisted-selling;


• | Knowledge of buy-sell-trade programs, including pricing algorithms, inventory balancing, refurbishment capabilities and secondhand dealer laws;


• | Customer retention programs, including using our loyalty programs to drive consumer awareness of new retail concepts and promote new products; and


• | The ability to deploy capital in ways that diversify the underlying business, manage financial risk and increase shareholder value, including finding acquisitions that have a high return on invested capital and are accretive to earnings.

Our competencies in real estate and human resource management stem from our experience in rapid growth retail environments.
We have anchored our strategy and growth plans upon the following pillars:

• | Maximize brick and mortar stores. Our strategy regarding our retail stores includes growing our leading market share in video games, utilizing our stores to grow digital sales and applying our retail expertise to our Technology Brands businesses. Our growth strategy depends in part upon opening new stores and operating them profitably. We expect to open approximately 100 new stores in fiscal 2017, including approximately 35 collectibles stores and approximately 65 Technology Brands stores. Our strategy also includes closing stores which are not meeting our performance standards or stores at the end of their lease terms and transferring sales to other nearby GameStop locations. We plan to close approximately 130 Video Game Brands stores worldwide in fiscal 2017 and 55 Technology Brands stores.

In our video game stores, we provide a high level of customer service by hiring game enthusiasts and providing them with ongoing sales training, including training in the latest technical and functional elements of our products and services, making them the most knowledgeable associates in the video game retail market. We focus marketing efforts and store associates on driving the sale of new release video game products, both physical and digital. As the world’s largest retailer of video game products with a proven capability to capture market share immediately following new product launches, we believe we regularly receive larger allocations of popular new video game products than our competitors. To assist our customers in obtaining immediate access to new releases, we offer our customers the opportunity to pre-order products in our stores or through our websites prior to their release.
Our Technology Brands business centers around our long-term partnership with AT&T, under which we sell AT&T products and services in our Spring Mobile managed AT&T and Cricket branded stores and certain AT&T products and services in our Simply Mac stores. We also have an agreement with Apple under which we sell Apple products and services in our Simply Mac stores.

We acquired Spring Mobile in November 2013. Spring Mobile has grown from approximately 90 AT&T branded stores at the end of 2012 to 1,403 stores as of January 28, 2017, through a program with two primary focuses. The first of these is to acquire AT&T retailers. The second is opening what we refer to as “whitespace” stores, or new stores in retail locations identified by either AT&T or Spring Mobile management and agreed to by both parties. AT&T supports the opening of new whitespace stores by its authorized retailers in an effort to increase the size of its retail distribution channel. Both of these represent opportunities for continued growth in the near term for Spring Mobile. 
In connection with the continued expansion of our Technology Brands business, Spring Mobile completed acquisitions of several additional AT&T authorized retailers in fiscal 2016, adding over 500 stores.
In July 2015, we acquired ThinkGeek, an online and wholesale retailer and developer that sells pop culture themed collectibles, apparel, gadgets, electronics, toys and other retail products for technology enthusiasts and general consumers through the www.thinkgeek.com website and certain exclusive products to wholesale channel customers. The addition of ThinkGeek provides an expansion of our global omnichannel platform and enables us to broaden our product offering in the collectibles category, including standalone stores and deepen relationships with our existing customer base.
We continue to seek opportunities to extend core competencies to other products and retail categories in order to continue to grow and to help mitigate the financial impact from the cyclical nature of the video game console cycle.

• | Expand our pre-owned business. We believe we are the largest retailer of pre-owned video game products in the world and carry the broadest selection of pre-owned and value video game products for both current and previous generation platforms, giving us a unique advantage in the video game retail industry. The opportunity to trade-in and purchase pre-owned video game products offers our customers a unique value proposition generally unavailable at most mass merchants, toy stores and consumer electronics retailers. We obtain most of our pre-owned video game products from trade-ins made in our stores by our customers. Pre-owned and value video game products generate significantly higher gross margins than new video game products. Our strategy consists of continuing to expand our product assortment to drive sales and gross profit growth, increasing consumer awareness of the benefits of trading in and buying pre-owned video game products through increased marketing activities and the use of both broad and targeted marketing to our loyalty program members. The supply of trade-ins of video game products, and the demand for resale of these products, is affected by overall demand for video game products and the introduction of new software and hardware by our suppliers. We expect the March 2017 launch of the Nintendo Switch and the continued adoption of next-generation consoles and software to drive trade-ins of video game products, thereby expanding our supply of pre-owned video game products.

Our Simply Mac stores also offer customers the opportunity to trade-in and purchase pre-owned Apple products.

• | Own the customer. Sustaining and growing our existing customer base depends on our ability to increase GameStop brand awareness, to drive membership in our loyalty programs, to engage with customers online, through social media and our mobile apps, and to expand our market leadership position by offering a variety of new and pre-owned video game products and continuing to enhance our mobile and digital product and service offerings. We operate loyalty programs in each of the countries in which we operate our Video Game Brands stores. Our U.S. loyalty program, called PowerUp RewardsTM ("PowerUp Rewards"), had over 36 million members as of January 28, 2017. Our loyalty programs in our video game stores in the remaining countries had approximately 16 million members as of January 28, 2017. Our loyalty programs generally offer our customers the ability to sign up for a free or paid membership which gives our customers access to exclusive video game related rewards. The programs' paid memberships may also include a subscription to Game Informer magazine, additional discounts on pre-owned merchandise in our stores and additional credit on trade-ins of pre-owned products. Approximately 6 million of the 36 million U.S. loyalty members were paying members. Our e-commerce sites allow our customers to buy games online, reserve or pick up merchandise in our stores, order in-store for home delivery and to learn about the latest video game products and their availability in our stores. Together, our loyalty programs, websites, mobile applications, magazine and other properties are a part of our omnichannel retail strategy designed to enhance our relationships with our customers, making it easier for our customers to transact with us and increase loyalty.

Our store personnel provide value-added services to each customer, such as maintaining lists of regular customers and reserving new releases for customers with a down payment to ensure product availability. In addition, our store personnel readily provide product reviews and ratings to ensure customers are making informed purchasing decisions and inform customers of available resources, including Game Informer and our e-commerce sites, to increase a customer’s enjoyment of the product upon purchase.

• | Expand our digital growth strategy. Growth in the video game industry in recent years has been fueled by the proliferation of online game play, the sale of video games delivered in digital form and the expansion of other forms of digital gaming. The recent generations of video game consoles contain the technology to digitally download video game software content and a growing percentage of new games are being sold digitally (which the video game industry refers to as "full-game downloads"). Additionally, a growing market exists for the sale of digitally downloadable add-on content for physical games, which the video game industry refers to as “DLC.” The digital game market also consists of both immersive and casual games delivered over the internet to computers, tablets, smart phones and other devices. We sell a variety of digitally downloadable content in our video game stores and on our websites, including DLC, full-game downloads, network points cards, prepaid digital and prepaid subscription cards. We believe we are the only significant brick-and-mortar retail seller of DLC and that we are frequently the leading seller of DLC for most major game titles.

• | Maintain a disciplined capital allocation. Our objective in recent years has been to return a significant portion of our free cash flow to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends unless more strategic opportunities arise that we believe would create more meaningful shareholder returns. In fiscal 2016, we paid dividends of $1.48 per share of Class A Common Stock, totaling $155.5 million for the year. Additionally, on February 28, 2017, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in our annual cash dividend to $1.52 per share of Class A Common Stock, with the first quarterly dividend of fiscal 2017 of $0.38 per share of Class A Common Stock, payable on March 28, 2017 to stockholders of record on March 14, 2017. In fiscal 2016, we repurchased 3.0 million shares of our Class A Common Stock at an average price per share of $24.94 for a total of $75.1 million. 

In order to create more meaningful shareholder returns, as we evaluate investments in strategic opportunities, we target internal rates of return (“IRR”) in excess of 20% for whitespace store expansion and acquisitions. The total consideration of the completed acquisitions of additional AT&T authorized retailers in fiscal 2016 was $483.5 million net of cash acquired, which includes $43.2 million estimated contingent consideration. 
Market Size
Video Game Products. Based upon estimates compiled by various market research firms, including NPD Group, Inc. ("NPD") and International Development Group ("IDG"), we estimate that the market for new physical video game products was approximately $17 billion in 2016 in the countries in which we operate. This estimated market excludes sales of pre-owned video game products, which are not currently measured by any third-party research firms. Additionally, based on estimates compiled by various market research firms, we estimate that the market in North America for content in digital format (full-game and add-on content downloads for console and PC, subscriptions, mobile games and social network games) was between $13 billion and $22 billion in 2016.
Mobile and Consumer Electronics. The mobile and consumer electronics market, as we refer to it, consists primarily of wireless services, new and pre-owned mobile devices, such as smart phones and tablets, consumer electronics such as Apple products and services, non-gaming headsets and accessories. The market for wireless devices and services is estimated by CTIA — The Wireless Association® to exceed $190 billion. We expect that the market for AT&T services and products and the wireless market in general will continue to grow as more and more devices connect to the internet through wireless networks and as AT&T continues to broaden its offerings of content and services, such as DIRECTV.
Merchandise
We categorize our sale of products and services as follows:

• | New Video Game Hardware. We offer the video game platforms of all major manufacturers, including the Sony PlayStation 4, Microsoft Xbox One and the Nintendo Switch, Wii U, and DS line. We also offer extended service agreements on video game hardware and software. Video game hardware sales are generally driven by the introduction of new platform technology and the reduction in price points as platforms mature. We are in a console cycle which began with the Nintendo Wii U launch in November 2012 and the launches of the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in November 2013. In March 2017, Nintendo introduced the Switch. We believe that selling video game hardware increases store traffic and promotes customer loyalty, leading to increased sales of video game software and accessories, which have higher gross margins than video game hardware. 


• | New Video Game Software. We purchase new video game software for current and certain prior generation consoles from the leading manufacturers, including Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft, as well as all other major third-party game publishers, such as Electronic Arts and Activision. We are one of the largest customers of video game titles sold by these publishers. We generally carry approximately 570 SKUs of new video game software at any given time across a variety of genres, including sports, action, strategy, adventure/role playing and simulation. 


• | Pre-owned and Value Video Game Products. We provide our customers with an opportunity to trade in their pre-owned video game products in our stores in exchange for store credits which can be applied towards the purchase of other products, primarily new merchandise. We believe this process drives our higher market share, particularly at launch. We resell these pre-owned video game products and have the largest selection (approximately 3,000 SKUs) of pre-owned video game titles which have an average price of $24 as compared to an average price of $46 for new video game titles and which generate significantly higher gross margins than new video game products. Our highly-customized inventory management system allows us to actively manage the pricing and product availability of our pre-owned video game products across our store base and to reallocate our inventory as necessary. Our trade-in program also allows us to be one of the only suppliers of previous generation platforms and related video games. We also operate refurbishment centers in the U.S., Canada, Australia and Europe, where defective video game products can be tested, repaired, relabeled, repackaged and redistributed back to our stores. 


• | Video Game Accessories. Video game accessories consist primarily of controllers, gaming headsets, virtual reality products, memory cards and other add-ons for use with video game hardware and software. 


• | Digital. The proliferation of online game play through Microsoft Xbox Live, the PlayStation Network and PC gaming websites has led to consumer demand for subscription, time and points cards (“digital currency”) as well as full-game downloads and DLC, for existing console video games. We sell a wide variety of digital currency and we have developed technology to sell 

5

DLC and full-game downloads in our stores and on our U.S. website. We believe we are the worldwide leading retailer of digital currency and DLC for Xbox Live and the PlayStation Network. 

• | Technology Brands. Technology Brands consist primarily of wireless products, services and accessories and consumer electronics offered in our Technology Brands segment through Spring Mobile managed AT&T and Cricket branded stores and Simply Mac stores. This product category also includes Apple and other consumer electronics products. 


• | Collectibles. Collectibles consist of licensed merchandise, primarily related to the video game, television and movie industries and pop culture themes which are sold through our video game stores, ThinkGeek stores, Zing Pop Culture stores and www.thinkgeek.com. 


• | Other Products. Other products primarily consist of PC entertainment software, gaming-related print media, mobile and consumer electronics sold through our Video Game Brands segments, and revenues from PowerUp Pro loyalty members receiving Game Informer magazine in print form. We offer PC entertainment software from many of the largest PC publishers, including Electronic Arts, Take Two and Activision across a variety of genres, including sports, action, strategy, adventure/role playing and simulation. We also carry strategy guides, magazines and interactive game figures, such as Amiibos from Nintendo and Skylanders from Activision. 

The products in our Video Games Brands segments are substantially the same regardless of geographic location, with the primary differences in merchandise being the timing of release of new products in the various geographies and language translations. Our in-store video game product inventory generally consists of a constantly changing selection averaging over 5,700 SKUs. We have buying groups in each of our segments that negotiate terms, discounts and cooperative advertising allowances for the stores in their respective geographic areas. We use customer requests and feedback, pre-orders, industry magazines and product reviews to determine which new releases are expected to be hits. Pre-orders are tracked at individual stores to distribute titles and capture demand effectively. This merchandise management is essential because a significant portion of a game’s sales are usually generated in the first days and weeks following its release.
Store Operations
We design our video game stores to provide an electronic gaming atmosphere with an engaging and visually captivating layout, with an average size of 1,500 square feet. Our video game stores are typically equipped with several video game sampling areas, which provide our customers the opportunity to play games before purchase, as well as equipment to play video game clips. We use store configuration, in-store signage and product demonstrations to produce marketing opportunities both for our vendors and for us.
Our Technology Brands stores vary in size, with an average size of approximately 1,900 square feet. Our Spring Mobile managed AT&T and Cricket branded stores carry wireless products and accessories, and our Simply Mac stores carry Apple and other consumer electronics. 
Our stores are generally located in high-traffic “power strip centers,” local neighborhood strip centers, high-traffic shopping malls and pedestrian areas, primarily in major metropolitan areas. These locations provide easy access and high frequency of visits and, in the case of strip centers and high-traffic pedestrian stores, high visibility. We target strip centers that are conveniently located, have a mass merchant or supermarket anchor tenant and have a high volume of customers.
Site Selection and Locations
Site Selection.  Site selections for new stores are made after an extensive review of demographic data, including data from our PowerUp Rewards loyalty program, and other information relating to market potential, competitor access and visibility, compatible nearby tenants, accessible parking, location visibility, lease terms and the location of our other stores. Spring Mobile managed AT&T and Cricket branded stores are selected after approval from AT&T. Simply Mac stores are selected with input from Apple. In each of our geographic segments, we have a dedicated staff of real estate personnel experienced in selecting store locations.

Game Informer
We publish Game Informer, the world’s largest print and digital video game publication and website featuring reviews of new title releases, game tips and news regarding current developments in the video game industry. Print and digital versions of the monthly magazine are sold through subscriptions, digitally and through displays in our domestic and international stores. Game Informer magazine is the fourth largest consumer publication in the U.S. and for its December 2016 issue, the magazine had approximately 6.0 million paid subscribers, including approximately 2.3 million paid digital magazine subscribers. The digital version of the magazine is the largest subscription digital magazine in the United States. Game Informer is a part of the PowerUp Rewards Pro loyalty program and is a key feature of each paid PowerUp Rewards membership. Operating results from the English version of Game Informer are included in the United States segment as this represents where the majority of subscriptions and sales are generated. Other international version results from Game Informer operations are included in the segment in which the sales are generated.
Omnichannel
We operate e-commerce sites in eight countries, under the brand names of GameStop, EB Games, Micromania and ThinkGeek, that allow our customers to buy video game products, collectibles and other merchandise online. Customers can reserve merchandise online and then pick it up in stores, or order products that may not be in-stock in stores and have it shipped to their homes. The sites also offer customers information and content about available games, release dates for upcoming games, and access to store information, such as location and product availability. E-commerce results are included in the geographic segment where the sales originate. Additionally, with the GameStop mobile app, smart phone users can browse our extensive product selection and experience an enhanced PowerUp Rewards dashboard. We estimate that the GameStop mobile app has been installed over 8 million times. 
Kongregate
We operate Kongregate, which is a leading web and mobile gaming platform that has attracted over 5.2 billion web gameplays and over 2.5 billion mobile gameplays since its launch. Kongregate is also a publisher of mobile games and has several titles available in both the Apple and Google app stores, which have received over 110 million mobile installs. Over 34,000 developers have uploaded more than 112,000 games to www.kongregate.com. The majority of Kongregate’s revenues come from its mobile apps and in-game transactions utilizing a proprietary virtual currency called Kreds. Kongregate’s mobile publishing division has several titles available in both the Apple and Google app stores.
Advertising
Given the high foot traffic drawn past our stores, we use in-store marketing efforts such as window displays and “coming soon” signs to attract customers, as well as to promote our products. Inside our stores, we feature selected products through the use of vendor displays, “coming soon” or preview videos, signs, catalogs, point-of-purchase materials and end-cap displays. These advertising efforts are designed to increase the initial sales of new titles upon their release.
On a global basis, we receive cooperative advertising and market development funds from most of our manufacturers, distributors, software publishers and accessory suppliers to promote their respective products. Generally, vendors agree to purchase advertising space in one of our advertising vehicles. Once we run the advertising, the vendor pays us an agreed amount.
Our loyalty programs are designed to incent our customers to shop more often at our stores and to allow us to market directly to our customers based on their individual tastes and preferences. Our loyalty programs provide members with the opportunity to earn unique video game related rewards not available through any other retailer. Vendors also participate in these programs to increase the sales of their individual products. 
In the last several years, as part of our brand-building efforts and targeted growth strategies, we expanded our advertising and promotional activities in certain targeted markets at key times of the year. In addition, we expanded our use of television and radio advertising in certain markets to promote brand awareness, our pre-owned business and store openings. We expect our investment in advertising to increase in certain areas to support our targeted growth strategies.
Distribution and Information Management
Our operating strategy involves providing a broad merchandise selection to our customers as quickly and as cost-effectively as possible. We use our inventory management systems to maximize the efficiency of the flow of products to our stores, enhance store efficiency and optimize store in-stock and overall investment in inventory.
Distribution.  We operate distribution facilities in various locations throughout the world, with each location strategically located to support the operations in a particular country or region. In order to enhance our first-to-market distribution network, we also utilize the services of several off-site, third-party operated distribution centers that pick up products from our suppliers, repackage the products for each of our stores and ship those products to our stores by package carriers. Inventory is shipped to each store at least twice a week, or daily, if necessary, in order to keep stores in supply of products. Our distribution facilities also typically support refurbishment of pre-owned products to be redistributed to our stores.
8

We distribute products to our U.S. stores and on-line customers through a 353,000 square foot distribution center in Grapevine, Texas and a 631,000 square foot distribution center in Shepherdsville, Kentucky. The technology used in the distribution centers allows for high-volume receiving and distributions to stores.
We distribute merchandise to our Canadian segment from two distribution centers in Brampton, Ontario. We have a distribution center near Brisbane, Australia which supports our Australian operations and a small distribution facility in New Zealand which supports the stores in New Zealand. European segment operations are supported by four regionally-located distribution centers in Milan, Italy; Memmingen, Germany; Dublin, Ireland; and Paris, France. 
Digital Distribution.  We have developed proprietary technology to work in conjunction with developers, as well as Microsoft and Sony, to enable us to sell DLC and full-game downloads in our stores and on our e-commerce sites. 
Management Information Systems.  Our proprietary inventory management systems and point-of-sale technology show daily sales and in-store stock by title by store. Our systems use this data to automatically generate replenishment shipments to each store from our distribution centers, enabling each store to carry a merchandise assortment uniquely tailored to its own sales mix and rate of sale. Our call lists and reservation system also provide our buying staff with information to determine order size and inventory management for store-by-store inventory allocation. 
To support most of our operations, we use a large-scale, Intel-based computing environment with a state-of-the-art storage area network and a wired and wireless corporate network installed at our U.S. and regional international headquarters, and a secure, virtual private network to access and provide services to computing assets located in our stores, distribution centers and satellite offices and to our mobile workforce. This strategy has proven to minimize initial outlay of capital while allowing for flexibility and growth as operations expand. Regional communication links exist to each of our distribution centers and offices in international locations with connectivity to our U.S. data center as required by our international, distributed applications.
Our proprietary point-of-sale system has been enhanced to facilitate trade-in transactions, including automatic look-up of trade-in prices and printing of machine-readable bar codes to facilitate in-store restocking of pre-owned video games. In addition, our central database of all pre-owned and value video game products allows us to actively manage the pricing and product availability of our pre-owned video game products across our store base and reallocate our pre-owned and value video game products as necessary.
Field Management and Staff
Each of our Video Game Brands stores employs, on average, one store leader, one assistant store leader and between two and ten sales associates, many of whom are part-time employees. Each store leader is responsible for managing their personnel and the economic performance of their store. We have cultivated a work environment that attracts employees who are actively interested in video games so that they are better able to assist customers. To encourage them to sell the full range of our products and to maximize our profitability, we provide our employees with targeted incentive programs to drive overall sales and sales of higher margin products. 
Our stores communicate with our corporate offices daily via e-mail. This e-mail allows for better tracking of trends in upcoming titles, competitor strategies and in-stock inventory positions and the opportunity to communicate directly with our executives. We have invested in significant management training programs for our store leaders and our district leaders to enhance their business management skills. We also sponsor our annual store leaders’ conferences at which we conduct intense educational training programs to provide our video game store employees with information about the upcoming video game products that will be released by publishers during the holiday season. All video game software publishers and vendors are invited to attend the conferences.
Our Video Game Brands store operations are managed by market vice presidents or managing directors (in the case of international markets) who directly supervise regional leaders. The regions are further divided into districts, each with a district leader covering an average of 15 stores. 
Our Technology Brands segment is managed by a senior vice president who manages a vice president for each of our three store concepts. We operate the AT&T branded, Cricket branded and Simply Mac branded stores with a field management and store management structure similar to that of our Video Game Brands stores. 
Vendors
We purchase substantially all of our new products worldwide from approximately 90 manufacturers, software publishers and several distributors. Purchases from the top ten vendors in our Video Game Brands segments accounted for approximately 78% of our new product purchases in fiscal 2016. Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo, Electronic Arts and Activision accounted for 24%, 14%, 10%, 7% and 6%, respectively, of our new product purchases in our Video Game Brands segments during fiscal 2016. We have established price protections with our primary video game product vendors in order to reduce our risk of inventory obsolescence. In addition, we have few purchase contracts with video game trade vendors and generally conduct business on an order-by-order basis, a practice that is typical throughout the industry. We purchase substantially all of our products in our Technology Brands segment through our agreements with AT&T and Apple. We believe that maintaining and strengthening our long-term relationships with our vendors is essential to our operations and continued expansion. We believe that we have very good relationships with our vendors.

Competition
The video game industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid changes in consumer preferences and frequent new product introductions. We compete with mass merchants and regional chains; computer product and consumer electronics stores; other video game and PC software specialty stores; toy retail chains; direct sales by software publishers; and online retailers and game rental companies. Video game products are also distributed through other methods such as digital delivery. We also compete with sellers of pre-owned and value video game products. Additionally, we compete with other forms of entertainment activities, including casual and mobile games, movies, television, theater, sporting events and family entertainment centers.
In the U.S., we compete with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (“Wal-Mart”); Target Corporation (“Target”); Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon.com”); and Best Buy Co., Inc. (“Best Buy”), among others. Throughout Europe we compete with major consumer electronics retailers such as Media Markt, Saturn and FNAC, major hypermarket chains like Carrefour and Auchan, and online retailer Amazon.com. Competitors in Canada include Wal-Mart and Best Buy. In Australia, competitors include K-Mart, Target and JB HiFi stores.
Our Spring Mobile AT&T branded stores compete with mass market retailers such as Wal-Mart, Best Buy and Target, among others, as well as other pre-paid and post-paid wireless carriers and their distribution channels, including Verizon, Sprint and T-Mobile. Our Simply Mac stores compete with mass-market retailers as noted above. Our Spring Mobile managed Cricket branded stores compete with the pre-paid and post-paid wireless service offerings of Verizon, T-Mobile, Sprint and other prepaid brands including Boost, GoPhone and MetroPCS.
Seasonality
Our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal, with the major portion of our sales and operating profit realized during the fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the holiday selling season. During fiscal 2016 and 2015, we generated approximately 35% and 38%, respectively, of our sales during the fourth quarter.
Trademarks 
We have a number of trademarks and servicemarks, including “GameStop,” “Game Informer,” “EB Games,” “Electronics Boutique,” “ThinkGeek,” “Spring Mobile,” “Simply Mac,” “Kongregate,” “Power to the PlayersTM” and “PowerUp Rewards,” which have been registered by us with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. For many of our trademarks and servicemarks, including “Micromania,” we also have registered or have registrations pending with the trademark authorities throughout the world. We maintain a policy of pursuing registration of our principal marks and opposing any infringement of our marks.
Employees
We have approximately 23,000 full-time salaried and hourly employees and between 30,000 and 45,000 part-time hourly employees worldwide, depending on the time of year. Fluctuation in the number of part-time hourly employees is due to the seasonality of our business. We believe that our relationship with our employees is excellent. Some of our international employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, while none of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor union or are members of a collective bargaining unit.
Sustainability
We are committed to sustainability and to operating our business in a manner that results in a positive impact to the environment and our communities. Through our trade-in program, we take in software (CDs), gaming consoles and consumer electronics that are otherwise destined for landfills and either refurbish them or recycle them. In 2016 alone, through our U.S. refurbishment center, the company refurbished over 8 million pieces of software (CDs) and over 3.9 million consumer electronic devices, and recycled almost 3 million pounds of e-waste. In addition, we continuously measure, and look for cost-effective ways to reduce, our carbon emissions and have seen both our total emissions and emissions by store decrease over the past five years.
