Item 1. Business
General
Belden Inc. (the Company, us, we, or our) connects and protects the world with the industry’s most complete suite of end-to-end specialty networking solutions.  Our comprehensive portfolio of solutions enables customers to transmit and secure data, sound, and video for mission critical applications across complex enterprise and industrial environments. Our business is organized around two global business platforms, Enterprise Solutions and Industrial Solutions, both of which provide the opportunity to drive future growth due to favorable secular trends. Each business platform represents a reportable segment. Financial information about our segments appears in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
We sell our products to distributors, end-users, installers, and directly to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Belden Inc. is a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1988, but the Company’s roots date back to its founding by Joseph Belden in 1902.
As used herein, unless an operating segment is identified or the context otherwise requires, “Belden,” the “Company”, and “we” refer to Belden Inc. and its subsidiaries as a whole.
Strategy and Business Model
In 2020, we executed our strategy around three transformative actions. First, we divested Grass Valley in order to simplify our portfolio and meet our strategic revenue growth goals. Next, we streamlined our cost structure by reducing Selling, General, and Administrative expenses by approximately $40 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, with an annualized impact of approximately $60 million. Finally, we initiated processes to divest up to approximately $200 million of low-margin cable product lines that do not meet our long-term revenue growth and profitability goals. After the completion of these strategic actions, our portfolio of businesses will be well positioned to meet our long-term goals and deliver shareholder value. 
Our portfolio and strategic priorities align with attractive end markets with favorable secular trends. Within Industrial Solutions, the growing demand for automated production and the ever-increasing need for network security drive demand for our solutions. Enterprise Solutions benefits from increasing consumer demand for more internet bandwidth and faster speeds, investment in 5G technology, and trends requiring integrated networks in smart buildings. We are well positioned to benefit from these secular trends in the form of improved revenue growth and expanded Adjusted EBITDA margins in the future.
Our business model is designed to generate shareholder value:

•Operational Excellence—The core of our business model is operational excellence and the execution of our Belden Business System. The Belden Business System has three areas of focus. First, we demonstrate a commitment to Lean enterprise initiatives, which improve not only the quality and efficiency of the manufacturing environment, but our business processes on a company-wide basis. Second, we utilize our Market Delivery System (MDS), a go-to-market model that provides the foundation for organic growth. We believe that organic growth, resulting from both market growth and share capture, is essential to our success. Finally, our Talent Management System supports the development of our associates at all levels, which preserves the culture necessary to operate our business consistently and sustainably.
•Cash Generation—Our pursuit of operational excellence results in the generation of cash flow. We generated cash flows from operating activities of $173.4 million, $276.9 million, and $289.2 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.
•Portfolio Improvement—We utilize the cash flow generated by our business to fuel our continued transformation and generate shareholder value. We continuously improve our portfolio to ensure we provide the most complete, end-to-end solutions to our customers. Our portfolio is designed with balance across end markets and geographies to ensure we can meet our goals in most economic environments. We have a disciplined acquisition cultivation, execution, and integration system that allows us to invest in outstanding companies that strengthen our capabilities and enhance our ability to serve our customers.
Segments
We operate our business under the two segments – Enterprise Solutions and Industrial Solutions. Effective January 1, 2020, we transferred our West Penn Wire business and multi-conductor product lines from the Enterprise Solutions segment to the Industrial Solutions segment as a result of a shift in responsibilities among the segments. We have recast the prior period segment information to conform to the change in the composition of reportable segments. A synopsis of the segments is included below:
Enterprise Solutions
The Enterprise Solutions (Enterprise) segment is a leading provider in network infrastructure solutions, as well as cabling and connectivity solutions for commercial audio/video and security applications. We serve customers in markets such as healthcare, education, financial, government, corporate enterprises and broadband service providers, as well as end-markets, including sport venues and academia. Enterprise product lines include copper cable and connectivity solutions, fiber cable and connectivity solutions, racks and enclosures, and secure, high performance signal extension and matrix switching systems. Our products are used in applications such as local area networks, data centers, access control, Fiber to the Home and building automation. Enterprise provides true end-to-end copper and fiber network systems to include cable, assemblies, interconnect panels, and enclosures. Our high-performance solutions support all networking protocols up to and including 100G+ Ethernet technologies. Enterprise’s innovative products can deliver data in addition to power over Ethernet, which meets the higher performance requirements driven by the increasing number of connections in smart buildings. Enterprise products also include intelligent power, cooling, and airflow management for mission-critical data center operations. The Enterprise product portfolio is designed to support Internet Protocol convergence, the increased use of wireless communications, and cloud-based data centers by our customers. Our systems are installed through a network of highly trained system integrators and are supplied through authorized distributors.
Industrial Solutions
The Industrial Solutions (Industrial) segment is a leading provider of high performance networking and machine connectivity products. Industrial products include physical network and fieldbus infrastructure components and on-machine connectivity systems to meet end user and OEM needs. Products are designed to provide reliability and confidence of performance for a wide range of industrial automation applications. The products are used in markets that include discrete automation, process automation, energy and mass transit. Applications include network and fieldbus infrastructure; sensor and actuator connectivity; and power, control, and data transmission. Industrial products include solutions such as industrial Ethernet switches, network management software, routers, firewalls, gateways, input/output (I/O) connectors/systems, industrial Ethernet cables, optical fiber industrial Ethernet cables, Fieldbus cables, IP and networking cables, I/O modules, distribution boxes, and customer specific wiring solutions.
Our industrial cable products are used in discrete manufacturing and process operations involving the connection of computers, programmable controllers, robots, operator interfaces, motor drives, sensors, printers, and other devices. Many industrial environments, such as petrochemical and other harsh-environment operations, require cables with exterior armor or jacketing that can endure physical abuse and exposure to chemicals, extreme temperatures, and outside elements. Other applications require conductors, insulation, and jacketing materials that can withstand repeated flexing. In addition to cable product configurations for these applications, we supply heat-shrinkable tubing and wire management products to protect and organize wire and cable assemblies. Our industrial connector products are primarily used as sensor and actuator connections in factory automation supporting various fieldbus protocols as well as power connections in building automation. These products are used both as components of manufacturing equipment and in the installation and networking of such equipment.
Industrial Solutions products are sold directly to industrial equipment OEMs and through a network of industrial distributors, value-added resellers, and system integrators.
See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our segments.
Acquisitions
A key part of our business strategy includes acquiring companies to support our growth and enhance our product portfolio. Our acquisition strategy is based upon targeting leading companies that offer innovative products and strong brands. We utilize a disciplined approach to acquisitions based on product and market opportunities. When we identify acquisition candidates, we conduct rigorous financial and cultural analyses to make certain that they meet both our strategic plan targets and our goal for return on invested capital of 13-15%.
We have completed a number of acquisitions in recent years as part of this strategy. Most recently, in January 2021, we acquired OTN Systems N.V. (OTN), a leading provider of automation networking infrastructure solutions - refer to Note 28, Subsequent Events, for further discussion. In December 2019, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Special Product Company (SPC), a leading designer, manufacturer, and seller of outdoor cabinet products for optical fiber cable installations. In April 2019, we acquired the FutureLink business from Suttle Inc. as well as Opterna International Corp. (Opterna), which designs and manufactures complementary fiber connectivity, cabinet, and enclosure products used in optical networks.The results of SPC, FutureLink, and Opterna have been included in our Consolidated Financial Statements as of their acquisition dates, and are reported within the Enterprise Solutions segment. In 2018, we acquired Net-Tech Technology, Inc. (NT2), an integrator of optical passive components and network optimization products used within broadband network applications where 
optical backhaul is used. The results of NT2 have been included in our Consolidated Financial Statements from the acquisition date, and are reported within the Enterprise Solutions segment. For more information regarding these transactions, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Customers
We sell to distributors, OEMs, installers, and end-users. On June 22, 2020, WESCO International, Inc (WESCO) acquired Anixter International, Inc. (Anixter), our largest distributor. References to "WESCO" in the remainder of this report will be inclusive of Anixter. For the year ended December 31, 2020, sales to WESCO represented approximately 15% of our consolidated revenues. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenues in 2020. 
We have supply agreements with distributors and OEM customers. In general, our customers are not contractually obligated to buy our products exclusively, in minimum amounts, or for a significant period of time. We believe that our relationships with our customers and distributors are good and that they are loyal to Belden products as a result of our reputation, the breadth of our product portfolio, the quality and performance characteristics of our products, and our customer service and technical support, among other reasons.
International Operations
In addition to manufacturing facilities in the United States (U.S.), we have manufacturing and other operating facilities in Brazil, Canada, China, India, Mexico, and St. Kitts, as well as in various countries in Europe. During 2020, approximately 45% of Belden’s sales were to customers outside the U.S. Our primary channels to international markets include both distributors and direct sales to end users and OEMs.
Financial information for Belden by country is shown in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Competition
The markets in which we operate can be generally categorized as highly competitive with many players. In order to maximize our competitive advantages, we manage our product portfolio to capitalize on secular trends and high-growth applications in those markets. Based on available data for our served markets, we estimate that our market share across our segments is significant, ranging from approximately 5% – 20%. A substantial acquisition in one of our served markets would be necessary to meaningfully change our estimated market share percentage.
The principal competitive factors in all our product markets are technical features, quality, availability, price, customer support, and distribution coverage. The relative importance of each of these factors varies depending on the customer. Some products are manufactured to meet published industry specifications and are less differentiated on the basis of product characteristics. We believe that Belden stands out in many of our markets on the basis of the breadth of our product portfolio, the quality and performance characteristics of our products, our customer service, and our technical support.
Research and Development
We conduct research and development on an ongoing basis, including new and existing hardware and software product development, testing and analysis, and process and equipment development and testing. See the Consolidated Statements of Operations for amounts incurred for research and development. Many of the markets we serve are characterized by advances in information processing and communications capabilities, including advances driven by the expansion of digital technology, which require increased transmission speeds and greater bandwidth. Our markets are also subject to increasing requirements for mobility, information security, and transmission reliability. Some of our markets are using workflows and resources in public and private cloud and showing preference for software products delivered as services. We believe that our future success will depend in part upon our ability to enhance existing products and to develop, manufacture and deliver new products that meet or anticipate such changes in our served markets.
In our Enterprise Solutions segment, in order to support the demand for additional bandwidth and to improve service integrity, broadband service providers are investing in their networks to enhance delivery capabilities to customers for the foreseeable future. Additional bandwidth requirements resulting from increased traffic expose weak points in the network, which are often connectivity related, causing broadband service operators to improve and upgrade residential networks with higher performing connectivity products.
In our Industrial Solutions segment, there is a compelling need among global enterprises, service providers and government agencies to detect, prevent and respond to cyber security threats. This is a long-standing need within corporate networks, but we believe the rapid proliferation of new devices in the “internet of things” will continue to cause this need to broaden and accelerate. Additionally, cyber-attacks are moving beyond traditional targets into critical infrastructure, which will further amplify the importance of our work in network security. Furthermore, there is a growing trend toward adoption of Industrial Ethernet technology, bringing to the critical infrastructure the advantages of digital communication and the ability to network devices made by different manufacturers and integrate them with enterprise systems. While the adoption of this technology is at a more advanced stage in certain regions of the world, we believe that the trend will globalize. This trend will also lead to a rising need for wireless systems for some applications and for cybersecurity to protect this critical infrastructure. Part of our research and development is focused on creating scalable, efficient technologies to provide real-time instrumentation and analytics across entire networks. This includes delivering high-fidelity visibility and deep intelligence about networked systems, their vulnerabilities, and providing actionable information about how to effectively secure them. Additionally, we have highly-skilled and active research teams who analyze current and anticipated threats, and provide offerings to the market to enable customers to quickly detect and resolve cybersecurity threats.
Our research and development efforts are also focused on fiber optic technology, which presents a potential substitute for certain of the copper-based products that comprise a portion of our revenues. Fiber optic cables have certain advantages over copper-based cables in applications where large amounts of information must travel significant distances and where high levels of information security are required. While the cost to interface electronic and optical light signals and to terminate and connect optical fiber remains comparatively high, we expect that in future years the cost difference versus traditional copper networks will diminish. We sell fiber optic infrastructure, and many customers specify these products in combination with copper-based infrastructure. The final stage of most networks remains almost exclusively copper-based, and we expect that it will continue to be copper for the foreseeable future. However, if a significant decrease in the cost of fiber optic systems relative to the cost of copper-based systems were to occur, such systems could become superior on a price/performance basis to copper-based systems. Part of our research and development efforts focus on expanding our fiber-optic based product portfolio.
Patents and Trademarks
We have a policy of seeking patents when appropriate on inventions concerning new products, product improvements, and advances in equipment and processes as part of our ongoing research, development, and manufacturing activities. We own many patents and registered trademarks worldwide that are used by our operating segments, with pending applications for numerous others. We consider our patents and trademarks to be valuable assets. Our most prominent trademarks are: Belden®, Alpha Wire™, GarrettCom®, Hirschmann®, Lumberg Automation™, Mohawk®, Poliron™, PPC®, ProSoft Technology®, Thinklogical®, Tofino®, Tripwire® and West Penn Wire™.
Raw Materials
The principal raw material used in many of our cable products is copper. Other materials we purchase in large quantities include fluorinated ethylene-propylene (FEP), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene, aluminum-clad steel and copper-clad steel conductors, aluminum, brass, other metals, optical fiber, printed circuit boards, and electronic components. With respect to all major raw materials used by us, we generally have either alternative sources of supply or access to alternative materials. Supplies of these materials are generally adequate and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future.
Over the past three years, the prices of metals, particularly copper, have been highly volatile. The chart below illustrates the high and low spot prices per pound of copper over the last three years.

 | 2020 | | 2019 | 2018
Copper spot prices per pound | | | | 
High | $ | 3.63 | | $ | 2.98 | $ | 3.29
Low | $ | 2.12 | | $ | 2.51 | $ | 2.56

Prices for materials such as PVC and other plastics derived from petrochemical feedstocks have also fluctuated. Since Belden utilizes the first in, first out (FIFO) inventory costing methodology, the impact of copper and other raw material cost changes on our cost of goods sold is delayed by approximately two months based on our rate of inventory turnover.
While we generally are able to adjust our pricing for fluctuations in commodity prices, we can experience short-term favorable or unfavorable variances. When the cost of raw materials increases, we are generally able to recover these costs through higher pricing of our finished products. The majority of our products are sold through distribution, and we manage the pricing of these 
products through published price lists, which we update from time to time, with new prices typically taking effect a few weeks after they are announced. Some OEM customer contracts have provisions for passing through raw material cost changes, generally with a lag of a few weeks to three months.
Backlog
Our business is characterized generally by short-term order and shipment schedules. Our backlog consists of product orders for which we have received a customer purchase order or purchase commitment and which have not yet been shipped. Orders are generally subject to cancellation or rescheduling by the customer. As of December 31, 2020, our backlog of orders believed to be firm was $223.0 million. The majority of the backlog at December 31, 2020 is scheduled to ship in the first quarter of 2021.
Environmental Matters
We are subject to numerous federal, state, provincial, local, and foreign laws and regulations relating to the storage, handling, emission, and discharge of materials into the environment, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; the Clean Water Act; the Clean Air Act; the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; and similar laws in the other countries in which we operate. While we believe that our existing environmental control procedures are adequate, we will continue to evaluate and update our procedures as needed to address new or changing aspects of environmental matters.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 6,200 and 200 full-time and contractor employees, respectively, worldwide, of which approximately 65%, 20% and 15% were in North and South America, EMEA, and APAC, respectively. Approximately 1,700 employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements at various locations around the world. We believe our relationship with our employees is generally positive, and we measure and monitor the workforce's sustainable engagement, among other metrics, to ensure this remains the case.
Our culture and principles enable us to attract, retain, motivate and develop our workforce as well as drive employee engagement. We believe an engaged workforce leads to a more innovative, productive and profitable company. Our employees around the world live our Belden Values every day and work to ensure that our products and services connect and protect our customers critical infrastructure. Reflective of our corporate value "We Invest in Talent," our employees are highly engaged, scoring 88% positive in our most recent employee survey. Furthermore, we were recognized by Great Place to Work in Germany, Brazil and India, where we were also recognized as a Great Place to Work for Women. 
The ethnic and gender diversity of our senior leadership team has increased with new strategic hires from outside the Company alongside internal promotions. The number of women serving as independent directors on our board of directors has further increased to 33%. During 2020, we also appointed a new Director of Inclusive Culture and continue to partner with organizations as we look to identify further opportunities to improve diversity, inclusion and belonging across our company.
During 2020, we launched our Connect with Community program, which enables Belden employees to take a week’s paid time away from work to volunteer in their local communities. As a result, a broad range of communities around the world have benefited from the efforts of our team members who have worked with food banks, environmental organizations, education establishments and community development charities across the world. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we also introduced our voluntary flex-time program, which enables most of our employees outside of direct production to take time off to deal with personal and family matters, resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, and receive 25% of their pay during such period. 
We continually evolve our Early Career Leadership program. This 3-year rotational program enables talented graduates to work around the world in challenging roles within their chosen business function and prepares them to be the leaders of the future. As of December 31, 2020, the Early Career Leadership program had an exceptional retention rate of 100% and comprised over 80 participants, of which 46% were female.
