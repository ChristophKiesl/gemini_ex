Item 1. Business
Company Overview
Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Spectrum,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company, with a strategy of acquiring, developing, and commercializing novel and targeted oncology therapies. We have an in-house clinical development organization with regulatory and data management capabilities, in addition to commercial infrastructure and a field based sales force for our marketed product, ROLVEDON™ (eflapegrastim).
We have one commercial asset and one drug candidate in late-stage development:
•ROLVEDON™ is a novel long-acting granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (“G-CSF”) for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. On April 11, 2022, we announced that we had received notice that the resubmission of our Biologics License Application (“BLA”) for ROLVEDON had been accepted for filing and received a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) date of September 9, 2022. On September 9, 2022, we received 
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (“FDA”) marketing approval for ROLVEDON and began commercialization activities in the fourth quarter of 2022; and 
•Poziotinib is a novel irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor (“TKI”) under investigation for non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”) tumors with various mutations. On December 6, 2021, we announced we submitted our New Drug Application (“NDA”) for poziotinib to the FDA for use in patients with previously treated locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations. The NDA submission was based on the positive results of Cohort 2 from the ZENITH20 clinical trial, which assessed the safety and efficacy of poziotinib. The product candidate received fast track designation from the FDA and there is currently no treatment specifically approved by the FDA for this indication. On February 11, 2022, we announced that we received notice from the FDA that the NDA had been accepted for filing and received a PDUFA action date of November 24, 2022. On September 22, 2022, we met with the FDA’s Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (“ODAC”). The ODAC voted 9 (no) - 4 (yes) that the current benefits of poziotinib did not outweigh its risks for the treatment of patients with NSCLC with HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations. On November 25, 2022, we announced that we had received a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”) from the FDA regarding our NDA. The CRL stated that the FDA determined that it could not approve the NDA in its present form and provided recommendations needed for resubmission, including generating additional data from a randomized controlled study prior to approval. We are continuing to evaluate these recommendations but we have de-prioritized further poziotinib development activities. 
Cancer Background and Market Size
Cancer is a group of diseases characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells, which can result in death. The development of cancer is multi-factorial and includes both external factors (tobacco, infectious organisms, chemicals, and radiation) and internal factors (inherited mutations, hormones, immune conditions, and mutations that occur from exposure to environmental factors or errors in making DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) during normal cell division). These causal factors may act together or in sequence to initiate or promote the development of cancer. Ten or more years often pass between exposure to these factors and the development of detectable cancer. Cancer is treated through surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, immunotherapy, and/or targeted drug therapy.
According to the American Cancer Society’s publication Cancer Facts & Figures 2022, cancer is the second leading cause of death in the U.S. (only behind heart disease). In the U.S., approximately 1.9 million new cancer cases are expected to be diagnosed in 2022 and approximately 609,360 persons were expected to die from the disease. Anyone can develop cancer. Since the risk of being diagnosed with cancer increases with age, most cases occur in adults who are middle aged or older. About 80% of all cancers are diagnosed in people 55 years of age or older. In the U.S., approximately 40 out of 100 men and 39 out of 100 women will develop cancer during their lifetime. These probabilities are estimated based on the overall experience of the general population. Individuals within the population may have higher or lower risk because of differences in exposures (e.g., smoking), and/or genetic susceptibility. In addition, currently available treatments are variably effective for different cancers and individual patients. Together these patients’ risks and the treatment limitations suggest a significant current and long-term demand for improved and novel cancer treatments.
Product Portfolio
Our product portfolio consists of one commercial product and product candidates for the treatment of cancer patients. Serious adverse effects (“SAEs”) in patients from our product and product candidates could result in a clinical hold or the withdrawal of regulatory approval and have a negative impact on future sales. See our specific SAE risk factor within Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business --Reports of adverse events or safety concerns involving our commercial product or in-development products or similar agents, could delay or prevent us from obtaining or maintaining regulatory approval or negatively impact sales.
Commercial Product
ROLVEDON
ROLVEDON (eflapegrastim) is a novel long-acting G-CSF that employs a proprietary LAPSCOVERY™ technology designed to enhance the duration of therapeutic effects and reduce the frequency of administration. ROLVEDON is FDA-approved for the treatment of adult patients with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. We have a co-development and commercialization agreement with Hanmi Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (“Hanmi”) for ROLVEDON worldwide rights, except in Korea, China, and Japan, which we entered into in January 2012. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) has issued a permanent, product-specific J-code for ROLVEDON (J1449), which becomes effective on April 1, 2023. The 
unique J-code, as well as ROLVEDON’S inclusion in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network® Supportive Care Guidelines, are important elements in establishing brand awareness and building customer confidence in our novel product.
Chemotherapy can cause myelosuppression that can lead to neutropenia, a condition where the number of neutrophils or white blood cells are too low, which can lead to infection, hospitalization, and even death. G-CSF stimulates the production of white blood cells by the bone marrow. A recombinant form of G-CSF is used in appropriate cancer patients to accelerate recovery from neutropenia after chemotherapy, allowing higher-intensity treatment regimens to be given at full-dosage and on schedule. 
We submitted our BLA for ROLVEDON to the FDA on October 24, 2019. Our BLA was supported by data from two similarly designed Phase 3 clinical trials, ADVANCE and RECOVER, which evaluated the safety and efficacy of ROLVEDON in 643 early-stage breast cancer patients for the treatment of neutropenia due to myelosuppressive chemotherapy. Both studies met the pre-specified endpoint of non-inferiority relative to pegfilgrastim in duration of severe neutropenia and met all of the secondary endpoints. In addition, the safety profile was similar to pegfilgrastim. On April 11, 2022, we announced that we had received notice that our BLA had been accepted for filing and received a PDUFA action date of September 9, 2022. On September 9, 2022, we received the FDA marketing approval for ROLVEDON and began commercialization activities in the fourth quarter of 2022. In February 2023, the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) issued a permanent J-code, J1449 for ROLVEDON, effective April 1, 2023. 
A company sponsored clinical trial that has been initiated to evaluate the administration of eflapegrastim on the same day as chemotherapy is currently ongoing. This Phase 1 clinical trial is a randomized, open label, actively controlled study to evaluate the same-day dosing of eflapegrastim on duration of neutropenia when administered at varying intervals following docetaxel and cyclophosphamide (TC) chemotherapy in patients with early-stage breast cancer. The study was completed with the enrollment of 16 patients dosed with eflapegrastim 30 minutes after chemotherapy on the same day in Cycle 1. The study added an Expansion Phase with a plan to dose approximately 45 patients with eflapegrastim 30 minutes after the chemotherapy on the same day in all 4 cycles. The overall safety profile to date for the 30-minute arm was similar to what has been seen previously in large, randomized studies with G-CSF given 24 hours after chemotherapy. The safety will be monitored continuously throughout the Expansion Phase of the study. An evaluation of safety and efficacy will be conducted once the data from 6 patients in the Expansion Phase is complete to determine the trend. 
As part of the post-market requirement, Spectrum is expected to conduct a pediatric study in Rolvedon that includes the development of an appropriate formulation to dose certain pediatric patients of 1 month to 17 years of age based on weight-based dosing. The study as well as the development of a pediatric formulation is in progress. 
In Development Pipeline
Poziotinib
Poziotinib is a novel, pan-HER inhibitor that is designed to irreversibly block signaling through the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (“EGFR”) family of TKIs, including HER1 (erbB1; EGFR), HER2 (erbB2), HER4 (erbB4), and HER receptor mutations. This, in turn, leads to the inhibition of the proliferation of tumor cells that over-express these receptors. Mutations of over-expression/amplification of EGFR family receptors have been associated with a number of different cancers, including NSCLC, breast cancer, and gastric cancer. In March 2015, we entered into a co-development and commercialization agreement with Hanmi for poziotinib worldwide rights, except in Korea and China.
Our clinical development program for poziotinib has been focused on previously treated locally or advanced metastatic NSCLC, first-line treatment of NSCLC and treatment of other solid tumors with HER2 mutations. NSCLC tumors with HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations are rare and have generally not been responsive to other TKIs. Patients with these mutations have a poor prognosis, and available treatment options are limited. Poziotinib, due to its unique chemical structure and characteristics, is believed to inhibit cell growth of tumors with HER2 exon-20 insertion mutations. 
In October 2017, we announced the start of a pivotal Phase 2 global clinical trial with active sites in the U.S., Canada and Europe (“ZENITH20”). The ZENITH20 trial consisted of seven cohorts of NSCLC patients. Cohorts 1, 2, 3 and 4 had completed enrollment while Cohorts 5, 6, and 7 ceased enrolling patients upon the receipt of the CRL (discussed below). Cohorts 1 (EGFR) and 2 (HER2) included previously treated NSCLC patients with exon 20 mutations. Cohort 3 (EGFR) and 4 (HER2) included first-line NSCLC patients with exon 20 mutations. Cohorts 1- 4 were each independently powered for a pre-specified statistical hypothesis and the primary endpoint was objective response rate (“ORR”). Cohort 5 included previously treated or treatment-naïve NSCLC patients with EGFR or HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations and evaluated different dosing regimens. Cohort 6 included NSCLC patients with classical EGFR mutations who progressed while on treatment with first-line 
osimertinib and developed an additional EGFR mutation. Cohort 7 included NSCLC patients with a variety of less common mutations in EGFR or HER2 exons 18-21 or the extracellular or transmembrane domains.
On December 26, 2019, we announced that the pre-specified primary endpoint was not met in Cohort 1 of the ZENITH20 trial evaluating poziotinib in previously treated NSCLC patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations. Cohort 1 enrolled a total of 115 patients who received 16 mg/day of poziotinib. The intent-to-treat analysis showed that 17 patients had a response (by RECIST) and 62 patients had stable disease for a 68.7% disease control rate (“DCR”). The confirmed ORR was 14.8% (95% Confidence Interval (“CI”) 8.9%-22.6%). The median duration of response was 7.4 months and the progression free survival was 4.2 months. The safety profile was in-line with other second-generation EGFR TKIs. 
On July 27, 2020, we announced that we met the pre-specified primary endpoint for Cohort 2 in the ZENITH20 trial evaluating previously treated NSCLC patients with HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations. Cohort 2 enrolled a total of 90 patients who received an oral, once daily dose of 16 mg of poziotinib. All the patients had failed at least one line of prior systemic therapy with 60 patients (67%) having failed two or more prior therapies, including chemotherapy and immunotherapy. All responses were read independently and confirmed by a central imaging laboratory using RECIST criteria. The intent-to-treat analysis demonstrated a confirmed ORR of 27.8% (95% CI of 18.9%-38.2%). Based on the pre-specified statistical hypothesis for the primary endpoint, the observed lower bound of 18.9% exceeded the pre-specified lower bound of 17% in this heavily pre-treated population. The safety profile was in-line with the type of adverse events seen with other second-generation EGFR TKIs. These results were presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology (“ESMO”) Virtual Congress 2020 Science Weekend held in September 2020.
In December 2020, we reported that the pre-specified primary endpoint in Cohort 3 evaluating poziotinib in first-line NSCLC patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations was not met. Cohort 3 of the ZENITH20 clinical trial enrolled a total of 79 patients who received an oral once daily dose of 16 mg of poziotinib. The median time of follow up of all patients was 9.2 months. The intent-to-treat analysis showed that 22 patients had a partial response (by RECIST) and 68 patients had stable disease for an 86.1% DCR. 91% of patients experienced tumor reduction with a median reduction of 25.5%. The confirmed ORR was 27.8% (95% CI 18.4-39.1%). Based on the pre-specified statistical hypothesis for the primary endpoint, the observed lower bound of 18.4% did not meet the pre-specified lower bound of >20%. The median duration of response was 6.5 months and the median progression free survival was 7.2 months. The safety profile was similar with the type of adverse events observed with other second-generation EGFR TKIs. Grade 3 treatment related rash was 33% and diarrhea was 23%. 94% of patients had drug interruptions with 6 patients (8%) permanently discontinuing due to adverse events.
In March 2021, we announced that the FDA granted fast track designation for poziotinib based on data from Cohort 2 of ZENITH20, which evaluated previously treated patients with NSCLC with HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations. On December 6, 2021, we announced the submission of our NDA seeking accelerated approval for poziotinib to the FDA for use in patients with previously treated locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations. The NDA submission was based on the positive results of Cohort 2 from the ZENITH20 clinical trial, which assessed the safety and efficacy of poziotinib in previously treated patients with NSCLC with HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations. On February 11, 2022, we announced that the NDA had been accepted and an action date of November 24, 2022 had been set.
In March 2022, we presented the results of Cohort 4 at the ESMO Targeted Anticancer Therapies (“TAT”) meeting. Cohort 4 of the ZENITH20 clinical trial enrolled a total of 70 patients, 48 of whom received an oral once daily dose of 16 mg of poziotinib and 22 of who received an oral twice daily dose of 8 mg of poziotinib. The intent-to-treat analysis demonstrated a confirmed ORR of 41% (95% CI of 30%-54%). Based on the pre-specified statistical hypothesis for the primary endpoint, the observed lower bound of 30% exceeded the pre-specified lower bound of 20%. The median duration of response was 5.7 months and median progression free survival was 5.6 months. The most common treatment related Grade ≥ 3 adverse events were rash (30%), stomatitis (19%), diarrhea (14%), and paronychia (7%). In addition, the incidence of Grade ≥ 3 pneumonitis was low at 3%. The safety profile was consistent with the TKI class. 
On September 22, 2022, we met with the FDA’s ODAC. On the question of whether the current benefits of poziotinib outweigh its risks for the treatment of patients with NSCLC with HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations, the ODAC voted 9 (no) – 4 (yes) that the current benefits of poziotinib did not outweigh its risks. On November 25, 2022, we announced that we had received a CRL from the FDA regarding our NDA for poziotinib. The CRL stated that the FDA determined that it could not approve the NDA in its present form and provided recommendations needed for resubmission, including generating additional data from a randomized controlled study prior to approval. We are continuing to evaluate those recommendations but we have de-prioritized further poziotinib development activities. 
Manufacturing
We currently do not have internal manufacturing capabilities. Our product is and our product candidates are manufactured by third parties that specialize in these services. We expect to continue to contract with third-parties for our manufacturing and packaging requirements, including API and finished-dosage products. We believe that our current agreements with these third-party manufacturers provide sufficient capacity to support our clinical requirements and the anticipated commercial demand for ROLVEDON. We attempt to prevent supply disruption through our executed supply agreements, appropriate forecasting, and maintaining base stock levels. 
Sales and Marketing Strategy
We presently market ROLVEDON through group purchasing organizations (“GPOs”), wholesalers, specialty distributors or directly to clinics and hospitals in the U.S. All of our revenue is derived from sales within the U.S. The primary decision makers for our products are oncologists, hematologists and account administrators. As of December 31, 2022, our U.S. sales force (sales management, sales representatives, and sales administrative support) numbered 39 employees.
Competition
The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly-evolving technology and intense competition, which we expect to persist. Many companies are engaged in research and development of compounds that are similar to ours – both commercialized and in development, which fosters continuous innovation. In the event that one or more of our competitor’s programs are successful, the market for our product and product candidates could be reduced or eliminated. Any product for which we obtain FDA approval must also compete for market acceptance and market share.
Our successful marketing of branded products, upon FDA approval, depends primarily on the ability to communicate the effectiveness, safety, and value of the products to healthcare professionals in private practice, group practices, hospitals, academic institutions, and managed care organizations. Competition for branded drugs is less driven by price and is more focused on innovation in treatment of disease, advanced drug delivery, and specific clinical benefits over competitive drug therapies. Unless our products are shown to be differentiated (e.g., have a better safety profile, efficacy, and/or cost-effectiveness) compared to other alternatives, they may not gain acceptance by medical professionals and may therefore never be commercially successful.
Companies that have products on the market or in research and development that target the same indications as our in-development products or new compounds sought include, among others: Amgen, Inc., Coherus BioSciences, Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Sandoz, Pfizer, AstraZeneca plc, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd, Rain Therapeutics Inc., Janssen Research & Development, Taiho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Cullinan Oncology, LLC, Daiichi-Sankyo Co., Ltd., Genentech, Inc., Gilead Sciences, Inc., Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., and Novartis International AG.
Each of the aforementioned companies may be more advanced in the development of competing product candidates. Many of these competitors are large and well-capitalized companies focusing on a wide range of cancer types and have substantially greater resources and expertise than we do. As a consequence, they are able to spend more on product development, marketing, sales and other product initiatives than we can. Some of our competitors have:
•significantly greater name recognition;
•broader or deeper relations with healthcare professionals, customers and third-party payors;
•more established distribution networks;
•greater experience in conducting research and development, manufacturing, clinical trials, marketing and obtaining regulatory clearance or approval for products; and
•greater financial and human resources for product development, sales and marketing and patent prosecution.
We believe that the current competitive landscape for each of our key commercialized and in-development products, is as follows:
(a)ROLVEDON is a novel long-acting G-CSF that employs a proprietary technology that is designed to prolong the duration of biologics, reducing the frequency of administration. There is currently one other novel long-acting G-CSF and five biosimilar G-CSFs marketed in the United States including, Neulasta® (pegfilgrastim), marketed by Amgen, Inc., UDENYCA™ (pegfilgrastim-cbqv), a biosimilar marketed by Coherus BioSciences, Fulphila® (pegfilgrastim-jmdb), a biosimilar marketed by Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Ziextenzo® (pegfilgrastim-bmez), a biosimilar marketed by Sandoz, NYVEPRIA™ (pegfilgrastim-apgf), a biosimilar 
marketed by Pfizer, Inc. and Stimufend® (pegfilgrastim-fpgk), a biosimilar marketed by Fresenius Kabi. One additional biosimilar G-CSF, Fylnetra® (pegfilgrastim-pbbk) manufactured by Amneal Pharmaceuticals has been approved but is not on the market as of today . In addition, there are several novel products in development that may compete with ROLVEDON if they are approved, including G1 Therapeutics’ trilaciclib, BeyondSpring’s plinabulin, and Evive Biotech’s benegrastim.
(b)Poziotinib is a novel investigational, oral, quinazoline-based pan-HER inhibitor that is designed to irreversibly block signaling through the EGFR family of tyrosine-kinase receptors, including human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER1/ErbB1/EGFR), HER2 (ErbB2), and HER4 (ErbB4), as well as HER receptor mutations. Poziotinib’s development program has been primarily focused on advanced NSCLC patients harboring exon 20 insertion mutations in HER2(ErbB2). At present there are no FDA approved therapies for metastatic NSCLC patients with HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations.
There are a number of other targeted therapies focused on these subtypes of NSCLC that are in early clinical investigation by our potential competitors, including: TAGRISSO (Osimertinib) - AstraZeneca, Tarlox (tarloxotinib) - Rain Therapeutics Inc., DS-8201a - Daiichi Sankyo, CLN081 - Taiho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., and Cullinan Oncology, LLC, and Pyrotinib - Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd.
New drug development is the process whereby product candidates are tested for the purpose of filing an NDA or a BLA in the U.S. (or similar filing in other countries). Obtaining marketing approval from the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside of the U.S. is an inherently uncertain, lengthy, and expensive process that requires several phases of clinical trials to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the appropriate regulatory authorities that the product is both safe and effective for its respective indications. Our development focus is primarily based on acquiring and developing late-stage development drug candidates as compared to new drug discovery, which is particularly uncertain and lengthy.
Our product and late-stage product candidate are summarized below:
ROLVEDON™ (eflapegrastim-xnst)
Poziotinib
An investigational orally administered, irreversible TKI for the treatment of solid tumors.
 Our research and development expenses for drug development are comprised of our personnel expenses, contracted services with third parties, license fees and milestone payments to third parties, clinical trial costs, laboratory supplies, drug products, and certain allocations of corporate costs. The below table summarizes our research and development expenses by project in 2022 and 2021:

 | Research and Development Expenses for the Year Ended December 31,(in thousands)

Patents and Proprietary Rights
Overview
We in-license from third parties certain patents and related intellectual property rights related to our proprietary product and product candidates. Under most of these license arrangements, we are generally responsible for all development, patent filing, prosecution, and maintenance costs, sales, marketing and liability insurance costs related to our product and product candidates.
In addition, these licenses and agreements may require us to make royalty and other payments and to reasonably utilize the underlying technology of applicable patents. If we fail to comply with these and other terms in these licenses and agreements, we could lose the underlying rights to one or more of our potential products, which would adversely affect our product development and harm our business. For more information regarding these arrangements see Note 8(b), “Financial Commitments & Contingencies and Key License Agreements,” to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
The protection, preservation, and infringement-free commercial utilization of these patents and related intellectual property rights are very important to the successful execution of our strategy. However, the issuance of a patent is neither conclusive as to its validity nor as to the enforceable scope of the claims of the patent. Accordingly, our patents and the patents we have licensed may not prevent other companies from developing similar or functionally equivalent products or from successfully challenging the validity of our patents. If our patent applications are not allowed or, even if allowed and issued as patents, if such patents or the patents we have in-licensed are circumvented or not upheld in a court of law or in administrative proceedings, including oppositions, re-examinations or inter parties review, our ability to competitively utilize our patented products and technologies may be significantly reduced. Also, such patents may or may not provide competitive advantages for their respective products or they may be challenged or circumvented by competitors, in which case our ability to commercially sell these products may be diminished.
From time-to-time, we may need to obtain licenses to patents and other proprietary rights held by third parties to develop, manufacture and market our products. If we are unable to timely obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, our ability to commercially exploit such products may be inhibited or prevented.
Patents and Licenses Summary
We believe that our patents and licenses are critical to operating our business, as summarized below.
ROLVEDON: Composition of matter patents covering ROLVEDON, both foreign and domestic, are due to expire in 2036. We also have a ROLVEDON formulation patent granted in the U.S., Europe, Japan and other countries. The formulation patent will not expire in the U.S. until 2031. Additionally, a patent term extension has been filed and pending regulatory approval. ROLVEDON is also covered by additional patents and pending applications claiming various aspects of the technology and formulation that do or would provide protection until 2039. 
Poziotinib: A composition of matter patent covering poziotinib is due to expire in 2028. Poziotinib is also covered by additional patents and patent applications covering its formulations and synthetic processes which will expire between 2032 and 2034. We have licensed patent applications covering the use of poziotinib that if granted, would expire in 2037.
Patent Protection and Value Maximization 
We are constantly evaluating our patent portfolio and are currently assessing and filing patent applications for our product and product candidates and considering new patent applications in order to maximize the life cycle of each of our assets.
While the U.S. and the European Union (EU) are currently the largest potential markets for most of our assets, we also have patents issued and patent applications pending outside of the U.S. and the EU. Limitations on patent protection in these countries, and the differences in what constitutes patentable subject matter in countries outside the U.S., may limit the protection we have on patents issued or licensed to us outside of the U.S. In addition, laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as would laws in the U.S.
To minimize our costs and expenses and to maintain effective protection, we usually focus our patent and licensing activities within the U.S., the EU, Canada, and Japan. In determining whether or not to seek a patent or to license any patent in a certain foreign country, we weigh the relevant costs and benefits, and consider, among other things, the market potential and profitability, the scope of patent protection afforded by the law of the jurisdiction and its enforceability, and the nature of terms with any potential licensees. Failure to obtain adequate patent protection for our proprietary drugs and technology would impair our ability to be commercially competitive in these markets.
In conducting our business, we rely upon trade secrets, know-how, and licensing arrangements. We use customary practices for the protection of our confidential and proprietary information such as confidentiality agreements and trade secret protection measures. It is possible that these agreements will be breached or will not be enforceable in every instance, and that we will not have adequate remedies for any such breach. It is also possible that our trade secrets or know-how will otherwise become known or independently developed by competitors. The protection of know-how is particularly important because it is often necessary or useful information that allows us to practice the claims in the patents related to our proprietary product and product candidates.
In addition to the specific intellectual property subjects discussed above, we have a trademark registration in the U.S. for Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc.®. We also have trademarks for the Spectrum Pharmaceuticals’ logos. Any other trademarks are the property of their respective owners.
Governmental Regulation
The development, production and marketing of our proprietary drug product candidates and biological products are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries. In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and related regulations and regulates biological products under the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) and related regulations. Drugs and biologics are also subject to other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries govern, among other things, the development, approval, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, promotion, advertising and import and export of drugs and biologics. Product development and approval within this regulatory framework, including for products already at a clinical stage of development, can take many years and require the expenditure of substantial resources, and to obtain FDA approval, a product must satisfy quality, safety, and efficacy requirements. In addition, each drug-manufacturing establishment must be registered with the FDA. Domestic manufacturing establishments must comply with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP), regulations and are subject to inspections by the FDA. To supply drug ingredients or products for use in the U.S., foreign manufacturing establishments must also comply with cGMP and are subject to inspections by the FDA or by other regulatory authorities in certain countries under reciprocal agreements with the FDA. Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of product candidates for a considerable period of time and impose substantial costs upon our activities. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process or after approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA sanctions include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval or suspension or revocation of a license, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, voluntary or mandatory product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. In addition, government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of product candidates for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures upon our activities.
General Information about the Drug Development and Approval Process and Post-Marketing Requirements
The U.S. system of new drug and biologics development and approval is a rigorous process. Only a small percentage of compounds that enter the pre-clinical testing stage are ever approved for commercialization. Our strategy focuses on in-licensing clinical stage product candidates that are already in or about to enter human clinical trials. A late-stage focus helps us to effectively manage the high cost of drug development by focusing on compounds that have already passed the many hurdles in the pre-clinical and early clinical process.
The process required by the FDA before drugs and biologics may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of nonclinical laboratory and animal tests according to good laboratory practices (GLP) and other applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals; 
•submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application (IND) which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
•approval of the protocol and related documentation by an independent institutional review board (IRB) or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as Good Clinical Practices (GCP) and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information;
•for a drug, submission of an NDA that includes substantive evidence of the product’s safety and efficacy and, for a biologic, submission to the FDA of a BLA for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, and potency;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities where the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate;
•potential FDA audit of certain nonclinical study sites and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of an NDA or BLA; 
•review of the product candidate by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate; and
•FDA review of the NDA or BLA and the approval or licensure thereof, which must occur before a drug or biologic, respectively, can be marketed or sold.
Pre-clinical Testing: Before testing any drug or biologic candidate in humans, laboratory and animal studies are conducted to assess the biological activity and safety of a drug or biologic candidate against the targeted disease. The conduct of the pre-clinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLP. Additional pre-clinical testing may be required or requested by a regulatory authority even after clinical trials have begun.
Investigational New Drug Application: After certain pre-clinical studies are completed, an IND application is submitted to the FDA to request the ability to begin human testing of the drug or biologic. As a part of its IND application, the trial sponsor must submit the results of the pre-clinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol. An IND becomes effective thirty days after the FDA receives the application (unless the FDA notifies the sponsor of a clinical hold), or upon prior notification by the FDA. If the FDA notifies the sponsor of a clinical hold, the sponsor of the IND application must resolve any outstanding concerns with the FDA before the clinical trial may begin. The FDA also may impose a clinical hold on ongoing clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If a clinical hold is imposed, a trial may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. A clinical hold may either be a full clinical hold or a partial clinical hold that would limit a trial, for example, to certain doses or for a certain length of time or to a certain number of subjects. Further, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that site. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of study subjects and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. 
Clinical Trials: Clinical trials involve the administration of a product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA and to the IRB. Information about certain clinical trials must be 
submitted with specific timeframes to clinical trial registries, such as clinicaltrials.gov. Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
•Phase 1 Clinical Trials: These trials typically involve small numbers of healthy volunteers or patients and usually define a drug candidate’s safety profile, including the safe dosage range and may also provide early evidence of effectiveness.
•Phase 2 Clinical Trials: These trials are conducted in a limited number of patients with the targeted disease to preliminarily assess the drug candidate’s effectiveness. These studies are designed primarily to determine the appropriate dose levels, dose schedules and route(s) of administration, as well as to determine if there are any side effects to expand the safety profile following Phase 1. These clinical trials, and Phase 3 trials discussed below, are designed to evaluate the product’s overall benefit-risk profile. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
•Phase 3 Clinical Trials: These trials usually involve a larger number of patients with the targeted disease to determine the product candidate’s efficacy and to observe and report any adverse reactions that may result from longer-term use on a large, more widespread, patient population. During Phase 3 clinical trials, typically the product is compared to either a placebo or a standard treatment for the target disease. Phase 3 trials often are designed to serve as the primary basis for developing physician labeling and for providing the substantial evidence of safety and effectiveness for an NDA or BLA. 
During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Within 15 calendar days, a sponsor must submit written IND safety report to the FDA and the study investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events; findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects; or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.
Regulatory authorities, a data safety monitoring board or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the participants are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients, and the trial may not recommence without the IRB’s authorization.
New Drug Application or Biologics License Application: To obtain approval to market a drug in the U.S., an NDA must be submitted to the FDA that provides data demonstrating the drug is safe and effective. Similarly, for a biological product in the U.S., a BLA must be submitted to the FDA that provides data establishing to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety, purity and potency of the product for the proposed indication. Both an NDA and BLA include all data available from pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, detailed information relating to the product’s manufacture and composition, and proposed labeling. Under PDUFA, each NDA and BLA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual prescription drug product program fee for drugs and biologics. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances.
Expedited Development and Review Programs: The FDA has established procedures for accelerating the development and approval of drugs for serious or life-threatening diseases for which the sponsor can demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. These programs include fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review, and accelerated approval. The FDA may grant “fast track” status to product candidates that are intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need for the condition. Fast track is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of such product candidates by providing, among other things, more frequent meetings with the FDA to discuss the product candidate’s development plan and rolling review, which allows submission of individually completed sections of an BLA or NDA for FDA review before the entire submission is completed. The sponsor of a product candidate may request the FDA to designate the product as a fast track product at any time during clinical development. Fast track status does not ensure that a product will be developed more quickly or receive FDA approval. In addition, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no 
longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process, or if the designated drug development program is no longer being pursued. 
A product candidate intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that it may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The benefits of breakthrough therapy designation include the same benefits as fast track designation, plus intensive guidance from the FDA to ensure an efficient drug development program.
The FDA may give a priority review designation to a product candidate if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or to provide a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. Priority review is intended to reduce the time it takes for the FDA to review an NDA or BLA, with the goal to take action on the application within six months from when the application is filed, compared to ten months for a standard review. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a biological product or drug designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review.
Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drugs or biologics studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a biological product or drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials with due diligence to confirm clinical benefit. Under the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022 (“FDORA”), the FDA is now permitted to require, as appropriate, that such confirmatory trials be underway prior to approval or within a specific time period after the date accelerated approval is granted. In addition, the FDA currently requires, unless otherwise informed by the agency, pre-approval of promotional materials for products being considered for accelerated approval. Under FDORA, the FDA has increased authority for expedited procedures to withdraw approval of a drug or indication approved under accelerated approval if, for example, the confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product.
Fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Moreover, even if a product candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product candidate no longer meets the conditions for designation or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
Pediatric Studies
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), as amended, an NDA or BLA or supplement must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug or biologic for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The intent of PREA is to compel sponsors whose products have pediatric applicability to study those products in pediatric populations. The FDCA requires manufacturers of drugs and biologics that include a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration to submit a pediatric study plan to the FDA as part of the IND application. The plan must be submitted not later than 60 days after the end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA; or if there is no such meeting, before the initiation of any Phase 3 trials or a combined Phase 2 and Phase 3 trial; or if no such trial will be conducted, no later than 210 days before submitting a marketing application or supplement. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Generally, PREA does not apply to any drug or biologic for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
NDA/BLA Approval: The FDA approves drugs and biologics, respectively, based on the data and information in the NDA or BLA application demonstrating the product is safe and effective for its proposed use(s) and that the product’s benefits outweigh its risks. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA or BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may refuse to file any NDA or BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the NDA or BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. After the NDA or BLA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the application to determine, among other things, whether the 
proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use(s) and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency, and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel products or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically comprised of clinicians and other experts, for evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and, if so, under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
After the FDA completes its initial review of an NDA or BLA, it will communicate to the sponsor that the product will either be approved, or it will issue a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”) to communicate that the application will not be approved in its current form. The CRL usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor (e.g., requiring labeling changes) or major (e.g., requiring additional clinical trials). The CRL also may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a CRL is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA or BLA to address all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application, or request a hearing.
One of the performance goals of the FDA under PDUFA is to review 90% of standard BLAs and NDAs in 10 months and 90% of priority BLAs and NDAs in six months after the 60-day filing date. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA or NDA applicant otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date. The FDA will also review the NDA or BLA applicant’s manufacturing process and controls to ensure they are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality, and purity. Finally, the FDA will review and approve the product’s proposed labeling. Even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be limited to specific disease states, patient populations and dosages, or the indications for use may otherwise be limited. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings, or precautions be included in the product labeling. 
Postmarketing studies: As a condition of approval, the FDA may require sponsors to conduct additional studies or clinical trials after approval has been granted. These postmarketing requirements (PMRs) may be required for a number of reasons including postmarketing studies or clinical trials to demonstrate clinical benefit for drugs approved under accelerated approval, or deferred pediatric studies, where studies are required under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA):
•The Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, or FDAAA, significantly added to the FDA’s authority to require post-approval studies. Under FDAAA, the FDA may require sponsors to conduct further clinical trials to assess a known serious risk, assess signals of serious risk, or identify an unexpected serious risk. If required to conduct a post-approval study, periodic status reports must be submitted to the FDA. Failure to conduct such post-approval studies in a timely manner may result in administrative action being taken by FDA, including civil fines.
In addition, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct Phase 4 studies to gain more information about the product, including to explore additional patient populations, compare the product to a competitor, or to further study the risks, benefits and optimal use of a product. 
Postmarketing Regulation
Following approval of a new drug or biological product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and record‑keeping activities, reporting of adverse experiences, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements. Prescription drug and biologic promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug or biologic, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials.
Adverse events that are reported after marketing approval can result in additional limitations being placed on a product’s use and, potentially, withdrawal of the product from the market. The FDA has authority to mandate labeling changes to products at any point in a product’s life cycle based on new safety information derived from clinical trials, post-approval studies, peer-reviewed medical literature, or post-market risk identification systems data. The FDAAA also gave the FDA authority to require the implementation of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), for a product when necessary to assure that the product’s benefits outweigh its risks. The FDA may require the submission of a REMS before a product is approved, or after approval based on “new safety information,” including new analysis of existing safety information. A REMS may include a medication guide, patient package insert, a plan for communication with healthcare providers, or other elements 
to assure safe use (ETASU) as the FDA deems are necessary to assure safe use of the product, which could include imposing certain restrictions on distribution or use of a product. A REMS must include a timetable for submission of assessments of the strategy at specified time intervals. Failure to comply with a REMS, including the submission of a required assessment, may result in substantial civil or criminal penalties.
Additionally, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) provides for an electronic system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs distributed in the U.S. The law’s requirements include the quarantine and prompt investigation of a suspect product to determine if it is illegitimate and notifying trading partners and the FDA of any illegitimate product. Drug manufacturers and other parties involved in the supply chain for prescription products must comply with product tracking and tracing requirements, including placing a unique product identifier on prescription drug packages.
FDA Enforcement
FDA regulations require that approved products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP regulations which require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation, and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs or biologics, and those supplying products, ingredients, and components of them, are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements and other regulatory requirements. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. The discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP regulations, could result in enforcement action.
The FDA strictly regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drugs and biological products. Drugs and biological products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA does not regulate behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments and physicians may legally prescribe available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those approved by the FDA. However, the FDA does restrict an applicant’s communications regarding off-label use of their products. A company that is found to have improperly marketed or promoted an off-label use may be subject to significant liability, including criminal and civil penalties under the FDCA and False Claims Act, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and mandatory compliance programs. 
Failure to comply with the FDA and other governmental regulations can result in fines, unanticipated compliance expenditures, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production and/or distribution, suspension of the FDA’s review of NDAs or BLAs, enforcement actions, injunctions and criminal prosecution. Under certain circumstances, the FDA also has the authority to revoke previously granted drug approvals. 
Under its Fraud, Untrue Statements of Material Facts, Bribery and Illegal Gratuities Policy, the FDA can significantly delay the approval of a marketing application, or seek to withdraw an approved application where it identifies fraud or discrepancies in regulatory submissions. Such actions by the FDA may significantly delay or suspend substantive scientific review of a pending application during validity assessment or remove approved products from the market until the assessment is complete and questions regarding reliability of the data are resolved. 
Healthcare Reform
The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Changes in government legislation or regulation and changes in private third-party payors’ policies toward reimbursement for our products, if successfully developed and approved, may reduce reimbursement of our products’ costs to physicians, pharmacies, patients, and distributors. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, payment of rebates, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit our net revenue and results for products, if any, we commercialize in the future.
The pricing and reimbursement environment for our products may change in the future and become more challenging due to state and federal healthcare reform measures. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, or ARRA, for example, allocated new federal funding to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same condition. The plan for the research was published in 2012 by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures are 
made to Congress. Although ARRA does not mandate the use of the results of comparative effectiveness studies for reimbursement purposes, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of any products for which we receive marketing approval or on the reimbursement policies of public and private payors. It is possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s product could adversely affect the sales of any product for which we receive marketing approval. For example, if third-party payors find our products not to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (PPACA) is a sweeping measure intended to expand healthcare coverage within the U.S., primarily through the imposition of health insurance mandates on employers and individuals, the provision of subsidies to eligible individuals enrolled in plans offered on the health insurance exchanges, and the expansion of the Medicaid program. This law has substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and has significantly impacted the pharmaceutical industry. These changes have impacted previously existing government healthcare programs and have resulted in the development of new programs, including Medicare payment for performance initiatives and improvements to the Medicare physician quality reporting system and feedback program.
One of the goals of the PPACA was to expand coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. With regard to pharmaceutical products, among other things, the PPACA increased minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extended manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations. 
Some states have elected not to expand their Medicaid programs by raising the income limit to 133% of the federal poverty level, as is permitted under the PPACA. For each state that does not choose to expand its Medicaid program, there may be fewer insured patients overall, which could impact sales of our products that are approved and that we successfully commercialize, and our business and financial condition. Where Medicaid patients receive insurance coverage under any of the new options made available through the PPACA, the possibility exists that manufacturers may be required to pay Medicaid rebates on drugs used under these circumstances, a decision that could impact manufacturer revenues.
Certain provisions of the ACA have been subject to judicial challenges as well as efforts to modify them or to alter their interpretation or implementation. For example, Congress eliminated, starting January 1, 2019, the tax penalty for not complying with the PPACA’s individual mandate to carry health insurance. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, among other things, amended the Medicare statute to reduce the coverage gap in most Medicare drugs plans, commonly known as the “donut hole,” by raising the required manufacturer point-of-sale discount from 50% to 70% off the negotiated price effective as of January 1, 2019. Provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) will serve to eliminate this coverage gap by reducing Medicare beneficiaries’ out-of-pocket maximum from $7,050 to $2,000, starting January 1, 2025. Additional legislative changes, regulatory changes, and judicial challenges related to the PPACA remain possible, but the nature and extent of such potential changes or challenges are uncertain at this time. It is unclear how the PPACA and its implementation, as well as efforts to modify or invalidate the PPACA, or portions thereof, or its implementation, will affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. It is possible that the PPACA, in its current form or as it may be amended in the future, and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to maintain or increase sales of our product or product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval or to successfully commercialize our product and product candidates.
Other legislative changes relating to reimbursement have been adopted in the U.S. since the ACA was enacted. For example, on August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 and subsequent legislation, among other things, resulted in aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of, on average, 2% per fiscal year through 2031 (with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through June 30, 2022, due to the COVID-19 pandemic). As long as these cuts remain in effect, they could adversely impact payment for any products we may commercialize in the future. We expect that additional federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, and in turn could significantly reduce the projected value of certain development projects and reduce our profitability.
Additional legislative changes, regulatory changes, or guidance could be adopted, which may impact the marketing approvals and reimbursement for our product candidates. For example, there has been increasing legislative, regulatory, and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to drug pricing practices. There have been several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, evaluate the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient assistance and support programs, potentially permit government negotiation of Medicare pricing with manufacturers relative to certain international prices paid, and reform government healthcare program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. If healthcare policies 
or reforms intended to curb healthcare costs are adopted or if we experience negative publicity with respect to pricing of our products or the pricing of pharmaceutical drugs generally, the prices that we charge for any approved products may be limited, our commercial opportunity may be limited and/or our revenues from sales of our products may be negatively impacted.
The IRA includes several provisions that may impact our business to varying degrees, including imposing a new manufacturer financial liability on certain drugs and biologics dispensed Medicare Part D, starting in 2025. The IRA also allows the U.S. government to negotiate Medicare Part B and Part D price caps for certain high-cost drugs and biologics without generic or biosimilar competition, with the first set of drugs being selected for negotiation in 2023. The IRA also requires manufacturers to pay rebates to Medicare for certain drug prices that increase faster than inflation under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D.
It is possible that the PPACA, as currently enacted or may be amended in the future, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, more rigorous coverage criteria and new payment methodologies and in additional downward pressure on coverage and payment and the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our products. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted in the United States or outside of the United States, or whether regulatory changes, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our product candidates, if any, may be.
Foreign Regulation
Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country/region to country/region, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement also may vary, sometimes significantly, from country/region to country/region.
Under the EU regulatory systems, we may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized procedure or decentralized procedure or the mutual recognition procedure. The centralized procedure is mandatory for medicines produced by a biotechnological process. The procedure is also mandatory for new active substances which are indicated for treatment of several diseases or conditions, including cancer and orphan conditions. Companies may apply for centralized assessment if the product contains a new active substance or the product constitutes significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or the granting of authorization under the centralized procedure is in the interests of the EU patients. A centralized marketing authorization is valid in all EU member states. This marketing authorization is issued in the form of a European Commission decision which is legally binding in its entirety to which it is addressed.
Directive 2004/27/EC introduced two parallel procedures to the centralized procedure to allow a product to be progressively authorized in each of the member states of the EU. They are the decentralized procedure and the mutual recognition procedure. The mutual recognition procedure applies where the product has already been authorized in a member state of the EU that will act as reference member state. The national marketing authorization granted by the reference member state forms the basis for mutual recognition in the member states chosen by the applicant. In the decentralized procedure, the product in question is not authorized in any one the EU member states. In such a situation, the applicant company will request a member state to act as the reference member state to lead the scientific assessment for the benefit/risk balance for agreement by the concerned member states. In both cases, the concerned member states have up to 90 days to accept or raise reasoned objections to the assessment made by the reference member state.
In addition, pricing and reimbursement is subject to negotiation and regulation in most countries outside the U.S. Increasingly, adoption of a new product for use in national health services is subject to health technology assessment under the national rules and regulations to establish the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a new treatment. In some countries, in order to contain health care expenditures, reference price is introduced in order for the national healthcare providers to achieve a price comparable to the reference price in the same therapeutic category. We may therefore face the risk that the resulting prices would be insufficient to generate an acceptable return to us.
Third Party Reimbursement and Pricing Controls
All sales in the U.S. of ROLVEDON and any future commercialized products depend in part upon the availability of reimbursement from third-party payers. Third-party payers include government health programs, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. ROLVEDON is reimbursed or purchased under several government programs, including Medicaid, Medicare Parts B and D, the 340B/Public Health Service program, and the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
Significant uncertainties exist as to the coverage and reimbursement status of our current products as well as any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the U.S., sales of ROLVEDON, as well as any products for which we may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers. Third-party payers include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. No uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. The process for determining whether a payer will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payer will pay for the drug product. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Moreover, a payer’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for our current products and any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of any products, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. Our current product and product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. If third-party payers do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit.
The U.S. government and state legislatures have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, limitations on coverage, increased rebates, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, the PPACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal healthcare programs. These and any additional healthcare reform measures could further constrain our business or limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in additional pricing pressures. Adoption of government controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals.
The marketability of our current products and any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payers fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, the emphasis on cost containment measures in the U.S. has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Government Price Reporting
Manufacturers participate in, and have certain price reporting obligations under, the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, state Medicaid supplemental rebate program(s), and other governmental pricing programs. Starting January 1, 2022, manufacturers are required to report the average sales price for certain drugs under the Medicare program regardless of whether the manufacturer participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. Previously, this reporting obligation extended only to manufacturers participating in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. Under this Program, manufacturers are required to pay a rebate to each state Medicaid program for covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program as a condition of having federal funds being made available for their drugs under Medicaid and Part B of the Medicare program.
Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that is administered by the states for low-income and disabled beneficiaries. Medicaid rebates are based on pricing data reported by manufacturers on a monthly and quarterly basis to the CMS, the federal agency that administers the Medicaid and Medicare programs. These data include the average manufacturer price and, in the case of innovator products, the best price for each drug, which, in general, represents the lowest price available from the manufacturer to any entity in the U.S. in any pricing structure, calculated to include all sales and associated rebates, discounts, and other price concessions. The amount of the rebate is adjusted upward if the average manufacturer price increases more than inflation (measured by reference to the Consumer Price Index - Urban). Currently, the rebate is capped at 100 percent of the average manufacturer price, but, effective January 1, 2024, this cap on the rebate will be removed, and our rebate liability could increase accordingly.
If a manufacturer becomes aware that its reporting for a prior quarter was incorrect, or has changed as a result of recalculating the pricing data, the manufacturer is obligated to resubmit the corrected data for up to three years after those data originally were due, which revisions could affect rebate liability for prior quarters. The PPACA made significant changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, and CMS issued a final regulation in 2016 to implement the changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program under the PPACA. On December 21, 2020, CMS issued a final rule that modified Medicaid Drug Rebate Program regulations to permit reporting multiple best price figures with regard to value‑based purchasing arrangements (beginning in 2022); provided definitions for “line extension,” “new formulation,” and related terms with the practical effect of expanding the scope of drugs considered to be line extensions (beginning in 2022); and revised best price and average manufacturer price exclusions of manufacturer-sponsored patient benefit programs, particularly regarding potential inapplicability of such exclusions in the context of pharmacy benefit manager “accumulator” programs (beginning in 2023).
Medicare is a federal program that is administered by the federal government that covers individuals age 65 and over or that are disabled as well as those with certain health conditions. Medicare Part B generally covers drugs that must be administered by physicians or other health care practitioners, among others. Medicare Part B generally pays for such drugs under a payment methodology based on the average sales price of the drugs. Manufacturers are required to report average sales price information to CMS on a quarterly basis. The manufacturer-submitted information is used by CMS to calculate Medicare payment rates. Congress could enact additional changes that affect our overall rebate liability and the information manufacturers report to the government as part of price reporting calculations. For example, the IRA, passed and signed into law in 2022, mandates that drug and biologics manufacturers pay rebates under the Medicare Part B and Part D programs to the extent that drug prices rise faster than the rate of inflation, as measured against a statutory benchmark period.
Civil monetary penalties can be applied if a manufacturer is (1) found to have knowingly submitted any false pricing or other information to the government, (2) found to have made a misrepresentation in the reporting of our average sales price, or (3) fails to submit the required data on a timely basis. Such conduct also could be grounds for CMS to terminate a Medicaid Drug Rebate Program agreement, in which case federal payments may not be available under Medicaid or Medicare Part B for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs.
Federal law requires that any company that participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program also participate in the Public Health Service’s 340B drug pricing program (the “340B program”) in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B program, which is administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration, or HRSA, requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily defined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs. Covered entities include hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of financially needy patients, community health clinics, and other entities that receive certain types of grants under the Public Health Service Act. The ACA expanded the list of covered entities to include certain free-standing cancer hospitals, critical access hospitals, rural referral centers, and sole community hospitals, but exempts “orphan drugs” from the ceiling price requirements for these covered entities. The 340B ceiling price is calculated using a statutory formula, which is based on the average manufacturer price and Medicaid rebate amount for the covered outpatient drug as calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. In general, products subject to Medicaid price reporting and rebate liability are also subject to the 340B ceiling price calculation and discount requirement. 
In 2019, HRSA issued a final regulation regarding the calculation of the 340B ceiling price and the imposition of civil monetary penalties on manufacturers that knowingly and intentionally overcharge covered entities. It is currently unclear how HRSA will apply its enforcement authority under this regulation. Any charge by HRSA that a manufacturer has violated the requirements of the regulation could result in civil monetary penalties. Moreover, under a final regulation, effective January 2021, HRSA established an administrative dispute resolution (“ADR”) process for claims by covered entities that a manufacturer has engaged in overcharging, and by manufacturers that a covered entity violated the prohibitions against diversion or duplicate discounts. Such claims are to be resolved through an ADR panel of government officials rendering a decision that can be appealed to a federal court. An ADR proceeding could subject a manufacturer to onerous procedural requirements and could result in additional liability. HRSA also implemented a price reporting system under which 
manufacturers are required to report 340B ceiling prices on a quarterly basis to HRSA, which then publishes those prices to 340B covered entities. In addition, legislation could be passed, that would further expand the 340B program to additional covered entities, or participating manufacturers could be required to agree to provide 340B discounted pricing on drugs used in an inpatient setting. 
In order to be eligible to have their products paid for with federal funds under the Medicaid and Medicare Part B program s and purchased by certain federal agencies (VA, Department of Defense (DoD), Coast Guard, and Public Health Service (PHS)) and grantees, manufacturers must participate in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) pricing program. Prices for innovator drugs purchased by the VA, DoD, Coast Guard, and PHS are subject to a cap (known as the “Federal Ceiling Price”) equal to 76% of the annual non-federal average manufacturer price (non-FAMP) minus, if applicable, an additional discount. The additional discount applies if non-FAMP increases more than inflation (measured by reference to the Consumer Price Index – Urban (CPIU)). In addition, in the second and subsequent year, the price also is capped at prior year FSS contract plus CPIU. Manufacturers must also participate in the Tricare Retail Pharmacy Program, under which they pay quarterly rebates to DoD for prescriptions of innovator drugs dispensed to Tricare beneficiaries through Tricare Retail network pharmacies. The governing statute provides for civil monetary penalties for failure to provide information timely or for knowing submission of false information to the government.
Medicare Part D generally provides coverage to enrolled Medicare patients for self-administered drugs (i.e., drugs that are not administered by a physician). Medicare Part D is administered by private prescription drug plans approved by the U.S. government and, subject to detailed program rules and government oversight, each drug plan establishes its own Medicare Part D formulary for prescription drug coverage and pricing, which the drug plan may modify from time to time. The prescription drug plans negotiate pricing with manufacturers and pharmacies, and may condition formulary placement on the availability of manufacturer rebates. In addition, manufacturers are required to provide to CMS a 70% discount on brand name prescription drugs utilized by Medicare Part D beneficiaries when those beneficiaries are in the coverage gap phase of the Part D benefit design. In addition to reducing Medicare Part D beneficiaries’ out-of-pocket annual maximum from $7,050 to $2,000, starting in 2025, the IRA (passed in 2022) will allow require manufacturers to offer a 10% or 20% discount on many brand-name drugs and biologics to Medicare Part D beneficiaries, depending on whether they have met their out-of-pocket maximum. Civil monetary penalties can be applied if a manufacturer fails to provide these discounts. Congress also enacted in the IRA a Medicare Part D inflation rebate, under which manufacturers would owe additional rebates if the average manufacturer price of a drug were to increase faster than the pace of inflation.
The IRA also included provisions that would subject certain high-spend single-source drugs and biologics (i.e. without generic or biosimilar competition) to a price negotiation process under Part B and Part D. There are some exceptions for orphan drugs, low Medicare spend drugs, and plasma-derived products. Single-source biologics without biosimilar competition could be selected for participation in the drug price negotiation program at the earliest 11 years after approval. It is unknown what effect the drug price negotiation provisions or inflation rebate provisions of the IRA could have on our products. We further expect continued scrutiny on government price reporting from Congress, agencies, and other bodies. Group health plans, health insurance issuers, health maintenance organizations, other healthcare payors, and pharmacy benefit managers in the United States are adopting more aggressive utilization management techniques and are increasingly requiring significant discounts and rebates from manufacturers as a condition to including products on formulary with favorable coverage and cost-sharing. These payors may not cover or adequately reimburse for use of our products or may do so at levels that disadvantage them relative to competitive products. 
Outside the United States, within the EU, our products are paid for by a variety of payors, with governments being the primary source of payment. Government health authorities in the EU determine or influence reimbursement of products, and set prices or otherwise regulate pricing. Negotiating prices with governmental authorities can delay commercialization of our products. Governments may use a variety of cost-containment measures to control the cost of products, including price cuts, mandatory rebates, value-based pricing, and reference pricing (i.e., referencing prices in other countries or prices of competitive products and using those reference prices to set a price). Budgetary pressures in many EU countries are continuing to cause governments to consider or implement various cost-containment measures, such as price freezes, increased price cuts and rebates, and expanded generic substitution and patient cost-sharing. Recently, several states also have enacted or are considering legislation intended to make drug prices more transparent and deter significant price increases that impose reporting requirements on biopharmaceutical companies. These laws may affect our future sales, marketing, and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens. Such laws also typically impose significant civil monetary penalties for each instance of reporting noncompliance that can quickly aggregate into the millions of dollars.
Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws
We are also subject to numerous fraud and abuse laws and regulations globally. In the U.S., there are a variety of federal and state laws restricting certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Our sales, marketing, patient support and medical activities may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. The U.S. federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving anything of value to induce (or in return for) the referral of business, including the purchase, recommendation or prescription of a particular drug reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. The statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical companies on one hand and patients, prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common manufacturer business arrangements and activities from prosecution and administrative sanction, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and are subject to regulatory revision or changes in interpretation by the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, and the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or OIG. Recent regulations that eliminate the discount safe harbor protection for manufacturer rebates paid directly, or indirectly through a pharmacy benefit manager (“PBM”) to Medicare Part D or Medicare Advantage plans, have been delayed by the IRA until January 1, 2032. Practices or arrangements that involve remuneration may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may be established without providing specific intent to violate the statute, and may be punishable by civil, criminal, and administrative fines and penalties, damages, imprisonment, and/or exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.
The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of federal funds, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid, or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. A claim resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim. The False Claims Act also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of themselves and the federal government alleging violations of the statute and to share in any monetary recovery. Violations of the False Claims Act may result in significant financial penalties (including mandatory penalties on a per claim or statement basis), treble damages and exclusion from participation in federal health care programs. 
Pharmaceutical companies are subject to other federal false claim and statements laws, some of which extend to non-government health benefit programs. For example, the healthcare fraud provisions under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its implementing regulations, or HIPAA, impose criminal liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private third party payors, or falsifying or covering up a material fact or making any materially false or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services. Violations of HIPAA fraud provisions may result in criminal, civil and administrative penalties, fines and damages, including exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.
The majority of states have adopted analogous laws and regulations, including state anti-kickback and false claims laws, that may apply to our business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including private insurers. Other states have adopted laws that, among other things, require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources, and state laws and regulations that require drug manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information, which requires tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities. In addition, some states have laws requiring pharmaceutical sales representatives to be registered or licensed, and still others impose limits on co-pay assistance that pharmaceutical companies can offer to patients. 
The Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to track and disclose to the federal government certain payments and transfers of value provided to U.S.-licensed physicians, certain non-physician licensed healthcare practitioners, and teaching hospitals as well as ownership interests held by physicians and their families, and reporting to the federal government and public disclosure by the federal government of this data.
