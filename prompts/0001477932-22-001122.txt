ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Background
 
Kingfish Holding Corporation (“us,” “our,” “we,” the “Company,” or “Kingfish”) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on April 11, 2006 as Offline Consulting Inc. We became Kesselring Holding Corporation (“Kesselring Holding”) on June 8, 2007, and on November 25, 2014 we changed our name to Kingfish Holding Corporation. The principal executive offices of the Company are located at 2641 49th Street, Sarasota, Florida 34234, and our telephone number is (941) 870-2986.
 
On May 18, 2007, we entered into a reverse merger transaction pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement whereby we acquired Kesselring Corporation, a Florida corporation that was engaged in the business of homebuilding and restoration operations in central Florida and in the manufacture of building products from operations located in the State of Washington. Following the completion of the reverse merger transaction, the Company formed a wholly-owned subsidiary named Kesselring Holding Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and engaged in a merger transaction with this subsidiary, pursuant to which the Company was the surviving entity, to effect a name change of the Company from “Offline Consulting, Inc.” to “Kesselring Holding Corporation.” A Certificate of Ownership was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, effective as of June 8, 2007.
 
During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010, the Company defaulted on its loan agreements with AMI Holdings, Inc., a corporation controlled by James K. Toomey, a shareholder, officer and director of the Company (“Mr. Toomey”), and certain of his relatives (“AMI”), and on May 24, 2010, AMI foreclosed on and took possession of all of the Company’s then-existing operating entities. In addition, in order settle an indebtedness with Gary E. King, a former officer and director of the Company, and with Kenneth Craig, the Company’s then-President, on May 24, 2010, the Company sold its remaining assets to an entity affiliated with Mr. King. Following the foreclosure and this sale of assets, the Company no longer held any operating entities and was not engaged in any business operations.
 
On September 16, 2011, the Company, having only 69 holders of record and no significant assets, filed a Form 15 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) to terminate the registration of its common shares under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) and to suspend its reporting obligations under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act. 
 
In 2014, our remaining management concluded that it might be feasible to acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation and, as a result, our management began to explore potential opportunities to acquire other assets or business operations in an effort to maximize shareholder value. Accordingly, the Company took the steps necessary to reactivate its reporting obligations which had been suspended since 2011 under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act (“Reactivation Actions”). The Company completed its Reactivation Actions and commenced its reactivated reporting obligations on December 17, 2014.
 
The Company was unsuccessful in its endeavor to identify and engage in a business combination with a potential target company or business following its Reactivation Actions and, as of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, the Company had expended substantially all of its available cash and was unable to secure any additional funds to finance its operations. As a result, the Company was unable to prepare and timely file its periodic reports under the Exchange Act, commencing with its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 and, other than maintaining its corporate status, was dormant from such date through May 2020. 
 
In May 2020, the Company determined that the business environment had sufficiently changed so that identifying a target and completing a business combination may be more likely than was previously the case. As part of this strategy, the Company determined to attempt to seek the financing necessary to prepare and file all of its delinquent periodic reports on Form 10-K under the Exchange Act and to again aggressively pursue an acquisition target. 
 
In order for the Company to finance the preparation and filing of such delinquent periodic report with the Commission, Mr. Toomey, a principal shareholder, director and secretary of the Company, has loaned the Company approximately $130,000 during the fiscal year ended 2020 and the first quarter of the 2021 fiscal year (“Toomey Loans”). See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “—Subsequent Developments” for a description of the Toomey Loans.

Business Operations 
 
As a result of our very limited cash resources, we were unable to prepare and timely file our periodic reports under the Exchange Act, commencing with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 and, other than maintaining our corporate status, we were dormant during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017. 
 
Although our business strategy was to seek suitable private company candidates for a business combination with us, we were unable to pursue this strategy during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 and, unless additional funds are obtained, we will not be able to pursue that strategy. Furthermore, unless and until we can obtain such additional financing, our operations will continue to be dormant and our ability to continue as a going concern is doubtful. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any additional financing in the future, and if we are unable to receive sufficient additional financing to finance our operations upon acceptable terms.
 
The Company currently is considered to be a “blank check” company. The rules and regulations of the Commission defines blank check companies as “any development stage company that is issuing a penny stock, within the meaning of Section 3(a)(51) of the Exchange Act and that has no specific business plan or purpose, or has indicated that its business plan is to merge with an unidentified company or companies.” Pursuant to Rule 12b-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act, the Company also qualifies as a “shell company,” because it has no or nominal assets (other than cash) and no or nominal operations. Many states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of “blank check” companies in their respective jurisdictions. Management does not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in our securities, either debt or equity, until we have successfully concluded a business combination transaction. 
 
Employees 
 
We presently have no employees apart from our management. Our officers and directors are engaged in outside business activities and are employed on a full-time basis by certain unaffiliated companies. We expect no significant changes in the number of our employees.
Recent Activities 
 
As of the date of filing of this Form 10-K, the Company has entered into preliminary discussions regarding a potential business combination and equity financing transaction with Renovo Resource Solutions, Inc. (“Renovo”), a Florida corporation located in Manatee County, Florida, and 6, LLC, a Florida limited liability real estate holding company controlled by Renovo which owns the land on which Renovo conducts its business (Renovo and 6 LLC, collectively the “Renovo Group”). Renovo is engaged in an environmentally friendly scrap yard operation. Renovo’s operation are located on a site specifically engineered for its business and includes a new constructed facility for its operations. Renovo is a privately held company in which Mr. Toomey and his family have a one-third ownership interest. The Company has only commenced preliminary discussions with the Renovo Group and has not entered into a letter of intent or other undertaking with Renovo. It is anticipated that when the Company is analyzing the available alternatives, it will consider and evaluate, among other things, a potential business combination with Renovo in combination with a simultaneous equity financing transaction. 
 
The Renovo Group has incurred indebtedness of approximately $6.1 million in connection with its business operations and land holdings, consisting primarily of the construction costs incurred in connection with its newly constructed facilities. In order for a business combination with the Renovo Group to be feasible, the Company and Renovo would need to simultaneously raise approximately $12,500,000 in equity financing (“Equity Financing”) at the time of any such potential business combination in order (a) to repay the Company’s outstanding indebtedness owed to Mr. Toomey, (b) to pay the costs associated with any business combination transaction and Equity Financing, and (c) for the Renovo Group to repay its outstanding debt obligations, to pay its operating expenses until such expenses can be paid from operating income, to finance the completion of the permitting and improvements needed on its operational site, and to permit it to take advantage of operational opportunities in its local community. Accordingly, if the Company were to pursue a business combination with the Renovo Group under such circumstances, it would likely require as a condition to any such business combination that the necessary Equity Financing be firmly committed and made available at the time of the consummation of such business combination. In the event that the Renovo Group is unable to commit to timely raising such Equity Financing, the Company would have no interest in pursuing a business combination transaction with the Renovo Group. Although we have commenced negotiations with the Renovo Group, we have not entered into a letter of intent or other undertaking with the Renovo Group for a business combination and no source of Equity Financing has been secured or is in the process of negotiations at this time. In view of the number of significant uncertainties surrounding a possible transaction, there is no assurance that the Company and the Renovo Group will reach any agreement with respect to a business combination and, if so, that they will be able to secure the Equity Financing necessary to consummation of such a transaction.
