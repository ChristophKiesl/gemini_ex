ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General Overview
 
Sparta Commercial Services, Inc. (“Sparta,” “we,” “us,” or the “Company”) is a Nevada corporation serving four markets. Sparta is a technology company that develops, markets and manages business websites and mobile applications (mobile apps) for smartphones and tablets. The Company also owns and manages websites which sell on-demand motorcycle, recreational vehicle, automobiles, and truck title history reports for consumers, retail dealers, auction houses, insurance companies and banks/finance companies. Since 2007, Sparta has provided and administered leasing programs nationwide for local and/or state agencies seeking to finance essential municipal vehicles and equipment. Lastly the Company also introduced a new business line in the rapidly expanding Hemp-CBD (cannabidiol) market.
 
In 2016, the Company changed the name of its majority-owned subsidiary Specialty Reports, Inc., to iMobile Solutions, Inc. The new name reflects the Company’s strategic evolution and focus on the growing mobile application market domestically.
 
Sparta’s mobile application (mobile app) offerings have broadened our base beyond our original base of vehicle dealers to include a wide range of businesses including, but not limited to, agriculture dealerships, racetracks, private clubs, country clubs, restaurants and grocery stores. We also offer a private label version of our mobile app framework to enable other businesses to offer custom apps to their customers.
 
The Company also designs, launches, maintains, and hosts websites for businesses. We provide specific, tailored action plans for our clients’ websites that include services such as eCommerce, CRM (Customer Relationship Management) development and integration, ordering system creation and integration, SEO (search engine optimization), social media marketing, and online reviews to improve their presence online. In addition, we offer text messaging services which are vital for businesses’ marketing, retention and loyalty strategies. Our text messaging platform allows our clients to easily manage, schedule, and analyze text message performance.
 
The Company’s vehicle history reports include Cyclechex (Motorcycle History Reports at www.cyclechex.com); RVchecks (Recreational Vehicle History Reports at www.rvchecks.com); CarVINreport (Automobile Reports at www.carvinreport.com) and Truckchex (Heavy Duty Truck History Reports at www.truckchex.com). Our Vehicle History Reports are designed for consumers, retail dealers, auction houses, insurance companies and banks/finance companies.
 
Sparta also administers a Municipal Leasing Program for local and/or state agencies throughout the country who are seeking a better and more economical way to finance their essential equipment needs, including police motorcycles, cruisers, buses, fire trucks, and EMS equipment. We are continuing to expand our roster of equipment manufacturers and the types of equipment we lease.
 
New World Health Brands, Inc. (NWHB) was formed in April 2019 as a subsidiary and new business line of Sparta Commercial Services, Inc. While anticipating, and with the passing of the 2018 Farm Bill, which resulted in the removal of hemp (CBD) from Schedule 1 of the Controlled Substances Act, Sparta’s management recognized a potential business opportunity in the rapidly expanding Hemp-CBD (Cannabinol) market in the United States. During 2019-2020, management sourced, developed and tested 5 CBD product categories totaling 31 products, procured product packaging and labeling, implemented fulfillment, and launched an on-line B2C website, www.newworldhealthcbd.com.
 
We identify our ongoing information technology business in two reporting groups: mobile apps/websites and vehicle history reports, both of which operate under our wholly owned subsidiary, iMobile Solutions, Inc. The latest product offering, via www.newworldhealthcbd.com, offering a full array of hemp-derived CBD products, is contained in our subsidiary, New World Health Brands, Inc.
 
MOBILE APPS
 
Sparta creates mobile applications (mobile apps) for small and medium-size businesses under the tradename iMobileApp. iMobileApp employs a subscription business model and is positioned as a fast and affordable way for businesses to develop and launch a mobile app. The iMobileApp platform allows businesses to have a high-quality, fully functioning custom mobile app often at a lower cost than traditional marketing efforts, and typically at a significantly lower cost than a commercial quality website.

The Company has developed and managed mobile apps since 2011, creating hundreds of mobile apps for a wide variety of businesses for customers in 49 states and Canada. Today, iMobileApp is the largest provider of mobile app technology to the Harley-Davidson dealership network in the United States.
 
Mobile apps are one of the most important digital tools that a consumer-facing business can employ. Smartphones and tablets are now the leading devices for accessing the internet, and it is estimated that upwards of 80% of mobile use time is dedicated to utilizing mobile apps. As consumers become more mobile, businesses are increasingly seeing the need to as well. Currently, the mobile app development industry serving small to medium-sized businesses is fragmented, and the Company believes that iMobileApp can become a brand leader in this category.
 
An iMobileApp provides consumers easy access to a business website simply by touching the Company’s application icon. There is no need to search for or type in a web address. iMobileApp has dozens of basic and advanced functions, including providing businesses the ability to send a segmented promotional message that appears on the consumer’s mobile device front page, rather than in an email or text message. “Geo-fencing” is a feature that allows businesses to message customers who are in the vicinity of their store or event, or even when visiting a competitor.
 
The iMobileApp pricing model includes a modest up-front development fee, and an auto-renewing monthly subscription. Once a business launches an iMobileApp, the Company provides them with marketing tools to assist their customers in downloading the mobile app from the Apple and Android app stores. The Company offers two levels of on-going maintenance and support. The basic subscription provides training, technical support and software updates. The premium-priced program adds a fully managed feature, allowing businesses to contact iMobileApp Customer Service who will initiate campaigns, promotional messaging, and other iMobileApp features on behalf of the client.
 
A partial listing of iMobileApp features includes:
 
Mobile Client Framework (“MCF”) - Our mobile framework software allows us to provide customized apps that can be installed on the individual mobile devices and deployed through the Apple and Android app stores.
 
Content Management System (CMS) -iMobileApp customers can use our web-based content management system to upload images to their mobile app, change text content, change colors, organize the order of tabs, and publish updates to the app.
 
Customized Registration System - iMobileApp customers can elect to present their users with a registration screen on startup that collects information such as first name, last name, email address and telephone number in order to track marketing information and push individual notification messages for future functionality.
 
Push Notification System – A direct communication channel between businesses and their mobile app users. Allows brands to socialize directly with their very best customers, anytime, anywhere, to build a relationship at a one-to-one level.
 
Geo-Fencing Feature – Allows businesses to create an invisible “message fence” around a specific geographic area. When their app users are within the fenced area, the user receives a pre-programmed message on their device. This is especially useful when businesses have special promotions or events they would like to advertise to nearby users who are most likely to take advantage of them. Businesses can also “geo-fence” around a competitor, offering their users special promotions before they enter the competitor’s venue.
 
Inventory Display Manager – Business can manage, display and sell from their inventory on their mobile app. Inventory can be integrated through web link, hand-key, or inventory management data feed.
 
Event Manager – Business can manage and display upcoming events on their mobile app. Customers can view the event calendar, RSVP and Inventory can be integrated through web link, hand-key, or inventory management data feed.
 
Quick Dial Feature – Users tap the Quick Dial option to get a list of the business phone numbers on their mobile phones. The user selects the number to dial by putting their finger on the number. The business can add, remove, and edit phone numbers that appear in the Quick Dial screen from their CMS.
 
Multi-Location Management – Business can add and manage multiple locations on their app, each with distinct hours of operations, user database and notification segmentation. Businesses pay subscription fees for each location they wish to include in their app. Customers can use the client customization portal to add locations to their mobile app.

Marketing and Branding of iMobileApp
 
Marketing Materials - We provide customized marketing materials that app customers can download and display digitally or physically.
 
Embedded Product Developer and SRI Branding - The “about” screen of the application contains information useful to the support of the product. It also contains a powered-by-the-product-developer logo and text. iMS can choose to use a different logo, but the powered-by-the-product-developer text remains on the “about” screen.
 
App store and Google Android Distribution - All native applications are deployed through the product developer’s App store and Android Market Place online accounts.
 
Marketing information - If an app customer has enabled first-time user data collection then that information will be available to the app customer on their portal.
 
WEBSITES
 
The Company also designs, launches, maintains, and hosts websites for businesses. We provide specific, tailored action plans for our clients’ websites that include services such as eCommerce, CRM (Customer Relationship Management) development and integration, ordering system creation and integration, SEO (search engine optimization), social media marketing, and online reviews to improve their presence online.

Our text messaging platform allows our clients to easily manage, schedule, and analyze text message performance.
VEHICLE HISTORY REPORTS
 
The vehicle history report group is currently marketing through its websites: Cyclechex Motorcycle History Reports© (www.cyclechex.com), RVchex™ RV History Reports (www.rvchex.com), CarVinReport Car History Reports (www.carvinreports.com) and Truckchex Heavy Duty Truck History Reports (www.truckchex.com). These reports contain valuable information for consumers, dealers, insurers, auction houses, and lenders. The information includes a vehicle’s history, such as disclosed damage, salvaged or rebuilt title brands, the number of previous owners, the last recorded odometer reading, the manufacturer’s original equipment, and OEM recall data. We assemble the data for these reports from multiple sources, including, but not limited to, governmental agencies, in order to provide the most current information available for the benefit of all interested parties. We believe our products offer a compelling value because they are priced modestly and we provide a no-hassle, 90-day and 100% money-back guarantee. We are confident that our Specialty Reports provide buyers and sellers the peace of mind that comes from being able to make an informed decision.
 
In June 2010, iMobile Solutions, Inc. entered into an exclusive five-year agreement with a U.S. government authorized third-party distributor of on-line data from National Motor Vehicle Title System (NMVTIS) for NMVTIS data on motorcycles, scooters, ATVs and recreational vehicles. This agreement has been renewed on a year to year basis.
 
NMVTIS is an information system that federal law required the United States Department of Justice to establish and to provide an electronic means to verify vehicle title, brand, and theft data among motor vehicle administrators, law enforcement officials, prospective purchasers and insurance carriers. NMVTIS was initially authorized in the Anti-Car Theft Act of 1992 and reauthorized by the Anti-Car Theft Improvements Act of 1996. After passage of the 1996 reauthorization, responsibility was transferred from the U.S. Department of Transportation to the U.S. Department of Justice. The NMVTIS system is a Department of Justice program currently operated by the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA). The system also provides a means for states to share title information in order to prevent fraud and other crime.
 
NMVTIS was created to:
 

● | Prevent the introduction or reintroduction of stolen motor vehicles into interstate commerce 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Protect states, consumers (both individual and commercial), and other entities from fraud 
● | Reduce the use of stolen vehicles for illicit purposes including funding of criminal enterprises 
● | Provide consumer protection from unsafe vehicles 


5
-

 

NMVTIS information is supplied by state motor vehicle agency records and entire sectors (e.g., insurance, auto recyclers/junk/salvage, etc.) addressed by the Anti-Car Theft Act. As opposed to purchasing information from specific businesses or companies, entities are required to provide specific information to NMVTIS in a specific format. NMVTIS is intended to serve as a reliable source of title and brand history for automobiles, motorcycles and other vehicles. However, there are certain pieces of vehicle history data that NMVTIS’ database does not contain; for example, a vehicle’s repair history. Currently the data provided to NMVTIS by states is provided in a variety of time frames; while some report and update NVMTIS data in real-time (as title transactions occur) others send updates less frequently, such as once every 24 hours or within a period of days.
 
Vehicle History Reports benefit consumers:
 

● | Consumers can purchase reports directly from the Cyclechex, RVchex, Truckchex or CarVinReport website 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Consumers can purchase reports via an Affiliate website 

 
Vehicle History Reports benefit dealers:
 

● | Dealers can purchase a block of history reports from Cyclechex, RVchex, Truckchex or CarVinReport (with pricing incentives to purchase a larger quantity of reports) 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Reports facilitate acceptance of trade-in vehicles and add value to the purchase of any pre-owned motorcycle, RV, automobile, light truck or heavy-duty truck 
● | Dealers can provide reports to customers 

Vehicle History Reports Affiliate Program:
 

● | Dealers and other industry sources can incorporate the Cyclechex, RVchex, Truckchex or CarVinReport website linking their sales and marketing strategies 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Affiliates earn commission on Cyclechex, RVchex, Truckchex or CarVinReport history reports generated from their sites

NEW WORLD HEALTH BRANDS CBD
 
During 2019-2020, management sourced, developed and tested 5 CBD product categories totaling 31 products, procured product packaging, created clear-transparency labeling, implemented fulfillment and launched an on-line B2C website, www.newworldhealthcbd.com.
 
Sourcing CBD Products
 
All of our CBD products are sourced through third party suppliers in Arizona, Colorado, Wyoming, Oregon, Nevada and Washington State. NWHB carries single compound isolates, as well as products made from high quality, whole-plant, industrial hemp extracts, containing a full-spectrum of phytocannabinoids, including CBD, terpenes, flavonoids, and other minor, but valuable hemp compounds. Hemp extracts from Industrial Hemp are generally cannabis with less than 0.3% tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”). Cannabis, which contains THC, causes psychoactive effects when consumed. NWHB does not produce or sell any products derived from high-THC cannabis/marijuana plants.
 
NWHB manages risks that are associated with third-party suppliers and manufacturers by identifying and qualifying alternative providers. NWHB regularly assess its supply chain for any threats to business continuity. None of the third party suppliers are considered to be material to the business on a standalone basis and if any given supplier is lost in a specific region, NWHB believes they could be replaced without material disruption as it could contract with multiple alternative suppliers and manufacturers.
 
All of our product providers are licensed by their respective departments of Agriculture and represent that they are compliant with applicable state laws relating to their products. Our products come from domestic seed, have clean label transparency and are third party tested for CBD potency, heavy metals, pesticides, microbials, and more, by ISO/IEC 17025 accredited labs.
 
CBD Product Categories
 
Our product line consists of only industrial hemp-based CBD containing zero or less than 0.03% THC. We do not manufacture or market edibles. We do not manufacture or market CBD vapes. Our present product base consists of products in 5 categories: tinctures, capsules & tablets, topicals, Zero THC and tinctures for pets. The per serving dosage of CBD products ranges from 3.3mg to 50mg, depending on the dose. Our product line includes: tinctures of various sizes and flavors: capsules of differing potency and quantity; tablets of differing potency and quantity; salve of differing potency and quantity; creams and lotions of differing potency and quantity; and pet tinctures.
Strategic Advantage
 
NWHB benefits from the parent Company’s vertical integration of supply and service chains providing support of its on demand web/mobile application development/maintenance, accounting, corporate governance, and real time customer support across the NWHB product line. This relationship results in significant time and cost efficiencies and fosters a mutually beneficial parent/subsidiary relationship.
 
As the NWHB subsidiary grows, the Company will help NWHB develop its own managerial control group at such time as the subsidiary can afford an incremental building of a dedicated management team.
 
MARKETING AND SALES
 
Our marketing starts with product development. We create compelling products that: (i) in the case of iMobile Solutions, Inc. and iMobileApp, provide a variety of small to mid-sized businesses with a state-of-the-art website and mobile application solutions, and (ii) in the case of our four vehicle history report products, provide historical title information that assists consumers in purchase decision-making and dealers, auction houses, or other entities in making a sale or evaluating a vehicle.
 
iMobile Solutions, Inc. (iMS)
 
The primary marketing objective for iMS is to continue penetrating new business verticals and to be the leader is mobile app development for growing businesses. While an iMobileApp can benefit any business, the Company identifies and focuses marketing efforts on specific verticals, currently comprised of vehicle dealers, country clubs, racetracks, restaurants, etc., to build a presence in certain industries and become the “go-to” mobile app developer for those markets. As we continue to target franchised vehicle dealers by type of product and manufacturer by specifically approaching each dealership in their dealer network to promote our iMS mobile application we are gaining market share of the vehicle dealer marketplace. By selling our mobile applications throughout one manufacturer’s dealer network, we benefit from “word of mouth” referrals while building a recognizable presence in that particular market. For example, a leading motorcycle manufacturer has over 1,400 authorized dealers worldwide. By penetrating this market, we significantly improve our credibility with their entire dealer network, resulting in the individual dealers being more receptive to our sales call, and making them more likely to purchase an iMobileApp and refer us to other dealers.
 
Additional marketing has been done through targeted advertising as well as news stories in relevant trade publications.

iMobileApp (iMA)
 
There are two primary areas of focus to continue gaining market share for iMA – digital marketing and targeted sales efforts.
 
The digital marketing strategy is predicated on the fact that the business mobile app marketplace is emerging and highly fragmented. In parallel, the web is not yet dominated by any one business mobile app competitor. Our strategy is to build a strong digital web presence that will help grow our business in the short term, and establish iMA as the market leader in web search as the industry consolidates. The cornerstone of our digital strategy is a state-of-the-art web management platform (see www.iMobileApp.com) that is highly search engine optimized (SEO) in structure and content. Page rank and traffic will increase over time as we support the website with traffic building efforts through blogging, social networking, ad-clicks, remarketing, and continual technical and content optimization. The goal is to have a leadership market share in organic and accidental search for businesses seeking mobile application solutions.
 
Traditional sales and marketing efforts will be employed against key categories that have an established high level of acceptance for mobile apps and/or in which iMA has already established market share. Efforts will include inside sales calls, email campaigns, category trade association marketing, and customer referrals.
 
Vehicle History Reports
 
The vehicle categories that we are targeting - motorcycles, recreational vehicles and commercial trucks – are not the focus of our largest competitors (CARFAX®, AutoCheck®). Distribution in the vehicle history reports industry is web-based, and digital competition in our targeted categories is relatively weak and fragmented. Our digital strategy is to become the leading search result for consumers seeking information on used powersports vehicles RV’s, and heavy-duty trucks. We employ an advanced web management platform that is highly search engine optimized (SEO). Page rank and traffic will increase over time as we support the website with traffic building efforts through blogging, social networking, ad-clicks, remarketing, and continual technical and content optimization.
 
An equally important digital strategy is our affiliate and cross-marketing programs. By working with leading companies that serve this category – like AutoTrader®, National Powersports Distributors, Kelley Blue Book®, and AllState® Insurance – we are able to cross-promote our powersports and RV history reporting products on their websites. Consumers who are on affiliate or marketing partner sites can become aware of our reporting services and click through to our websites. If a purchase is completed, the referring affiliate receives a commission on the sale or in some cases may extend a discount to their customers.
 
In December 2010, Powersports Business chose Cyclechex as one of their “Nifty 50” winners, recognizing it as one of the top 50 new powersports products introduced during the year.
 
SRI has considerable opportunity to increase brand awareness and grow traffic through product development, targeted marketing programs and strategic partnerships.
 
Municipal Leasing
 
In 2011, the Company launched a website (www.spartamunicipal.com) exclusively dedicated to the Company’s municipal business line that began in 2007. With this site, agency heads, police and fire department chiefs, dealerships, and other municipal financing decision makers have direct online access to information about the Municipal Lease Program, including how it benefits governmental agency economic interests, and specifics about terms and options. Marketing efforts, when budgets allow, include attending tradeshows, advertising in industry publication, direct mail/email campaigns, and indirect marketing such as referrals by prior municipal customers or dealerships. Sparta’s municipal program is also included in the corporate sites of Harley-Davidson© and BMW Motorrad USA Police Motors for government fleet leasing which results in direct inquiries from municipalities.
New World Health Brands CBD
 
Our initial marketing strategy has been a direct-to-consumer online sales approach via our website www.newworldhealthcbd.com within the United States, by using e-commerce to reach consumers to introduce and guide them through the CBD buying process. Starting with a solid foundation of content and robust product offerings, our marketing strategy will continue to be supplemented with social media exposure, (Facebook and Instagram) and ultimately retail distribution as the strategy evolves. At present, NWHB has developed preliminary distribution within the New York City metro area within independent pharmacies, medical supply stores, smoke shops, spas, and independent retail food stores. Using data collection and customer analysis from e-commerce sales will continue to be a significant component of NWHB’s marketing strategy. Direct-to-consumer e-commerce sales give an unprecedented opportunity to gain significant insight into how to better support the customer based on data, including buying habits, purchase frequency, and in many cases, how the product is being used, whether it be general wellness, health conditions, etc. By building customer trust with a focus on premium, quality products and live customer service, we expect to build a well-recognized brand. Through our own social media and blogging platforms, management expects New World Health Brands will continue to grow CBD organic sales and revenue by promoting our products as trusted brands for consumers who desire premium CBD products.

Sales and Customer Support
 
An internal team is responsible for closing sales on leads generated from web inquires, email responses, inside sales calls and customer referrals. A future sales team will target businesses, trade associations, national chains, manufacturers, vehicle dealers and vehicle auction houses.
 
Customer service is based in our New York City office.
 
Competition
 
While there are numerous entities offering customized mobile apps, we believe that iMobileApp is a leading pre-packaged customizable mobile app for small to medium sized business, such as restaurants, country clubs, social clubs, racetracks, grocery stores, agriculture dealers, vehicle dealers, and more, at a price point significantly below other vendors of customized apps for the vehicle dealer industry.
 
Because of our strong commitment to customer service and our compelling product, we believe that our iMobileApp product can be effectively and competitively marketed.
 
The two major providers of used automobile history reports, CARFAX® and AutoCheck® do not provide motorcycle, recreational vehicle or heavy duty truck history reports. In fact, CARFAX® states on their website FAQ’s that their database contains records primarily of cars and light trucks and “for heavy trucks, RVs, or motorcycles, CARFAX® recommends checking with your DMV, enthusiast forums, and of course a pre-purchase vehicle inspection.” AutoCheck® states on its web site “AutoCheck® only reports on information for cars and light trucks.” We have not identified direct competition of the RV space and do not intend to compete directly with either CarFax® or AutoCheck®.
 
Competition within the CBD-based hemp products industry is very fragmented and highly competitive. The competition is comprised of publically and privately-owned companies and tend to be diverse in terms of geographic market coverage and variety of product mix offered. The “CBD industry” includes tinctures, capsules and tablets, topicals, patches, edibles, vapes, smokables and drinkables all based on pure CBD, defined as containing less than 0.3% THC; blended CBD and THC. NWHB is focused on marketing only hemp-based CBD products. To our knowledge there are only four public companies selling only CBD products. Because of this fragmented market where there is not one sole widely recognized brand, we believe that by focusing on high quality, gluten free, non-GMO, pure CBD products using targeted brand marketing programs we can make New World Health Brands initially a regionally recognized brand and then, potentially, a nationally recognized brand.
