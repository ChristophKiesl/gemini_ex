PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND STRATEGIES
Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls
Products and Services
We have been involved in the chlor alkali industry for nearly 130 years and consider ourselves as the leading global chlor alkali and derivatives producer.  Chlorine, caustic soda and hydrogen are co-produced commercially by the electrolysis of salt.  These co-produced products are produced simultaneously, and in a fixed ratio of 1.0 ton of chlorine to 1.1 tons of caustic soda and 0.03 tons of hydrogen.  The industry refers to this as an Electrochemical Unit or ECU.  
Chlorine is used as a raw material in the production of thousands of products, including vinyls, urethanes, epoxy, water treatment chemicals and a variety of other organic and inorganic chemicals.  A significant portion of chlorine production is consumed in the manufacture of ethylene dichloride (EDC) and vinyl chloride monomer (VCM), both of which our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment produces. A large portion of our EDC production is utilized in the production of VCM, but we are also one of the largest global participants in merchant EDC sales. EDC and VCM are precursors for polyvinyl chloride (PVC). PVC is a plastic used in applications such as vinyl siding, pipe, pipe fittings and automotive parts.
Our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment is one of the largest global marketers of caustic soda, including caustic soda produced by a third party in Brazil. The diversity of caustic soda sourcing allows us to cost effectively supply customers worldwide. Caustic soda has a wide variety of end-use applications, the largest of which includes water treatment, alumina, pulp and paper, urethanes, detergents and soaps and a variety of other organic and inorganic chemicals.
Our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment also includes our chlorinated organics business which is the largest global producer of chlorinated organic products that include chloromethanes (methyl chloride, methylene chloride and chloroform) and chloroethanes (perchloroethylene, trichloroethylene and carbon tetrachloride). Our chlorinated organics business participates in both the solvent segment, as well as the intermediate segment of the global chlorocarbon industry with a focus on 
sustainable applications and in applications where we can benefit from our cost advantages. Intermediate products are used as feedstocks in the production of fluoropolymers, fluorocarbon refrigerants and blowing agents, silicones, cellulosics and agricultural chemicals. Solvent products are sold into end uses such as surface preparation, dry cleaning, pharmaceuticals and regeneration of refining catalysts. This business’s unique technology allows us to utilize both hydrochloric acid and chlorinated hydrocarbon byproducts (RCls), produced by our other production processes, as raw materials in an integrated system. 
We also manufacture and sell other chlor alkali-related products, including hydrochloric acid, sodium hypochlorite (bleach) and potassium hydroxide, which we refer to as co-products. The production of co-products, chlorinated organics products and epoxy resins generally consume chlorine as a raw material creating downstream applications that upgrade the value of chlorine and enable caustic soda production. Our industry leadership in the production of chlorinated organics and epoxy resins, as well as other co-products, offer us eighteen integrated outlets for our captive chlorine. 
The Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment’s products are delivered by pipeline, marine vessel, deep-water and coastal barge, railcar and truck. Our logistics and terminal infrastructure provides us with geographically advantaged storage capacity and provides us with a private fleet of trucks, tankers and trailers that expands our geographic coverage and enhances our service capabilities. At our largest integrated product sites, our deep-water access enables us to reach global markets.
Our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment maintains strong relationships with The Dow Chemical Company (Dow) as both a customer and supplier. These relationships are maintained through long-term cost based contracts that provide us with a reliable supply of key raw materials and predictable and consistent demand for our end use products. Key products sold to Dow include chlorine, caustic soda, chlorinated organics and VCM. In 2021, our VCM contract transitions from a toll manufacturing arrangement to a direct customer sale agreement. Key raw materials received from Dow include ethylene and electricity. Ethylene is supplied for the vinyls business under a long-term supply arrangement with Dow whereby we receive ethylene at integrated producer economics. 
Electricity, salt, ethylene and methanol are the major purchased raw materials for our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment.  Electricity is the single largest raw material component in the production of Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls’ products. Approximately 72% of our electricity is generated from natural gas or hydroelectric sources.  Approximately 59% of our salt requirements are met by internal supply. Methanol is sourced domestically and internationally primarily from large producers. The high volume nature of the chlor alkali industry places an emphasis on cost management and we believe that our scale, integration and raw material positions make us one of the low cost producers in the industry.
The following table lists principal products and services of our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment.

Strategies
Maximize returns to the ECU. Leverage our diverse and flexible chlor alkali derivatives portfolio via our differentiated operating model to continually mitigate exposure to the prevailing weaker side of the ECU and maximize value from the stronger side of the ECU. 
Participate in global trade flow of the products we market. Access excess product available for global trade, complementing our internal produced product to serve a growing customer demand at the highest value. 
Continually drive down costs through productivity.  Our advantaged cost position is derived from low cost energy, scale, integration, and deep water ports. Maintaining a strong discipline on areas such as cost management, capital outlays, and asset maintenance are key to creating greater operating flexibility to maximize returns to the ECU.
Epoxy
Products and Services
The Epoxy business was one of the first major manufacturers of epoxy products, and has continued to build on more than half a century of history through product innovation and technical excellence. We believe the Epoxy segment is one of the largest fully integrated global producers of epoxy resins, curing agents and intermediates. The Epoxy segment has a favorable manufacturing cost position which is driven by a combination of scale and integration into low cost feedstocks (including chlorine, caustic soda, allylics and aromatics). With its advantaged cost position, the Epoxy segment is among the lowest cost producers in the world. The Epoxy segment produces and sells a full range of epoxy materials and precursors, including upstream products such as aromatics (acetone, bisphenol (BisA), cumene and phenol), allyl chloride (Allyl) and epichlorohydrin (EPI), midstream products such as liquid epoxy resins (LER) and solid epoxy resins (SER) and downstream products such as converted epoxy resins (CER) and additives.
The Epoxy segment serves a diverse array of applications, including wind energy, electrical laminates, consumer goods and composites, as well as numerous applications in civil engineering and protective coatings. The Epoxy segment has important relationships with established customers, some of which span decades. The Epoxy segment’s primary geographies are North America and Western Europe. The segment’s product is delivered primarily by marine vessel, deep-water and coastal barge, railcar and truck.
Allyl is used not only as a feedstock in the production of EPI, but also as a chemical intermediate in multiple industries and applications, including water purification chemicals. EPI is primarily produced as a feedstock for use in the business’s epoxy resins, and also sold to epoxy producers globally who produce their own resins for end use segments such as coatings and adhesives. LER is manufactured in liquid form and cures with the addition of a hardener into a three-dimensional thermoset solid material offering a distinct combination of structural strength, adhesion, electrical insulation, thermal or chemical resistance and corrosion protection that is well-suited to coatings and composites applications. SER is processed further with BisA to meet specific end market applications. While LER and SER are sold externally, a significant portion of LER production is further converted into CER where value-added modifications produce higher margin resins.
Our Epoxy segment maintains strong relationships with Dow as both a customer and supplier. These relationships are maintained through long-term cost based contracts that provide us with a reliable supply of key raw materials. Key products sold to Dow include aromatics and key raw materials received from Dow include benzene and propylene.
The Epoxy segment’s production economics benefit from its integration into chlor alkali and aromatics which are key inputs in epoxy production. This fully integrated structure provides both access to low cost materials and significant operational flexibility. The Epoxy segment operates an integrated aromatics production chain producing cumene, phenol, acetone and BisA for internal consumption and external sale. The Epoxy segment’s consumption of chlorine enables the Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment to generate caustic soda production and sales. Chlorine used in our Epoxy segment is transferred at cost from the Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment.
The following table lists principal products and services of our Epoxy segment.

Products & Services | Major End Uses | Plants & Facilities | Major Raw Materials & Components for Products/Services
Allylics (allyl chloride, epichlorohydrin and glycerin) & aromatics (acetone, bisphenol, cumene and phenol) | Manufacturers of polymers, resins and other plastic materials, water purification, and pesticides | Freeport, TX Stade, GermanyTerneuzen, Netherlands | benzene, caustic soda, chlorine, propylene 
Liquid epoxy resin/solid epoxy resin | Adhesives, paint and coatings, composites and flooring | Freeport, TXGuaruja, BrazilStade, Germany | bisphenol, caustic soda, epichlorohydrin

Strategies
Focus on Return to the ECU. The Epoxy segment is focused on maximizing return to the ECU by targeting participation and improving margins in EPI, LER, and derivative applications with the highest return to the ECU. 
Drive Productivity to Sustain Our Cost Advantage. The Epoxy segment continues to drive productivity cost improvements through the entire supply chain to build on our position as the low cost producer of EPI and LER in the Americas and Europe. We expect to reduce structural costs in applications that do not fit our strategic model.
Capitalize on Aromatics Assets.  The Epoxy segment utilizes our Aromatics position as a low-cost feedstock for LER and derivative applications while seeking the highest return opportunities for Aromatics assets.
Winchester
Products and Services
In 2021, Winchester is in its 155th year of operation and its 91st year as part of Olin.  Winchester is a premier developer and manufacturer of small caliber ammunition for sale to domestic and international retailers (commercial customers), law enforcement agencies and domestic and international militaries.  We believe we are a leading U.S. producer of ammunition for recreational shooters, hunters, law enforcement agencies and the U.S. Armed Forces. Winchester also manufacturers industrial products that have various applications in the construction industry. 
On October 1, 2020, Winchester assumed full management and operational control of the Lake City Army Ammunition Plant (Lake City) in Independence, MO. The United States Army selected Winchester to operate and manage Lake City in September 2019. The contract is for the production of small caliber military ammunition, including 5.56mm, 7.62mm, and .50 caliber rounds, as well as certain cartridges and casings.

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS
Olin has an international presence, including the geographic regions of Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America. Approximately 36% of Olin’s 2020 sales were generated outside of the U.S., including 25% of our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls 2020 segment sales, 67% of our Epoxy 2020 segment sales and 7% of our Winchester 2020 segment sales. See Note 20 “Segment Information” of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8, for geographic segment data.  We are incorporating our segment information from that Note into this section of our Form 10-K.
CUSTOMERS AND DISTRIBUTION
Products we sell to industrial or commercial users or distributors for use in the production of other products constitute a major part of our total sales.  We sell some of our products, such as epoxy resins, caustic soda and sporting ammunition, to a large number of users or distributors, while we sell other products, such as chlorine and chlorinated organics, in substantial quantities to a relatively small number of industrial users.  Olin has a significant relationship with Dow, who was our largest customer by revenue in 2020, representing approximately 11% of our total sales. We expect this relationship to continue to be significant to Olin and to represent approximately 10% of our annual sales in 2021. No other single customer accounted for more than 5% of sales. We discuss the customers for each of our three business segments in more detail under “Products and Services.”
We market most of our products and services primarily through our sales force and sell directly to various industrial customers, mass merchants, retailers, wholesalers, other distributors and the U.S. Government and its prime contractors.
Sales to all U.S. Government agencies and sales under U.S. Government contracting activities in total accounted for approximately 3% of sales in 2020.  Because we engage in some government contracting activities and make sales to the U.S. Government, we are subject to extensive and complex U.S. Government procurement laws and regulations.  These laws and regulations provide for ongoing government audits and reviews of contract procurement, performance and administration.  
Failure to comply, even inadvertently, with these laws and regulations and with laws governing the export of munitions and other controlled products and commodities could subject us or one or more of our businesses to civil and criminal penalties, and under certain circumstances, suspension and debarment from future government contracts and the exporting of products for a specified period of time.
BACKLOG
The total amount of estimated backlog was approximately $2,175 million and $151 million as of January 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.  The backlog orders are associated with contractual orders in our Winchester business.  Backlogs in our other businesses are not significant. Backlog is comprised of all open customer orders which have been received, but not yet shipped.  The backlog was estimated based on expected volume to be shipped from firm contractual orders, which are subject to customary terms and conditions, including cancellation and modification provisions. During 2020, consumer purchases of ammunition increased significantly above normal demand levels. The increase in demand has been across all of Winchester’s commercial product offerings. Our ability to fulfill the backlog could be constrained due to limitations on our production capacity. Approximately 53% of contracted backlog as of January 31, 2021 is expected to be fulfilled during 2021, with the remainder expected to be fulfilled during 2022.
COMPETITION
We are in active competition with businesses producing or distributing the same or similar products, as well as, in some instances, with businesses producing or distributing different products designed for the same uses.
Chlor alkali manufacturers in North America, with approximately 17 million tons of chlorine and 18 million tons of caustic soda capacity, account for approximately 16% of worldwide chlor alkali production capacity.  In 2020, we have the largest chlor alkali capacity in North America and globally. While the technologies to manufacture and transport chlorine and caustic soda are widely available, the production facilities require large capital investments, and are subject to significant regulatory and permitting requirements. Approximately 76% of the total North American chlor alkali capacity is located in the U.S. Gulf Coast region. There is a worldwide market for caustic soda, which attracts imports and allows exports depending on market conditions. Other large chlor alkali producers in North America include The Occidental Petroleum Corporation (Oxy) and Westlake Chemical Corporation (Westlake).  
We are also a leading integrated global producer of chlorinated organic products with a strong cost position due to our scale and access to chlor alkali feedstocks. This industry includes large diversified producers such as Oxy, Westlake, Inovyn and KEM ONE, as well as multiple producers located in China.
We are a major global fully integrated epoxy producer, with access to key low cost feedstocks and a cost advantaged infrastructure. With its advantaged cost position, the Epoxy segment is among the lowest cost producers in the world. The markets in which our Epoxy segment operates are highly competitive and are dependent on significant capital investment, the development of proprietary technology and maintenance of product research and development. Among our competitors are Huntsman Corporation (Huntsman) and Hexion, Inc., as well as multiple producers located in Asia. 
We believe our Winchester business is one of the largest global manufacturers of commercial small caliber ammunition. Our Winchester business, Vista Outdoor Inc. (Vista), and Remington Outdoor Company, Inc. (Remington) are among the largest commercial ammunition manufacturers in the U.S.  In October 2020, Vista acquired the Remington ammunition business in the bankruptcy auction of Remington’s assets. The ammunition industry is highly competitive with Olin, Vista and numerous smaller domestic manufacturers and foreign producers competing for sales to the commercial ammunition customers.  Many factors influence our ability to compete successfully, including price, delivery, service, performance, product innovation and product recognition and quality, depending on the product involved.

The insights provided by our workforce through various skills, backgrounds and experiences that each of our employees brings will lead us to future innovations which will reduce costs, reduce our environmental footprint, improve our ability to serve the world and keep our employees healthier and safer. We uphold the diversity of our employees to embolden inclusive dialogue, creative ideas, and innovative solutions to cultivate lasting, positive impacts for our customers, employees, communities, and shareholders. In our support of diversity and inclusion objectives, approximately 26% of our global workforce is comprised of women, and approximately 27% of our management roles are held by women. Our goal is to continue to expand women in leadership positions by approximately 10% by 2025. Our largest concentration of employees is located in the U.S., of which 29% are minorities.
We also strive for continued professional development of our workforce. We never stop learning and Olin provides a wide range of employee development and productivity programs. These opportunities help our employees improve and grow, ensuring that each employee understands our values and commitment to one another. Our learning platform focuses on fostering additional learning opportunities which allow our people to build meaningful careers. As part of our commitment to professional development, we offer undergraduate and graduate tuition assistance to eligible employees up to a maximum of $10,000 per year. We regularly review talent development and succession plans to identify and develop a pipeline of talent to maintain business operations. We also have a well-established performance management process, which includes, at a minimum, annual year-end reviews and development discussions. Our talent management process seeks to provide employees on-going feedback to enhance their performance.
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 8,000 employees, with 6,800 working in the U.S., including approximately 1,700 employees at Lake City which is a GOCO facility, and 1,200 working in foreign countries.  For our foreign country locations, approximately 56% are located in Europe, Middle East, Africa, and India, 20% in Asia Pacific, 14% in Canada, and 10% in Latin America. Approximately 48% of our total employees are employed in our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls and Epoxy businesses, 49% are employed in our Winchester business, including 21% at Lake City, and 3% are employed in Corporate functions. Various labor unions represent a significant number of our hourly-paid employees for collective bargaining purposes.
The following labor contract will be required to be negotiated in 2021:

Location | Number of Employees | Expiration Date
East Alton (Winchester) | 573 | December 2021 

While we believe our relations with our employees and their various representatives are generally satisfactory, we cannot assure that we can conclude this labor contract or any other labor agreements without work stoppages and cannot assure that any work stoppages will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
RESEARCH ACTIVITIES; PATENTS
Our research activities are conducted on a product-group basis at a number of facilities.  Company-sponsored research expenditures were $16.6 million, $16.5 million and $14.9 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
We own or license a number of patents, patent applications and trade secrets covering our products and processes.  We believe that, in the aggregate, the rights under our patents and licenses are important to our operations, but we do not consider any individual patent, license or group of patents and licenses related to a specific process or product to be of material importance to our total business.
SEASONALITY
Our sales are affected by economic downturns and the seasonality of several industries we serve, including building and construction, coatings, oil and gas, infrastructure, electronics, automotive, water treatment, refrigerants and ammunition. The seasonality of the ammunition business is typically driven by the U.S. fall hunting season. Our chlor alkali businesses generally experience their highest level of activity during the spring and summer months, particularly when construction, refrigerants, coatings and infrastructure activity is higher. The chlor alkali industry experiences changes in demand for each of the co-produced products and as a result of the large increments in which new capacity is added and removed.  Because chlorine and caustic soda are produced in a fixed ratio, the supply of one product can be constrained both by the physical capacity of the production facilities and/or by the ability or desire to sell the co-produced product.  Prices for both products respond rapidly to changes in supply and demand. We have significant diversification of our chlorine outlets, which allows us to better manage this co-product relationship.
RAW MATERIALS AND ENERGY
Basic raw materials are processed through an integrated manufacturing process to produce a number of products that are sold at various points throughout the process. We purchase a portion of our raw material requirements and also utilize internal resources, co-products and finished goods as raw materials for downstream products. We believe we have reliable sources of supply for our raw materials under normal market conditions. However, we cannot predict the likelihood or impact of any future raw material shortages.
The principal basic raw materials for our production of Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls’ products are electricity, salt, ethylene and methanol.  Electricity is the predominant energy source for our manufacturing facilities.  Approximately 72% of our electricity is generated from natural gas or hydroelectric sources. We have long-term power supply contracts with Dow in addition to utilizing our own power assets, which allow for cost differentiation at specific U.S. manufacturing sites. A portion of our purchases of raw materials, including ethylene, are made under long-term supply agreements, while approximately 59% of the salt used in our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment is produced from internal resources. Methanol is sourced domestically and internationally primarily from large producers.
The Epoxy segment’s principal raw materials are chlorine, benzene, propylene and aromatics, which consist of cumene, phenol, acetone and BisA. A portion of our purchases of raw materials, including benzene, propylene and a portion of our aromatics requirements, are made under long-term supply agreements, while a portion of our aromatics requirements are produced from our integrated production chain. Chlorine is predominately sourced from our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment.
Lead, brass and propellant are the principal raw materials used in the Winchester business.  We typically purchase our ammunition cartridge case cups and copper-based strip, and propellants pursuant to multi-year contracts.
We provide additional information with respect to specific raw materials in the tables set forth under “Products and Services.”
ENVIRONMENTAL AND TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROLS
As is common in our industry, we are subject to environmental laws and regulations related to the use, storage, handling, generation, transportation, emission, discharge, disposal and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non-hazardous substances and wastes in all of the countries in which we do business.
The establishment and implementation of national, state or provincial and local standards to regulate air, water and land quality affect substantially all of our manufacturing locations around the world.  Laws providing for regulation of the manufacture, transportation, use and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances, and remediation of contaminated sites have imposed additional regulatory requirements on industry, particularly the chemicals industry.  In addition, implementation of environmental laws has required and will continue to require new capital expenditures and will increase operating costs.
We are a party to various government and private environmental actions associated with former waste disposal sites and past manufacturing facilities.  Charges to income for investigatory and remedial efforts were $20.9 million, $25.3 million and $7.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These charges may be material to operating results in future years. These charges do not include insurance recoveries for costs incurred and expensed in prior periods.
See our discussion of our environmental matters contained in Note 21 “Environmental” of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 and under the heading “Environmental Matters” in Item 7—“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

We are committed to the guiding principles of the chemical industry's Responsible Care® initiative around the globe and we use our management system to drive continuous improvement and achieve excellence in environmental, health, safety, process safety and security performance. Our safety, health and environmental strategy and goals are designed to sustain our drive to zero incidents. Relentlessly and responsibly, we constantly emphasize the importance of monitoring the safety, security and environmental impact of our plants and processes. Through our day-to-day vigilance, Olin strives to continue to be recognized as one of the industry’s best performers. 
Our corporate values — Act with Integrity, Drive Innovation and Improvement and Lift Olin People — are part of our culture. These values are also reflected in our Environment, Health, Safety and Security (EHS&S) policy and practice. Olin leadership visibly performs and guides the organization to conduct business in a manner that protects and increasingly benefits our employees, business partners and the communities in which we live. All employees have responsibilities within our management systems necessary to sustain our drive to zero incidents. Full year 2020 was the third consecutive year that Olin achieved a decline for total safety and environmental events, which includes recordable injuries, process safety events, environmental events, and distribution events.
Sustainability and Governance
We strongly believe in meeting the needs of the present without compromising the needs of future generations. We recognize the impact our company has on our natural resources and our responsibility to stewardship of people and the planet. This means striving for a company culture responsible to the ongoing economic, social and governance ideals of our employees and shareholders. 
At Olin, we integrate sustainability in everything we do as a Responsible Corporate Citizen. We value and respect our people, the communities in which we operate, our customers and the environment. We commit to making a contribution to the protection of the world and its future condition through the safety and efficiency of our business practices - from supply to manufacture to delivery and ultimately the end-use of our products. Our focus on continuous improvement throughout our history drives our business. Our inaugural Sustainability Report describes our core tenets in this area. Focused on four pillars, we are challenging ourselves to advance those opportunities where our impact on the planet, our operations and our people and communities is most meaningful:
Energy and Climate Mindfulness
Olin systematically and strategically manages our energy and carbon footprint, driving greater efficiency and increasing utilization of renewable resources.
Resource Efficiency
Olin effectively manages critical resources to minimize consumption and waste, increase reuse and recycle of materials, drive operational efficiency, and be good stewards of protection for the environment.
Product Sustainability and Commercial Outreach
Olin’s products and processes contribute to sustainable opportunities and innovation, enabling safe handling and distribution throughout the supply chain.
Employee and Community Care
Olin provides equal opportunities to employees and ensures the ongoing safety and livelihood of our people and communities. 
We have developed a strategy and global initiative to manage and track our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, water usage, waste disposal and energy consumption and efficiency at our facilities.  We are committed to improving our use of resources, acting on opportunities to reduce our environmental footprint and setting targets for improvement. We understand that maintaining safe, sustainable operations has an impact on us, our communities, the environment and our collective future. We continue to invest to develop safer, cleaner and more efficient products and processes. Our social and governance practices drive safety, equality and fairness for our operations and ensure transparency of our practices. 
Product Responsibility
We take great pride in distributing and handling our products safely and enabling our customers to do the same. Our product stewardship and quality practices are aligned with our core values, the American Chemistry Council’s Product Safety Code under Responsible Care®, and other globally recognized standards. We apply these standards to our chemical business segments and relevant subsidiaries to ensure compliance with applicable global regulations, evaluation, continuous improvement and transparency of relevant production and product or formulation information. Additionally, Winchester ammunition is designed and manufactured in accordance with the voluntary industry standards published by the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers’ Institute. We are deeply committed to ammunition education and advocate strongly for the belief that it is important to take the necessary steps to be trained and educated when handling and using a firearm for recreational purposes, both for experienced and novice participants. Our goal is to meet or exceed guidelines in every instance. Olin Leadership demonstrates its commitment to these standards through active participation and communication concerning product safety, within our organization and to external stakeholders.
