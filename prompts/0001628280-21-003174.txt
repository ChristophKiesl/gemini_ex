The majority of our distillery and ingredient product sales are made directly, or through distributors, to manufacturers and processors of finished packaged goods or to bakeries. 
Recent Developments
Acquisition of Luxco. On January 22, 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Luxco, Inc., and its affiliated companies ("Luxco"). Luxco is a leading branded beverage alcohol company across various categories, with a more than 60-year business heritage. As a result of the Luxco acquisition, we expect to increase our scale and market position in the branded-spirits sector and strengthen our platform for future growth of higher valued-added products. Under the terms of the agreement, Luxco shareholders will receive $237,500 in cash (less assumed indebtedness) and 5,007,833 shares of MGP Common Stock. The purchase price is subject to customary purchase price adjustments, including working capital, which adjustments are anticipated to be paid in cash. The transaction is anticipated to be completed during the first half of 2021, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions (See Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors and Note 15 for additional information).
INFORMATION ABOUT SEGMENTS

As of December 31, 2020, we had two reportable segments: Distillery Products and Ingredient Solutions.
Distillery Products Segment.  We process corn and other grains (including rye, barley, wheat, barley malt, and milo) into food grade alcohol and distillery co-products, such as distillers feed (commonly called dried distillers grain in the industry), fuel grade alcohol, and corn oil. We also provide warehouse services, including barrel put away, barrel storage, and barrel retrieval services, as well as blending services. We have certain contracts with customers to supply distilled products (or "distillate"), as well as certain contracts with customers to provide barreling and warehousing services.  Contracts with customers may be monthly, annual, and multi-year with periodic reviews of pricing.  Sales of fuel grade alcohol are made on the spot market.  Since 2015, our Distillery Products segment includes production and sales of our own branded alcohol products, including sales under the following brands: TILL® American Wheat Vodka, George Remus® Straight Bourbon Whiskey, Remus Repeal Reserve® Straight Bourbon Whiskey, Tanner’s Creek® Blended Bourbon Whiskey, Rossville Union® Straight Rye Whiskey, Eight & Sand Blended Bourbon Whiskey and Green Hat® Gin. During 2020, our five largest Distillery Products customers, combined, accounted for 18.9 percent of our consolidated sales.
Food Grade Alcohol - The majority of our distillery capacities are dedicated to the production of high quality, high purity food grade alcohol for beverage and industrial applications.
Food grade alcohol sold for beverage applications, premium beverage alcohol, consists primarily of premium bourbon and rye whiskeys ("brown goods") and GNS, including vodka and gin ("white goods").  Our premium bourbon is created by distilling grains, primarily corn. Our whiskey is made from fermented grain mash, including rye and corn. Our whiskeys are sold as aged and unaged distillate, which may be further aged by our customers or warehoused at our facilities, and are sold at various proof concentrations. Our GNS is sold in bulk quantities at various proof concentrations. Our gin is created by redistilling GNS together with proprietary formulations of botanicals or botanical oils.
Food grade industrial alcohol is used as an ingredient in foods (e.g., vinegar and food flavorings), personal care products (e.g., hair sprays and hand sanitizers), cleaning solutions, pharmaceuticals, and a variety of other products.  We sell food grade industrial alcohol in tank truck or rail car quantities direct to a number of industrial processors.
Fuel grade alcohol - Fuel grade alcohol is sold primarily for blending with gasoline to increase the octane and oxygen levels of the gasoline.  As an octane enhancer, fuel grade alcohol can serve as a substitute for lead and petroleum-based octane enhancers.  As an oxygenate, fuel grade alcohol has been used in gasoline to meet certain environmental regulations and laws relating to air quality by reducing carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon particulates, and other toxic emissions generated from the burning of gasoline. We produce fuel grade alcohol as a co-product of our food grade alcohol business at our Atchison facility.

Distillers Feed and related Co-Products - The bulk alcohol co-products sales include distillers feed and corn oil. Distillers feed is principally derived from the mash from alcohol processing operations.  The mash is dried and sold primarily to processors of animal feeds as a high protein additive.  In addition, we produce corn oil as a value added co-product through a corn oil extraction process at our Atchison facility.

Warehouse Services - Customers who purchase barreled distillate may, and in most cases do, also enter into separate warehouse service agreements with us for the storage of product for aging. Services under warehouse agreements include barrel put away, barrel storage, and barrel retrieval, as well as blending services.
Ingredient Solutions Segment.  Our Ingredient Solutions segment consists primarily of specialty wheat starches, specialty wheat proteins, commodity wheat starches, and commodity wheat proteins. Contracts with Ingredient Solutions customers are generally price, volume, and term agreements, which are fixed-term contracts, with very few agreements longer than 12 months in duration.  During 2020, our five largest Ingredient Solutions customers, combined, accounted for 13.4 percent of our consolidated sales.
Specialty Wheat Starches - Wheat starch is derived from the carbohydrate-bearing portion of wheat flour.  We produce a premium wheat starch powder by extracting the starch from the starch slurry, substantially free of all impurities and then dry the starch in spray, flash, or drum dryers.
A substantial portion of our premium wheat starch is altered during processing to produce certain unique specialty wheat starches designed for special applications.  We sell our specialty wheat starches on a global basis, primarily to food processors and distributors.
We market our specialty wheat starches under the trademarks Fibersym® Resistant Starch series, FiberRite® RW Resistant Starch, Pregel® Instant Starch series, and Midsol® Cook-up Starch series. They are used primarily for food applications as an ingredient in a variety of food products to affect their nutritional profile, appearance, texture, tenderness, taste, palatability, cooking temperature, stability, viscosity, binding, and freeze-thaw characteristics.  Important physical properties contributed by wheat starch include whiteness, clean flavor, viscosity, and texture.  For example, our starches are used to improve the taste and texture of cream puffs, éclairs, puddings, pie fillings, breading, and batters; to improve the size, symmetry, and taste of angel food cakes; to alter the viscosity of soups, sauces, and gravies; to improve the freeze-thaw stability and shelf life of fruit pies and other frozen foods; to improve moisture retention in microwavable foods; and to add stability and to improve texture in frostings, mixes, glazes, and sugar coatings.

Our wheat starches, as a whole, generally compete primarily with corn starch, which dominates the United States starch market.  Additionally, our wheat starches compete with potato and tapioca. However, the unique characteristics of our specialty wheat starches provide a number of advantages over other starches for certain functionality in baking and pasta end uses. 

Specialty Wheat Proteins - We have developed a number of specialty wheat proteins for food applications. Specialty wheat proteins are derived from vital wheat gluten through a variety of proprietary processes which change its molecular structure.  Specialty wheat proteins for food applications include the products Arise® and Proterra®. 
We produce clean label ingredients under our Arise® line of wheat protein isolates. Along with Arise® 8000, this series includes Arise® 8100 and Arise® 8200. Each of these ingredients is also Non-Genetically Modified Organism ("Non-GMO") Project Verified. We also offer a Non-GMO Project Verified food ingredients portfolio of Proterra® 1000, Proterra® 2000, and plant protein combinations textured and ready for meat replacement applications. Additionally, we offer gluten free textured pea proteins. 
Our specialty wheat proteins generally compete with other ingredients and modified proteins having similar characteristics, primarily soy proteins and other wheat proteins, with differentiation being based on factors such as functionality, price, and, in the case of food applications, flavor.
Commodity Wheat Starches - As is the case with value added wheat starches, our commodity wheat starches have both food and non-food applications, but such applications are more limited than those of value added wheat starches and typically sell for a lower price in the marketplace.  Commodity wheat starches compete primarily with other commodity starches, corn starches and tapioca. Marketplace prices generally track the fluctuations in the overall commodity markets in this category.
Commodity Wheat Proteins - Commodity wheat protein, or vital wheat gluten, is a free-flowing light tan powder which contains approximately 75 percent protein.  When we process wheat flour to derive starch, we also derive vital wheat gluten.  Vital wheat gluten is added by bakeries and food processors to baked goods, such as breads, and to pet foods, cereals, processed meats, and fish and poultry to improve the nutritional content, texture, strength, shape, and volume of the product.  The neutral flavor and color of vital wheat gluten also enhances the flavor and color of certain foods.  The cohesiveness and elasticity of the gluten enables the dough in wheat and other high protein breads to rise and to support added ingredients, such as whole cracked grains, raisins and fibers.  This allows bakers to make an array of different breads by varying the gluten content of the dough.  Vital wheat gluten is also added to white breads, hot dog buns, and hamburger buns to improve the strength and cohesiveness of the product. Additionally, our wheat gluten is being used in more vegan and vegetarian food options than in years past. This is a relatively new application and is generating additional volume opportunities in this segment. 
COMPETITIVE CONDITION
While we believe that the overall market environment offers considerable growth opportunities for us in 2021 and beyond, the markets in which our products are sold are competitive. Our products compete against similar products of many large and small companies. In our Distillery Products segment, competition is based primarily on product innovation, product characteristics, functionality, price, service, and quality factors, such as flavor. In our Ingredient Solutions segment, competition is based primarily on product innovation, product characteristics, price, name, color, flavor, or other properties that affect how the ingredient is being used.
PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, AND LICENSES

We are involved in a number of patent-related activities, primarily within our Ingredient Solutions segment.  We have filed patent applications to protect a range of inventions made in our research and development efforts, including inventions relating 
to applications for our products.  Some of these patents or licenses cover significant product formulation and processes used to manufacture our products.
SEASONALITY

Sales for some of our products, including brown goods, can fluctuate from period to period due to inherent demands and timing of our customers needs; however, our sales are generally not seasonal.
TRANSPORTATION

Historically, our output has been transported to customers by truck and rail, most of which is provided by common carriers. We use third party transportation companies to help us manage truck and rail carriers who deliver our products to our North American customers as well as overseas shipments to our international customers. 
RAW MATERIALS, PACKAGING MATERIALS, AND FOOD GRADE ALCOHOL
Our principal Distillery Products segment raw materials, or input costs, are corn and other grains (including rye, barley, wheat, barley malt, and milo), which are processed into food grade alcohol and distillery co-products consisting of distillers feed, fuel grade alcohol, and corn oil. Our principal Ingredient Solutions segment raw material is wheat flour, which is processed into starches and proteins.  The cost of grain and wheat flour has, at times, been subject to substantial fluctuation. 
In 2020, we purchased most of our grain requirements from two suppliers, Bunge Milling, Inc. ("Bunge") and Consolidated Grain and Barge Co. ("CGB"). Our current grain supply contracts with Bunge and CGB expire on December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Through these contracts, we purchase grain for delivery into the future at negotiated prices based on several factors.  We also order wheat flour for delivery into the future at negotiated prices based on several factors.  We purchase most of our wheat flour through a supply contract with Ardent Mills, which expires August 20, 2023. We typically enter contracts for future delivery only to protect margins on contracted alcohol sales, expected ingredient sales, and general usage.
Our principal packaging material for our Distillery Products segment is oak barrels. Both new and used barrels are utilized for the aging of premium bourbon and rye whiskeys. We purchase oak barrels from multiple suppliers and some customers supply their own barrels.
We also source food grade alcohol from Pacific Ethanol Central, LLC ("Pacific Ethanol"), formerly Illinois Corn Processing, LLC ("ICP").
ENERGY

Natural gas is an input cost used to operate boilers to make steam heat.  We procure natural gas for our facilities in the open market from various suppliers.  We have a risk management program whereby we may purchase contracts for the delivery of natural gas for delivery into the future at negotiated prices based on several factors, or we can purchase futures contracts on the exchange.  Historically, prices of natural gas have been higher in the late fall and winter months than during other periods. 
All of our electricity needs for both our Atchison and Lawrenceburg facilities is sourced from renewable wind power. Through an agreement with a supplier, we purchase renewable energy credits. The wind energy, equal in value to the credits, will then be sourced from wind farms in Kansas and added to the overall energy grid system. 
HUMAN CAPITAL
As of December 31, 2020, we had a total of 360 employees.  A collective bargaining agreement, covering 103 employees at the Atchison facility, expires on August 31, 2024.  A collective bargaining agreement, covering 64 employees at the Lawrenceburg facility, expires on December 31, 2022.  We have not experienced any recent work stoppages, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good. Headcount by facility is as follows: 
•Atchison, Kansas - 237
•Lawrenceburg, Indiana - 120
•Washington, D.C. - 3
We believe our employees are key to achieving our business objectives. Our key human capital measures include employee safety, turnover, absenteeism and productivity. We frequently benchmark our compensation practices and benefits programs against those of comparable industries and in the geographic areas where our facilities are located. We believe that our compensation and employee benefits are competitive and allow us to attract and retain skilled and unskilled labor throughout our organization. Our notable health, welfare and retirement benefits include:
•Company subsidized health insurance
•401(k) Plan with Company matching contributions
•Tuition assistance program
•Paid time off
Employee safety is one of our top priorities. We develop and administer company-wide policies designed to ensure the safety of each team member and compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA") standards. This includes a program called Safety Up, which promotes safety from the plant floor up and includes employee-led safety meetings, training and assessments, and weekly safety audits. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic we were deemed an essential employer and continued to operate with COVID-19 prevention protocols in place to minimize the risk of the spread of COVID-19 in our workplaces. Many of our administrative staff were encouraged or required to work from home. These protocols remain in place and will continue so long as the pandemic continues. 
Our Company strives for workforce retention. We have programs for continuing education through our MGP University and also provide tuition reimbursement. New and open positions are posted for our current workforce to apply for and internal promotions are encouraged.
We strive to maintain an inclusive environment free from discrimination of any kind, including sexual or other discriminatory harassment. Our employees have multiple avenues available through which inappropriate behavior can be reported, including a confidential hotline. Our policies require all reports of inappropriate behavior to be promptly investigated with appropriate action taken.
REGULATION

We are subject to a broad range of federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations intended to protect public health and the environment.  Our operations are also subject to regulation by various federal agencies, including the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Trade Bureau ("TTB"), OSHA, the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"), the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), and by various state and local authorities.  Such laws and regulations cover virtually every aspect of our operations, including production and storage facilities, distillation and maturation requirements, importing ingredients, distribution of beverage alcohol products, marketing, pricing, labeling, packaging, advertising, water usage, waste water discharge, disposal of hazardous wastes and emissions, and other matters. In addition, beverage alcohol products are subject to customs, duties or excise taxation in many countries, including taxation at the federal, state, and local level in the United States.
