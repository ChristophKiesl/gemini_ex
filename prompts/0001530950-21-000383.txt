ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Introduction
We are a consumer packaged goods holding company operating in the center-of-the-store, refrigerated, foodservice, food ingredient and convenient nutrition food categories. We also participate in the private brand food category, including through our investment with third parties in 8th Avenue Food & Provisions, Inc. (“8th Avenue”). Unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise indicates, all references in this Form 10-K to “Post,” “the Company,” “us,” “our” or “we” mean Post Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
Post is a Missouri corporation incorporated on September 22, 2011. On February 3, 2012, Post completed its legal separation via a tax free spin-off from its former parent company. On February 6, 2012, Post common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) under the ticker symbol “POST”. We operate in five reportable segments: 
•Post Consumer Brands: Includes branded and private label ready-to-eat (“RTE”) cereals from the businesses of Post Foods, LLC, MOM Brands Company, LLC (“MOM Brands”), which Post acquired in May 2015, Weetabix North America (“Weetabix NA”), which Post acquired in July 2017, and the RTE cereal operations of TreeHouse Foods, Inc., which Post acquired in June 2021, as well as nut butters under the Peter Pan brand, which Post acquired in January 2021;
•Weetabix: Includes the business of Weetabix Limited, which Post acquired in July 2017, which produces and distributes branded and private label RTE cereal, hot cereals and other cereal-based food products, breakfast drinks and muesli primarily outside of North America;
•Foodservice: Includes primarily egg and potato products in the foodservice and food ingredient channels from the businesses of MFI Holding Corporation (“Michael Foods”), which Post acquired in June 2014, Willamette Egg Farms (“Willamette”), which Post acquired in October 2015, National Pasteurized Eggs, Inc. (“NPE”), which Post acquired in October 2016, Bob Evans Farms, Inc. (“Bob Evans”), which Post acquired in January 2018, Henningsen Foods, Inc., which Post acquired in July 2020, and Almark Foods (“Almark”), which Post acquired in February 2021;
•Refrigerated Retail: Provides refrigerated retail products, inclusive of side dishes, eggs and egg products, sausage, cheese and other dairy and refrigerated products, from the businesses of Bob Evans, Michael Foods, including the business of Crystal Farms Dairy Company (“Crystal Farms”), which Post acquired as a part of its acquisition of Michael Foods in June 2014, Willamette, NPE and Almark, as well as the Egg Beaters brand, which Post acquired in May 2021; and 
•BellRing Brands (historically referred to as Active Nutrition): Provides products in the convenient nutrition category, including ready-to-drink (“RTD”) protein shakes, other RTD beverages, powders and nutrition bars, from the businesses of Premier Nutrition Company, LLC, which Post acquired in September 2013, Dymatize Enterprises, LLC, which Post acquired in February 2014, and the PowerBar brand, which Post acquired in October 2014, and includes Active Nutrition International GmbH, which manufactures and sells convenient nutrition products in certain international markets. 
On October 21, 2019, the initial public offering of a minority interest in our historical active nutrition business was completed (the “BellRing IPO”). As a result of the BellRing IPO and certain other transactions completed in connection with the BellRing IPO (the “BellRing formation transactions”), BellRing Brands, Inc. (“BellRing”) became a holding company owning 28.8% of the non-voting membership units (the “BellRing Brands, LLC units”) of BellRing Brands, LLC and a publicly-traded company whose Class A common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the “BellRing Class A Common Stock”), is traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “BRBR”. Post owns 71.2% of the BellRing Brands, LLC units and one share of BellRing’s Class B common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the “BellRing Class B Common Stock”), which, for so long as Post or its affiliates (other than BellRing and its subsidiaries) directly own more than 50% of the BellRing Brands, LLC units, represents 67% of the combined voting power of the common stock of BellRing. BellRing Brands, LLC is the holding company for Post’s historical active nutrition business. Effective October 21, 2019, the financial results of BellRing and its subsidiaries are consolidated within the Company’s financial results and 28.8% of the consolidated net income (loss) and net assets of BellRing and its subsidiaries, representing the percentage of economic interest in BellRing Brands, LLC held by BellRing (and therefore indirectly held by the public stockholders of BellRing through their ownership of the BellRing Class A Common Stock), are allocated to noncontrolling interest. For additional information, refer to Note 4 within “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in Item 8 of this report.
On October 26, 2021, Post entered into a Transaction Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Transaction Agreement”) providing for the distribution of a significant portion of its ownership interest in BellRing to Post’s shareholders. Pursuant to the 
Transaction Agreement, Post will contribute its share of BellRing Class B Common Stock, all of its BellRing Brands, LLC units and cash to BellRing Distribution, LLC, a newly-formed wholly-owned subsidiary of Post (“New BellRing”), in exchange for all of the then-outstanding equity of New BellRing and New BellRing indebtedness (the “BellRing Separation”). New BellRing will convert into a Delaware corporation, and Post will then distribute at least 80.1% of its shares of New BellRing common stock to Post shareholders in a pro-rata distribution, an exchange offer or a combination of both, depending on market conditions. Upon completion of the distribution of New BellRing common stock to Post shareholders (the “BellRing Distribution”), BellRing Merger Sub Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of New BellRing, will merge with and into BellRing (the “BellRing Merger”), with BellRing as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of New BellRing. Pursuant to the BellRing Merger, each outstanding share of BellRing Class A Common Stock will be converted into one share of New BellRing common stock plus a to-be-determined amount of cash per share. The exact amount of cash consideration will be determined in accordance with the Transaction Agreement based upon several factors, including the amount of New BellRing indebtedness to be issued. Immediately following the BellRing Distribution and the BellRing Merger, it is expected that Post will own no more than 14.2% of the New BellRing common stock and Post shareholders will own at least 57.0% of the New BellRing common stock. Legacy holders of BellRing Class A Common Stock will own approximately 28.8% of the New BellRing common stock, maintaining their current effective ownership in the BellRing business. Post expects to use the New BellRing indebtedness and shares of New BellRing common stock to repay creditors of Post. Completion of the BellRing Separation, the BellRing Distribution and the BellRing Merger is anticipated to occur in the first calendar quarter of 2022, the second quarter of fiscal 2022, subject to certain customary closing conditions, although there can be no assurance that these transactions will occur within the expected timeframe or at all.
For additional information regarding the above-mentioned transactions, refer to “Risk Factors” within Item 1A of this report.
On May 28, 2021, Post and Post Holdings Partnering Corporation (“PHPC”), a newly formed special purpose acquisition company (a “SPAC”), consummated the initial public offering of 30.0 million units of PHPC (the “PHPC Units”), of which PHPC Sponsor, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Post (“PHPC Sponsor”), purchased 4.0 million PHPC Units. On June 3, 2021, PHPC issued an additional 4.5 million PHPC Units pursuant to the underwriters’ exercise in full of their over-allotment option. The term “PHPC IPO” as used herein generally refers to the consummation of the initial public offering on May 28, 2021 and the underwriters’ exercise in full of their over-allotment option on June 3, 2021. Each PHPC Unit consists of one share of Series A common stock of PHPC, $0.0001 par value per share (“PHPC Series A Common Stock), and one-third of one redeemable warrant of PHPC, each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of PHPC Series A Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share (the “PHPC Warrants”). The PHPC IPO generated gross proceeds to PHPC of $345.0 million. The PHPC Units, PHPC Series A Common Stock and PHPC Warrants each trade on the NYSE under the ticker symbols “PSPC.U”, “PSPC” and PSPC WS”, respectively. Under the terms of the PHPC IPO, PHPC is required to consummate a partnering transaction within 24 months (or 27 months under certain circumstances) of the completion of the PHPC IPO.
In connection with the completion of the initial public offering on May 28, 2021, PHPC also entered into a forward purchase agreement with PHPC Sponsor (the “Forward Purchase Agreement”), providing for the purchase by PHPC Sponsor, at the election of PHPC, of up to 10.0 million units of PHPC (the “PHPC Forward Purchase Units”), subject to the terms and conditions of the Forward Purchase Agreement, with each PHPC Forward Purchase Unit consisting of one share of PHPC’s Series B common stock, $0.0001 par value per share, and one-third of one warrant to purchase one share of PHPC Series A Common Stock, for a purchase price of $10.00 per PHPC Forward Purchase Unit, in an aggregate amount of up to $100.0 million in a private placement to occur concurrently with the closing of PHPC’s partnering transaction. 
In addition, substantially concurrently with the closing of the initial public offering on May 28, 2021, PHPC completed the private sale of 1.0 million units of PHPC (the “PHPC Private Placement Units”), at a purchase price of $10.00 per PHPC Private Placement Unit, to PHPC Sponsor, and in connection with the underwriters’ exercise in full of their option to purchase additional PHPC Units, PHPC Sponsor purchased an additional 0.1 million PHPC Private Placement Units, generating proceeds to PHPC of $10.9 million (the “PHPC Private Placement”). The PHPC Private Placement Units sold in the PHPC Private Placement are identical to the PHPC Units sold in the PHPC IPO, except that, with respect to the warrants underlying the PHPC Private Placement Units (the “PHPC Private Placement Warrants”) that are held by PHPC Sponsor or its permitted transferees, such PHPC Private Placement Warrants (i) may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis, (ii) are not subject to being called for redemption (except in certain circumstances when the PHPC Warrants are called for redemption and a certain price per share of PHPC Series A Common Stock threshold is met) and (iii) subject to certain limited exceptions, will be subject to transfer restrictions until 30 days following the consummation of PHPC’s partnering transaction. If the PHPC Private Placement Warrants are held by holders other than PHPC Sponsor or its permitted transferees, the PHPC Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by PHPC in all redemption scenarios and exercisable by holders on the same basis as the PHPC Warrants.
Proceeds of $345.0 million were deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of PHPC’s public stockholders consisting of certain proceeds from the PHPC IPO and certain proceeds from the PHPC Private Placement, net of underwriters’ discounts and commissions and other costs and expenses. The public stockholders of PHPC Series A Common Stock will be entitled in certain circumstances to redeem their shares of PHPC Series A Common Stock for a pro rata portion of the amount in the trust account at $10.00 per share of PHPC Series A Common Stock held, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to PHPC to pay income taxes.
In addition, Post, through PHPC Sponsor’s ownership of 8.6 million shares of Series F common stock of PHPC, $0.0001 par value per share (“PHPC Series F Common Stock”), has certain governance rights in PHPC. These rights include that, prior to PHPC’s partnering transaction, only holders of PHPC’s Series F Common Stock have the right to vote on the election of PHPC’s directors, as well as certain class voting rights regarding amendments of PHPC’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation.
As of September 30, 2021, Post beneficially owned 31.0% of the equity of PHPC and the net income and net assets of PHPC were consolidated within Post’s financial statements. The remaining 69.0% of the consolidated net income and net assets of PHPC, representing the percentage of economic interest in PHPC held by the public stockholders of PHPC through their ownership of PHPC equity, were allocated to redeemable noncontrolling interest. PHPC intends to partner with a company in the consumer products industry that complements the experience and expertise of Post’s management team and is a business to which Post believes it can add value.
For additional information regarding the PHPC IPO and related transactions, refer to “Risk Factors” within Item 1A of this report and Note 4 within “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in Item 8 of this report.
On October 1, 2018, 8th Avenue was separately capitalized by Post and third parties through a series of transactions (the “8th Avenue Formation Transactions”), and 8th Avenue became the holding company for Post’s private brand food products business, which was historically reported as Post’s Private Brands segment. After completion of the 8th Avenue Formation Transactions, Post retained 60.5% of the common equity in 8th Avenue, which, effective October 1, 2018, is accounted for using the equity method and is no longer consolidated in the Company’s financial statements. The private brands business was no longer considered a reportable segment of Post as of October 1, 2018. For additional information regarding 8th Avenue, refer to Notes 4 and 7 within “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in Item 8 of this report. 8th Avenue primarily manufactures and distributes private label peanut and other nut butters, pasta, dried fruit and nut products and granola.
COVID-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused and continues to cause global economic disruption and uncertainty, including in our business. We continue to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and developments related thereto and to focus on protecting the health and safety of our employees, including their economic health, maintaining the continuity of our supply chain to serve customers and consumers and preserving financial liquidity to navigate the uncertainty caused by the pandemic. As the overall economy continues to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, labor shortages, input and freight inflation and other supply chain disruptions, including input availability (and, with respect to our BellRing Brands segment, equipment delays), are pressuring our supply chain in all of our segments, resulting in missed sales and higher manufacturing costs, most notably in our Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail segments. Lower than anticipated production and delays in capacity expansion across the broader third party shake contract manufacturer network have resulted in low inventories and missed sales in our BellRing Brands segment. Service levels and fill rates remain below normal levels, and inventories are low, resulting in the placement of certain products on allocation. For additional discussion regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our businesses and financial results, see “Sales, Marketing and Distribution” below and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 and “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this report. Also, refer to “Human Capital - COVID-19 Response” below for information regarding actions we have taken on behalf of our employees.
Our Business Model
We operate a decentralized, adaptive business model, which provides us with flexibility to pursue acquisitions and other strategic transactions. Since our formation, we have expanded and established new platforms through numerous acquisitions. Our acquisition strategy has focused on businesses with product offerings that can strengthen our current portfolio, enable us to expand into complementary categories, geographic regions or distribution channels or provide diversification of cash flows in similar channels. In addition to acquisitions, we also have pursued and completed other types of strategic transactions. For example, we separately capitalized 8th Avenue with third parties, facilitated the completion of the BellRing IPO and the PHPC IPO and announced the signing of a transaction agreement to distribute a significant portion of our interest in BellRing to Post’s shareholders. 
Our Businesses
Post Consumer Brands 
Our Post Consumer Brands segment includes our North America cereal business which manufactures, markets and sells branded and private label RTE cereal and hot cereal products. According to NielsenIQ’s Total U.S. expanded All Outlets Combined (“xAOC”) information, the category was approximately $8.4 billion in sales for the 52-week period ended October 30, 2021 (“NielsenIQ’s Total U.S. xAOC information”). We have leveraged the strength of our brands, category expertise and over a century of institutional knowledge to create a diverse portfolio of cereals. Post Consumer Brands is the third largest seller of RTE cereals in the United States (the “U.S.”) with a 19.3% branded share of retail dollar sales and a 22.1% branded share of retail pound sales, based on NielsenIQ’s Total U.S. xAOC information. NielsenIQ’s Total U.S. xAOC is representative of food, drug and mass merchandisers (including Walmart), some club retailers (including Sam’s Club and BJs), some dollar retailers (including Dollar General and Family Dollar) and military. Based on sales data for fiscal 2021, Post Consumer Brands’s core brands include the following RTE cereal brands: Honey Bunches of Oats, Pebbles, Great Grains, Grape-Nuts, Honeycomb and Malt-O-Meal. Post Consumer Brands’s brand portfolio also includes, among others, the RTE cereal brands of Oreo O’s and Mom’s Best, as well as the hot cereal brands of Malt-O-Meal hot wheat, CoCo Wheats, Better Oats and Mom’s Best oatmeal. In addition, Post Consumer Brands includes the natural and organic RTE cereal and snacking platform in both branded and private label of Weetabix NA, led by the Weetabix and Barbara’s brands, serving the natural and specialty channels and conventional retailers. Post Consumer Brands also markets and sells Peter Pan nut butters, which are co-manufactured by 8th Avenue. Post Consumer Brands’s products are primarily manufactured through a flexible production platform at nine owned facilities in the U.S. and Canada. 
Weetabix
Our Weetabix segment primarily markets and distributes branded and private label RTE cereal products. According to Nielsen’s ScanTrack data, the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”) cereals and breakfast drinks category was approximately £1.4 billion in sales for the 52-week period ended October 9, 2021 (“Nielsen’s ScanTrack data”). According to Nielsen’s ScanTrack data, Weetabix holds the number two overall position for branded manufacturers in the U.K. cereals and breakfast drinks category, the Weetabix brand, a core brand in Weetabix’s portfolio, holds the number one brand position in the U.K. cereals and breakfast drinks category and the Alpen brand, another core brand in Weetabix’s portfolio, was the number one muesli brand in the U.K. Nielsen’s ScanTrack data is representative of grocery, health and beauty and beverage purchases, collating data from, among others, major grocery stores, independent grocery chains, convenience stores and gas stations. Other brands in Weetabix’s portfolio include Weetos, Ready Brek and Weetabix On The Go. Weetabix’s products are primarily manufactured at three owned manufacturing facilities in the U.K. Weetabix’s main markets are the U.K. and the Republic of Ireland, where Weetabix has deep relationships with all key retailers and key players in wholesale and foodservice. Weetabix distributes products to multiple countries throughout the world mainly through a network of third party distributors in the respective markets. Weetabix also has a physical presence in the emerging markets of China and Hong Kong, mainly served through the eCommerce channel. Additionally, Weetabix has operations in Africa through two joint ventures, each of which owns a manufacturing facility.
Cereal and granola products sold by our Post Consumer Brands and Weetabix segments together contributed 37.5% to our consolidated revenue for fiscal 2021. For additional information regarding our net sales by product, refer to Note 22 within “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in Item 8 of this report. 
Foodservice
Through our Foodservice segment, we primarily produce and distribute egg and potato products in the foodservice and food ingredient channels. We provide a broad portfolio of egg products under several brands, with the primary brands being Papetti’s and Abbotsford Farms, and potato products under several brands, with the primary brand being Simply Potatoes; the primary brands were determined based on sales data for fiscal 2021. The Foodservice segment also manufactures certain meat products. Our operations include sixteen egg products production facilities in the U.S., some of which are fully integrated, from the maintenance of laying flocks through the processing of egg products, potato processing facilities in Maine, Minnesota and Nevada, and meat products processing and production facilities in Nebraska. Several of these production facilities also produce products for our Refrigerated Retail segment.
Refrigerated Retail
Through our Refrigerated Retail segment, we produce and distribute side dishes, eggs and egg products, sausage, cheese and other dairy and refrigerated products to retail customers. Our refrigerated side dish, potato and sausage products are sold primarily under the Bob Evans, Bob Evans Farms and Simply Potatoes brands; processing facilities for these products are located in Michigan, Ohio and Texas, as well as Maine and Minnesota, which are referenced in the Foodservice segment discussion above. Our egg products are chiefly sold under the Bob Evans Egg Whites brand, which are produced at facilities located in Arizona, Illinois, Minnesota, Nebraska and New Jersey, which also produce products for our Foodservice segment, as well as the Egg Beaters brand, which are manufactured under a co-manufacturing agreement at a third party facility. Our cheese and other dairy case products are sold principally under the Crystal Farms brand. In addition to utilizing third party manufacturers, we operate a facility in Wisconsin that processes and packages various cheese products for the Crystal Farms brand and for private label customers. 
Eggs and egg products sold by our Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail segments together contributed 25.0% to our consolidated revenue for fiscal 2021. For additional information regarding our net sales by product, refer to Note 22 within “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in Item 8 of this report. 
BellRing Brands 
Our BellRing Brands segment markets and distributes RTD protein shakes, other RTD beverages, powders and nutrition bars in the convenient nutrition category. BellRing Brands’s primary brands based on fiscal 2021 sales data are Premier Protein and Dymatize. The BellRing Brands segment’s products are primarily manufactured under co-manufacturing agreements at various third party facilities located in the U.S. and Europe. BellRing Brands also owns a facility in Germany that manufactures bars and gels primarily for the European Union (the “E.U.”), Switzerland and U.K. markets. Our BellRing Brands products are primarily sold in the club, food, drug and mass and eCommerce channels, as well as the specialty and convenience channels. 
Protein-based products and supplements contributed 20.0% to our consolidated revenue for fiscal 2021. For additional information regarding our net sales by product, refer to Note 22 within “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in Item 8 of this report.
Sales, Marketing and Distribution
Each of our businesses has developed marketing strategies specific to its product lines. For certain of our products, we have consumer-targeted marketing campaigns, which generally include television, digital and print advertisements, coupon offers, rebate programs, co-marketing arrangements with complementary consumer product and entertainment companies and joint advertising with select retail customers. We also generally use print and digital advertising, social media and billboards, as well as more targeted grass roots programs such as sampling events and business drops, in order to increase brand awareness and loyalty at both national and local levels. Our internet and social media efforts are used to educate consumers about the nutritional value and flavor profiles of our products and for product promotion and consumer entertainment.
Our Post Consumer Brands segment sells products primarily through an internal sales staff and broker organizations. Our Weetabix segment services its key U.K. markets through a centralized commercial team which manages relationships with customers at the corporate level while a third party sales force operates at the store level to ensure maximum availability and compliance with agreed plans. Weetabix has in-country sales and marketing teams in the growth markets of Spain, the United Arab Emirates and China, and it also services emerging markets, such as China and Hong Kong, through the eCommerce channel. Our Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail segments sell and market their products primarily through dedicated teams of internal sales staff and broker organizations. Our BellRing Brands segment uses a flexible sales model that combines a national and international direct sales force, broker network and distributors. 
Generally, our products are distributed through a network of third party common carriers. In addition, our Refrigerated Retail segment has internal fleets that distribute certain of its products.
Demand for our products is impacted by changes in consumer behaviors and preferences, and we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, changes in consumer consumption patterns as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures that have been and are being taken by governments, businesses, including us, and the public at large to limit the spread, variants and resurgences of COVID-19. Our products sold through retail channels generally experienced an uplift in sales starting in March 2020 and continuing through the first half of fiscal 2021, driven by increased at-home consumption in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, most of our retail categories exhibited a mix shift to premium products. In the second half of fiscal 2021, most of our retail channel product categories trended toward growth rates in line with their pre-pandemic levels. At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, our foodservice business was significantly impacted by lower away-from-home demand resulting from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on various channels, including full service restaurants, quick service restaurants, education and travel and lodging. Since then, the recovery of our foodservice volumes has been closely tracking with changes in the degree of restrictions on mobility and gathering. Volumes in certain channels and product categories have nearly fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels. Volumes in other channels impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic have recovered from low levels experienced at the height of the pandemic, but have recently plateaued at levels below pre-pandemic volumes. In the aggregate, overall foodservice volumes remain below pre-pandemic levels. Our BellRing Brands segment’s primary categories returned to growth rates in line with their pre-pandemic levels in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and have remained strong in subsequent periods. We continue to actively monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our businesses; however, we are unable to accurately predict the future impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have due to various uncertainties, including the duration, severity and spread of COVID-19, actions that may be taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic, the availability and adoption of effective treatments and vaccines, changes in consumer behaviors and preferences and the impact on our supply chain, operations, workforce and the financial markets.
Research and Development
Our research and development efforts span our business segments. These capabilities extend to ingredients, packaging technologies, product sizes and delivery formats; new product and process development, as well as analytical support; bench-top and pilot plant capabilities; and research support to operations.
Raw Materials and Energy
Raw materials used in our businesses (purchased from local, regional and international suppliers) consist of ingredients and packaging materials. The principal ingredients for most of our businesses are agricultural commodities, including wheat, oats, rice, corn, other grain products, vegetable oils, dairy- and vegetable-based proteins, sugar and other sweeteners, fruit and nuts. Additionally, the principal ingredients for the Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail businesses are eggs, pork, pasta, potatoes, cheese, milk and butter. A portion of our egg needs comes from Company-owned layer hens, and the balance is purchased under third party contracts and in the spot market. We also buy significant amounts of grain to feed layer hens. In addition, we procure live sows at prevailing market prices from terminals, local auctions, country markets and corporate and family farms in various U.S. locations. Each of our segments utilizes raw material sources that ensure that its products meet standards and certification requirements, where applicable, for example, non-GMO, organic, gluten-free and/or cage-free. The principal packaging materials used by our businesses are folding cartons, corrugated boxes, flexible and rigid plastic film, trays and containers, beverage packaging, and aseptic foil and plastic lined cartonboard. 
Supply availability and prices paid for raw materials can fluctuate widely due to external factors, such as pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic) and other outbreaks of contagious diseases, weather conditions, feed costs, labor shortages, labor disputes, governmental programs, regulations and trade and tariff policies, industry consolidation, economic climate, energy shortages, transportation delays, commodity market prices, currency fluctuations and other unforeseen circumstances, such as avian influenza and diseases affecting livestock, which could affect the domestic poultry industry and our egg supply and our sow supply, respectively. We continuously monitor worldwide supply and cost trends of these raw materials to enable us to take appropriate action to obtain ingredients and packaging needed for production. 
Cereal processing ovens and most of the Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail production facilities generally are fueled by natural gas, which is obtained from local utilities or other local suppliers. Electricity and steam (generated in on-site, gas-fired boilers) also are used in our manufacturing facilities. Short-term standby propane storage exists at several facilities for use in the event of an interruption in natural gas supplies. In addition, considerable amounts of diesel fuel are used in connection with the distribution of our products, including in our internal fleet. Refrigerated Retail also uses large quantities of carbon dioxide as a cooling agent during its sausage production. Weetabix owns and operates its own combined heat and power generation unit, which is capable of supplying the majority of the requirements of its main operation site with power and steam which means the site can be operated using either electricity or natural gas.
Trademarks and Intellectual Property
We own or have long-term licenses to use a number of trademarks that are critical to the success of our businesses. Our Post Consumer Brands business’s trademarks include Post®, Post Consumer Brands®, Honey Bunches of Oats®, Great Grains®, Post® Bran Flakes, Post® Shredded Wheat, Spoon Size® Shredded Wheat, Golden Crisp®, Alpha-Bits®, Ohs!®, Shreddies™, Post® Raisin Bran, Grape-Nuts®, Honeycomb®, Frosted Mini Spooners®, Golden Puffs®, Cinnamon Toasters®, Fruity Dyno-Bites®, Cocoa Dyno-Bites®, Berry Colossal Crunch®, Malt-O-Meal®, Farina™, Dyno-Bites®, Mom’s Best®, Better Oats®, CoCo Wheats®, Peter Pan®, Weetabix®, Barbara’s® and Puffins®, each of which we own, as well as several trademarks that our Post Consumer Brands business licenses from third parties or our BellRing Brands business for use in the U.S., Canada and several other international markets, such as Pebbles®, Oreo O’s®, Chips Ahoy!®, Honeymaid®, Premier Protein® and Dunkin’®. Our Weetabix segment’s trademarks include Weetabix®, Alpen®, Weetos™, Ready Brek™, Weetabix On The Go™ and Oatibix®, each of which we own, as well as Oreo O’s®, which we license from a third party. The trademarks for the Foodservice business include Michael Foods™, Papetti’s®, Abbotsford Farms®, Simply Potatoes®, Willamette Egg Farms®, Henningsen Foods™ and Almark Foods™, each of which we own, and Just® Egg, which we license for use in North America. The trademarks for the Refrigerated Retail business include Davidson’s Safest Choice®, Abbotsford Farms®, Better’n Eggs®, Crystal Farms®, Simply Potatoes®, Diner’s Choice®, Westfield Farms®, David’s Deli®, Crescent Valley®, Owens®, Country Creek Farm® and Egg Beaters®, each of which we own, and Bob Evans® (which is used in brands such as Bob Evans® Egg Whites), Bob Evans Farms® and Pineland Farms®, which we license for worldwide use. Our BellRing Brands segment’s trademarks include BellRing®, BellRing Brands®, Premier Protein®, Premier Nutrition®, Dymatize®, ISO.100®, PowerBar® and Joint Juice®, each of which we own, as well as several trademarks that our BellRing Brands business licenses from third parties or our Post Consumer Brands business, such as Dunkin® and Pebbles®. We also own the trademark for Airly® and have submitted an application for the trademark Oat Clouds™. Our owned trademarks are, in most cases, protected through registration in the U.S. or the U.K., as well as in many other countries where the related products are sold. 
We also own several patents in North America and elsewhere. While our patent portfolio as a whole is material to our business, no one patent or group of related patents is material to our business. In addition, we have proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how processes and other intellectual property rights that are not registered.
We rely on a combination of trademark law, copyright law, trade secrets, non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements, provisions in other agreements and other measures to establish and protect our proprietary rights to our products, packaging, processes and intellectual property.
Seasonality
Demand for certain of our products may be influenced by holidays, changes in seasons or other events, which may impact customer and consumer spending patterns and the timing of promotional activities. For example, demand for our egg products, potatoes, sausage, side dishes, butter and cheese tends to increase during the Thanksgiving, Christmas, Easter and other holiday seasons, which may result in increased net sales during the first and third quarters of our fiscal year. Demand for our Malt-O-Meal hot wheat, Better Oats oatmeal and Ready Brek hot oats cereals also tends to be seasonably skewed towards the colder winter season. Demand for various products in our BellRing Brands business tends to be lower during our first fiscal quarter as a result of the holiday season. However, on a consolidated basis our revenues and results of operations generally are distributed relatively evenly over the quarters of our fiscal year. For a discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which impacted demand trends for fiscal 2020 and 2021, refer to “COVID-19 Pandemic” above.

We sell Post Consumer Brands products primarily to grocery stores, mass merchandise customers, supercenters, club stores, natural/specialty stores and drug store customers. We also sell Post Consumer Brands products in the military, eCommerce and foodservice channels. Our Weetabix segment’s products are primarily sold to grocery stores, discounters, wholesalers and convenience stores and through eCommerce.

Competition
The consumer food and beverage and convenient nutrition categories in which we operate are highly competitive and highly sensitive to both pricing and promotion. Competition is based on, among other things, brand recognition and loyalty, taste, nutritional value, price, ingredients, product quality, variety, innovation, distribution, packaging, convenience, effective promotional activities and the ability to identify and satisfy dynamic, emerging consumer preferences. Our principal competitors in these categories may have substantial financial, marketing and other resources. In addition, in many of our product categories, we compete not only with widely advertised branded products, but also with private label and store brand products. Our principal strategies for competing in each of our segments include effective customer relationship management, category insights, superior product quality and food safety, product innovation, an efficient supply chain and competitive pricing. The industries in which we operate are expected to remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future.
Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters
We are subject to regulation by federal, state, local and foreign governmental entities and agencies. Our activities in Canada and Europe are subject to regulations similar to those applicable to our business in the U.S. As a producer and distributor of goods for human consumption, our operations must comply with stringent production, storage, distribution, labeling and marketing standards administered by the applicable government entities, namely the Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (the “USDA”), the Federal Trade Commission and state and local agencies in the U.S., as well as similar regulatory agencies in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., the E.U. and elsewhere. Products that do not meet regulatory standards may be considered to be adulterated and/or misbranded and subject to recall. Additionally, following the adoption of the Food Safety Modernization Act in the U.S. and the Safe Foods for Canadians Act in Canada, the 
FDA and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency are implementing additional regulations focused on prevention of food contamination, more frequent inspection of high-risk facilities, increased record-keeping and improved tracing of food. 
Our facilities, like those of similar businesses, are subject to certain safety regulations, including regulations issued pursuant to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act and similar regulations in Canada, the U.K. and Germany. These regulations require us to comply with certain safety standards to protect our employees. Further, certain of our Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail operations are subject to laws that mandate specific housing requirements for layer hens and mandate specific space requirements for farm animal enclosures, including layer hens and pigs, which laws may vary on a state to state basis. As a company with international operations, we also are subject to laws, rules and regulations in the U.S. and other countries related to anti-corruption, antitrust and competition, economic sanctions and imports/exports. 
In addition, our operations are subject to various federal, state and foreign laws and regulations regarding data privacy, including the General Data Protection Regulation, the E.U.’s retained law version of the General Data Protection Regulation and the California Privacy Rights Act, each of which applies to certain of our businesses and deals with the collection and use of personal information obtained from data subjects. Our operations also are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations with respect to environmental matters, including air quality, noise, wastewater pretreatment and discharge, storm water, waste handling and disposal and other regulations intended to protect public health and the environment.
We have made, and will continue to make, expenditures to ensure and enhance environmental compliance. While the impact of compliance with laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations, cannot be predicted with certainty, we currently expect that our Refrigerated Retail and Foodservice segments will incur, or continue to incur, material capital expenditures in future fiscal years to comply with recently enacted state laws regulating housing and space requirements for layer hens.
Human Capital
The Company and its consolidated subsidiaries have approximately 10,735 employees as of November 1, 2021, of which approximately 8,970 are in the U.S., approximately 1,005 are in the U.K., approximately 430 are in Canada and approximately 330 are located in other jurisdictions. As of November 1, 2021, approximately 17% of such employees were unionized. We have entered into several collective bargaining agreements on terms that we believe are typical for the industries in which we operate. Most of the unionized workers at our facilities are represented under contracts which expire at various times throughout the next several years. In general, as these agreements expire, we believe that the agreements can be renegotiated on terms satisfactory to us. Any new collective bargaining agreements could result in changes to our cost structure at the relevant facilities. We believe that overall we have good relationships with employees and their representative organizations. Approximately 60 employees at our Weetabix facilities are currently engaged in a strike due to announced changes to shift patterns and related pay rates. There is no guarantee that we will reach an agreement with the union representing these employees in a timely manner, and although production has not been materially impacted at these facilities, if an agreement is not reached, we could experience interruption in production at these facilities.
Our people are critical to our success. While each of our businesses generally operates autonomously to implement its strategies with respect to its employees, our organization aligns to provide a safe, rewarding and respectful workplace where our people are provided with opportunities to pursue career paths based on their skills, performance and potential. We adhere to our Code of Conduct, which sets forth a commitment to our stakeholders, including our employees, to operate with integrity and mutual respect.
Health and Safety
We are committed to maintaining a healthy and safe workplace for our employees. We have a comprehensive safety and risk management system in place that incorporates rigorous safety standards and practices, employee and leadership training to ensure consistent implementation of our safety protocols and periodic internal and external audits to evaluate our compliance with such policies. Through regular communications between safety teams and leaders, we strive to continuously improve and update our safety protocols and practices. Our senior leadership team and our Board of Directors receive periodic updates regarding the performance of our safety and risk management system and our risk mitigation activities. 
Talent Acquisition, Development, Engagement and Retention
Acquiring, developing, engaging and retaining a diverse and talented workforce is key to accomplishing our goals and achieving business results. 
In recent years, we have taken steps to enhance our talent acquisition processes across the enterprise, including implementing diversity training for recruiters, employee training on interview skills and processes to improve our candidate selection process to promote more diversity among our employees. We also have updated our careers websites and increased community outreach to enable us to reach a wider audience of candidates.
Providing development opportunities and resources for our employees is another key factor in our human capital strategy. We offer a variety of training and development programs for employees at all levels of our organization. In addition, we leverage our learning management system for individual development plans and offer a large catalog of training resources, ranging from technical skills to communication and feedback. We also provide robust compliance and safety training for our employees. 
We engage with our employees through regular engagement surveys and then act on those survey results, as needed. Employee-led groups, opportunities to participate in informal wellness activities and philanthropic work are informed by what our employees identify as important to them. We measure our progress and take additional actions, as needed. Transparent communications about the Company keep our employees informed. 
Our compensation and benefits teams strive to develop and implement policies and programs that support our business goals, maintain competitiveness, promote shared fiscal responsibility among the Company and our employees, strategically align talent within our organization and reward performance, while also managing the costs of such policies and programs. We provide our employees with competitive fixed and/or variable pay, and for eligible employees we currently provide access to medical, dental and life insurance benefits, disability coverage, 401(k) plans or programs and employee assistance programs, among other benefits, through our Total Rewards program.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
We are dedicated to creating an inclusive environment that reflects the communities in which we live and work. During fiscal 2020, we formed a Diversity and Inclusion Council with representation from both our holding company and each of our businesses, the aim of which is to develop strategies and guidelines, establish objectives for diversity, equity and inclusion (“DE&I”) and create tools that can be used to align efforts and monitor and track progress. 
COVID-19 Response
During fiscal 2021, as the COVID-19 pandemic has persisted, we have continued to prioritize the health, safety and well-being of our employees, including their economic health. Throughout the pandemic, we have adhered to our infectious disease preparedness and response plans, which have continually been reviewed and updated as the COVID-19 pandemic has evolved. Many of the safety measures implemented in fiscal 2020 were also utilized in fiscal 2021. At various points during fiscal 2021, these measures have included, where practicable: practicing social distancing, installing physical barriers in our manufacturing facilities and offices where social distancing was not possible, installing touchless (hands-free) appliances, deep cleaning our facilities, staggering break times and shift changes at our manufacturing locations, providing personal protective equipment, encouraging hygiene practices advised by health authorities, restricting business travel and site visitors, improving air handling units with ionization technology in our offices and implementing remote working for certain office employees. In addition, we continued to utilize third party service providers to provide on-the-ground nurses, testing and protection to our employees. We also held over 25 on-site vaccination events at our facilities. As federal, state, local and international regulations and guidelines continue to evolve, we continue to enhance our practices to remain aligned with such regulations and guidelines. Moreover, at various points during the COVID-19 pandemic, including during portions of fiscal 2021, we provided regular compensation and benefits to employees who had COVID-19, had to quarantine due to COVID-19 exposure, were awaiting COVID-19 test results or needed to provide care for their families due to COVID-19.
