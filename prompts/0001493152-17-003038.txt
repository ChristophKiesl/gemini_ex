Business Overview
 
Barfresh is a leader in the creation, manufacturing and distribution of ready to blend frozen beverages. The current portfolio of products includes smoothies, shakes and frappes. All of the products are portion controlled and ready to blend beverage ingredient packs or “beverage packs”. The beverage packs contain all of the solid ingredients necessary to make the beverage, including the base (either sorbet, frozen yogurt or ice cream), real fruit pieces, juices and ice – five ounces of water are added before blending.
 
Domestic and international patents and patents pending are owned by Barfresh, as well as related trademarks for all of the products. In November 2011, the Company acquired the patent rights in the United States and Canada. The Canadian patent has been granted and the United States patent was granted on August 16, 2016. On October 15, 2013, the Company acquired all of the related international patent rights, which were filed pursuant to the Patent Cooperation Treaty and have been granted in 13 jurisdictions. The patents are pending in the remainder of the jurisdictions that have signed the treaty. In addition, on October 15, 2013, the Company purchased all of the trademarks related to the patented products.
 
The Company has conducted sales through two channels: National Accounts, and through an exclusive nationwide distribution agreement with Sysco Corporation (“Sysco”), the U.S.’s largest broadline distributor, which was entered into during July 2014.
 
The process of obtaining sales orders for National Accounts generally follows several steps, including product demonstration, product testing, and exclusive flavor development for the larger National Accounts. We are currently in various stages of product development and testing with a number of National Accounts, having recently launched in market tests with several major National Key accounts, and is focused on moving from in-market tests to national roll-out with those major National Key accounts.
 
On July 6th, 2016, the Company announced that it had signed a supply agreement with a major global on-site foodservice operator. The agreement, which marked the culmination of a successful in market test conducted at several locations, makes Barfresh’s suite of blended beverages available across the customer’s diverse customer base in its education, healthcare, sports and entertainment, and business government channels, in the US and Canada representing over 2,000 potential accounts.

In addition to the National Accounts, the Company sells to food distributors that supply products to the food services market place. Effective July 2, 2014, the Company entered into an exclusive agreement with Sysco Merchandising and Supply Chain Services, Inc. for resale by the Sysco Corporation (“Sysco”) to the foodservice industry of the Company’s ready-to-blend smoothies, shakes and frappes. All Barfresh products will be included in Sysco’s national core selection of beverage items, making Barfresh its exclusive single-serve, pre-portioned beverage provider. The agreement is mutually exclusive; however, Barfresh may also sell the products to other foodservice distributors, but only to the extent required for such foodservice distributors to service multi-unit chain operators with at least 20 units and where Sysco is not such multi- unit chain operator’s nominated distributor for our products.
 
The Company’s products have been included in Sysco’s “Cutting Edge Solutions” (“CES”) Platform since March of 2016, and are once again included in Sysco’s most recent CES Platform, announced during February of 2017. As part of this platform, our products will receive national advertising and marketing, and will be considered a core product. All 72 of SYSCO’s OPCO’s will participate in the CES program, and will be evaluated on their success in moving the CES products.
 
On October 26, 2015, Barfresh signed an agreement with PepsiCo North America Beverages, a division of PepsiCo, to become its exclusive sales representative within the food service channel to present Barfresh’s line of ready-to-blend smoothies and frozen beverages throughout the United States and Canada. Through this agreement, Barfresh’ products will be included as part of PepsiCo’s offerings to its significant customer base. The agreement facilitates access to potential National customer accounts, through introductions provided by PepsiCo’s one-thousand plus person foodservice sales team. Barfresh products have become part of PepsiCo’s customer presentations at national trade shows and similar venues.
 
Finally, the Company intends to monetize the international patents outside of the current area of operations, North America, by expanding contract manufacturing to other countries and selling either through selling agents or internal sales personnel. The Company will also consider entering into some form of license or royalty agreements with third parties.
 
Barfresh currently utilizes contract manufacturers to manufacture all of the products in the United States. Production lines are currently operational at two locations. The first is in our Salt Lake City contract manufacturer location, which currently produces products sold to existing customers. Currently annual production capacity with this contract manufacturer is 14 million units per year. The second location is with Yarnell Operations, LLC., a subsidiary of Shulze and Burch, located in Arkansas. The Yarnell’s agreement, which was signed during February, 2016, secures additional production capacity ahead of expected sales growth. Barfresh will have the capacity to ramp up to an incremental production capacity of 100 million units through this agreement. Yarnell’s began shipping product for Barfresh during June of 2016. Yarnell’s location enhances the company’s ability to efficiently move product throughout the supply chain to destinations in the eastern United States, home to many of the country’s large foodservice outlets.
 
Although there currently is not a contract in place with any suppliers for the raw materials needed to manufacture our products, there are a significant number of sources available and the company does not anticipate becoming dependent on any one supplier. As demand for the range of our products grows, we plan to contract a level of raw material requirements to ensure continuity of supply.

Such shares were cancelled immediately following the acquisition. 
● | Financing transaction. Immediately following the acquisition of Barfresh, we sold an aggregate of 1,333,332 shares of our common stock and five-year warrants to purchase 1,333,332 shares of common stock at a per share exercise price of $1.50 in a private offering for gross proceeds of $999,998, less expenses of $26,895.

Strategic Investment by Unibel
 
During November, 2016, the Company received an equity investment from Unibel, the majority shareholder of the Bel Group (“Unibel”). The Bel Group is headquartered in Paris, France, with global operations in 33 countries, 30 production sites on 4 continents and nearly 12,000 employees. Its many branded products, including The Laughing Cow®, Mini Babybel® and Boursin®, are sold in over 130 countries around the world. Pursuant to the securities purchase agreement, Unibel purchased 15,625,000 shares of common stock at $0.64 per share (“Shares”) and warrants to purchase 7,812,500 shares of common stock (“Warrants”) for aggregate gross proceeds to Barfresh of $10 million. The Warrants are exercisable for a term of five years at a per share price of $.088 for cash. Pursuant to the Investor Rights agreement, Barfresh has registered the Shares and the Warrants, and Unibel was granted a seat on the Barfresh Board. This strategic investment provides Barfresh with the necessary capital to drive revenue growth while leveraging Unibel’s more than 150 years of industrial expertise, innovative capabilities, world-class marketing and branding expertise to accelerate our growth in new and existing markets and product channels

Research and Development
 
The Company incurred research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016, in the amount of $432,146, and for the year ended December 31, 2015 in the amount of $341,998. During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we re-classified certain personnel expenses that had previously been included in personnel expense, to Research and Development These expenses relate primarily to the services performed by our Director of Manufacturing and Product Development, and supporting consultant expenses. The re-classification is shown in both the current period and the prior period. The increase in Research and Development expenses was primarily attributable to increased activity in creating unique flavors for potential customers in our national account pipeline.

Competition
 
There is significant competition in the smoothie market at both the consumer purchasing level and also the product level.
 
The competition at the consumer level is primarily between specialized juice bars (e.g. Jamba Juice) and major fast casual and fast food restaurant chains (such as McDonalds). Barfresh does not compete specifically at this level but intends to supply its product to customers that fall within these segments to enable them to compete for consumer demand.
 
There may also be new entrants to the smoothie market that may alter the current competitor landscape.
 
The existing competition from a product perspective can be separated into three categories:
 

● | Specialized juice bar products: The product is made in-store and each ingredient is added separately. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Syrup based products: The fruit puree is supplied in bulk and not portion controlled for each smoothie. These types of products still require the addition of juice, milk or water and/or yogurt and ice. While there are a number of competitors for this style of product, the two dominant competitors are Island Oasis and Minute Maid. 
● | Portion pack products: These products contain only the fruit and yogurt and require the addition of juice or milk and ice. The two dominant competitors are General Mills’ Yoplait Smoothies and Inventure Group’s Jamba Smoothies. 

 
The Company believes that ease of use, portion control, premium quality, and minimal capital investment required to enable a customer to begin to carry Barfresh beverage products all add up to represent a very significant competitive advantage that will allow us to quickly gain traction in the market and secure long-term agreements with customers. However, there are other factors that may influence the adoption of a particular product by customers, including their dependence on prior relationships with competition.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Barfresh owns the domestic and intellectual property rights to its products’ sealed pack of ingredients.
 
In November 2011, the Company acquired patent applications filed in the United States (Patent Application number 11/660415) and Canada (Patent Application number 2577163) from certain related parties. The United States patent was issued on August 16, 2016. The Canadian patent was originally filed on August 16, 2005 and it has been granted.
 
On October 15, 2013, the Company acquired all of the related international patent rights, which were filed pursuant to the Patent Cooperation Treaty, have been granted in 13 jurisdictions and are pending in the remainder of the jurisdictions that have signed the PCT. In addition, the Company purchased all of the trademarks related to the patented products.

The Company is not aware of the need for any governmental approvals of its products.
 
The Company utilizes contract manufacturers. Before entering into any manufacturing contract, the Company determines that the manufacturer has met all government requirements.
 
The Company will be subject to certain labeling requirements as to the contents and nutritional information of our products.
