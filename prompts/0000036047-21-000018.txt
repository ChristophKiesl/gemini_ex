Item 1. Business
The Company
We are a leading global property information, analytics, data-enabled software platforms, and services provider operating in North America, Western Europe, and Asia Pacific. Our vision is to deliver unique property-level insights that power the global real estate economy. Our mission is to empower our clients to make smarter decisions through data-driven insights.
With our data as a foundation, we provide software platforms and value-added business services that address the unique needs of the mortgage, real estate, insurance, capital, and public sectors. The quality of our software platforms and services is distinguished by our broad range of data assets and our experience in aggregating, organizing, normalizing, processing, and delivering data on a large-scale basis. Our structured property-specific data, consisting of over 150 million parcel records, covers over 99% of the United States ("US"), includes both residential and commercial real estate data, and is enriched by over one billion historical sales, mortgages, and pre-foreclosure transactions. Our consortium data covers loan-level mortgage performance, appraisal, as well as mortgage application data and is in excess of 300 million records. We are also the industry's first parcel-based geocoder and have developed a proprietary spatial database covering more than 150 million parcel polygons across the US. These databases enable our clients to access detailed property insights, as well as data regarding current and historical mortgages, mortgage risk and portfolio performance, involuntary property liens and encumbrances, building construction and replacement costs, consumer credit, tenancy, location intelligence, hazards, and other natural risk factors.
We have more than one million end-users who rely on our data and predictive decision analytics to reduce risk, enhance transparency, and improve the performance of their businesses.
We offer our clients a comprehensive national database covering real property and mortgage information, judgments and liens, building and replacement costs, tax information, parcel and geospatial data, among other data types. Using these robust datasets, we have built strong value-added analytical capabilities and business services to meet our clients’ needs for property tax processing, property valuation, hazard risk, property risk and replacement cost, flood plain location determination, geospatial data, analytics, and related services.
As used herein, the terms "CoreLogic," the "Company," "we," "our" and "us" refer to CoreLogic, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries, except where it is clear that such terms refer only to CoreLogic, Inc. and not its subsidiaries. Our executive offices are located at 40 Pacifica, Irvine, California, 92618-7471, our telephone number is (949) 214-1000, and our website is www.corelogic.com.
Corporate Events
Merger Agreement
In February 2021, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (“Merger Agreement”) with Celestial-Saturn Parent Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Acquirer”), and Celestial-Saturn Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Acquirer (“Acquisition Sub”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, Acquisition Sub would be merged with and into CoreLogic (“Merger”), with CoreLogic continuing as the surviving corporation in the Merger and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Acquirer. The Acquirer and Acquisition Sub are affiliates of Stone Point Capital Partners and Insight Partners. If the Merger is consummated, CoreLogic’s securities will be de-listed from the New York Stock Exchange and de-registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”), as soon as practicable following the effective time of the Merger ("Effective Time").
In the event the Merger is completed, except as otherwise provided in the Merger Agreement, each share of common stock, par value $0.00001 per share, of CoreLogic issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time would be converted into the right to receive $80.00 per share in cash, without interest (“Merger Consideration”). Consummation of the Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including, among other things, the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock (“Requisite Stockholder Approval”). The consummation of the Merger is not subject to a financing condition, and the Acquirer has obtained equity and debt financing commitments for the purpose of financing the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Please refer to “Overview of Business Environment and Company Developments—Merger” in “Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Consolidated Results of Operations” and Note 21—Subsequent Events—Proposed Merger of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
On February 16, 2021, the Board received an unsolicited acquisition proposal from CoStar Group, Inc. ("CoStar") to acquire the Company in an all-stock transaction. The Board is carefully reviewing the proposal in consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors. The Merger Agreement remains in full force and effect, and the Board has not withdrawn or modified its recommendation that the stockholders of CoreLogic vote in favor of the approval of the Merger, the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.
Rights Agreement Amendment
In February 2021, in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, CoreLogic also entered into an amendment (“Rights Agreement Amendment”) to the Rights Agreement, dated as of July 6, 2020, by and between CoreLogic and Equiniti Trust Company, as rights agent (“Rights Agreement”), in order to (i) render the Rights Agreement inapplicable to the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (ii) ensure that in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, none of the Acquirer, Acquisition Sub, or any of their “Affiliates” or “Associates” (each as defined in the Rights Agreement) shall be deemed to be or become an “Acquiring Person” (as defined below) and (iii) provide that the “Expiration Date” (as defined in the Rights Agreement) shall occur immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Unsolicited Proposal and Proxy Contest
In June 2020, we received an unsolicited proposal from Senator Investment Group, LP (“Senator”) and Cannae Holdings, Inc. (“Cannae”) to acquire the Company for $65.00 per share in cash, which initial proposal was increased by Senator and Cannae on September 14, 2020 by $1.00 per share to $66.00 per share in cash (“Unsolicited Proposal”). In July 2020, our Board of Directors ("Board"), in consultation with its independent financial and legal advisors, unanimously determined to reject the Unsolicited Proposal. Senator and Cannae issued a press release announcing proposals to remove members of our Board and replace them with up to nine individuals nominated by Senator and Cannae and to amend certain provisions of our Bylaws (“Proxy Contest Proposals”). In August 2020, the Board determined to call a special meeting of CoreLogic’s stockholders to allow our stockholders to consider and vote on the Proxy Contest Proposals. A special meeting of our stockholders to vote on the Proxy Contest Proposals was held in November 2020, with a record date of September 18, 2020, resulting in the removal of three members of our Board and the appointment of three of Senator and Cannae's nominees to our Board, each with a term expiring at the Company's 2021 annual meeting of stockholders. In connection with the Unsolicited Proposal, Proxy Contest Proposals, and related strategic transaction process, we have incurred expenses of approximately $54.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Discontinued Operations
In July 2020, we announced our intention to exit our reseller operations focused on mortgage credit and borrower verification and multi-family tenant screening. Although market leaders in their respective business areas, these reseller businesses are not compatible with our long-term strategic imperatives. The divestiture of these operations is expected to improve our revenue growth trends and revenue mix, and significantly enhance profit margins. As a result of this strategic decision, the businesses have been reflected in our consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods presented. In October 2020, we sold a portion of our multi-family tenant screening business, which resulted in a gain on sale of discontinued operations of $2.7 million, net of tax. In February 2021 we sold the remainder of our multi-family tenant screening business for $51.2 million. Please refer to Note 18 - Discontinued Operations of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
Business Exits & Transformation within Continuing Operations
In December 2018, we announced our intent to exit a loan origination software unit and its remaining legacy default management related platforms, as well as accelerate an appraisal management company ("AMC") transformation program, which actions were focused on expanding our overall profit margins and providing for enhanced long-term organic growth trends. In September 2019, we divested our default management related platforms and received proceeds of $3.8 million. The AMC transformation was concluded in December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our operating revenues decreased by $61.9 million attributable to the aforementioned business exits and strategic transformation compared to 2018. We also recorded non-cash impairment charges of $47.8 million and severance expense of $5.3 million in 2019 relating to the AMC transformation program.
Acquisitions
We opportunistically acquire companies, businesses, products, and services to grow market share in the mortgage, real estate, insurance, capital, public sector, and rental property markets. We also identify opportunities that complement our strengths and/or diversify our exposure from the mortgage and real estate market.
In January 2020, we acquired the remaining 66% of Location, Inc. ("Location") for $11.5 million, subject to certain working capital adjustments. Location is a leading provider of geographic location indicators for crime and non-weather related events connected to underwriting risk assessment. This acquisition further progresses our long-term strategic plan by adding scale to our insurance and spatial businesses. Location is included as a component of our Property Intelligence & Risk Management Solutions ("PIRM") segment. 
During 2019, we completed the acquisition of National Tax Search, LLC ("NTS") for total net cash of approximately $13.2 million. This acquisition includes contingent consideration of up to $7.5 million to be paid in cash by 2022, contingent upon the achievement of certain revenue targets in fiscal years 2020 and 2021. NTS is a leading provider of commercial property tax payment services and specializes in identifying potential collateral loss related to unpaid property tax, homeowner's association fees, and inaccurate flood zone determinations. The NTS acquisition increases the Company's commercial property tax offerings and is expected to drive future growth in the US. 
See Note 17 - Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.
Dividend
In December 2019, we announced the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend to common shareholders. CoreLogic paid a cash dividend of $0.22 per share of common stock in January 2020 and June 2020 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on January 10, 2020 and June 1, 2020, respectively. In July 2020, our Board announced a 50% increase in our cash dividend and declared a $0.33 per share cash dividend to common stockholders, which was paid in September 2020 and December 2020 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on September 1, 2020 and December 1, 2020, respectively. In January 2021, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.33 per share of common stock to be paid in March 2021 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 1, 2021.
Financing Activities
In May 2019 we amended our credit agreement (as amended, the "Credit Agreement") with Bank of America, N.A., as the administrative agent, and other financial institutions. The Credit Agreement provides for a $1.8 billion five-year term loan facility (the "Term Facility"), and a $750.0 million five-year revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Facility"). The Term Facility matures, and the Revolving Facility expires, in May 2024. The Revolving Facility includes a $100.0 million multicurrency revolving sub-facility and a $50.0 million letter of credit sub-facility. The Credit Agreement also provides for the ability to increase the Term Facility and Revolving Facility by up to $300.0 million in the aggregate; however, the lenders are not obligated to do so. See Note 8 - Long Term Debt of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.
Technology Transformation
In September 2018, we announced the adoption of the Google Cloud Platform (“GCP”) as a foundational element of our ongoing technology transformation program to further expand infrastructure capabilities and drive efficiencies. We successfully completed the initial transformation phase, and will continue transitioning our technology over the foreseeable future on an opportunistic basis. The transition to GCP allows us to leverage the capabilities of the cloud platform to achieve best-in-class system performance and reliability and to facilitate the deployment of unique business insights fueled by gold-standard data, information, and analytics. Additionally, we expect to realize cost efficiencies and enhanced security as we continue the transition.
Our Data
Our data is the foundation of many of our products, platforms, and services, and can generally be categorized as property information, mortgage information, and consumer information. We obtain our data from a variety of sources, including but not limited to, data gathered from public sources, data contributed by our clients, and data obtained from other industry leading data aggregators.
We gather data from a variety of public sources, including electronic data and documents from federal, state, and local governments and enhance this information through advanced analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning ("AI/ML"), leveraging data we collect from non-public sources. This allows us to create comprehensive textual and geospatial views of each property within our coverage areas, including physical property characteristics, boundaries and tax values, current and historical ownership, voluntary and involuntary liens, tax assessments and delinquencies, replacement cost, property risk including environmental, flood, and hazard information, building permits, local trends, and nationwide summary statistics.
Specific agreements exist which govern data contributed to our consortium data assets by our clients. These contractual arrangements provide the necessary permissions to enable us to deliver solutions across several vertical markets using the client contributed data. We structure end-user agreements to consortium data solutions to acknowledge the specific uses of the data and to provide the required levels of data privacy and protection for the consortium contributors’ data. Consortium data includes loan performance information and appraisal information.
We acquire appraisal and property valuations from appraisers.
Business Segments
We have organized our business into the following two segments: Property Intelligence & Risk Management Solutions ("PIRM") and Underwriting & Workflow Solutions ("UWS"). 
We believe that we hold the leading market position for many of our solutions, including:
•property tax processing, based on the number of loans under service;
•flood zone determinations, based on the number of flood zone certification reports issued;
•property valuation and technology platform solutions, based on the number of in-house staff appraisers and inquiries received; and
•multiple listing services ("MLS"), based on the number of active desktops using our technology.
In addition to our two reporting segments, we also have a corporate group, which bears costs and expenses not allocated to our segments. More detailed financial information regarding each of our business segments is included in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations as well as Note 19 - Segment Information of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Solutions
Property Intelligence & Risk Management Solutions
Our PIRM segment delivers unique housing market and property-level insights, predictive analytics, and risk management capabilities. We have also developed proprietary technology and software platforms to access, automate, and track this information, as well as assist our clients with decision-making and compliance tools in the real estate and insurance industries. We deliver this information directly to our clients in a standard format over the web, through hosted software platforms or in bulk data form. Our solutions include property insights and insurance and spatial solutions in North America, Western Europe, and Asia Pacific. 
Our property insights combine our patented predictive analytics with our proprietary and contributed data to enable our clients to improve customer acquisition and retention, detect and prevent fraud, improve mortgage transaction cycle time and cost efficiency, identify real estate trends and neighborhood characteristics, track market performance, and increase market share. Our data is comprised of real estate information, incorporating crime data, site inspections, information about neighborhoods, document images, and other information from proprietary sources. Further, we maintain the leading market share of real estate listing software systems, which we provide to more than 50% of all US and Canadian real estate agents. We also provide a full range of professional services to listing organizations and assist our clients in identifying revenue opportunities and improving member services.
Our insurance and spatial solutions provide property and casualty insurers, energy, and other markets the ability to more effectively locate, assess, and manage property-level assets and risks through location-based data, property content, proprietary workflow solutions, and analytics. We maintain the industry's first parcel-based geocoder and an industry-leading parcel 
database covering more than 150 million parcels across the US, as well as critical and up-to-date information across multiple hazard databases including information on storm, land-based, fire, and even non-weather-related hazards. 
Underwriting & Workflow Solutions
Our UWS segment provides comprehensive mortgage origination and monitoring solutions, including underwriting-related solutions and data-enabled valuations and appraisals. We have also developed proprietary technology and software platforms to access, automate, and track this information, as well as assist our clients with vetting and on-boarding prospects, meeting compliance regulations, and understanding, evaluating, and monitoring property values. Our UWS solutions include property tax solutions, valuation solutions, and flood data solutions in North America.
Our property tax solutions are built from aggregated property tax information from over 20,000 taxing authorities. We use this information to advise mortgage originators and servicers of the property tax payment status of loans in their portfolio and to monitor that status over the life of the loans. If a mortgage lender requires tax payments to be impounded on behalf of its borrowers, we can also monitor and oversee the transfer of these funds to the taxing authorities and provide the lender with payment confirmation.
Our valuations solutions represent property valuation-related, data-driven services, and analytics combined with collateral valuation workflow technologies, which assist our clients in assessing risk of loss using both traditional and alternative forms of property valuation, driving process efficiencies, and ensuring compliance with lender and governmental regulations. We have been building collateral risk management models for more than 20 years and provide collateral information technology and solutions that automate property appraisal ordering, tracking, documentation, and review for lender compliance with government regulations.
Our flood data solutions provide flood zone determinations in accordance with the US Federal legislation passed in 1994, which requires that most mortgage lenders obtain a determination of the current flood zone status at the time each loan is originated and obtain applicable updates during the life of the loan. We provide flood zone determinations primarily to mortgage lenders.
Clients
Our clients are predominantly financial services institutions in the mortgage and insurance industries. We provide our solutions to national and regional mortgage lenders, servicers, brokers, credit unions, commercial banks, investment banks, fixed-income investors, real estate agents, MLS companies, real estate investment trusts, property and casualty insurance companies, government agencies, and government-sponsored enterprises.
Our more significant client relationships tend to be long-term in nature, and we typically provide a number of different solutions to each client. Because of the depth of these relationships, we derive a significant portion of our aggregate revenue from our largest clients, with 34.4%, 26.4%, and 32.0% of our operating revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, being generated by our ten largest clients. None of our clients individually accounted for greater than 10% of our operating revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.
Competition
We offer a diverse array of specialized products and services that compete directly and indirectly with similar products and services offered by national and local providers. We believe there is no single competitor who offers the same combination of products and services that we do. Therefore, we believe that we compete with a broad range of entities.
Our PIRM segment competes with entities that provide access to data or data-based analytics products and services as part of their product offerings, including Black Knight, Inc., which provides real estate information, analytics, valuation-related services, and other solutions; ATTOM Data, which provides public records data; First American Financial Corporation ("FAFC"), which provides real estate, home ownership and property data; as well as Verisk Analytics, Inc., which provides data and risk assessment in the insurance and financial services industries. We also compete with departments within financial institutions that utilize internal resources to provide similar analytics and services on a captive basis. We compete based on the breadth and quality of our data sets, the exclusive nature of some of our key data sets, the quality and effectiveness of our products, and the integration of our platforms into client systems. We believe the data we offer is distinguished by quality, the broad range of our data sources (including non-public sources), the volume of records we maintain, and our ability to provide data spanning a historical period of time that exceeds comparable data sets of most of our competitors.
Our UWS segment competes with third-party providers such as Black Knight, Inc. and Lereta LLC, which provide tax and flood solutions, as well as Clear Capital, Solidifi, and ServiceLink, which provide valuation-related services. For these services, we compete largely based on the quality of the products and services we provide, our ability to provide scalable services at competitive prices, and our ability to provide integrated platforms. We also compete with departments within financial institutions that utilize internal resources to provide similar services on a captive basis. We generally compete with captive providers based on the quality of our products and services, the scalability of our services, cost efficiencies, and our ability to provide some level of risk mitigation.
Sales and Marketing
Our sales strategy is client-focused and resources are primarily assigned based on client size and complexity. Several of our sales team members and subject matter experts specialize in specific solutions, products, and services. Each of our sales executives develops and maintains key relationships within each client’s business units and plays an important role in relationship management as well as developing new business. Our sales executives understand the current marketplace environment and demonstrate extensive knowledge of our clients’ internal operating structure and business needs. The depth and breadth of our relationships with our clients allows us to develop and implement solutions that are tailored to the specific needs of each client in a prompt and efficient manner.
Smaller clients, measured by revenue or geographic coverage, are primarily managed through our inside sales operations function which is responsible for working with mortgage and real estate brokers, smaller property and casualty insurance companies, fixed-income investors, appraisers, real estate agents, correspondents, and other lenders.
Several of our product and service lines have sales teams and subject matter experts who specialize in specific solutions, products, and services. These sales teams and subject matter experts work collaboratively with our sales executives and our inside sales operations to assist with client sales by combining our data, products, and data-enabled services to meet the specific needs of each client and may be assigned to assist with sales in targeted markets for certain categories of clients or for particular service groups.
Our marketing strategy is to accelerate growth by building trusted relationships with our clients and delivering superior value through unique property-related data, analytics, and data-enabled solutions. We use the most efficient methods available to successfully identify, target, educate, and engage potential and existing clients through their preferred channel of communication. Employing client-centric marketing initiatives and campaigns, we clearly articulate our value proposition to build awareness, familiarity and interest in our business solutions, demand for our products and services, as well as increase volume, quality, and velocity of sales opportunities. Our marketing activities include direct marketing, advertising, public relations, event marketing, digital marketing, social media, and other targeted activities.
Acquisitions and Divestitures
Historically, we have increased the scale of our existing businesses and entered new markets, products, and services through selective acquisitions that we believe strengthen our overall solution offerings and value proposition to clients. We continually evaluate our business mix and opportunistically seek to optimize our business portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures.
Intellectual Property
We own significant intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets. We consider our intellectual property to be proprietary and we rely on a combination of statutory (e.g., copyright, trademark, trade secret, and patent) and contractual safeguards in an intellectual property enforcement program to protect our intellectual property rights.
We have more than 50 issued patents in the US covering business methods, software, and systems patents, principally relating to automated valuation, fraud detection, data gathering, flood detection, MLS technology, and property monitoring. We also have at least 19 patent applications pending principally relating to these and other areas in the US. In addition, we have a number of issued patents and pending patent applications internationally, including in Canada and Australia. The protection of our proprietary technology is important to our success and we intend to continue to protect those intellectual property assets for which we have expended substantial research and development capital and which are material to our business.
In addition, we own more than 300 trademarks in the US and foreign countries, including the names of our products and services as well as our logos and tag lines, many of which are registered. Many of our trademarks, trade names, service marks, and logos are material to our business, as they assist our clients in identifying our products and services and the quality that stands behind them.
We own more than 1,000 registered and unregistered copyrights in the US and foreign countries, covering computer programs, reports, and manuals. We also have other literary works, including marketing materials, handbooks, presentations, and website content that are protected under common law copyright. We believe our written materials are essential to our business as they provide our clients with insight into various areas of the financial and real estate markets in which we operate.
Our research and development activities focus primarily on the design and development of our analytical tools, software applications, and data sets. We expect to continue our practice of investing in the development of new software applications and systems in response to the market and client needs we identify through client input collected in meetings, phone calls, and web surveys. We also assess opportunities to integrate existing data sets to enhance our products' effectiveness. 
In order to maintain control of our intellectual property, we enter into license agreements with our clients, granting rights to use our products and services, including our software and databases. We also audit our clients from time to time to ensure compliance with our agreements. This helps to maintain the integrity of our proprietary intellectual property and to protect the embedded information and technology contained in our solutions. As a general practice, employees, contractors, and other parties with access to our proprietary information enter into agreements that prohibit the unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary rights, information, and technology.
Information Technology
Information technology is a significant focus area, and we maintain a long-term strategic technology plan which is reassessed annually. Our existing technology infrastructure is a private, dedicated cloud-based computing environment hosted in primary and secondary technology centers owned and managed by the NTT Data Corporation ("NTT"). Additionally, we are in the process of modernizing a number of our legacy solutions to take full advantage of the dynamic scaling offered by the Google Cloud Platform using the Pivotal Cloud Foundry Platform as a Service capability to ensure we maintain the flexibility to operate our products and services on any public cloud platform in the future.
We maintain an Innovation Development Center ("IDC") where we use an Extreme Agile Development methodology to develop, enhance and expand our next generation cloud-agnostic IDC platform on which new products can be rapidly built, scaled, modified and deployed. In addition, the IDC plays a leading role in research and development in the areas of employing hardware advancements, data and analytics, mobility, voice, and the application of AI/ML. We supplement the IDC with a number of strategic alliances.
Technology Operations
In conjunction with NTT and GCP, we operate a computing technology environment intended to allow us to provide flexible systems at all times, enabling us to deliver increased capacity as needed or when client needs demand increased speed of delivery. Our current mainstream private, dedicated cloud computing environment hosted by NTT is designed to enable us to deliver secure and compliant data, analytics, and services to support client needs. We have also completed the development of an advanced cloud operating model that provides a fully automated, tightly controlled, and highly secured environment for the products and services we are, and increasingly will be, operating on GCP as we transition to the Google public cloud. This network of systems, combined with enterprise-level service operations, positions us as a leading property insights provider to the financial services market. Our platforms store, process, and deliver our data and proprietary technologies that are the foundation of our business and critical to the development of our solutions. Additionally, our unified network architecture allows us to operate multiple systems as a single resource capable of delivering subsets of our applications, data, and analytics as compelling combined solutions to our clients.
Security
Leveraging the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) and the associated NIST Cybersecurity Framework, we have deployed a wide range of physical and digital security measures, along with a formal governance program to protect the security of our information technology infrastructure, personnel and data. Our security team is responsible for establishing corporate information security policies, performing 24/7 security operations, maintaining information security awareness and ensuring enterprise IT compliance. Both our technology managers and NTT’s technology infrastructure managers are Information Technology Infrastructure Library certified. NTT is contractually obligated to comply with our information security policies and procedures, and our new cloud operating model that we use for those products and services that have already been refactored to operate on GCP automatically enforces compliance with our information security policies. Our digital security framework for both our NTT and GCP computing environments provides layered protection designed to secure both active and inactive virtual machines in the data centers we use. This approach enables dedicated virtual machines to 
regularly scan all of our systems. These measures help to detect and prevent intrusions, monitor firewall integrity, inspect logs, catch and quarantine malware, and prevent data breaches. Our physical and digital security solutions run in tandem, enabling us to better identify suspicious activities and implement preventive measures.
Regulation
We are subject to a number of US federal, state and local, as well as foreign laws and regulations that involve various aspects of our businesses. Failure to satisfy those legal and regulatory requirements, or the adoption of new laws or regulations, could have a significant negative impact on our ability to provide certain products and services or could result in the imposition of fines or penalties or the incurrence of damages. We maintain a robust corporate compliance program responsible for ensuring compliance with US federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations relating to our business.
US federal, state and local, and foreign laws and regulations are evolving and can be subject to significant change. There are also a number of legislative proposals pending before the US Congress, various state legislative bodies, and foreign governments concerning consumer and data protection that could affect us. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain. These laws are enforced by regulatory agencies or other enforcement bodies in the jurisdictions where we operate and, in some instances, also through private civil litigation. Among the more significant areas of regulation for our business are the following:
US Consumer Financial Regulations and Data Protection
Our US operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing the collection, protection and use of consumer data and other information, as well as the provision of certain services, that provide for sanctions for violations. The laws and regulations that affect our US operation include, but are not limited to, the following:
•Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”). The FCRA governs the practices of consumer reporting agencies that are engaged in the business of collecting and analyzing certain types of information about consumers, including credit eligibility information. The FCRA also governs the submission of information to consumer reporting agencies, the access to and use of information provided by consumer reporting agencies, and the ability of consumers to access and dispute information held about them. Some of our services are subject to regulation under the FCRA. Violation of the FCRA can result in civil and criminal penalties and the FCRA contains an attorney fee shifting provision to provide an incentive for consumers to bring individual or class action lawsuits for violations of the FCRA. Regulatory enforcement of the FCRA is under the purview of the US Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), and state attorneys general, acting alone or in concert with one another. Many states have also enacted laws with requirements similar to the FCRA. Some of these state laws impose additional, or more stringent, requirements than the FCRA.
•Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (“Dodd-Frank Act”). The Dodd-Frank Act gave the CFPB supervisory authority over “larger participants” in the market for consumer financial services, as the CFPB defines by rule. In July 2012, the CFPB finalized its regulation regarding larger participants in the consumer reporting market. Under the regulation, certain of our credit services businesses are considered larger participants. As a result, the CFPB has the authority to conduct examinations of the covered credit services businesses and we expect that we will continue to be examined by the CFPB as part of this authority. In addition, the CFPB serves as the principal federal regulator of providers of consumer financial products and services. As such, the CFPB has significant rulemaking authority under existing federal statutes that regulate many of our products and services, as well as the authority to conduct examinations of certain providers of financial products and services, including our tax services business. The CFPB also has the authority to initiate an investigation of our other businesses if it believes that a federal consumer financial law is being violated. In addition to transferring authority under certain existing laws to the CFPB and providing it with examination and supervisory authority, the Dodd-Frank Act also prohibits unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices (“UDAAP”) with respect to consumer financial products and provides the CFPB with authority to enforce those provisions. The CFPB has stated that its UDAAP authority may allow it to find statutory violations even where a specific regulation does not prohibit the relevant conduct, or prior published regulatory guidance or judicial interpretation has found the activity to be in accordance with law.
•Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ("GLBA"). The GLBA regulates the sharing of non-public personal financial information held by financial institutions and applies indirectly to companies that provide services to financial institutions. In addition to regulating information sharing, the GLBA requires that non-public personal financial information be safeguarded using physical, administrative, and technological means. Certain of the non-public personal information we hold is subject to protection under the GLBA.
•Privacy Laws. The privacy and protection of consumer information is a developing area of regulation, and we continue to monitor legislative and regulatory developments at the federal, state, and local levels. In addition to the GLBA, we expect that there will continue to be enhanced state and/or federal regulation in the area of financial and consumer data privacy, including regulation similar to the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”). Such regulation may impose additional registration requirements and/or require us to make new disclosures to consumers about our data collection, use, and sharing practices and afford consumers new abilities to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties. Any such additional regulation could significantly impact some of our business practices. 
•Data Security. In addition to the above, federal and state laws also impose requirements relating to the security of information held by us. For our businesses that involve the collection, processing, and distribution of personal public and non-public data, certain of their solutions and services are subject to regulation under US federal, state, and local laws and, to a lesser extent, foreign countries. These laws impose requirements regarding the collection, protection, use, and distribution of some of the data we have, and provide for sanctions and penalties in the event of violations of these requirements. In addition, certain state laws may impose breach notice responsibilities in the event of the loss of data due to third-party security breaches, employee error, or other events resulting in persons gaining unauthorized access to our data (including, in some cases, for losses that are incurred through our clients’ errors or systems). Some of these laws require additional data protection measures over and above the GLBA data safeguarding requirements. If data within our system is compromised by a breach, we may be subject to provisions of various state security breach laws. All states have adopted data security breach laws that require notice be given to affected consumers in the event of a breach of personal information, and in some cases the provision of additional benefits such as free credit monitoring to affected individuals. In addition, the CCPA provides consumers with a private right of action under certain circumstances if their personal information is subject to a breach. If data within our system is compromised by a breach, we may be subject to provisions of these various state security breach laws.
•Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (“RESPA”). With respect to certain services provided to our financial institution clients, RESPA generally prohibits the payment or receipt of fees or any other item of value for the referral of real estate-related settlement services. RESPA also prohibits fee shares or splits or unearned fees in connection with the provision of residential real estate settlement services, such as mortgage brokerage services and real estate brokerage services. Notwithstanding these prohibitions, RESPA permits payments for goods furnished or for services actually performed, so long as those payments bear a reasonable relationship to the market value of the goods or services provided. Our mortgage origination-related businesses that supply credit reports, flood and tax solutions, valuation products, and all other settlement services to residential mortgage lenders are structured and operated in a manner intended to comply with RESPA and related regulations. The CFPB may enforce RESPA. RESPA also provides a private right of action to consumers under certain circumstances.
•Real estate appraisals and automated valuation models (“AVMs”) are subject to federal and state regulation. The Dodd-Frank Act implemented rules and guidance thereunder, and inter-agency guidance jointly issued by the federal financial institution regulators have expanded regulation of these activities. Regulations address appraisals, AVMs, and other forms of property value estimates, which are subject to explicit and detailed regulations including licensing, pricing, and quality control requirements. In addition, creditors are required to disclose information to applicants about the purpose, and provide consumers with a free copy, of any appraisal, AVM or other estimate of a home's value developed in connection with a residential real estate mortgage loan application.
In addition to the foregoing, our businesses may be subject to or impacted by additional laws and regulations applicable to their industry or geographic location, such as our flood and insurance businesses, and our businesses that operate in foreign jurisdictions.
International Consumer Financial Regulations and Data Protection
We are subject to consumer and data protection laws and regulations in the foreign countries where we conduct business. We conduct business in several international jurisdictions, including Australia, New Zealand, Canada, United Kingdom, various countries in Europe, and Brazil. Principal regulatory bodies and regulatory laws that impact our international operations include the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, the agency with direct responsibility for administering the Australian Privacy Principles and Part IIIA of the Privacy Act 1988, and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of New Zealand, which issued the Credit Reporting Privacy Code 2004. We are also subject to the European Union Data Protection Regulation, commonly known as GDPR, which places certain obligations on companies processing and controlling data on individuals in the European Union ("EU") and prohibits the transfer of personal information from the EU to other countries whose laws do not protect personal data to an adequate level of privacy or security. In Canada, we are subject to the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act of 2000, as well as substantially similar provincial laws enacted in Alberta, British Columbia, and Quebec. We are also subject to the recently implemented Brazilian General Data Protection Law, which is 
similar in many respects to the GDPR. In addition to the above-mentioned regulations, we are subject to a variety of international consumer protection, privacy, data security and notification laws and regulations in each foreign jurisdiction in which we operate that may relate to our business or affect the demand for our products and services.
Compliance with current and future laws and regulations relating to our businesses, including consumer protection laws and regulations and international regulations, could have a material adverse effect on us, and activities related to ongoing compliance will likely increase our compliance costs.
Human Capital Management
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 5,300 employees, of which approximately 4,400 were employed in the US and 900 outside the US. Our global workforce was approximately comprised of 2% executive management, 33% tactical management, and 65% operational contributors.
We believe the strength and quality of our workforce is one of the significant contributors to our success. This is largely attributed to our employees who strive every day to create a productive environment for our customers. Therefore, one of our core strategies is to invest in and support our employees to differentiate our brand, products, and services in the competitive global property information, analytics and data-enabled software platforms and services provider operating market. We recognize the diversity of customers, partners, and communities, and believe in creating an inclusive and equitable environment that represents a broad spectrum of backgrounds and cultures.
Inclusion and Diversity
We have a number of Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”) that are voluntary, employee-led groups made up of individuals who join together based on common interests, backgrounds or demographic factors such as gender, race, or ethnicity. ERGs strengthen the culture of inclusion, improve employee relationships, provide support for existing employees and influence employee acquisition and employee retention. Our ERGs include groups comprised of women, veterans, the LGBTQ+ community, Latinos, Asians and Asian Americans, and African Americans.
Talent and Development
We invest in learning opportunities to help employees grow and build their careers through a multitude of training and development programs. These include tuition assistance programs, on-the-job learning formats, and external training including seminars, workshops, and an online platform. 
Health, Safety and Wellness
The health, safety and wellness of our employees is essential to the success of our business. We provide our employees with access to a variety of health and wellness programs. Additionally, we offer rewards for employees who participate in a variety of well-being activities and health assessments during the year.
Employee Compensation and Benefits
We have demonstrated a history of investing in our workforce by offering competitive salaries and wages. We regularly monitor employee performance and offer various incentives to those employees who regularly meet or exceed expectations. To foster a stronger sense of ownership and align the interests of employees with shareholders, we have an employee stock purchase plan available to eligible employees under our equity incentive programs. 
Employee Satisfaction
We regularly conduct anonymous surveys to seek feedback from our employees on a variety of topics, including but not limited to, confidence in company leadership, competitiveness of our compensation and benefits package, career growth opportunities and improvements on how we could make our company an employer of choice. The results are shared with our employees and reviewed by senior leadership, who analyze areas of progress or deterioration and prioritize actions and activities in response to this feedback to drive meaningful improvements in employee engagement. Further, we regularly review external rating sites to ensure the Company maintains a positive image among current and former employees. We work closely to evaluate human 
capital management issues such as employee retention, workplace safety, harassment and bullying, as well as to implement measures to mitigate these risks.
