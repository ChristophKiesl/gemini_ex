FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this Annual Report which address activities, events or developments, which we expect, believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. The words “believes,” “intends,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “projects,” “estimates,” “predicts” and similar expressions are also intended to identify forward-looking statements.
These forward-looking statements include, among others, such things as:

• | the impact to our business of crude oil, natural gas and other commodity prices;


• | amounts and nature of future revenues and margins from each of our segments;


• | trends in the industries we serve;


• | our ability to generate sufficient cash from operations or to raise cash in order to meet our short and long-term capital requirements;


• | the likely impact of new or existing regulations or market forces on the demand for our services;


• | expansion and other trends of the industries we serve;


• | our expectations with respect to the likelihood of a future impairment; and


• | our ability to comply with the covenants in our credit agreement.

These statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses we made in light of our experience and our historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments as well as other factors we believe are appropriate. However, whether actual results and developments will conform to our expectations and predictions is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, including:

• | the risk factors discussed in Item 1A of this Annual Report and listed from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission;


• | economic, market or business conditions in general and in the oil, gas, power, iron and steel, agricultural and mining industries in particular;


• | reduced creditworthiness of our customer base and the higher risk of non-payment of receivables due to low prevailing crude oil and other commodity prices;


• | the inherently uncertain outcome of current and future litigation;


• | the adequacy of our reserves for contingencies;


• | changes in laws or regulations; and


• | other factors, many of which are beyond our control.

Consequently, all of the forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report are qualified by these cautionary statements and there can be no assurance that the actual results or developments anticipated by us will be realized or, even if substantially realized, that they will have the expected consequences or effects on our business operations. We assume no obligation to update publicly, except as required by law, any such forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Matrix Applied Technologies
On February 1, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of all outstanding stock of Baillie Tank Equipment, Ltd. ("BTE"), an internationally-based company with nearly 20 years of experience in the design and manufacture of products for use on aboveground storage tanks. Founded in 1998, BTE is a provider of tank products including geodesic domes, aluminum internal floating roofs, floating suction and skimmer systems, roof drain systems, and seals. BTE is headquartered in Sydney, Australia with a manufacturing facility in Seoul, South Korea. The Company acquired BTE to expand its service offerings of certain technical solutions for aboveground storage tanks. The business is now known as Matrix Applied Technologies, and its operating results are included in the Storage Solutions segment.
The Company purchased BTE with cash on-hand for a net purchase price of $13.0 million. The Company paid $15.4 million when including the subsequent repayment of long-term debt acquired and the settlement of certain other liabilities acquired, and excluding the cash acquired and certain amounts owed to the former owners for working capital adjustments.
HDB Ltd. Limited Partnership
On August 22, 2014, the Company purchased substantially all of the assets of HDB Ltd. Limited Partnership ("HDB"). HDB, headquartered in Bakersfield, California provides construction, fabrication and turnaround services to energy companies throughout California's central valley. The acquisition advanced a strategic goal of the Company to expand into the upstream energy market. The acquisition purchase price was $5.6 million and was funded with cash on hand. Commencing on August 22, 2014, HDB's operating results are included in the Oil Gas & Chemical segment.
OTHER BUSINESS MATTERS
Customers and Marketing
The Company provided services to approximately 600 customers in fiscal 2017. One customer, Energy Transfer Partners, L.P., accounted for $233.7 million or 19.5% of our consolidated revenue, all of which was in the Storage Solutions segment. Another customer, TransCanada Corporation, accounted for $183.2 million or 15.3% of our consolidated revenue, $171.8 million of which was in the Electrical Infrastructure segment and $11.4 million of which was in the Storage Solutions segment.  The loss of these major customers or other significant customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company; however, we are not dependent on any single contract or customer on an on-going basis.
Matrix markets its services and products primarily through its marketing and business development personnel, senior professional staff and its operating management. We competitively bid most of our projects; however, we have a number of preferred provider relationships with customers who award us work through long-term agreements. Our projects have durations ranging from a few days to multiple years.

Segment Financial Information
Financial information for our operating segments is provided in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and in Note 13-Segment Information of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Competition
Our industry is highly fragmented and intensely competitive. We compete with local, regional, national and international contractors and service providers. Competitors vary with the markets we serve with few competitors competing in all of the markets we serve or in all of the services we provide. Contracts are generally awarded based on price, quality, safety performance, schedule, and customer satisfaction. 
Backlog
We define backlog as the total dollar amount of revenue that we expect to recognize as a result of performing work that has been awarded to us through a signed contract, notice to proceed or other type of assurance that we consider firm. The following arrangements are considered firm:

• | fixed-price awards;


• | minimum customer commitments on cost plus arrangements; and


• | certain time and material arrangements in which the estimated value is firm or can be estimated with a reasonable amount of certainty in both timing and amount.

For long-term maintenance contracts, we include only the amounts that we expect to recognize as revenue over the next 12 months. For all other arrangements, we calculate backlog as the estimated contract amount less revenues recognized as of the reporting date.
The following table provides a summary of changes in our backlog in fiscal 2017:

 | ElectricalInfrastructure | | Oil Gas &Chemical | | StorageSolutions | | Industrial | | Total

(1) | In July 2017, the Company reached a settlement agreement with the customer on a large project in the Electrical Infrastructure segment. The agreement resolved open claims and modified the terms enabling the Company to recover all costs and overhead to perform the remainder of the work. In addition, the execution strategy was revised and a significant portion of future work will no longer be performed by the Company. The magnitude of the scope reduction is based on the Company’s best estimate at this time but may change as the detailed execution plan continues to develop. 


(2) | Calculated by dividing project awards by revenue recognized.

Project awards in all segments are cyclical and are typically the result of a sales process that can take several months to complete. Historically, backlog in the Storage Solutions and Electrical Infrastructure segments generally have the greatest volatility because individual project awards can be less frequent and more significant. We expect to recognize approximately 92% of our total backlog reported as of June 30, 2017 as revenue within the next year.
The change in backlog in the Electrical Infrastructure segment during the year ended June 30, 2017 is mainly attributable to the work, including the project scope adjustment, related to the previously announced Napanee Power Generating Station project partially offset by transmission and distribution awards, which continue to meet the Company's expectations and the award for the electrical balance of plant work for PSEG Power's new 540-megawatt combined cycle power facility in New Jersey.
 5

The increase in backlog in the Oil, Gas & Chemical segment during the year ended June 30, 2017 is mainly attributable to backlog acquired from Houston Interests and increased project awards such as the previously announced award for the engineering, procurement and construction of a liquefied natural gas ("LNG") storage and vaporization facility for Southwest Gas Company, the previously announced Ultra-Low-Sulfur Gasoline Relocation Project awarded by KBR, Inc., and the previously announced award for the engineering, project management, procurement and commissioning of a 200 million cubic foot per day cryogenic gas recovery plant located in the SCOOP play of Southern Oklahoma's Woodford Shale and Springer Shale formations. 
The decline in backlog in the Storage Solutions segment during the year ended June 30, 2017 is attributable to the work related to the previously announced project for the construction of terminals supporting the Dakota Access Pipeline partially offset by storage solutions awards, including the previously announced award for the engineering, procurement, fabrication and construction of a 2 million gallon LNG tank for the JAX LNG Bunker Facility near the Port of Jacksonville in Florida, and the previously announced EPC award to construct 10 new tanks at the Vopak Americas Brownfield Expansion Project at the Deer Park, TX terminal. In addition, we continue to see a more cautious approach to decision-making on the part of clients and prolonged market uncertainty, which is delaying the timing of awards. 
The increase in backlog in the Industrial segment during the year ended June 30, 2017 is primarily attributable to increased project awards, including an award for a thermal vacuum chamber project during the second fiscal quarter.
Seasonality and Other Factors
Our operating results can exhibit seasonal fluctuations, especially in our Oil Gas & Chemical segment, for a variety of reasons. Turnarounds and planned outages at customer facilities are typically scheduled in the spring and the fall when the demand for energy is lower. Within the Electrical Infrastructure segment, transmission and distribution work is generally scheduled by the public utilities when the demand for electricity is at its lowest. Therefore, revenue volume in the summer months is typically lower than in other periods throughout the year. Also, we typically see a lower level of operating activity relating to construction projects during the winter months and early in the calendar year because many of our customers’ capital budgets have not been finalized.
Our business can also be affected, both positively and negatively, by seasonal factors such as energy demand or weather conditions including hurricanes, snowstorms, and abnormally low or high temperatures. Some of these seasonal factors may cause some of our offices and projects to close or reduce activities temporarily. In addition to the above noted factors, the general timing of project starts and completions could exhibit significant fluctuations. Accordingly, results for any interim period may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results.
Other factors impacting operating results in all segments come from work site permitting delays or customers accelerating or postponing work. The differing types, sizes, and durations of our contracts, combined with their geographic diversity and stages of completion, often results in fluctuations in the Company's operating results.
Material Sources and Availability
Steel plate and steel pipe are key materials used by the Company. Supplies of these materials are available throughout the United States and globally from numerous sources. We anticipate that adequate amounts of these materials will be available in the foreseeable future. However, the price, quantity, and the delivery schedules of these materials could change rapidly due to various factors, including producer capacity, the level of imports, worldwide demand, tariffs on imported steel and other market conditions.
Insurance
The Company maintains insurance coverage for various aspects of its operations. However, exposure to potential losses is retained through the use of deductibles, self-insured retentions and coverage limits.
Typically our contracts require us to indemnify our customers for injury, damage or loss arising from the performance of our services and provide warranties for materials. The Company may also be required to name the customer as an additional insured up to the limits of insurance available, or we may be required to purchase special insurance policies or surety bonds for specific customers or provide letters of credit in lieu of bonds to satisfy performance and financial guarantees on some projects. Matrix maintains a performance and payment bonding line sufficient to support the business. The Company generally requires its subcontractors to indemnify the Company and the Company’s customer and name the Company as an additional insured for activities arising out of the subcontractors’ work. We also require certain subcontractors to provide additional insurance policies, including surety bonds in favor of the Company, to secure the subcontractors’ work. There can be no assurance that our insurance and the additional insurance coverage provided by our subcontractors will fully protect us against a valid claim or loss under the contracts with our customers.

Employees
As of June 30, 2017, the Company had 4,001 employees of which 896 were employed in non-field positions and 3,105 were employed in field or shop positions. The number of employees varies significantly throughout the year because of the number, type and size of projects we have in progress at any particular time.
The Company’s subsidiaries include both merit and union companies. The union businesses operate under collective bargaining agreements with various unions representing different groups of our employees. Union agreements provide union employees with benefits including health and welfare, pension, training programs and competitive compensation plans. We have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages in recent years. We maintain health and welfare, retirement and training programs for our merit employees and administrative personnel.
Patents and Proprietary Technology
Matrix Service Company’s subsidiaries have several patents and patents pending, and continue to pursue new ideas and innovations to better serve our customers in several areas of our business. The Flex-A-Span® and Flex-A-Seal® trademarks are utilized to market the Company’s unique seals for floating roof tanks. The FastFroth® trademark is utilized to market the Company’s unique industrial cleaning process. Our patented RS 1000 Tank Mixer controls sludge build-up in crude oil tanks through resuspension. The Flexible Fluid Containment System patent covers a system that captures and contains flue leaking from pipe and valve connections. The Flex-A-Swivel patent refers to our unique pipe swivel joint assembly. Our patent for Spacerless or Geocomposite Double Bottom for Storage Tanks relates to a replacement bottom with leak detection and containment that allows for the retrofitting of an existing tank while minimizing the loss of capacity. The patent for the Training Tank for Personnel Entry, Exit and Rescue relates to a training device that can be used to train personnel on equipment that is made to simulate confined space scenarios.
The Company also holds a perpetual license to use various patents and technologies related to LNG storage tanks, LIN/LOX storage tanks, LPG storage tanks and thermal vacuum chambers. 
While the Company’s intellectual property is not its main business, we believe that the ability to use these patents and technology enables us to expand our presence in the markets and minimizes the development costs typically associated with organic growth.
Regulation
Health and Safety Regulations
Our operations are subject to regulation by the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) and Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”), and to regulation under state laws and by the Canadian Workers’ Compensation Board and its Workplace Health, Safety and Compensation Commission. Regulations promulgated by these agencies require employers and independent contractors to implement work practices, medical surveillance systems and personnel protection programs to protect employees from workplace hazards and exposure to hazardous chemicals and materials. In recognition of the potential for accidents within various scopes of work, these agencies have enacted strict and comprehensive safety regulations. The Company has established and consistently reinforces and monitors compliance with comprehensive programs intended to ensure that it complies with all applicable health and safety regulations to protect the safety of its workers, subcontractors and customers. While the Company believes that it operates safely and prudently, there can be no assurance that accidents will not occur or that the Company will not incur substantial liability in connection with the operation of its businesses. In order to minimize the financial exposure resulting from potential accidents associated with the Company's work, the Company maintains liability insurance to limit losses that could result from our work.
Environmental
The Company’s operations and the operations of its customers are subject to extensive and changing environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations relate primarily to air and water pollutants and the management and disposal of hazardous materials. The Company is exposed to potential liability for personal injury or property damage caused by any release, spill, exposure or other accident involving such pollutants, substances or hazardous materials.
In order to limit costs incurred as a result of environmental exposure, the Company maintains contractor’s pollution liability insurance that covers liability that may be incurred as a result of accidental releases of hazardous materials.
The Company believes that it is currently in compliance, in all material aspects, with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. The Company does not expect any material charges in subsequent periods relating to environmental conditions that currently exist and does not currently foresee any significant future capital spending relating to environmental matters.
