Item 1. Business.
Overview
 
We are a biodefense company engaged in developing a next generation anthrax vaccines. These next generation vaccines are intended to have more rapid time to protection, fewer doses for protection and less stringent requirements for temperature controlled storage and handling than the currently used vaccine.
 
On September 9, 2014, we signed a contract with the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (“NIAID") for the development of a next generation lyophilized anthrax vaccine (“SparVax-L”) based on the Company’s proprietary technology platform which contributes the recombinant protective antigen (“rPA”) bulk drug substance that is used in the liquid SparVax® formulation. The contract is incrementally funded. Over the base period of the contract, we were awarded initial funding of approximately $5.2 million, which includes a cost reimbursement component and a fixed fee component payable upon achievement of certain milestones. NIAID has exercised four options under this agreement to provide additional funding of approximately $8.8 million and an extension of the period of performance through December 31, 2017. The contract has a total value of up to approximately $28.1 million, if all technical milestones are met and all eight contract options are exercised by NIAID. If NIAID exercises all options, the contract would last approximately five years. If NIAID does not exercise any additional options, the contract would expire by its terms on December 31, 2017.
 
Since 2006, we have been engaged in legal proceedings with SIGA Technologies, Inc. (“SIGA”). On December 23, 2015, the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the Delaware Court of Chancery’s judgment against SIGA. On November 16, 2016, the Company received a final payment from SIGA which fully satisfied the judgment owed to PharmAthene. In total, the Company received payment of approximately $217.1 million (including interest) from SIGA.
 
On November 17, 2016, PharmAthene declared a special one-time cash dividend of $2.91 per share of common stock, paid on February 3, 2017. PharmAthene funded the one-time special dividend with approximately 98% of the after tax net cash proceeds that PharmAthene received from SIGA in satisfaction of the judgment owed to PharmAthene. On February 3, 2017, PharmAthene paid the one-time dividend in an aggregate amount of $200.3 million.
 
The receipt of the award from SIGA generated substantial taxable income to the Company, a portion of which was offset by the Company’s tax net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”). At December 31, 2016, we had available $176.1 million in accumulated domestic losses available to offset income, subject to limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”) and a 382 limitation of approximately $1 million, of which approximately $175 million was utilized to offset current year income. On November 25, 2015, the Company had adopted a Shareholders Rights Plan to help ensure that the NOLs remained available to help maximize the value for our shareholders of any amount received from the SIGA litigation.

On January 18, 2017, PharmAthene entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (as amended from time to time, the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which Altimmune, Inc. (“Altimmune”) will merge into Mustang Merger Sub Corp I Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of PharmAthene (“Merger Sub Corp”), with Altimmune as the surviving entity in such merger (“Merger 1”), and immediately thereafter, Altimmune will be merged with and into Mustang Merger Sub II LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of PharmAthene (“Merger Sub LLC”), with Merger Sub LLC as the surviving entity in such merger (“Merger 2”, and together with Merger 1, the “Mergers”). Upon consummation of the Mergers, Merger Sub Corp and Altimmune will cease to exist, and Merger Sub LLC will continue as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of PharmAthene. Upon completion of the Mergers, former PharmAthene security holders will own approximately 41.8% of the outstanding equity of the combined company, and former Altimmune security holders will own approximately 58.2% of the outstanding equity of the combined company, in each case, on an as converted and fully diluted basis. Following the anticipated consummation of the Mergers, PharmAthene would change its name to “Altimmune, Inc.”.
 
Altimmune is a privately-held immunotherapeutics company targeting infectious diseases. The combined company will be a fully-integrated and diversified immunotherapeutics company with one preclinical stage and four clinical stage programs.
 
Special Dividend
 
On November 17, 2016, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a special one-time cash dividend of $2.91 per share of common stock, paid on February 3, 2017.
 
The special dividend, totaling an aggregate payment of approximately $200 million, represented approximately 98% of the after tax net cash proceeds received from SIGA. In total, PharmAthene received payment of approximately $217.1 million (including interest) from SIGA in connection with the judgment.
Merger Agreement
 
On January 18, 2017, PharmAthene entered into the Merger Agreement, pursuant to which Altimmune will merge into Merger Sub Corp, with Altimmune as the surviving entity in Merger 1, and immediately thereafter, Altimmune will be merged with and into Merger Sub LLC, with Merger Sub LLC as the surviving entity in Merger 2. Upon consummation of the Mergers, Merger Sub Corp and Altimmune will cease to exist, and Merger Sub LLC will continue as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of PharmAthene. Upon completion of the Mergers, former PharmAthene security holders will own approximately 41.8% of the outstanding equity of the combined company, and former Altimmune security holders will own approximately 58.2% of the outstanding equity of the combined company, in each case, on an as converted and fully diluted basis. Following the anticipated consummation of the Mergers, PharmAthene would change its name to “Altimmune, Inc.”.
Proposed Mergers
 
The Mergers were unanimously approved by the respective Boards of Directors of PharmAthene and Altimmune, but remain subject to the approval of PharmAthene and Altimmune stockholders, and the satisfaction of other closing conditions. For the Mergers to be completed: (i) stockholders of Altimmune must have approved and adopted the Merger Agreement and the Mergers; (ii) stockholders of PharmAthene must have approved and adopted the Merger Agreement, the Mergers, issuance of PharmAthene common stock in the Mergers and an amendment to PharmAthene's certificate of incorporation to effect a reverse stock split; (iii) $3.5 million of capital committed to Altimmune must have been received by Altimmune in connection with the Altimmune Private Placement; (iv) the total amount of indebtedness and certain outstanding specified liabilities of Altimmune as of the effective time of the Mergers, must not exceed $2.5 million and all excess indebtedness and liabilities of Altimmune must have been repaid, settled or otherwise extinguished; (v) PharmAthene and Altimmune must have agreed in good faith on a final flu clinical development plan in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement; (vi) the net cash of PharmAthene must not be less than $10.25 million; (vii) the shares of PharmAthene common stock to be issued in the Mergers must be approved for listing on the NYSE MKT LLC (“NYSE MKT”), subject to official notice of issuance; and (viii) other customary closing conditions must be satisfied.

The combined company, which will operate as a public company under the name "Altimmune, Inc.", is expected to trade on the NYSE MKT under the ticker symbol "ALT".
 
William Enright, Chief Executive Officer of Altimmune, Elizabeth Czerepak, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Corporate Development of Altimmune, M. Scot Roberts, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer of Altimmune, and Sybil Tasker, M.D., M.P.H., Senior Vice President of Clinical Research and Development of Altimmune, will serve in their respective positions for the combined company following the consummation of the Mergers. The combined company's Board of Directors following consummation of the Mergers will be initially comprised of three former PharmAthene directors and four former Altimmune directors. The combined company's headquarters will be located in Gaithersburg, MD. At closing the combined company is expected to have approximately $20 million in cash and cash commitments.
 
The combined company's clinical stage product candidates following the Mergers will include:
 

· | NasoVAX: an intranasal, single dose, state-of-the-art recombinant influenza vaccine that in preclinical studies demonstrated early universal activity. Phase 2 is expected to commence during mid-2017 with initial data expected in the fourth quarter of 2017.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | HepTcell: a first-in-class immunotherapeutics for chronic hepatitis B with the potential to offer a functional cure. Phase 1 is ongoing with data expected in the fourth quarter of 2017.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | SparVax-L: a next generation lyophilized anthrax vaccine currently NIAID funded that may be stored at room temperature and provides extended shelf life. Depending on the requirements for future U.S. Government funding, a Phase 2 bridging study or non-human primate challenge study is anticipated to begin during the second half of 2017 with data anticipated during 2018.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | NasoShield: an intranasal, single dose, first-in-class anthrax vaccine currently funded by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (“BARDA”) that based on preclinical studies may offer protection within a few weeks of administration. A Phase 1 trial is expected to begin during the second half of 2017 with data anticipated during the first half of 2018. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition to the clinical stage product candidates, the combined company will have one preclinical program, Oncosyn, driven by Altimmune's proprietary Densigen synthetic peptide technology investigating the utility of this platform in immuno-oncology indications.
 
Anthrax Vaccine Program Product Candidates
 
On September 9, 2014, we signed a contract with NIAID that funds the preclinical development SparVax-L. Data generated to date demonstrates that our rPA can be stably formulated in a lyophilized state for room temperature storage. The next phase of the program is a demonstration of the final form of the vaccine in a single unit, dual-chambered syringe designed for simpler storage and ease of use. All of the necessary components of the vaccine will be contained in a single logistics transport and storage will be greatly improved. Animal efficacy studies were initiated in the second quarter of 2016 and the preliminary data from this study indicates that the vaccine is efficacious even when stored at room temperature. Additional non-clinical toxicology studies are currently being performed to support a filing with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) to update the SparVax® Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) to allow for the commencement of a subsequent clinical trial.
 
On July 6, 2015, we signed a license agreement with ImmunoVaccine Technologies (“IMV”) for the exclusive use of the DepoVaxTM vaccine platform (“DPX”), to develop an anthrax vaccine utilizing PharmAthene’s rPA. On June 23, 2016, we terminated this license agreement.
 
On August 5, 2016 the Company filed a formal protest against the Department of Health and Human Services (“DHHS”) challenging its solicitation for a next generation anthrax vaccine provider. According to the protest, filed with the U.S. Government Accountability Office (the “GAO”), the government’s Request for Proposals was written in a way that eliminated competition. The Company spent approximately $1 million in related proposal, legal and professional consulting services. After further discussions with DHHS, the Company agreed to withdraw the protest on August 25, 2016 when BARDA agreed to participate in conversations with NIAID and the Company on mechanisms to advance the SparVax-L vaccine program. The stability and efficacy data developed under the NIAID contract were presented as part of the annual review meeting under the NIAID contract in November 2016 and discussions were held on the path forward for the SparVax-L vaccine program.

Stockholder Rights Plan to Preserve Value of Net Operating Loss Carryforwards
 
On November 25, 2015, the Company’s Board of Directors adopted a stockholder rights plan (“Rights Plan”) in an effort to preserve the value of its NOLs under Section 382 of the Code. The description and terms of the rights are set forth in a Section 382 Rights Agreement, dated as of November 25, 2015 (the “Section 382 Rights Agreement”), by and between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as Rights Agent. The Company’s Board of Directors has terminated this plan.
 
SIGA Litigation
 
In December 2006, we filed a complaint against SIGA in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The complaint alleged, among other things, that we have the right to license exclusively the development and marketing rights for SIGA’s drug candidate, Tecovirimat, also known as ST-246®, pursuant to a merger agreement between the parties that was terminated in 2006. The complaint also alleged that SIGA failed to negotiate in good faith the terms of such a license pursuant to the terminated merger agreement with us.
 
In September 2014, SIGA filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the “Bankruptcy Court”). SIGA’s petition for bankruptcy initiated a process whereby its assets were protected from creditors, including PharmAthene.
 
In January 2015, after years of litigation, the Delaware Court of Chancery issued a Final Order and Judgment, finding that were entitled to receive a lump sum award of $194.6 million, plus additional interest.
 
On December 23, 2015, the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the Delaware Court of Chancery's decision as a result of which, with additional post-judgment interest, if calculated based on the original decision, would provide for an estimated total award in excess of $205 million.
 
On November 16, 2016, the Company received a final payment from SIGA of $83.9 million which fully satisfied the judgment owed to PharmAthene. We received approximately $217.1 million from SIGA during the year ended December 31, 2016, including additional amounts calculated as interest by SIGA.
 
Corporate Information
 
We have been engaged in the biodefense business through our predecessor entity since our inception in 2001. Our subsidiary PharmAthene Canada, Inc. was operated in support of the Protexia® contract with the U.S. Army Space and Missile Command issued to develop a nerve agent countermeasure. In July 2012, we substantially liquidated our Canadian subsidiary, which we acquired in 2005. All assets in Canada have been disposed of. In March 2008, PharmAthene, Inc., through its wholly owned subsidiary PharmAthene UK Limited, acquired from Avecia Biologics Limited the rights to develop SparVax®. In 2009, the contract was novated from PharmAthene UK Limited to PharmAthene, Inc. In June 2015, we substantially liquidated PharmAthene UK Limited.

U.S. Government Regulation of Biological Products
 
General
 
Regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries will have a significant impact on our research, product development, manufacturing and marketing of any biopharmaceutical products. The nature and the extent to which regulations apply to us will vary depending on the nature of any such products. Our potential biopharmaceutical products will require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization. The products we are developing are subject to federal regulation in the United States, principally by the FDA under the Public Health Service Act and Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FFDCA, and by state and local governments, as well as regulatory and other authorities in foreign governments that include rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and other approval procedures. Such regulations govern or influence, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, safety and efficacy requirements, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, licensing, advertising, promotion, distribution and export of products, manufacturing and the manufacturing process. In many foreign countries, such regulations also govern the prices charged for products under their respective national social security systems and availability to consumers.

The Public Health Service Act classifies our current drug candidates which are produced using biological systems, as biological drug products, or Biologics. All drugs intended for human use, including Biologics, are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA in the United States and similar regulatory bodies in other countries. The steps ordinarily required by the FDA before a biological drug product may be marketed in the United States are similar to steps required in most other countries and include, but are not limited to:
 

· | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, preclinical animal testing and formulation studies;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must be in effect before clinical trials may commence;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) that includes preclinical data, clinical trial data, product composition and formulation information, and manufacturing information;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | FDA review of the BLA;
--+-----------------------


· | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | FDA approval of the BLA, including approval of all product labeling.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The research, development and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and approvals may not be granted on a timely or commercially viable basis, if at all.
 
Preclinical testing includes laboratory evaluations to characterize the product’s composition, impurities, stability, and mechanism of its biologic effect, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety, purity and potency of each product. Preclinical safety tests must be conducted by laboratories that comply with FDA regulations regarding Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal Welfare Act. Violations of these laws and regulations can, in some cases, lead to invalidation of the tests, requiring such tests to be repeated and delaying approval of the BLA. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND and are reviewed by the FDA before the commencement of human clinical trials. Unless the FDA objects to an IND by placing the study on clinical hold, the IND will go into effect 30 days following its receipt by the FDA. The FDA may authorize trials only on specified terms and may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks. If the FDA places a study on clinical hold, the sponsor must resolve all of the FDA’s concerns and have the FDA lift the clinical hold, before the study may proceed. The IND application process may become extremely costly and substantially delay development of products. Similar restrictive requirements also apply in other countries. Additionally, positive results of preclinical tests will not necessarily indicate positive results in clinical trials.
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to humans under the supervision of qualified principal investigators. Our clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, regulations under protocols submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. In addition, each clinical trial must be approved and conducted under the auspices of an institutional review board, or IRB, and requires the patients’ informed consent. The IRB considers, among other things, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects, and the possibility of liability of the institutions conducting the trial. The IRB at each institution at which a clinical trial is being performed may suspend a clinical trial at any time for a variety of reasons, including a belief that the test subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Since our products are being developed using funding from the U.S. Government, additional review by either the NIH’s IRB or the DOD’s IRB-equivalent may also be required. These reviews take place following approval by the independent IRB. As the sponsor, we can also suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time.

Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases; phases 1, 2, and 3, involving an increasing number of human subjects. These phases may sometimes overlap or be combined. Phase 1 trials are performed in a small number of healthy human subjects or subjects with the targeted condition, and involve testing for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion or immunogenicity for vaccine products. Phase 2 studies, which may involve up to hundreds of subjects, seek to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, preliminary information related to the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases, dosage tolerance, and optimal dosage. Finally, Phase 3 trials may involve up to thousands of individuals often at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, and are intended to provide the documentation of effectiveness and important additional safety data required for licensing. Prior to commencing Phase 3 clinical trials many sponsors elect to meet with FDA officials to discuss the conduct and design of the proposed trial or trials.
 
In addition, federal law requires the listing, on a publicly-available website, of detailed information on clinical trials for investigational drugs. Some states have similar or supplemental clinical trial reporting laws.
 
In 2002, the FDA amended its requirements applicable to BLAs to permit the approval of certain Biologics that are intended to reduce or prevent serious or life-threatening conditions based on evidence of safety from trial in healthy subjects and effectiveness from appropriate animal studies when human efficacy studies are not ethical or feasible. These regulations, also known as the Animal Rule, and published in the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR 601 Subpart H), authorize the FDA to rely on evidence from animal studies to provide evidence of a product’s effectiveness under circumstances where there is a reasonably well-understood mechanism for the toxicity of the agent. Under these requirements, and with FDA’s prior agreement, Biologics used to reduce or prevent the toxicity of chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear substances may be approved for use in humans based on evidence of effectiveness derived from appropriate animal studies and any additional supporting data. Products evaluated for effectiveness under this rule are evaluated for safety under pre-existing requirements for establishing the safety of new drug and biological products, including Phase 1 through Phase 2 clinical trials. Under certain circumstances a single animal species may be acceptable if that animal model is sufficiently well-characterized for predicting a response in humans. The animal study endpoint must be clearly related to the desired benefit in humans and the information obtained from animal studies must allow for selection of an effective dose in humans. Products approved under the Animal Rule are subject to additional requirements including post-marketing study requirements, restrictions imposed on marketing and distribution and requirements to provide information to patients.
 
We will rely on the Animal Rule for our product candidates because we cannot ethically expose humans to anthrax. Other countries do not, at this time, have established criteria for review and approval of these types of products outside their normal review process, i.e., there is no Animal Rule equivalent in countries other than the United States.
 
Success in early-stage animal studies and clinical trials does not necessarily assure success in later-stage clinical trials. Data obtained from animal studies and clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be subject to alternative interpretations that could delay, limit or even prevent regulatory approval.
 
All data obtained from the preclinical studies and clinical trials, in addition to detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product, would be submitted in a BLA to the FDA for review and approval for the manufacture, marketing and commercial shipments of any of our products. FDA approval of the BLA is required before commercial marketing or non-investigational interstate shipment may begin in the United States. The FDA may also conduct an audit of the clinical trial data used to support the BLA.
 
However, under Project BioShield, the Secretary of DHHS may, with the concurrence of the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security and upon the approval of the President, contract to purchase unapproved countermeasures for the Strategic National Stockpile, or SNS, in specified circumstances under an Emergency Use Authorization (“EUA”). The U.S. Congress is notified of a recommendation for a stockpile purchase after Presidential approval. Project BioShield specifies that a company supplying the countermeasure to the SNS is paid on delivery and acceptance of a substantial portion of the countermeasure. To be eligible for purchase under these provisions, the Secretary of DHHS must determine that there are sufficient and satisfactory clinical results or research data, including data, if available, from preclinical and clinical trials, to support a reasonable conclusion that the countermeasure will qualify for approval or licensing within eight years. The legislation also allows unlicensed products to be procured for the SNS so that they are available at the time an emergency is declared.
 
Project BioShield also allows the Secretary of DHHS to authorize the emergency use of medical products that have not yet been approved by the FDA. To exercise this authority, the Secretary of DHHS must conclude that:
 

7
-


· | the agent for which the countermeasure is designed can cause serious or life-threatening disease;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the product may reasonably be believed to be effective in detecting, diagnosing, treating or preventing the disease;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the known and potential benefits of the product outweigh its known and potential risks; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | there is no adequate alternative to the product that is approved and available.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Although this provision permits the Secretary of DHHS to circumvent the FDA approval process, its use would be limited to rare circumstances.
 
We believe our products would be eligible both for consideration for procurement into the SNS and for use in the event of an emergency, although there is no guarantee that our products would meet the criteria set forth by DHHS or the FDA for procurement and EUA, respectively.
 
With regard to a BLA, the FDA may deny or delay approval of an application that does not meet applicable regulatory criteria, e.g., if the FDA determines that the preclinical or clinical data or the manufacturing information does not adequately establish the safety, purity and potency (including efficacy) of the Biologic. The FDA has substantial discretion in the approval process and may disagree with an applicant’s interpretation of the data submitted in its BLA. The FDA can request additional information, seek clarification regarding information already provided in the submission or ask that additional clinical trials be conducted, all of which can delay approval. The FDA also may, at any time, require the submission of product samples and testing protocols for lot-by-lot confirmatory review or testing, known as lot release, by the FDA prior to commercial distribution. This means a specific lot of Biologic cannot be released for commercial distribution until the FDA has authorized such release. Similar types of regulatory processes will be encountered as efforts are made to market any Biologic internationally. We will be required to assure product performance and manufacturing processes from one country to another.
 
If the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved uses for the product as described in the product labeling, require that contraindications, warning statements or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that additional studies be conducted following approval as a condition of the approval, impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing or dispensing in the form of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval or limit labeling. Once it approves a BLA, the FDA may revoke or suspend the product approval if compliance with post-market regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. In addition, the FDA may require post-marketing studies to monitor the effect of approved products, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-market studies. The Animal Rule requires post-marketing studies, such as field studies, to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit and assess its safety should an exigency exist that leads to the product being used in humans; the nature of these studies will be discussed with FDA as part of the BLA process. The FDA has broad post-market regulatory and enforcement powers, including the ability to levy civil and criminal penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize or recall products and revoke approvals.
 
Biologics manufacturers, distributors and their subcontractors are required to register their facilities with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic inspections, or inspections “for cause” by the FDA and other authorities, where applicable, and must comply with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, regulations, the FDA’s general biological product standards, and the product establishment standards set forth in the approved BLA. The cGMP requirements for biological products in particular are extensive and compliance with them requires considerable time, resources and ongoing investment. The regulations require manufacturers to establish validated systems to ensure that products meet high standards of sterility, purity and potency. The requirements apply to all stages of the manufacturing process, including the synthesis, processing, sterilization, packaging, labeling, storage and shipment of the biological product. For all drugs and biological products, the regulations require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose documentation requirements upon us and any third party manufacturers that it may decide to use. Manufacturing establishments are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and state agencies for compliance with all cGMP requirements. The FDA is authorized to inspect manufacturing facilities without a warrant at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner.
 
We, or our present or future suppliers, may not be able to comply with cGMP and other FDA regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements subjects the manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as a delay or refusal to approve a BLA, suspension of manufacturing, seizure or recall of a product, or civil or criminal prosecution of the company or individual officers or employees.

Post-Marketing Regulation
 
Any products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA licenses or approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including but not limited to:
 

· | recordkeeping requirements;
--+----------------------------


· | periodic reporting requirements;
--+---------------------------------


· | cGMP requirements related to all stages of manufacturing, testing, storage, packaging, labeling and distribution of finished dosage forms of the product;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | reporting of adverse experiences with the product; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------


· | advertising and promotion restrictions and enforcement actions.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------

 
Adverse experiences with the product must be reported to the FDA and could result in the imposition of market restrictions through labeling changes, recalls, or withdrawal of product approval. Product approvals may be revoked if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems concerning safety or effectiveness of the product occur following approval. As a condition of NDA or BLA approval, the FDA may require post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor a product’s safety or efficacy. The FDA also may impose other conditions, including labeling restrictions which can materially impact the potential market and profitability of a product.
 
With respect to post-market product advertising and promotion, the FDA imposes a number of complex regulations on entities that advertise and promote Biologics, including, among others, standards and restrictions on direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. The FDA has very broad enforcement authority under the FFDCA, and failure to abide by these regulations can result in administrative and judicial enforcement actions, including the issuance of a Warning Letter directing correction of deviations from FDA standards, a requirement that future advertising and promotional materials be pre-cleared by the FDA, and state and federal civil and criminal investigations and prosecutions. Foreign regulatory bodies also strictly enforce these and other regulatory requirements and drug marketing may be prohibited in whole or in part in other countries.
 
We, our collaborators or our third party contract manufacturers may not be able to comply with the applicable regulations. After regulatory approvals are obtained, the subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems, or the failure to maintain compliance with existing or new regulatory requirements, may result in:
 

· | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


· | Warning Letters or Untitled Letters from the FDA asking us, our collaborators or third party contractors to take or refrain from taking certain actions;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | withdrawal of the product from the market;
--+-------------------------------------------


· | FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | voluntary or mandatory product recall;
--+---------------------------------------


· | fines or disgorgement of profits or revenue;
--+---------------------------------------------


· | suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------


· | product seizure; and
--+---------------------


9
-


· | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

Other Regulations
 
In addition to the substantial regulations enforced by the FDA, we are also subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices, the experimental use of animals, and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents, used in connection with our various activities. We cannot accurately predict the extent of government regulation that might result from any future legislation or administrative action.
Changing Legal and Regulatory Landscape
 
Periodically legislation is introduced in the U.S. Congress that could change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of drugs, including biological products. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the FDA in ways that may significantly affect our business and products. We cannot predict whether or when legislation impacting our business will be enacted, what FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations may change, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be in the future.
Process and Analytical Development, and Manufacturing
 
We have no drug substance or drug product development, analytical or manufacturing facilities of our own, and have been relying on third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, and contract research organizations, or CROs. CMOs have experience in developing biological manufacturing processes and operating under cGMPs established by the Code of Federal Regulations and the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (Biologics) regulated by the FDA, and we rely on them for clinical and future commercial production of our product candidates. CROs provide cGLP/cGMP-compliant services for product analytical tests.
 
Certain raw materials used in producing our product candidates are available from only one source or a limited number of sources. We attempt to mitigate the risk associated with such sole source raw materials by actively managing our supplies. We have not experienced any shortages in supplies of such raw materials. Unavailability of certain materials or the loss of current sources of production could cause an interruption in production on a temporary basis pending establishment of new sources or, in some cases, implementation of alternative processes.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Part of our value depends in part on our ability to obtain patents, to protect trade secrets, and to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. We seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to our business.
 
The following table identifies each of our material issued and non-abandoned patents and published pending applications, in order of importance to us:

In addition, we are a party to various exclusive and non-exclusive licenses, which provide access to intellectual property and know-how useful for our products. Some of our licenses, which generally extend for the life of any applicable patent, require us to pay royalties on sales of products that may be derived from or produced using the licensed technology. For additional information on our license agreements, please refer to Note 7 - Commitments and Contingencies - License Agreements in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
We recently received trademark designation for SparVax and we also were recently notified of a notice of allowance for SparVax-L from the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
 
We have relied upon certain proprietary trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological advances to develop a competitive position. In efforts to maintain confidentiality and ownership of trade secrets, proprietary information and developments, all of our employees are required to execute agreements regarding confidentiality and assign to us all rights to any inventions and processes they develop while they are employed by us. We may in the future use license agreements to access external products and technologies as well as to convey our own intellectual property to others. We will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets.
 
Competition
 
The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition. A large number of companies of all sizes engage in activities similar to our activities and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources available to them.
Anthrax Product Competition
 
In the anthrax vaccine field there is only one FDA licensed anthrax vaccine, Biothrax®, which is sold by Emergent BioSolutions, Inc. With respect to the development of a next generation recombinant PA-based vaccine, we are aware of four other companies developing competing vaccines that are in the clinical stages of development: Emergent BioSolutions, Inc., Green Cross, Panacea Biotec Ltd., and PaxVax. There are a number of companies with anthrax vaccines in preclinical development including, but not limited to, Bavarian Nordic, IBio, Pfenex, Soligenix and Altimmune and there may be other companies developing competing vaccines that we are not aware of.
U.S. Government Contracts
 
Substantially all of our revenues to date have been derived from grants and U.S. Government contracts. There can be no assurances that our remaining U.S. Government contract will be continued, renewed beyond the base period, or that we can enter into new contracts or receive new grants to supply the U.S. or other governments with our products. The process of obtaining government contracts is lengthy and uncertain.
 
U.S. Government contracts typically are subject to audit by the government and contain termination provisions for the government allowing it to terminate at its discretion, which subjects us to additional risks. These risks include the ability of the U.S. Government unilaterally to:
 

· | preclude us, either temporarily or for a set period of time, from receiving new contracts or extending our remaining contracts based on violations or suspected violations of laws or regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | terminate our remaining contracts either for the convenience of the government (at the government’s sole discretion, for example, if funds become unavailable or the government no longer wants the work) or for default (for failing to perform in accordance with the contract schedule and terms);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | revise the scope and value of our contracts and/or the timing for work to be performed;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--


· | audit and object to our contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | control and potentially prohibit the export of our products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


· | claim rights to intellectual property, including our products, developed under the contract;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | add or remove the terms and conditions in our contracts; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


· | cancel or amend planned procurements, including outstanding RFP solicitations.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Company has been audited by BARDA through 2014 and has agreed on final indirect rates with DCAA through 2011.
 
Termination-for-convenience provisions generally enable us to recover only our costs incurred or committed, settlement expenses, and profit on the work completed prior to termination. Termination-for-default provisions do not permit these recoveries and would make us liable for excess costs incurred by the U.S. Government in procuring undelivered items from another source.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, we employed 13 persons, including 6 individuals engaged in research and development activities and 7 individuals engaged in general and administrative functions, such as human resources, finance and accounting.
