ITEM 1. BUSINESS
(U.S. dollars in millions, except per share data)
When used in this report, the terms "Avon," "Company," "we," "our" or "us" mean, unless the context otherwise indicates, Avon Products, Inc. and its majority and wholly owned subsidiaries.
General
We are a global manufacturer and marketer of beauty and related products. We commenced operations in 1886 and were incorporated in the State of New York on January 27, 1916. We conduct our business in the highly competitive beauty industry and compete against other consumer packaged goods ("CPG") and direct-selling companies to create, manufacture and market beauty and non-beauty-related products. Our product categories are Beauty and Fashion & Home. Beauty consists of skincare, fragrance and color (cosmetics). Fashion & Home consists of fashion jewelry, watches, apparel, footwear, accessories, gift and decorative products, housewares, entertainment and leisure products, children’s products and nutritional products. 
Our business is conducted primarily in one channel, direct selling, and our strategy is to expand to omnichannel. Since our merger with Natura Cosméticos S.A., we have updated our reportable segments to align with how the business is currently operated and managed. We have identified two reportable segments based on geographic operations: Avon International and Avon Latin America. In prior periods, the Company reported four segments: Europe, Middle East and Africa, Asia Pacific, South Latin America and North Latin America. Financial information relating to our reportable segments is included in "Segment Review" within Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, which we refer to in this report as "MD&A,", and in Note 14, Segment Information, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. We refer to each of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein as a "Note." Information about geographic areas is included in Note 14, Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. All of our consolidated revenue is derived from operations of subsidiaries outside of the United States ("U.S.").
In May 2019 we and Natura Cosméticos S.A., a Brazilian corporation (sociedade anônima) ("Natura Cosméticos"), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Mergers (the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which the Company and Natura Cosméticos were acquired by and became wholly-owned subsidiaries of Natura &Co, Holding S.A., a Brazilian corporation (sociedade anônima) ("Natura &Co") in January 2020. Natura has stock listed on the B3 S.A. - Brasil, Bolsa, Balcão stock exchange in Brazil and American Depositary Shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"). With the completion of this transaction, our common stock was removed from trading on the NYSE, and we became a privately held company.
COVID-19
A novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and subsequently declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Due to the uncertain and rapidly evolving nature of current conditions around the world, the impacts of COVID-19 most of which are beyond the Company’s control, continue to evolve, and the outcome is uncertain.
The most significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was felt during the second quarter of 2020, as many markets were subject to lockdown restrictions which limited our ability to recruit and enroll Representatives, operate manufacturing facilities and distribution centers and to process and deliver orders. The pandemic primarily resulted in reduced revenue, which in turn impacted profitability and cash generation. The third quarter showed signs of recovery in most markets. The fourth quarter has again been impacted by the new lockdown measures imposed in parts of Europe, although not to the extent felt during the second quarter as we were able to continue normal operations in our manufacturing facilities and distribution centers.
As of the date of this report, we are unable to estimate the long-term impact of the economic paralysis arising from efforts to curb the spread of the COVID-19 virus and the expected reduction in activity on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We will continue to review our revenue, investments, expenses and cash outflows, as well as adjusting our relationships with suppliers. Furthermore, the actions outlined above are continuously being re-evaluated in light of global developments relating to COVID-19. See also “Item 1A. Risk Factors—The COVID-19 pandemic is adversely affecting, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, our operations, manufacturing, supply chains and distribution systems, and we have experienced and expect to continue to experience unpredictable negative effects associated with the pandemic" and “Item 7 Management’s Discussion And Analysis Of Financial Condition And Results Of Operations—Overview— COVID-19 pandemic”.
Distribution
During 2020, we had sales operations in 55 countries and territories, and distributed our products in 25 other countries and territories. 
Unlike most of our CPG competitors, which sell their products through third-party retail establishments (e.g., drug stores and department stores), we primarily sell our products to the ultimate consumer through the direct-selling channel, with a strategy to 
expand to omnichannel. Our priority in the omnichannel model is to accelerate digital social selling through Representative engagement, activation, training, direct customer delivery service, and e-commerce. In our case, sales of our products are made to the ultimate consumer principally through direct selling by Representatives, who are independent contractors and not our employees. On average we had approximately 4 million Active Representatives during the year ended December 31, 2020, which represents the number of Representatives submitting an order in a sales campaign, totaled for all campaigns during the year and then divided by the number of campaigns. Representatives earn by purchasing products directly from us at a discount from a published brochure price and selling them to their customers, the ultimate consumer of our products. Representatives can start their Avon businesses for a nominal fee, or in some markets for no fee at all. We generally have no arrangements with end users of our products beyond the Representative, except as described below. No single Representative accounts for more than 10% of our net sales globally.
A Representative contacts their customers directly, selling primarily through our brochure (whether paper or online), which highlights new products and special promotions (or incentives) for each sales campaign. In this sense, the Representative, together with the brochure, are the "store" through which our products are sold. A brochure introducing a new sales campaign is typically generated every three to four weeks. A purchase order is processed and the products are picked at a distribution center and delivered to the Representative usually through a combination of local and national delivery companies. Historically, the Representative then delivers the merchandise and collects payment from the customer for her own account. Several of our larger countries have begun to offer direct to customer delivery of the ordered products. A Representative generally receives a refund of the price the Representative paid for a product if the Representative chooses to return it.
We employ certain web-enabled systems to increase Representative support, which allow a Representative to run her or his business more efficiently and also allow us to improve our order-processing accuracy. For example, in many countries, Representatives can utilize the Internet to manage their business electronically, including order submission, order tracking, payment and communications with us. In addition, in many markets, Representatives can further build their own business through personalized web pages provided by us, enabling them to sell a complete line of our products online. Self-paced online training also is available in certain markets. We are actively deploying and training the Representatives on additional digital tools and sales methods to help increase its customer reach.
In some markets, particularly in Asia Pacific, we use decentralized branches, satellite stores and independent retail operations (e.g., beauty boutiques) to serve Representatives and other customers. Representatives come to a branch to place and pick up product orders for their customers. The branches also create visibility of the Avon brand, channel with consumers and help reinforce our beauty image. In certain markets, we allow our beauty centers and other retail-oriented and direct-to-consumer opportunities to reach new customers in complementary ways to direct selling. Avon increasingly utilizes e-commerce and markets its products through consumer websites.
The recruiting or appointing and training of Representatives are the primary responsibilities of independent leaders supported by zone managers. Depending on the market and the responsibilities of the role, some of these individuals are our employees and some are independent contractors. Those who are employees are paid a salary and an incentive based primarily on the achievement of a sales objective in their district. Those who are independent contractors are rewarded primarily based on total sales achieved in their zones or downline team of recruited, trained and managed Representatives. Personal contacts, including recommendations from current Representatives (including the sales leadership program) and local market advertising constitute the primary means of obtaining new Representatives. The sales leadership program is a multi-level compensation program which gives Representatives, known as independent leaders, the opportunity to earn discounts on their own sales of our products, as well as commissions based on the net sales made by Representatives they have recruited and trained. This program generally limits the number of levels on which commissions can be earned to three. The primary responsibilities of independent leaders are the prospecting, appointing, training and development of their downline Representatives while maintaining a certain level of their own sales. As described above, the Representative is the "store" through which we primarily sell our products and, given the high rate of turnover among Representatives, which is a common characteristic of direct selling, it is critical that we recruit, retain and service Representatives on a continuing basis in order to maintain and grow our business. 
From time to time, local governments and others question the legal status of Representatives or impose burdens inconsistent with their status as independent contractors, often in regard to possible coverage under social benefit laws that would require us (and, in most instances, the Representatives) to make regular contributions to government social benefit funds. Although we have generally been able to address these questions in a satisfactory manner, these questions can be raised again following regulatory changes in a jurisdiction or can be raised in other jurisdictions. If there should be a final determination adverse to us in a country, the cost for future, and possibly past, contributions could be so substantial in the context of the volume and profitability of our business in that country that we would consider discontinuing operations in that country.
Promotion and Marketing
Sales promotion and sales development activities are directed at assisting Representatives, through sales aids such as brochures, product samples, demonstration products and training. In order to support the efforts of Representatives to reach new customers, specially designed sales aids, digital content and tools, promotional pieces, customer flyers and various forms of 
advertising may be used. In addition, we seek to motivate the Representatives through the use of special incentive programs that reward superior sales performance. Periodic sales meetings with Representatives are conducted by the district sales or zone managers. We believe that the training meetings are an integral part of enabling the Representatives to provide customers with the advice and tools to better service her customer base as well as teach sales techniques and provide recognition for sales performance.
We use a number of merchandising techniques, including promotional pricing for new products, combination offers, trial sizes and samples, and the promotion of products packaged as gift items. In most markets, for each sales campaign, we publish a distinctive brochure (whether paper or online), in which we introduce new products and special promotions on selected items or give particular prominence to a particular category. 
Competitive Conditions
We face competition from various products and product lines. The beauty and beauty-related products industry is highly competitive and the number of competitors and degree of competition that we face in this industry varies widely from country to country. We compete against products sold to consumers in a number of distribution methods, including direct selling, through the Internet, and through the mass market retail and prestige retail channels.
Specifically, due to the nature of the direct-selling channel, we often compete on a country-by-country basis, with our direct-selling competitors. Unlike a typical CPG company which operates within a broad-based consumer pool, direct sellers compete for representative or entrepreneurial talent by providing a more competitive earnings opportunity or "better deal" than that offered by the competition as well as significant competition from other non-direct selling earnings opportunities for which the existing Representatives or potential Representatives could avail themselves. Providing a compelling earnings opportunity for the Representatives is as critical as developing and marketing new and innovative products. As a result, in contrast to a typical CPG company, we must first compete for a limited pool of Representatives before we reach the ultimate consumer.
Within the broader CPG industry, we principally compete against large and well-known cosmetics (color), fragrance and skincare companies that manufacture and sell broad product lines through various types of retail establishments and other channels, including through the Internet. In addition, we compete against many other companies that manufacture and sell more narrow beauty product lines sold through retail establishments and other channels, including through the Internet.
We also have many global branded and private label competitors in the accessories, apparel, housewares, and gift and decorative products industries, including retail establishments, principally department stores, mass merchandisers, gift shops and specialty retailers. Our principal competition in the fashion jewelry industry consists of a few large companies and many small companies that sell fashion jewelry through department stores, mass merchandisers, specialty retailers and e-commerce.
We believe that the personalized customer service offered by the Representatives; the Representatives’ earnings opportunity as well as the amount and type of field incentives we offer the Representatives on a market-by-market basis; the high quality, attractive designs and prices of our products; the high level of new and innovative products; our easily recognized brand name; and our guarantee of product satisfaction are significant factors in helping to establish and maintain our competitive position.
International Operations
During 2020, our international operations, outside of the U.S., were conducted primarily through subsidiaries in 55 countries and territories. Outside of the U.S., our products were also distributed in 24 other countries and territories. In March 2016, we separated from our North America business, which had consisted of the Company's operations in the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico; this business has been presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented. As a result, all of our consolidated revenue is derived from operations of subsidiaries outside of the U.S. During 2020, approximately 51% of our consolidated revenue was derived from Avon Latin America, and approximately 49% was derived from Avon International. Further, approximately 20% of our consolidated revenue during 2020 was derived from Brazil, which is our largest market and is included within the Avon Latin America reportable segment.
Our international operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business abroad, including, but not limited to, the risk of adverse foreign currency fluctuations, foreign currency remittance restrictions, the ability to procure products, pandemic situations and unfavorable social, economic and political conditions. 
See the sections "Risk Factors - Our ability to conduct business in our international markets may be affected by political, legal, tax and regulatory risks." and "Risk Factors - We are subject to financial risks as a result of our international operations, including exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and the impact of foreign currency restrictions." in Item 1A for more information.
Manufacturing and Sourcing
We manufacture and package the majority of our Beauty products, which are formulated and designed by our staff of chemists, designers and artists. Raw materials, consisting chiefly of essential oils, chemicals, containers and packaging components 
required for our Beauty products are purchased from a range of third-party suppliers. The remainder of our Beauty products and all of our Fashion & Home products are purchased from various third-party manufacturers. 
Our products are affected by the cost and availability of materials such as glass, fragrance and fuel. For the vast majority of items we have more than one source of supply available. We believe that we can continue to obtain sufficient raw materials and supplies to manufacture and produce our Beauty products for the foreseeable future.
Additionally, we design the brochures (whether paper or online) that are used by the Representatives to sell our products. The brochures are then produced on our behalf by a range of printing suppliers. 
The loss of any one supplier would not have a material impact on our ability to source raw materials for the majority of our Beauty products or source products for the remainder of our Beauty products and all of our Fashion & Home products or paper for the brochures.
See Item 2, Properties for additional information regarding the location of our principal manufacturing facilities.
Product Categories
Both of our product categories individually account for 10% or more of consolidated net sales in 2020. The following is the percentage of net sales by product category for the years ended December 31: 

 | 2020 | | 2019 | | 2018
Beauty | 74 | % | | 74 | % | 75 | %
Fashion & Home | 26 | % | | 26 | % | 25 | %

2019 was impacted by certain indirect tax items in Brazil and 2018 was impacted by the Brazil Tax on Industrial products ("IPI") tax release, both are excluded from net sales in our calculation above. See "Avon LATAM" within MD&A for more information. 
Trademarks and Patents
Our business is not materially dependent on the existence of third-party patent, trademark or other third-party intellectual property rights, and we are not a party to any ongoing material licenses, franchises or concessions. We do seek to protect our key proprietary technologies by aggressively pursuing comprehensive patent coverage in major markets. We protect our Avon name and other major proprietary trademarks through registration of these trademarks in the relevant markets, monitoring the markets for infringement of such trademarks by others, and by taking appropriate steps to stop any infringing activities.
Seasonal Nature of Business
Our sales and earnings are typically affected by seasonal variations, a characteristic of many companies selling beauty, gift and
decorative products, apparel and fashion jewelry. For instance, our sales are generally highest during the fourth quarter due to
seasonal and holiday-related patterns. However, the sales volume of holiday gift items is, by its nature, difficult to forecast, and
taken as a whole, seasonality does not have a material impact on our financial results.
Research and Product Development Activities
New products are essential to growth in the highly competitive cosmetics industry. Our research and development ("R&D") department’s efforts are vital to developing new products, including formulating effective beauty treatments relevant to women’s needs, and improving existing products. As part of our Open Up & Grow strategy and to improve our brand competitiveness, we are focusing on developing breakthrough new technology and product innovation to deliver accessible Beauty products that provide visible consumer benefits while also delivering the Company’s ambitious sustainability goals. R&D also works extensively with third party companies to bring in new ideas, help accelerate development time and deliver against local market trends.
Our global R&D innovation center is located in Suffern, NY. There is a team of expert scientists, researchers and technicians applying the disciplines of science to the practical aspects of bringing products to market around the world. Relationships with dermatologists and other specialists enhance our ability to deliver new formulas and ingredients to market. Additionally, we have R&D centers located in, Brazil, China, Mexico, the Philippines, Poland, South Africa and the UK.
The amounts incurred on research activities relating to the development of new products and the improvement of existing products were $36.5 in 2020, $40.6 in 2019 and $48.0 in 2018. This research included the activities of product research and development and package design and development. Most of these activities were related to the design and development of Beauty products.
Environmental Matters
Compliance with environmental laws and regulations impacting our global operations has not had, and currently is not anticipated to have, a material adverse effect on our financial position, capital expenditures or competitive position. As part of the Natura &Co group, we are now in the process of working towards our B Corp accreditation; which we aim to achieve by 2025.
Human Capital Resources
At December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 19,500 employees. Of these, approximately 200 were employed in the U.S. Females constituted approximately 61% of our workforce and 61% of our managerial employees. 
At Avon, we use the power of beauty to transform women’s lives for the better. People are at the heart of our business and part of our Open Up & Grow strategy is the key focus on empowering our Associates to have a meaningful career experience. 
In 2020, we refreshed our employee value proposition after a listening exercise across the organization. Our refreshed brand essence reflects our commitment to doing good with our people, purpose and product. 2020 also saw the launch of our new engagement tool, Glint, with a focus on building manager capability to engage their teams. We had high levels of engagement with 84% participation and overall engagement score of 72%. Managers are briefed and asked to identify one action area of focus which, when coupled with a focused change at organizational level, creates powerful and systemic change across Avon.
We are committed to creating an inclusive environment where all Associates are able to bring their whole selves to work through hiring, developing and supporting a diverse and inclusive workplace. Our Associates and Management are expected to adhere to a set of expectations that sets standards for appropriate behavior and includes required annual training on inclusion in the workplace. Our employee networks provide a space for Associates to have honest conversations, highlight areas of improvement for the Company and build their own capabilities through mentoring, career conversations and educational events.
Our learning strategy is designed to empower Associates to maximize their impact and build capability at all levels. The “Leading with Heart” program for first -time people managers covers key concepts critical to being an effective and compassionate leader. Through the “Leading with Purpose” program, participants learn how to leverage their personal strengths while maximizing impact as senior leaders. Accessible to all Associates, the dynamic global communications and learning platform Inside Avon enables access to internal networks, communities of interest and bite-sized learning across a variety of topics. 
Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented safety protocols and new procedures to protect our employees, our subcontractors and our customers. These protocols include temporarily closing offices, significantly expanding the use of virtual interactions in all aspects of our business, including customer facing activities and for front line workers, social distancing measures enforced in all operations consistently since the beginning of the pandemic, including reconfiguring work spaces where possible and delineating paths, entrances, and exits in factories and warehouses and enhanced cleaning protocols. 
The “Staying Connected” virtual community was established to support Associates working remotely with topics ranging from exercise videos, mental well-being support, teaching resources for parents home-schooling and increased communication from Organizational Leaders in the form of Staying Connected: Virtual coffee breaks. All Associates had 3-month access to the THRIVE application and, when surveyed in April 2020, 92% of Avon Associates felt they were getting the support they needed. 
Transformation Plan, Open Up & Grow and Avon Integration
In January 2016, we announced a transformation plan (the "Transformation Plan") which was completed in 2018. In September 2018, we initiated a new strategy to return Avon to growth ("Open Up Avon"). In May 2020, the new leadership of Avon International refreshed our strategy ("Open Up & Grow") which aims to return Avon International to growth over the next three years. 
In addition, subsequent to the merger of Natura and Avon in January 2020, an integration plan (the "Avon Integration") was established to create the right global infrastructure to support the future vision of the Natura &Co Group, while also identifying synergies primarily between Avon LATAM and Natura &Co Latin America.
See "Overview" within MD&A for more information on these items.
Acquisitions and Dispositions 
In December 2015, we entered into definitive agreements with affiliates of Cerberus, which included the separation of the North America business from Avon into New Avon, a privately-held company that is majority-owned and managed by an affiliate of Cerberus. Avon retained approximately 20% ownership in New Avon. These transactions closed in March 2016. In August 2019 we and Cerberus finalized the sale of our respective interests in New Avon to LG Household & Health Care Ltd.
In May 2019 we and Natura Cosméticos, a Brazilian corporation entered into the Merger Agreement, pursuant to which the Company and Natura Cosméticos were acquired by and became wholly-owned subsidiaries of Natura &Co Holding, S.A. ("Natura &Co") in January 2020. With the completion of this transaction, our common stock was removed from trading on the NYSE, and we became a privately held company.
During 2020 and 2019, we disposed of businesses and assets as part of the Open up Avon strategy and later the Open Up & Grow strategy. In February, May and June 2019, we completed the sale of Avon Manufacturing (Guangzhou), Ltd, Maximin Corporation Sdn Bhd ("Malaysia Maximin") and the Rye office, respectively. In April and August 2020, we completed the sale of the Hungary distribution center and the China Wellness Plant, respectively. 
Refer to Note 3, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein, for additional information regarding the sale of the North America business, Avon Manufacturing (Guangzhou), Ltd, Maximin Corporation Sdn Bhd, the Rye office, the China Wellness Plant, the Hungary distribution center and Avon Shanghai.
