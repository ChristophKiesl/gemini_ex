Our Partnership
We are a Delaware limited partnership formed in June 2011 by Sprague Holdings and our General Partner. We engage in the purchase, storage, distribution and sale of refined products and natural gas, and provide storage and handling services for a broad range of materials. In October 2013, we became a publicly traded master limited partnership ("MLP") and our common units representing limited partner interests are listed on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the ticker symbol “SRLP".
Our Predecessor was founded in 1870 as the Charles H. Sprague Company in Boston, Massachusetts; and, in 1905, the company opened the Penobscot Coal and Wharf Company, a tidewater terminal located in Searsport, Maine. By World War II, the company was operating eleven terminals and a fleet of two dozen vessels transporting coal and other products throughout the world. As fuel needs diversified in the United States, the company expanded its product offerings and invested in terminals, tankers, and product handling activities. In 1959, the company expanded its oil marketing activities via entry into the distillate oil market. In 1970, the company was sold to Royal Dutch Shell’s Asiatic Petroleum subsidiary; and, in 1972, Royal Dutch Shell sold the company to Axel Johnson Inc., a member of the Axel Johnson Group of Stockholm, Sweden. 
We are one of the largest independent wholesale distributors of refined products in the Northeast United States based on aggregate terminal capacity. We own, operate and/or control a network of refined products and materials handling terminals and storage facilities predominantly located in the Northeast United States from New York to Maine and in Quebec, Canada that have a combined storage tank capacity of approximately 14.6 million barrels for refined products and other liquid materials, as well as approximately 2.0 million square feet of materials handling capacity. We also have access to approximately 43 third-party terminals in the Northeast United States through which we sell or distribute refined products pursuant to rack, exchange and throughput agreements.
We operate under four business segments: refined products, natural gas, materials handling and other operations. See Part II, Item 7 - "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations" for a discussion of financial results by segment and see Segment Reporting included under Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a presentation of financial results by reportable segment.
As of December 31, 2020, our Sponsor, through its ownership of Sprague Holdings, owned 12,951,236 common units, representing 56.4% of the limited partner interest in the Partnership. Sprague Holdings also owns our General Partner, which in turn owns a non-economic interest in the Partnership. Sprague Holdings currently holds all of our incentive distribution rights ("IDRs"), which entitle it to receive increasing percentages, up to a maximum of 50.0%, of the cash the Partnership distributes from distributable cash flow in excess of $0.4744 per unit per quarter. The maximum IDR distribution of 50.0% does not include any distributions that Sprague Holdings may receive on any limited partner units that it owns. 
On February 11, 2021, Sprague Holdings provided notice to the Partnership that Sprague Holdings had made an IDR Reset Election (the “IDR Reset Election”), as defined in our partnership agreement. Pursuant to the IDR Reset Election, the Partnership will issue 3,107,248 common units to Sprague Holdings, the minimum quarterly distribution amount will be increased from $0.4125 per common unit per quarter to $0.6675 per common unit per quarter and the levels at which the incentive distribution rights participate in distributions will be reset at higher amounts based on current common unit distribution rates and a formula in our partnership agreement. The IDR Reset Election is expected to be consummated on March 5, 2021. Upon consummation of the IDR Reset Election, Sprague Holdings will own 16,058,484 common units, representing 61.6% of the limited partner interest in the Partnership.

Business Strategies
Our primary business objective is to increase distributable cash flow per unit over time by executing the following strategies:
•Increase our business with our existing assets and customers. We will make investments in our existing asset base to handle additional products and provide new services to customers. We also intend to win additional business by better serving customers' need for certainty of supply, reduced commodity price risk and high quality customer service. 
•Acquire additional terminals and marketing and distribution businesses that are accretive. We intend to grow our asset and customer base by acquiring additional marine and inland terminals (both refined products and materials handling) within and adjacent to the geographic markets we currently serve. We also intend to acquire additional refined products and natural gas marketing businesses that can leverage our existing investment in our logistics capabilities and customer service systems to further increase our cash flow.
•Limit our exposure to commodity price risk and volatility. We take title to the products we sell in our refined products and natural gas segments, while our materials handling business does not take title to products and is operated predominantly under fixed-fee, multi-year contracts. We will continue to manage our exposure to commodity prices and seek to protect our sales margins by maintaining a balanced position in our purchases and sales through the use of derivatives and forward contracts. Our hedging activities are bounded by specific limits established by the board of directors of our General Partner, which are monitored and reported to senior management on a daily basis by our risk group.
•Maintain our operational excellence. We intend to maintain our long history of safe, cost-effective operations and environmental stewardship by investing in the maintenance of our assets and providing training programs for our personnel. We will work diligently to meet environmental regulations and we will continue to enhance our safety programs as our business grows and operating conditions change.
Refined Products
Overview
The products we sell in our refined products segment can be grouped into the following categories: distillates, gasoline and residual fuel oil and asphalt. Our refined products segment accounted for 86%, 89% and 89% of our total net sales for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Of our total volume sold in our refined products segment in 2020, distillates accounted for 78%, gasoline accounted for 13% and residual fuel oil and asphalt accounted for 9%.
Distillates. We sell four kinds of distillates: heating oil (both unbranded and our proprietary premium HeatForce® heating oil brand), diesel fuel (both unbranded and our proprietary premium RoadForce® diesel fuel brand), kerosene and jet fuel. In 2020, heating oil accounted for 57%, diesel fuel accounted for 41%, and other distillates accounted for 2% of the total volume of distillates we sold. We have the capability at several of our facilities to blend biodiesel with distillates in order to sell heating oil and diesel fuel with wide varieties of biodiesel content. In 2020, biofuel blended products accounted for 19% of the distillate fuel volumes sold. Distillate volumes accounted for 78%, 79%, and 78% of our total refined products sales for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Gasoline. We also sell unbranded gasoline. Gasoline volumes accounted for 13%, 10% and 10% of our total refined products sales for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Residual Fuel Oil and Asphalt. We sell various sulfur grades of residual fuel oil, blended to meet customer requirements. Residual fuel oil and asphalt volumes accounted for 9%, 11% and 12% of our total refined products sales for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Customers, Contracts and Pricing
We sell heating oil, diesel fuel, kerosene, unbranded gasoline, jet fuel, and residual fuel oil to wholesalers, retailers and commercial customers. The majority of these sales are made free on board, or FOB, at the bulk terminal or inland storage facility we own and/or operate or at facilities with which we have storage and throughput arrangements. In a FOB sale, the price of products sold includes the cost of delivering such product to the FOB location and any further shipping expenses are borne by the purchaser. 
Heating oil sales are made to approximately 900 wholesale distributors and retailers through the Sprague RealTime® pricing platform, under rack agreements based upon our posted price, contracts with index-based pricing provisions, and fixed price forward contracts. Diesel fuel sales are made to approximately 600 wholesalers and transportation fuel distributors. We also sell unbranded gasoline at Partnership-owned and at third-party locations, primarily to resellers. Residual fuel oil is sold to approximately 110 commercial and industrial accounts under rack agreements and contracts with index-based pricing provisions. 
Our commercial customers include federal and state agencies, municipalities, regional transit authorities, large industrial companies, real estate management companies, natural gas resource development companies and educational institutions. Most of these sales are made on a delivered basis, whereby we either deliver the product with our own trucks and barges or arrange with third-party haulers to make deliveries. We also deliver distillate and residual fuel oil by truck to marine customers.
Public sector entities also purchase our heating oil, diesel fuel, unbranded gasoline and residual fuel oil through competitive bidding processes. We currently have contracts with the U.S. government as well as with numerous states, municipalities, agencies and educational institutions. 
For the year ended December 31, 2020, no customer represented more than 10% of net sales for our refined products segment.
Natural Gas
Overview
We purchase, sell and distribute natural gas to approximately 15,000 commercial and industrial customer locations across 13 states in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic United States. Our natural gas segment accounted for 11%, 9% and 9% of our total net sales for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We deliver natural gas to customers through utility interconnections of pipelines and manage interactions with utilities on behalf of our customers. We sell natural gas pursuant to fixed price, floating price and other structured pricing contracts. We utilize physical purchase instruments as well as financial and derivative instruments both over the counter and through exchanges such as the Intercontinental Exchange Inc. ("ICE") and the New York Mercantile Exchange ("NYMEX"), to manage our natural gas commodity price risk.
In order to manage our supply commitments to our customers and provide operational flexibility and logistic opportunities, we enter into supply contracts, commitments for pipeline transportation capacity, leases for storage space and other physical delivery services for various terms. We believe that entering into these types of arrangements provides us with potential opportunities to grow our existing customer relationships and to pursue additional relationships.
Customers
Our natural gas customers operate in the industrial and commercial sectors in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic United States, with the highest concentration in New England and New York. Examples of customers include industrial users of varying sizes (e.g., pulp and paper, chemicals, pharmaceutical and metals plants) to various commercial customers (e.g., hospitals, universities, apartment buildings and retail establishments). The industrial customers have a high concentration of process load to support their manufacturing requirements, with the largest uses by the commercial customers typically for heating, cooling, lighting, cooking and drying.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, no customer represented more than 10% of net sales for our natural gas segment.
Contracts/Pricing
We use various types of contracts for the sale and delivery of natural gas to our customers, with terms ranging from month-to-month to over two years. We provide a wide range of pricing options to our customers, including daily pricing and long-term fixed pricing. For example, we may offer a contract that permits the customer to lock in a basis or location differential relative to the Henry Hub delivery location and then fix the price at a later date based on the prevailing market pricing. There are various other alternatives such as “capped” pricing (essentially setting a maximum) or daily pricing based on 
Table of Contents

a differential to a published market index. Due to the commodity price risk associated with uncertain customer usage patterns, we limit the number of transactions that require a single price for all volumes delivered, with the pricing of the non-contractual volumes primarily based on prevailing market economics. For any transaction where the competitive dynamics require a single price for all volumes delivered, we seek to manage the risk by, for instance, including appropriate increases in the cost build-up to reflect higher hedging costs.
Materials Handling
Overview
Materials handling consists of the movement of raw materials and finished goods through our waterfront terminals. We utilize our terminal network to offload, store and/or prepare for delivery a large number of liquid products, bulk and break bulk materials and provide heavy lift services and other handling services to some of the same customers that we supply with refined products and natural gas. Our materials handling segment accounted for 2% of our total net sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
We are capable of providing numerous types of materials handling services, including ship handling, crane operations, pile building, warehouse operations, scaling and, in some cases, transportation to the final customer. Because the products we handle are generally owned by our customers, we have minimal to no working capital requirements, commercial risk or inventory risk. Our materials handling activity is generally conducted under multi-year agreements as either fee-based activities or as leasing arrangements when the right to use an identified asset (such as storage tanks or storage locations) has been conveyed in the agreement. 
 Major Types of Materials Handling and Services
The type of materials handling and services we provide can be divided into three major categories:
Liquid. In a manner similar to our refined products operation our terminal network of marine docks, product pipelines and storage tanks are utilized to store and trans-load various other third party owned liquid products to and from ocean vessels, railcars and tanker trucks. Examples of liquid materials handled include crude oil, refined products, asphalt and clay slurry. Liquid handling activities include securing the vessel, attaching product lines from ship pipes to dock product lines, supervising discharge into tanks, measuring tank quantities, storing product, loading product into authorized trucks or railcars and in some cases transporting the product. Some products require heated storage allow for flow at ambient temperatures. The operations of Kildair Service ULC, our Canadian subsidiary ("Kildair"), include materials handling contracts involving trans-loading and storage of various petroleum products including crude, liquid asphalt and vacuum gas oil ("VGO").
Bulk. Bulk materials are typically aggregate materials that are moved in large vessels configured with multiple holds that store unpackaged products. Examples of bulk material include salt, petroleum coke, gypsum, and coal. Bulk load vessels are normally offloaded using cranes that can reside either on the vessel or on the dock of the terminal. In a typical discharge, the services performed include: securing the vessel to the dock, operating the vessel cranes, transferring products to trucks via large dock hoppers, transporting the materials to a holding pad, building materials up into large storage piles, covering the piles with protective tarps, storing the product, loading the product into trucks or railcars, scaling the loaded trucks and sometimes transporting the product to its final destination.
Break bulk. Break bulk materials are shipped in less than bulk quantities, normally with some type of secondary packaging. Examples of break bulk materials include one-ton sacks of raw materials, pallets of stones, bales of raw wood pulp and rolls of paper. Another subcategory of break bulk materials is large construction project cargo such as windmill components, often referred to as heavy lift. Break bulk handling activities include securing vessels, unloading or loading vessels either with cranes or specialty fork trucks, transferring products into warehouses or onto pads for storage, reloading products onto trucks or railcars and sometimes transporting products to their final destinations.
Customers
Our materials handling operations can service multiple customer types during any single operation, including: ocean shippers, multiple logistics firms, trucking firms and the materials supplier or consumer. Materials we handle normally fall into three major categories. The first category involves raw materials or finished goods shipped by water into local markets to support local production, manufacturing or construction firms. Examples of these products include asphalt for road construction, gypsum rock for drywall manufacturing, road salt for local road treatment, petroleum coke or utility fuels for energy demand and clay slurry for finished paper treatment. The second category of materials we handle are materials manufactured locally for export via vessel to other countries. These materials include wood pulp for paper manufacture in Asia or Europe and tallow for biodiesel production in Europe. The third category of materials we handle are both crude oil and refined products sourced either in Canada, U.S. or internationally for a range of use in local refineries and/or for further export to the U.S. or elsewhere.
Table of Contents

Contracts/Pricing
The typical contract term for our materials handling services varies depending on the frequency and type of service. For bulk and liquid services, the commodity is normally a raw materials input for industrial production (clay slurry) or construction of roads (asphalt) or wallboard (gypsum rock). As such, the demand is more ratable and the customer is normally in need of guaranteed space within a terminal. These customers typically enter into term contracts that can range from one to 20 years depending on the relative importance of the material to their production and the amount of any capital infrastructure that we need to develop for such customers. As of December 31, 2020, the weighted-average life of our materials handling contracts was eight years, with a weighted-average remaining term of three years, each calculated using adjusted gross margin as defined in Item 7 - "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-How Management Evaluates Our Results of Operations-Adjusted Gross Margin and Adjusted EBITDA”, attributable to these contracts.
Historically, our customers have paid for terminal improvements for specialty handling systems such as a clay slurry screening plant, while we pay for more generic infrastructure improvements such as storage pads.
For container and break bulk services, it is typical for the user of that material to contract on an individual shipment basis. For example, a typical pulp merchant may choose to sell its pulp domestically or to users in Europe or Asia depending on the highest delivered value it can yield. As such, its choice of delivery mode and terminal will be driven by the location of its final customer. Therefore, we normally maintain a published rate for most generic services, subject to change depending on market conditions.
Other Operations
Our other operations segment primarily includes the marketing and distribution of coal out of our Portland, Maine terminal and certain commercial trucking activities conducted by Kildair. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 our other operations segment accounted for less than 1% of our total net sales.
Commodity Risk Management
Because we take title to the refined products and natural gas that we sell, we are exposed to commodity risk. Our materials handling business is a fee-based business and, accordingly, our operations in that business segment have only limited exposure to commodity risk. Commodity risk is the risk of market fluctuations in the price of commodities such as refined products and natural gas. We endeavor to limit commodity price risk in connection with our daily operations. Generally, as we purchase and/or store refined products, we reduce commodity risk through hedging by selling futures contracts on regulated exchanges or using other derivatives, and close out the hedges as we sell the product for physical delivery to third parties. Products are generally purchased and sold at spot prices, fixed prices or indexed prices. While we seek to use these transactions to maintain a position that is substantially balanced between purchased volumes and sales volumes through regulated exchanges or derivatives, we may experience net unbalanced positions for short periods of time as a result of variances in daily sales and transportation and delivery schedules, as well as logistical issues associated with inclement weather conditions or infrastructure disruptions. Our general practice is to not hold refined products futures contracts or other derivative products and instruments for the sole purpose of speculating on price changes. While our policies are designed to limit market risk, some degree of exposure to unforeseen fluctuations in market conditions remains.
Our operating results are sensitive to a number of commodity risk factors. Such factors include commodity location, grades of product, individual customer demand for grades or location of product, localized market price structures, availability of transportation facilities, daily delivery volumes that vary from expected quantities and timing and costs to deliver the commodity to the customer. The term “basis risk” is used to describe the inherent market price risk created when a commodity of certain grade or location is purchased, sold or exchanged as compared to a purchase, sale or exchange of that commodity at a different time or place, including, without limitation, transportation costs and timing differentials. We attempt to reduce our exposure to basis risk by grouping our purchase and sale activities by geographical region and commodity quality in order to stay balanced within such designated region.
With respect to the pricing of commodities, we enter into derivative positions to limit or hedge the impact of market fluctuations on our purchases and forward fixed price sales of refined products and natural gas. All hedge positions are reflected in our results of operations. 
With respect to refined products, we primarily use a combination of futures contracts, over-the-counter swaps and forward purchases and sales to hedge our price risk. For light oils (gasoline and distillates), we primarily utilize the actively traded futures contracts on the regulated NYMEX to hedge our positions. Heavy oils are typically hedged with fixed-for-floating price residual fuel oil swaps contracts, which are either balanced by offsetting positions or financially settled.
Table of Contents

With respect to natural gas, we generally use fixed-for-floating price swaps contracts that trade on the Intercontinental Exchange ("ICE") for hedging. As an alternative, we may use NYMEX natural gas futures for such purposes. In addition, we use natural gas basis swaps to hedge our basis risk.
For both refined products and natural gas, if we trade in any derivatives that are not cleared on an exchange, we strive to enter into derivative agreements with counterparties that we believe have a strong credit profile and/or provide us with trade credit to limit counterparty risk and margin requirements.
Our risk management policies, and the specific limits therein, are intended to prevent unauthorized trading and to maintain substantial balance between purchases and sales or future delivery obligations. However, these steps may not detect and/or prevent all violations of such risk management policies, processes and procedures, particularly if deception or other intentional misconduct is involved.
Storage and Distribution
Marine terminals and inland storage facilities play a key role in the distribution of product to our customers. Our facilities are equipped to provide terminalling, storage and distribution of both solid and liquid products to serve our refined products and materials handling businesses. Each facility has capabilities that are unique to the local markets served. A number of facilities are used to handle liquid, dry bulk, break bulk and refined products at the same terminal and in most cases across the same dock, providing flexibility to fully utilize terminal assets to meet a variety of fuel and third-party cargo handling demands.
The marine terminals and inland storage facilities from which we distribute product are supplied by ship, barge, truck, pipeline or rail. Our customers receive product from our network of marine terminals and inland storage facilities via truck, barge, rail or pipeline.
Our marine terminals consist of multiple storage tanks and automated truck loading equipment. These automated systems monitor terminal access, volumetric allocations, credit control and carrier certification through the electronic identification of customers. In addition, some of the marine and inland terminals are equipped with truck loading racks capable of providing automated blending and additive packages that meet our customers’ specific requirements. Many of our marine and inland terminals operate 24 hours per day.
Throughput arrangements allow storage of our product at terminals owned by others. These arrangements permit our customers to receive product at third-party terminals while we pay terminal owners fees for services rendered in connection with the receipt, storage and handling of the product. Payments we make to terminal owners may be fixed or fluctuate based upon the volume of product that is delivered and sold at the terminal.
Exchange agreements allow our customers to take delivery of product at a terminal or facility that is not owned or leased by us. An exchange is a contractual agreement pursuant to which the parties exchange product at their respective terminals or facilities. For example, we (or our customers) receive product that is owned by the other party from such party’s facility or terminal and we deliver the same volume of product to such party (or to such party’s customers) out of one of the terminals in our terminal network. Generally, both parties to an exchange transaction pay a handling fee (similar to a throughput fee) and often one party also pays a location differential that covers any excess transportation costs incurred by the other party in supplying product to the location at which the first party receives product. Costs incurred in exchanges may also include product value differentials.
Our Terminals and Storage Facilities
As of December 31, 2020, we owned, operated, and/or controlled a network of refined products and material handling terminals and storage facilities predominantly located in the Northeast United States from New York to Maine and in Quebec, Canada that have a combined storage tank capacity of approximately 14.6 million barrels for refined products and other liquid materials, as well as approximately 2.0 million square feet of materials handling capacity. We also have access to approximately 43 third-party terminals in the Northeast United States through which we sell or distribute refined products pursuant to rack, exchange and throughput agreements.
On December 23, 2020, we sold the Mt. Vernon terminal to an unaffiliated buyer. In connection with the sale, we recorded a net gain on the sale of $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which is included within other operating income in the consolidated statements of income. Pursuant to a post-closing escrow and access agreement, we have deposited $1.2 million in an escrow account to secure our fulfillment of various environmental remediation regulatory requirements.

For a more detailed description of our terminals and storage facilities, please read Part I, Item 2 - "Properties.”
Competition
We encounter varying degrees of competition in the marketing of our refined products based on product type and geographic location. In our primary Northeast United States market, we compete in various product lines and for a range of customer types. The principal methods of competition in our refined products operations are pricing, service offerings to customers, credit support and certainty of supply. Our competitors include terminal companies, major integrated oil companies and their marketing affiliates and independent marketers of varying sizes, financial resources and experience. We believe that our being one of the largest independent wholesale distributors of refined products in the Northeast United States (based on aggregate terminal capacity), our ownership of various marine-based terminals and our reputation for reliability and strong customer service allow us to be competitive in marketing refined products in the areas in which we operate.
Competitors of our natural gas sales operations generally include natural gas suppliers and distributors of varying sizes, financial resources and experience, including producers, pipeline companies, utilities and independent marketers. The principal methods of competition in our natural gas operations are in obtaining supply, pricing optionality for customers and effective support services, such as scheduling and risk management. We believe that our sizable market presence and strong customer service and offerings allow us to be competitive in marketing natural gas in the areas in which we operate.
In our materials handling operations, we primarily compete with public and private port operators. Although customer decisions are substantially based on location, additional points of competition include types of services provided and pricing. We believe that our ability to provide materials handling services at a number of our refined products terminals and our demonstrated ability to handle a wide range of products provides us a competitive advantage in competing for products-related handling services in the areas in which we operate.
Seasonality
Demand for natural gas and some refined products, specifically heating oil and residual fuel oil for space heating purposes, is generally higher during the period of November through March than during the period of April through October. Therefore, our results of operations for the first and fourth calendar quarters are generally stronger than for the second and third calendar quarters. For example, over the 36-month period ended December 31, 2020, we generated an average of 77% of our total heating oil and residual fuel oil net sales during the months of November through March.
Employees
As of December 31, 2020, our General Partner employed approximately 663 full-time employees who supported our operations, 73 of whom were covered by six collective bargaining agreements. One of these agreements, covering 38 employees, is up for renewal on June 30, 2021. Our Canadian subsidiary had 102 employees as of December 31, 2020, 39 of whom were covered by one collective bargaining agreement which expires on March 18, 2021. Overall we believe that our relationships with full-time employees and labor unions are generally good.
Health and Safety
We maintain a culture of safety grounded on the premise of eliminating workplace incidents, risks and hazards. We have a Health, Safety, Environment and Sustainability department ("HSE") to implement processes to help eliminate high-risk actions and identified safety hazards. We strive to provide all employees with a safe work environment and the necessary skills, training, knowledge, equipment, and management to perform their responsibilities in the healthiest and safest manner possible. We track safety performance using industry standard metrics and work continuously to improve safety across our businesses. In 2020, Sprague’s company-wide Recordable Injury Frequency ("RIF") was calculated to be 1.68, down from 3.60 in March of 2019, and below its industry peer group. Our 2021 goal is to reduce Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA") recordable incidents by 25% year over year. In response to the global novel coronavirus pandemic ("COVID-19"), we have implemented and continue to implement safety measures in all our facilities. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to unique challenges, and we are striving to ensure the health, safety and general well-being of our employees. We continue to evolve our programs to meet our employees’ health and wellness needs, which we believe is essential to attract and retain employees of the highest level, and we offer a competitive benefits package focused on fostering work/life integration.
Inclusion, Equity and Diversity
We make it a priority to embrace diversity and collaboration in our workforce, our ways of thinking, and our business experiences. Our goal is to create a culture where we value, respect, and provide fair treatment and equal opportunities for all employees. We encourage employees to consider all points of view to help deliver better results. Inclusion, equity and diversity 
Table of Contents

("IE&D") is vital to our business as whole, not strictly a human resources initiative. We continue to build IE&D into our culture with a focus on continuous improvement, and have identified several key objectives that guide our effort and by which we will demonstrate our commitment to fostering inclusion, equity and diversity, including: 
•Promoting a work environment that enables employees to feel safe to express their ideas and perspectives and feel they belong to our team; and,
•Recruiting, developing and retaining diverse top talent.
Corporate social and environmental responsibility
Our values, rooted in trust, integrity, and collaboration, lay the foundation for our commitment to corporate social and environmental responsibility. We are committed to conducting business in an environmentally sensitive manner and we seek to comply with all applicable local, state, provincial, and federal environmental regulatory requirements. Beyond providing energy solutions that solve our customers' current energy challenges, we believe that to be truly successful, it's crucial that we do our part to continually adapt to the ever changing energy landscape by seeking out initiatives that reduce our environmental footprint, helping to improve the world for current and future generations. For us, that means we are committed to: protecting our planet by minimizing the environmental impact associated with our operations; striving to contribute our time, talent and resources to strengthen the communities where we live and work; and engaging in ethical practices. We're all in this together; we believe when our local communities succeed, we succeed. We and our employees live this mantra with various initiatives focused on supporting our communities both financially and with employee time. 
Compensation programs and employee benefits
The main objective of our compensation program is to provide a compensation package that will attract, retain, motivate and reward employees. In addition to competitive base salaries, we accomplish this compensation objective through our Thrift 401(k) plan match program and contributions to a Defined Contribution plan. Employees are also eligible for annual bonus amounts tied to our incentive plan metrics and objectives.
We are committed to providing comprehensive benefit options and it is our intention to offer benefits that will allow our employees and their families to live healthier and more secure lives. Some examples of the wide ranging benefits we offer are: medical insurance, prescription drug benefits, dental insurance, vision insurance, parental leave, short-term disability, long-term disability, health rewards, employee assistance programs, health savings accounts and flexible spending accounts.
Environment
General 
Our petroleum product terminal and supply operations are subject to extensive and stringent environmental laws. As part of our business, we own and operate petroleum storage and distribution facilities and a fleet of petroleum trucks, and must comply with environmental laws at the federal, state and local levels, which increase the cost of operating terminals and our business generally. These laws include statutes, such as the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act, and regulations, which are frequently modified or revised to impose new obligations that are applicable to our operations, including the acquisition of permits to conduct certain activities limiting or preventing the release of materials from our facilities, managing wastes generated by our operations, the installation of pollution control equipment, responding to releases of process materials or wastes from our operations, and the risk of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations. However, we do not believe that we are affected in a significantly different manner by these laws and regulations than are our competitors.
Our operations also utilize a number of petroleum storage facilities and distribution facilities that we do not own or operate, but at which refined products are stored. We utilize these facilities through several different contractual arrangements, including leases, throughput and terminalling services agreements. If facilities with which we contract that are owned and operated by third parties fail to comply with environmental laws, they could be shut down, requiring us to incur costs to use alternative facilities. 
Environmental laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business in several ways, such as: 

•Requiring capital expenditures to comply with environmental control requirements;
•Requiring remedial action to mitigate releases of hydrocarbons, hazardous substances or wastes caused by our operations or attributable to former operators; and,
•Curtailing the operations of facilities deemed in non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations.

Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of remedial requirements and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations. Certain environmental statutes impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hydrocarbons, hazardous substances or wastes have been released or disposed. Moreover, neighboring landowners and other third parties may file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hydrocarbons, hazardous substances or other wastes into the environment. 
The trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment. For example, shortly after taking office in January 2021, President Biden issued a series of executive orders designed to address climate change and requiring agencies to review environmental actions taken by the Trump administration, as well as a memorandum to departments and agencies to refrain from proposing or issuing rules until a departmental or agency head appointed or designated by the Biden administration has reviewed and approved the rule. President Biden’s executive orders, as well as reentry into the Paris Agreement as discussed below, may result in the development of additional regulations or changes to existing regulations. As a result, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate. We try to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and to plan accordingly to remain in compliance with changing environmental laws and regulations and to minimize the costs of such compliance. 
We do not believe that compliance with federal, state or local environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations. However, we can provide no assurance that future events, such as changes in existing laws, changes in the interpretation of existing laws, promulgation of new laws, or the development or discovery of new facts or conditions will not cause us to incur significant costs or will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash available for distribution to our unitholders.
Hazardous Substances and Releases 
Our business is subject to laws relating to the release of hazardous substances into the water or soils, which include requirements to control pollution of the environment. For instance, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended, also known as CERCLA or the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances. Under the Superfund law, these persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. The Superfund law also authorizes the EPA, and in some instances third parties, to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible persons the costs they incur. It is possible for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment. In the course of our ordinary operations, we may generate substances that fall within the Superfund law’s definition of a hazardous substance and, as a result, we may be jointly and severally liable under the Superfund law for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which those hazardous substances have been released into the environment. 
We currently own, lease or use storage or distribution facilities where hydrocarbons are being or have been handled for many years. Although we have used operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on, under or from the properties owned or leased by us or on or under other locations where we have contractual arrangements or where these wastes have been taken for disposal. In addition, many of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes was not under our control. These properties and wastes disposed thereon may be subject to the Superfund law or other federal and state laws. Under these laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes, including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators, to clean up contaminated property, including groundwater contaminated by prior owners or operators, or to make capital improvements to prevent future contamination. 
Our operations generate a variety of wastes, including some hazardous wastes that are subject to the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended ("RCRA") and comparable state laws. These regulations impose detailed requirements for the handling, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous waste. Our operations also generate solid wastes which are regulated under state law or the less stringent solid waste requirements of the federal Solid Waste Disposal Act. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with the existing requirements of RCRA, the Solid Waste Disposal Act and similar state and local laws, and the cost involved in complying with these requirements is not material. We are also incurring ongoing costs for monitoring groundwater at several facilities that we operate. We believe that these costs will not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.

Above-Ground Storage Tanks 
Above-ground tanks that contain petroleum and other hazardous substances are subject to comprehensive regulation under environmental laws. Generally, these laws impose liabilities for releases and require secondary containment systems for tanks or require the operators take alternative precautions to ensure that no contamination results from tank leaks or spills. We believe we are in substantial compliance with environmental laws and regulations applicable to above-ground storage tanks. 
The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, or OPA, addresses three principal areas of oil pollution-prevention, containment and cleanup. In order to handle, store or transport oil, we are required to file oil spill response plans with the United States Coast Guard (for marine facilities) and the EPA. States in which we operate have enacted laws similar to OPA. We maintain such plans, and when required have submitted plans and received federal and state approvals necessary to comply with the OPA, the Clean Water Act and related regulations. We believe we are in substantial compliance with regulations promulgated under OPA and similar state laws. 
Under OPA and comparable state laws, responsible parties for a regulated facility from which oil is discharged may be subject to strict, joint and several liability for removal costs and certain other consequences of an oil spill such as natural resource damages, where the spill is into navigable waters or along shorelines. Under the authority of the federal Clean Water Act, the EPA imposes specific requirements for Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure, or SPCC, plans that are designed to prevent, and minimize the impacts of, releases from above ground storage tanks. We believe we are in substantial compliance with regulations pursuant to OPA, the Clean Water Act and similar state laws.
From time to time, we experience spills and releases during various phases of our operations, and some of these releases can reach waters that applicable federal and state laws would define as navigable. As a result we may be responsible for fines and penalties as well as required capital expenditures and for implementation of compliance and maintenance programs.
Water Discharges 
The federal Clean Water Act, or CWA, and analogous state laws impose strict controls on the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into waters of the United States. This law and comparable state laws prohibit the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or analogous state agency and impose substantial liabilities for noncompliance. The EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (“Corps”) previously issued a final rule in May 2015 defining the scope of the EPA’s and the Corps’ jurisdiction, i.e., the scope of “Waters of the United States”; however, in October 2019, the EPA and the Corps published a final rule repealing the 2015 rule and re-codifying the longstanding regulatory text that existed prior to the 2015 rule. In January 2020, the EPA and the Corps finalized a new rule to replace the 2015 rule. The 2020 rule is currently subject to a number of legal challenges. Moreover, the January 2020 rule has been identified by the Biden Administration as one of the actions that will be reviewed to determine whether it is consistent with the policies of the Biden Administration and may be subject to suspension, revision or rescission. Modification of the 2020 rule may result in broader applicability of the CWA. 
The CWA also regulates the discharge of storm water runoff from certain industrial facilities. Accordingly, several of our facilities are required to obtain and maintain storm water discharge permits, which require monitoring and sampling of storm water runoff from such facilities. We believe we hold the required permits and operate in substantial compliance with those permits. While we have experienced permit discharge exceedances at some of our terminals, we do not expect any non-compliance with existing permits and foreseeable new permit requirements to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.
Air Emissions 
Our operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act, or CAA, and comparable state and local laws. Under such laws, permits are typically required to emit pollutants into the atmosphere above certain thresholds. We believe we currently hold or have applied for all necessary air permits and that we are in substantial compliance with applicable air laws and regulations. The trend in air emissions regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment. If more restrictive air laws and regulations are enacted in the future, they may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 
Various federal, state and local agencies have the authority to prescribe product quality specifications for the refined products that we sell, largely in an effort to reduce air pollution. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in substantial penalties. Although we can give no assurances, we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with these regulations.

Changes in product quality specifications could require us to incur additional handling costs or reduce our throughput volume. For instance, different product specifications for different markets could require the construction of additional storage. Also, states in which we operate have either started or plan to limit the sulfur content of home heating oil, which could also increase our costs to purchase such oil or limit our ability to sell heating oil. 

Changing sulfur regulations also impact the residual fuel oil business. Restrictions on certain grades of product and in certain cases, banning residual fuel oil in certain municipalities or regions, will force us to reconfigure existing tanks that are in residual fuel oil service. 
 Climate Change 
 In response to the April 2007 United States Supreme Court ruling in Massachusetts, et al. v. EPA that the EPA has authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions under the CAA, the EPA has taken several steps towards implementing regulations regarding the emission of greenhouse gases, or GHGs. In 2009, the EPA issued a final rule declaring that six GHGs “endanger both the public health and the public welfare of current and future generations.” The issuance of this “endangerment finding” allows the EPA to begin regulating GHG emissions under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act. In addition, the EPA has issued rules requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources in the United States, beginning in 2011 for emissions occurring in 2010. Certain state jurisdictions also have similar GHG reporting requirements. While our operations fall below the thresholds that would characterize large sources, we are required to implement systems to track certain purchases of product and we believe we are in material compliance with the regulations.
Overall, there has been a trend towards increased regulation of GHGs and initiatives, both domestically and internationally, to limit GHG emissions. Future efforts to limit emissions associated with transportation fuels and heating fuels could reduce the market for, or pricing of, our products, and thus adversely impact our business. In addition, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHG in the earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other climatic events. If any of those effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations. In addition, in 2015, the United States participated in the United Nations Conference on Climate Change, which led to the creation of the Paris Agreement. In April 2016, the United States signed the Paris Agreement, which requires countries to review and “represent a progression” in their nationally determined contributions, which set emissions reduction goals, every five years. Although the United States State Department formally informed the United Nations of the United States’ withdrawal from the Paris Agreement in November 2019 and finalized that withdrawal in 2020, the United States re-entered the Paris Agreement, effective January 20, 2021, pursuant to President Biden’s executive order. Several states and geographic regions in the United States have adopted legislation and regulations to reduce emissions of GHGs. Additional legislation or regulation by these states and regions, the EPA, and/or any international agreements to which the United States may become a party, that control or limit GHG emissions or otherwise seek to address climate change could adversely affect our operations. The cost of complying with any new law, regulation or treaty will depend on the details of the particular program. Any direct and indirect costs of meeting these requirements may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and our ability to make quarterly distributions to our unitholders. 
In addition to the regulatory efforts described above, activists concerned about the potential effects of climate change have, in certain instances, directed their attention at sources of funding for fossil-fuel energy companies. This could make it more difficult to secure funding for projects. Members of the investment community have recently increased their focus on sustainability practices, including practices related to GHGs and climate change, in the oil and natural gas industry. As a result, we and others in our industry have come under increasing pressure to improve our sustainability practices. Additionally, members of the investment community have begun to screen companies such as ours for sustainability performance before investing in our common units. If we are unable to establish adequate sustainability practices, our common unit price may be negatively impacted, our reputation may be negatively affected, and it may be more difficult for us to compete effectively. Our efforts to improve our sustainability practices in response to these pressures may increase our costs, and we may be forced to implement technologies that are not economically viable in order to improve our sustainability performance and to perform services for certain customers.
