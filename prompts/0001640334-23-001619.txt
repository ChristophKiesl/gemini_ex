ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
OUR COMPANY

NAMI Corp. (the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) conducts its operations through its controlled, consolidated subsidiary SBS Mining Corp. Malaysia Sdn. Bhd. (hereinafter referred to as “SBS”). SBS, founded on August 14, 2008, is a Malaysian corporation primarily engaged in trading activities for certain mineral ores and mining and exploration of properties located in Malaysia.
OUR CORPORATE HISTORY AND BACKGROUND

We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 5, 2012. Initially, we established November 30 as our fiscal year-end. On July 4, 2018, we changed our fiscal year-end to June 30. We were originally developing a built-in safe with a combination lock that could store personal and/or valuable items inside of backpacks, carry-on luggage, and suitcases. Since our inception and until the acquisition of SBS, we were a development stage company without significant assets or revenue.

On October 31, 2016, a change in control occurred because the Company’s largest shareholder sold 60,750,000 shares of our common stock to Mr. Ong Tee Keat, a member of the Company’s board of directors and advisor, who resides in Malaysia, which represented 60.22% of the total issued and outstanding shares of common stock at that time. Such 60,750,000 shares sold represented all of the shares of the Company’s common stock owned by the prior shareholder.

On October 31, 2016, we filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State (the “Nevada SOS”) whereby we amended our Articles of Incorporation by (a) increasing the authorized number of shares of common stock from 200 million to 5 billion; and (b) increasing all of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of seven (7) shares for every one (1) share issued and outstanding. Our board of directors and shareholders approved this amendment on October 26, 2016.

Prior to November 3, 2016, we operated our business under the name “Pack Fuerte, Inc.” On November 3, 2016, Pack Fuerte, Inc. filed Articles of Merger, pursuant to the Nevada Revised Statutes 92A.200 et. seq., with the Nevada SOS. The Articles of Merger set forth the terms and conditions under which we entered into a statutory merger with our wholly owned subsidiary, NAMI Corp., with Pack Fuerte, Inc. as the merging corporation and NAMI Corp. as the surviving corporation. Thereafter we have operated under the name NAMI Corp.

Acquisition of SBS

On July 12, 2018, we acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of SBS from GMCI Corp (“GMCI”) in exchange for the issuance of a total of 720,802,346 shares of our common stock to GMCI (the “SBS Acquisition”). As a result of the SBS acquisition, SBS became our wholly owned subsidiary; and the former SBS Shareholder, GMCI, became our controlling stockholder. The SBS Acquisition was treated as a recapitalization, with SBS as the acquirer and the Company as the acquired party for accounting purposes. Unless the context suggests otherwise, when we refer in this report to business and financial information for periods prior to the consummation of the SBS Acquisition, we are referring to the business and financial information of SBS. 

Immediately prior to the SBS Acquisition, GMCI owned all the issued and outstanding capital stock of SBS. As a result of the SBS Acquisition, we now own all the issued and outstanding capital stock of SBS. Following the closing of the SBS Acquisition, we conduct our operations through our controlled, consolidated subsidiary SBS. SBS is primarily engaged in mining and exploration of properties located in Malaysia.

On July 19, 2018, we were notified that the board of directors of GMCI deemed it to be in the best interests of GMCI and its stockholders for GMCI to approve and declare a dividend of restrictive shares of NAMI Corp. to the stockholders of GMCI, on a pro rata basis, determined in accordance with the number of shares of capital stock of GMCI held by such stockholders, thereby transferring ownership of 100% of the outstanding restrictive shares of NAMI Corp. owned by GMCI to the stockholders of GMCI (collectively, the “Nami Stock Dividend”). The Nami Stock Dividend was completed on August 21, 2018.

Filing of S-1 Registration Statement for our Selling Shareholders

On November 13, 2018, the Company filed a S-1 Registration Statement to register for the sale of up to 322,388,472 shares of our common stock by persons who received shares of our common stock pursuant to the Nami Stock Dividend and by persons who purchased shares of our common stock in private placements that took place from April to September 2017 (the “Private Investors”). The recipients of the Nami Stock Dividend and the Private Investors are referred to in this annual report as the “selling stockholders”. The selling stockholders may sell common stock from time to time in the principal market on which the stock will be traded at the prevailing market price or in negotiated transactions. With respect to shares of our common stock that may be offered and sold from time to time by the selling stockholders, we will receive no proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock pursuant to such offering. The Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) declared the effectiveness of the resale S-1 Registration Statement on November 26, 2018. 
Temporary Business Interruptions Caused by Covid-19

In March of 2020 the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The COVID-19 pandemic and preventative measures taken to contain or mitigate the outbreak caused disruption in business, the financial markets, and economies globally. 

The COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations, as a result of a Moving Control Order (“MCO”) implemented by the government of Malaysia in March of 2020 which caused us to temporarily suspend our business operations. On June 1, 2021 the government of Malaysia implemented the National Recovery Plan (“NRP”) which consisted of a four phase recovery plan designed to steer Malaysia out of the pandemic. As of the date of this annual report, we have re-initiated our business operations, but have to yet to accurately determine the extent of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.

The ultimate magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects in business globally remains unknown. Uncertainty surrounding the effects and magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic have caused instability in the global markets and economies, affecting our business in a multitude of ways and in varying magnitudes. Although we are yet unable to estimate the ultimate impact that the COVID-19 pandemic had on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, it adversely affected:


· | Global demand for bauxite, sea sand, and river sand, negatively impacting our ability to generate cash flows from operations; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Our operations, including causing interruptions, reductions, or closures of our operations, due to decreased demand for our products, government regulations and/or fewer workers due to illness or public health restrictions;
· | Commercial sustainability of key vendors or transportation disruptions within our supply chain; and 
· | Our access to global financial and credit markets and our ability to obtain additional credit or financing upon acceptable terms. 


Further or prolonged deterioration of adverse conditions could continue to negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

OVERVIEW

SBS, founded in August 14, 2008, is a Malaysian corporation primarily engaged in sea sand mining of properties located in Malaysia.

SBS’ executive offices are located at No 1, 1st Floor, Lorong Sekilau 1, Bukit Sekilau, 25200 Kuantan, Pahang Darul Makmur, Malaysia.

In August 2018, SBS created a new class of preferred equity, designated as the “12% Redeemable Cumulative Preference Shares,” in its attempt to raise capital for business expansion and exploration of mining activities. SBS authorized the issuance of up to 50 million shares of the newly created class of preferred stock at an issue price of RM 1.00 per share. 

This new preferred equity carried a cumulative 12% preferred dividend, payable on a quarterly basis, based on the issue price of the preferred shares (the “Preferred Dividend”). The preferred shares would be redeemed by SBS at the “Redemption Price.” The Redemption Price for each share was an amount of shares of NAMI Corp., equal to the issue price of the preferred shares, plus the unpaid Preferred Dividends. SBS should have redeemed the 12% Redeemable Cumulative Preference Shares on the second anniversary of their issuing date. This, however, was impossible due to SBS being forced to halt its operations to comply with movement restriction orders issued by the government of Malaysia. 

In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of SBS, the holders of 12% Redeemable Cumulative Preference Shares, were entitled to have the assets available for distribution applied first to pay them an amount equal to the issue price, plus all unpaid Preferred Dividends. The holders of 12% Redeemable Cumulative Preference Shares had no voting rights, except: (i) upon any resolution put forth when the Preferred Dividends remain in arrears and unpaid; (iv) upon any resolution that varies the rights of the preferred shares; (iii) upon any resolution for the winding up of SBS; (iii) upon any resolution to approve a capital reduction, repayment or distribution of SBS; (iv) upon any proposal to effect a scheme of arrangement; and (v) as required by law. As of June 30, 2022 dividends in arrears were paid and the outstanding balance was $0.

In August 2018, SBS commenced a capital raise of up to RM 50,000,000 (approximately USD $12.4 million) by offering shares of SBS’ 12% Redeemable Cumulative Preference Shares at a price of RM1.00 per share (the “12% Redeemable Cumulative Preference Shares Offering”). The Company received approximately $59,530 (MYR 240,000) in the first subscription of the 12% Redeemable Cumulative Preference Shares offering; and approximately $8,878 (MYR 40,000) in the second subscription of the 12% Redeemable Cumulative Preference Shares offering. The 12% Redeemable Cumulative Preference Shares offering was closed on February 28, 2019. 

As of the date of this annual report, SBS has redeemed the 280,000 shares of 12% Redeemable Cumulative Preference Shares which were outstanding for a total of 46,667 shares of NAMI Corp. As of the date of this report, there are no shares of 12% Redeemable Cumulative Preference Shares outstanding.  

Products and Suppliers 

Bauxite Financing 

SBS provides financing for the acquisition, stockpiling storage, exporting and shipment of bauxite ore from Malaysia. Currently, SBS has provided funding to Sincere Pacific Mining (M) Sdn. Bhd. (“Sincere Pacific”) to purchase and sell and export bauxite through a verbal agreement. Sincere Pacific is considered a related party as Mr. Liew Chin Loong, a director and officer of SBS, is also a fifty percent (50%) owner and a director of Sincere Pacific.

SBS and Sincere Pacific have verbally agreed to work in partnership to acquire and arrange transport for stockpiled bauxite shipments to mainland China. Services required for the loading, processing and transport of bauxite from mine sites to the port will be provided by SBS and Sincere Pacific directly. Sincere Pacific has agreed to manage all labor, processing, transport and export of the ore until such time as the parties have concluded a total of seven (7) shipments.

Sincere Pacific holds a special permit from the government of Malaysia that allows it to hold up to 1.8 million metric tons (all tons referred to herein are metric) of bauxite stockpile for shipment at Felda Bukit Goh, Kuantan. This permit has no expiration date. Sincere Pacific and SBS intend to conclude approximately seven (7) shipments under this permit. As of June 30, 2022, the two parties have concluded five (5) shipments. The remaining two shipments have not been concluded and do not have an estimated shipment date due to the fact that the Malaysian government has yet to issue the finalized standard operating procedure rules for the export of bauxite. On March 22, 2018, Sincere Pacific obtained an additional bauxite export license for a total tonnage of 124,160.67 metric tons. The permit expired on April 30, 2018. No sales were made by Sincere Pacific under the verbal agreement in the year ended June 30, 2022. Sincere Pacific acquires or purchases bauxite from multiple sources in Malaysia for selling the ore to customers in China.



7


Upon purchasing bauxite in Malaysia, Sincere Pacific processes the ore in its facilities, then stockpiles the ore pending shipment. Each shipment of bauxite consists of up to 55,000 metric tons. SBS does not take physical possession of the minerals at any time. It has been verbally agreed between Sincere Pacific and SBS that SBS, in return for providing exporting financing, shall receive a commission based on the gross amount of washed bauxite tonnage of up to 20,000 metric tons per shipment. Thereafter, if successful, the two parties will enter a formal agreement with respect to further shipments under newly negotiated terms. It is anticipated by our management team that the sales price obtained by Sincere Pacific for unwashed bauxite could gross a total of up to USD $24.50 to USD $26.00 per dry and delivered metric ton, free on board stowed and trimmed, subject to certain penalties or bonus based on the percentage of certain mineral compounds present (primarily aluminum oxide and silicon dioxide). Sincere Pacific issues payment to SBS upon successful conclusion of shipments, at an agreed USD $1.00 per delivered dry ton, net any applicable fees such as storage, etc. The parties intend to formalize a written agreement for future mineral trading activities following successful conclusion of approximately seven (7) shipments whereby we hope that SBS will receive commissions on up to 140,000 gross tons. As of the date of this report, no formalized written agreement has been completed.

However, the price at which Sincere Pacific sells a shipment of bauxite is subject to negotiation and current market prices. Therefore, this average net income of USD$1.00 per ton payable to SBS is subject to adjustment and possible volatility.

To date, Sincere Pacific has completed five (5) shipments of bauxite and SBS has provided Sincere Pacific with $614,226 (RM$2,504,769) of financing used towards a portion of these shipments. Of the total financing advanced by SBS, $186,744 (RM$800,000) has been repaid by Sincere Pacific as of the date of this filing. Through June 30, 2018, SBS has received revenue of $84,271 (RM$350,306) in commissions from Sincere Pacific from its bauxite trading operations. No sales were made by Sincere Pacific under the agreement in the year ended June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2022 and therefore no commissions were received by the Company during the year ended June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2022. 

Sea Sand Mining 

On August 30, 2017, SBS entered into an agreement with JHW Holdings Sdn. Bhd. (“JHW”), whereby JHW applied for and obtain a three (3) year mining concession from the Malaysian government to mine and dredge sea sand on the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia, effective beginning in January 2019. JHW was first granted a concession with an area of 1,113km², which was later amended and reduced to 383km². The final approved area is 20.48km² within the jurisdiction of the state of Terengganu, Malaysia (the “Area”). Pursuant to the agreement, JHW was responsible for carrying out and submitting to the relevant authorities all necessary study reports, including, but not limited to, Environmental Impact Assessment (“EIA”) reports and feasibility and hydraulic studies with respect to the Area to obtain approval for the sea sand mining and dredging license (the “Final Approval”). SBS was responsible for bearing all costs and expenses incurred with respect to such application, and for providing all the required technical assistance with obtaining the concession licenses. In exchange for covering all costs and expenses in connection with the obtainment of the Final Approval, JHW granted SBS the exclusive right to develop, carry out and operate all mining and extraction activities in the Area, and to manage all matters related to the operation and extraction of sea sand, either by itself or by a nominee. Gross profits from operations of the mining activities in the Area shall be allocated 25% to JHW and 75% to SBS pursuant to the terms of the agreement. In addition, SBS was required to prepay an advance of MYR 500,000 of future net incomes to JHW. As of June 30, 2022, SBS had paid MYR 250,000 (approximately USD $60,000) to JHW, the residual MYR 250,000, remain outstanding and will be paid once operations commence.

SBS and JHW fulfilled all regulatory requirements and obtained the necessary approvals from all governmental agencies, including Department of Environment (“DOE”) (Jabatan Alam Sekitar), Department of Mineral and Geoscience Malaysia (“JMG”) (Jabatan Mineral dan Geosains Malaysia) and all 13 agencies under the jurisdiction of the state and federal governments of Malaysia for the three (3) year concession in January of 2019.

The Final Approval of the sea sand mining and dredging license was obtained on January 10, 2019. The license expired on January 9, 2022; and has since then been renewed for an additional three (3) year period, commencing in August 2, 2022 and ending in August 1, 2025. The Company, who has been focusing its commercial efforts on its sea sand mining and dredging operations, expects to export sea sand mined from the Area to China, Japan and Hong Kong. 

On May 27, 2022, SBS entered into a sea sand sub-operator mining agreement with One Standard Continent SDN BHD (the “Sub-operator Agreement”). The Sub-operator Agreement was executed pursuant to a power of attorney entered into between SBS and One Standard Continent SDN BHD (“OSC”) on December 10, 2021, whereby OSC was granted the right to carry out dredging, removal, transportation, exploration and sale of natural sea sand from a sea area of 325.30 sq. km (the “Specified Area”). The Specified Area would be divided into separate areas to apply and obtain separate mining licenses (the “Concession Area”).

Under the terms of the Sub-operator Agreement, OSC will bear all costs and expenses incurred by SBS to carry out and submit all environmental impact and feasibility studies and other surveys as may be required to obtain the approval of a mining license. SBS granted OSC the exclusive right to manage, operate, develop and carry out mining activities within the Specified Area.

As consideration for the exclusive right to manage and operate mining activities in the Specified Area, OSC paid SBS a retainer fee of RM550,000 (the “Retainer Fee”). OSC may claim refunds for the Retainer Fee, through set off of the Tribute Fee (as defined below) payable by OSC to SBS for the last few shipments upon completion of the first Concession Area or upon expiration or termination of the Sub-operator Agreement. In addition to the Retainer Fee, SBS shall be entitled to receive RM11.50 for every metric cube of sea sand dredged, removed, transported, exported and sold from the Concession Area (the “Tribute Fee”).  Subsequent to this, the Company and OSC entered into a verbal agreement, in which OSC agreed to remit to the Company, upon receiving a power of attorney RM 2 million (approximately $450,000 USD) and further upon signing of a concession related agreement a further RM 3.15 million (approximately $715,000 USD).

Upon the issuance of a mining license for any given Concession Area, SBS will obtain all approvals required to guarantee OSC a legally workable operation and export. OSC shall pay SBS, in advance, the first Tribute Fee calculated on the basis of 200,000 cubic meters of sea sand sold within 21 days of the issuance of the mining license. OSC shall dredge, remove, transport, export and sale a monthly minimum of 600,000 cubic meters of sea sand from the Concession Area (the “Minimum Quantity”). OSC shall pay SBS the Tribute Fee calculated on the Minimum Quantity on the 14th day of every calendar month, commencing on the second month after the commencement of operations by OSC in the Concession Area. If the monthly sales exceed the Minimum Quantity, OSC shall pay the difference to SBS. 

Entry into Letter of Intent of Granite Mining Business

On January 17, 2019, we entered into a Letter of Intent with Pembinaan Kaya Hebat Sdn Bhd, a Malaysian corporation engaged in granite mining business (“PKH”), for the acquisition by us of up to one hundred percent (100%) of the issued and outstanding capital stock of PKH at its fair market value (the “PKH Acquisition”). The completion of the PKH Acquisition is subject to various conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, negotiating and executing a form of purchase agreement that is acceptable to both parties, approval of the financial statements of both parties’ boards of directors, and fair market valuation of PKH. If we are able to complete the PKH Acquisition, we intend to operate PKH as a wholly owned subsidiary or a majority-owned subsidiary. As of the date of this report, the PKH acquisition is still under negotiations. If the PKH acquisition is completed, it will trigger additional disclosure in subsequent reports and our financial statements. 

NAMI Corp. aspires to become a globally diversified mining company and is actively engaged in expansion plans by engaging with prospective mining businesses.

River Sand Mining

On September 6, 2019, SBS entered into a mining agreement with Wan Ismail bin Wan Ahmad (the “Donor”) pursuant to which the Donor granted to SBS the sole and exclusive rights to mine for river sand and other materials from a 1.9040-hectare (4.7 acre) plot of land located at Kampung Tiram, district of Kuala Kuantan, Kuantan, Malaysia (the “Concession”) for which the Donor had received a lease license from the State Government of Pahang. SBS shall pay the Donor a fixed monthly rate for the sole and exclusive rights to mine the Concession.

With the grant of the sole and exclusive rights of the aforementioned mining concession for river sand, the Company will expand its current business portfolio to river sand mining and trading. Meanwhile, the Company plans to continue acquiring strategic mining concessions to enhance its river sand mining division.

OUR INDUSTRY

Bauxite Trading 

In 2015, Malaysia exported 24.3 million tons of bauxite, resulting in $1.1 billion of revenue to exporters. China accounted for 99% of Malaysia’s export of bauxite. In 2016, the government of Malaysia banned all bauxite mining activities due to environmental concerns and ordered the clearing of the country’s stockpiled inventory of bauxite, requiring all exports to be done pursuant to approved permits issued by the Malaysian government (“Approved Permits”).2 As a result, Malaysia exported just 7.4 million metric tons of bauxite in 2016. The ban on the mining of bauxite in Malaysia lasted for three years and was finally lifted in April 2019. The total approximate amount of exported bauxite in 2018 decreased significantly to 515,217 tons as compared to 822,668 tons of bauxite exported in 2017.

Sincere Pacific currently holds an Approved Permit to export bauxite, which ensures the company applies sustainable mining practices to avoid environmental damage. 

Car manufacturers are the worlds’ number one industrial consumers of aluminum, using 18% of all aluminum consumed worldwide in 2019. The industry’s demand for aluminum is forecasted to double by 2050 as car manufacturers increase the use of this lightweight metal in order to improve battery performance in electric vehicles. China now dominates the global production of aluminum. In the first half of 2020, China imported 58.3 million tons of bauxite, up 30.3% when compared to 2019, and in the past five years, China’s bauxite imports have grown at an annual rate of 20%. Industry experts predict that this trend will continue to grow and that China’s reliance on imported bauxite for its internal aluminum production may increase from the current 50% to reach 80% in the coming years.

Sea Sand Mining 

The process of sea sand mining is extracting sand from the ocean bed with heavy machinery. Then sands are dredged and stored into bunkers or vessels that will be shipped to a buyer’s destination. In commercial businesses, sands are mainly used as construction materials (e.g., brick, concrete, and roads) and for land reclamation (also known as landfills). 

The demand for sea sand has soared globally, mostly for industrial and land reclamation purposes. According to the United Nations Commodity Trade Statistics Database (UN COMTRADE), the international trade value of sea sand has increased six-fold in the last 25 years. The Department of Mineral & Geoscience Malaysia reported that out of 36.7 million tons of sea sand produced in Malaysia in 2017, 1.5 million tons were exported, almost exclusively to Singapore.

On October 3, 2018, Malaysia banned all exports of sea sand due to environmental concerns, to satisfy domestic demand, and to clamp down on illegal sand smuggling. Nowadays, sea sand can only be exported from Malaysia under a specific export Approved Permit. Our partner, JHW, holds this export Approved Permit. Under the terms of JHW’s export Approved Permit, we can export up to 19,640,000m3 of sea sand. JHW applied for and obtained the export Approved Permit on April 9, 2021. The Approved Permit expired on January 9, 2022. Subsequent to June 30, 2022, the Approved Permit was renewed for an additional three year period, commencing on August 2, 2022 and ending in August 1, 2025

River Sand Mining

River sand can originate from a wide variety of sources such as from decomposed igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks; deposits of glacial sands or deposits of ancient sea sands in the form of uplifted or stranded beaches. Sands from rivers are a preferred source.

Apart from Perlis and Melaka, all other Malay states contributed to the production of river sand in 2017. Local demand is expected to increase from the revival of mega projects that were halted previously such as the Bandar Malaysia and East Coast Rail Link and Light Rail Transit 3 (“LRT 3”) projects. Bandar Malaysia’s development, which occupies the former airport in Sungai Besi, is estimated to be 196 hectares in size and will include 10,000 affordable housing units, a people’s park and priority for the use of local content and materials. Completion date is not confirmed yet but development is expected to take 20 years to complete. Tech giants such as Alibaba and Huawei have also expressed interest in establishing their ICT centers in Bandar Malaysia. 

Another project that received the green light in April 2019 is the East Coast Rail Link (the “ECRL”). The ECRL is a key railway project consisting of 655 kilometers of railways connecting the eastern coast of Malaysia with the western part of the country. The project is expected to be completed in December 2026. 

Competition

Currently, we do not have any direct competition with respect to the specific properties to which our respective partners, Sincere Pacific, JHW and Donor hold licenses. Sincere Pacific is one of the few holders of Approved Permits in Malaysia to export bauxite. It has little competition in terms of purchasing and exporting bauxite.

In terms of developing our business plan and conducting exploration and later deposit development, we expect to compete for qualified geological and environmental experts to assist us in our exploration of mining prospects, as well as any other consultants, employees and equipment that we may require in order to conduct our operations.

Currently, there is significant competition for financial capital to be deployed in mining and material extraction. Therefore, it is difficult for smaller companies such as us to attract investment for our exploration activities. We cannot give any assurances that we will be able to compete for capital funds; and without adequate financial resources, we cannot assure our investors or shareholders that the Company will be able to compete in exploration activities and ultimately in material deposit development, production and sales.

Markets, Sales and Distribution

JHW and SBS received the sea sand mining and dredging license on January 10, 2019. The license expired on January 9, 2022; and was renewed for an additional three-year period, commencing on August 2, 2022 and ending in August 1, 2025. The license permits JHW to export sea sand to China, Hong Kong and Japan. We plan to distribute and sell sea sand to customers in these locations.

11

Intellectual Property

SBS has no significant intellectual property as of the date of this filing. 

Regulation

Because our sole operating subsidiary SBS is located in Malaysia, our business is regulated by the national and local laws of Malaysia. We believe our conduct of business complies with existing Malaysia laws, rules and regulations.

Bauxite exports require Approved Permits issued by the Ministry of Malaysia. Sincere Pacific was issued an Approved Permit that can be renewed with the Malaysian government.

The exploration and development of a mining prospect in Malaysia is subject to regulation by a number of governmental authorities. The regulations address many environmental issues relating to air, soil and water contamination and apply to many mining-related activities, including exploration, mine construction, mineral and ore extraction, ore milling, water use, waste disposal and use of toxic substances. 


· | The Mineral Development Act of 1994 (“MDA”) defines the powers of the Federal Government on matters pertaining to the inspection and regulation of mineral exploration, mining and other related issues. The legislation is enforced by the Department of Minerals and Geosciences of Malaysia.

· | The State Mineral Enactment (“SME”) provides that each State has its own legislation to govern mining activities within its jurisdiction. The SME provides the States with the powers and rights to issue mineral prospecting and exploration licenses, mining leases, and other related matters. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | The Continental Shelf Act of 1966 (“CSA”) relates to the continental shelf of Malaysia, the exploration thereof and the exploitation of its natural resources. The CSA regulates applications for licenses that permit mining activities on the continental shelf. 
· | The Customs Act 1967 regulates the import and export of goods, with the clearance of import, export and transit of goods coming under the purview of Royal Malaysian Customs Department (“RMCD”). Some products require a license or Approved Permit (“AP”) before importing or exporting. Sand is among the products that need a license or AP to export. APs are issued by Permit Issuing Agencies (“PIAs”), which are the relevant ministries relating to the products being exported or imported, the AP for sand export is issued by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment.


In addition, we are subject to regulations relating to labor standards, occupational health and safety, mine safety, general land use, export of minerals and taxation. Many of the regulations require permits or licenses to be obtained and the filing of certain notices, the absence of which, or the inability to obtain, will adversely affect the ability for us to conduct our exploration, development and operation activities. The failure to comply with the regulations and terms of permits and licenses may result in fines or other penalties or in revocation of a permit or license or loss of a prospect.

Insurance

Insurance companies in Malaysia offer limited business insurance products. While business interruption insurance is available to a limited extent in Malaysia, we have determined that the risks of interruption, the cost of such insurance and the difficulties associated with acquiring such insurance on commercially reasonable terms make it impractical for us to have such insurance. As a result, we are subject to risk inherent to our business, including equipment failure, theft, natural disasters, industrial accidents, labor disturbances, business interruptions, property damage, product liability, personal injury and death. Furthermore, if we suffer losses, damages or liabilities, including those caused by natural disasters or other events beyond our control and we are unable to make a claim against a third party, we will be required to bear all such losses from our own funds, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Principal Address
