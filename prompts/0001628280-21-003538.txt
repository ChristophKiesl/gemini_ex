ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We are a technology company focused on providing sustainable and cost-effective solutions to the commercial transportation sector. As an American manufacturer, we create all-electric delivery trucks and drone systems, including the technology that optimizes the way these mechanisms operate. We are last-mile delivery’s first purpose-built electric mobility solution and we are currently focused on our core competency of bringing the C-Series electric delivery trucks to market and fulfilling our existing backlog of orders.
Automotive
We are an Original Equipment Manufacturer (“OEM”) with goals to have a product line that satisfies the Class 2-6 commercial-grade, medium-duty truck market. They will be marketed under the Workhorse® brand. All Workhorse last-mile delivery trucks are assembled in the Union City facility.
We believe our all-electric commercial vehicles offer fleet operators significant benefits, which include:
•Lower total cost-of-ownership as compared to conventional gas/diesel vehicles;
•Improved profitability through lower maintenance costs and reduced fuel expenses;
•Increased package deliveries per day through use of more efficient delivery methods;
•Decreased vehicle emissions and reduction in carbon footprint; and
•Improved vehicle safety and driver experience.
The Company sells its vehicles to fleet customers through its distributors, Hitachi Capital America (“Hitachi”), Ryder System, Inc. (“Ryder”) and Pritchard Companies (“Pritchard”). Both Ryder and Pritchard are maintenance providers for Workhorse, which provides fleet operators access to their maintenance facilities.
Delivery Trucks for Last-Mile Delivery and Commercial Work Use
Workhorse delivery trucks are used by our customers on daily routes across the United States. To date, we have built and delivered approximately 370 electric and range-extended medium-duty delivery trucks to our customers. To our knowledge, we are the only American commercial electric vehicle OEM to achieve such a milestone. Our customers include companies such as Alpha Baking, FedEx Express, Fluid Market, Inc., Pride Group Enterprises, Pritchard, Ryder, United Parcel Service (“UPS”), and W.B. Mason.
In addition to improved fuel economy, we anticipate the performance of our vehicles will reduce long-term vehicle maintenance expense by approximately 60% as compared to fossil-fueled trucks. Over a 20-year vehicle life, we estimate our C-Series delivery trucks will save over $170,000 in fuel and maintenance savings. We expect that fleet operators will be able to achieve a three-year or better total cost of ownership break-even without government incentives.
C-Series Electric Delivery Truck
Workhorse announced the development of its C-Series electric delivery truck in 2017, which leverages the existing ultra-low floor, and long-life commercial delivery vehicle platform, as well as our extensive customer experience gained from working with our E-GEN and E-100 customers. The C-Series incorporates lightweight materials, best in class turning radius, 360° cameras, collision avoidance systems and an optional roof mounted HorseFly delivery drone.
The C-Series electric delivery truck platform is available in 650 and 1,000 cubic feet configurations. We also have plans for a high-ceiling class 2 van, which competes with conventional market leaders including the Mercedes Sprinter, Ford Transit and Dodge ProMaster gasoline/diesel vans for both last-mile delivery and other service-oriented applications such as telecommunications. Based on lab testing, we expect these vehicles to achieve a fuel economy of approximately 40 miles per 
gallon equivalent (“MPGe”) and offer fleet operators the most favorable total cost-of-ownership of any comparable conventional truck utilizing an internal combustion engine that is available today.
U.S. Post Office Replenishment Program / Next Generation Delivery Vehicle Project
Workhorse was one of the five participants that the United States Postal Service (“USPS”) selected to build prototype vehicles for the USPS Next Generation Delivery Vehicle (“NGDV”) project. The USPS has publicly stated that approximately 165,000 vehicles are to be replaced. Workhorse delivered six vehicles for prototype testing under the NGDV Acquisition Program in compliance with the terms set forth in their USPS prototype contract. On February 23, 2021, the USPS announced it awarded a contract to Oshkosh Defense to assemble 50,000 to 165,000 vehicles over the next ten years. 
Technology
HorseFly™
Our HorseFly Unmanned Aerial System (“UAS”) is a custom-designed, purpose-built, all-electric drone system that is incorporated into our trucks and safely and efficiently delivers packages. HorseFly is designed with a maximum gross weight of 30 lbs., a 10 lb. payload and a maximum air speed of 50 mph. Our first aircraft can deliver a meaningful payload up to 10 miles, automatically lowering packages safely from 50 feet above the delivery point via our proprietary winch system. It is designed and built to be rugged and consisting of redundant systems to further meet the FAA’s required rules and regulations. Workhorse was granted a patent on our UAS, and though initially designed as a complimentary system delivering packages from our electric trucks, the latest iteration of our UAS supports package delivery point-to-point, enabling deliveries to and from almost anywhere, allowing it to serve a broader customer base. As part of the divestiture of SureFly, the Company formed a 50/50 joint venture to which we contributed our HorseFly technology.
Our HorseFly system includes an aircraft, Ground Control Station (“GCS”) and the supporting takeoff, landing and cargo handling systems. Our rugged components are designed to support the high volumes, long duty days and ease of maintenance demanded by the commercial package delivery industry. When properly equipped and certificated, the system allows Remote Pilots in Command (“RPIC”) to control more than one aircraft simultaneously. 
Our GCS enables safe, simple flight planning, precise control of the aircraft, and it includes an elegant and friendly customer interface. When a customer opts in for our delivery service, they can “drop a pin” and choose where we deliver on their property. We text customers when our aircraft are inbound to their address. If they cannot accept delivery for some reason, the system allows them to decline that delivery. Our aircraft returns to its launch point, and the customer can reschedule the delivery to a more convenient time. 
In 2020, Workhorse began the Federal Aviation Administration’s (“FAA”) Type Certification process for our Horsefly UAS. Type certification will be a major point of differentiation in the delivery drone marketplace. Safety, reliability and capability are the primary points of value in a commercial UAS. Presently, the FAA allows some exceptions for commercial operations to use non-certificated drone systems. As the industry matures, we expect the FAA will require certificated aircraft in most commercial operations.
In tests and demonstrations over the past three years, Workhorse has flown thousands of missions in the National Airspace System, demonstrating package deliveries for large multi-national companies including UPS in Ohio, Michigan, Florida and California. Our aircraft has proven to be safe, reliable, and capable of delivering packages.
Metron
Additionally, we have developed a cloud-based, remote management system to manage and track the performance of all of the vehicles we deploy in order to provide a real-time solution for fleet managers.
The telematics system and associated hardware installed in the Workhorse vehicles is designed to monitor the controller area network traffic for specific signals. These signals are uploaded along with GPS data to a Workhorse server facility where the data signals are tracked at ten second intervals while driving and during the electricity generating process and at sixty seconds during a plug-in charge. The real-time data is stored in a database as it arrives and delivers updates to clients connected through a web interface. We are moving to a ".Net" platform for more robust back-end tools and web support.
As a parameter-based system, we can set route-specific parameters to better manage the battery-provided power with the additional power generated through the regenerative braking process. In an upcoming release, we will add the ability to 
integrate Metron Telematics with the client’s internal telematics system and automatically update the parameters each day with information about the route. This enhancement will result in a “SMART-GEN” vehicle that will maximize efficiency by automating the process to determine the ideal times and locations to use the C-Series to add electricity to the batteries.
In-House Software Development
Our powertrain encompasses the complete motor assemblies, computers, and software required for vehicle electrification. We use off-the-shelf components and combine them with our proprietary software.
Locations and Facilities
Our company headquarters and research and development facility is located at 100 Commerce Drive, Loveland, Ohio. We also lease office and warehouse space at 119 Northeast Drive, Loveland, Ohio.
Our truck assembly facility is located in Union City, Indiana. This facility consists of three buildings with 250,000 square feet of manufacturing and office space.
Marketing
There are over 350,000 last-mile delivery trucks replaced annually and is the fastest growing vehicle market in an $18.0 billion market space. Our sales team is focused on securing purchase orders from commercial transportation companies and developing a dealer network through our relationships with Hitachi, Ryder and Pritchard.
We have established the commercial delivery truck as our core business and intend to be the best choice for a vehicle in this segment. Our sales plan is to meet with the top potential customers and obtain purchase orders for new electric vehicles to be manufactured in our production facility. 
As the last-mile delivery service space expands and non-traditional customers enter, Workhorse is reaching out to those potential new customers to gain product acceptance as their last-mile delivery partner. This market is comprised of a higher quantity of smaller delivery vehicles, such as the Workhorse C650, a 650-cubic feet platform or a high-ceiling class 2 van.
Finally, we believe that our competitive advantage in the marketplace is our ability to provide purpose-built solutions to customers that have unique requirements at relatively low volume. 
Strategic Relationships 
Hitachi: The Company engaged Hitachi for an operations assessment study focused on the evaluation of the strategies to increase our production output. In addition, Hitachi is working as a sales force on behalf of Workhorse and approaching their dealer relationships to drive orders of Workhorse trucks. Hitachi can provide inventory financing for these dealers as well as bundled financing, infrastructure support and service products.
Ryder: The Company has an agreement with Ryder to serve as a distributor. Ryder also serves as a provider of certain repair services and distributor of certain vehicle parts in the United States, Canada and Mexico.
Duke Energy Corp.: Workhorse continues working in partnership with Duke Energy Corp ("Duke") in creating an innovative battery leasing program designed to provide customers a cost competitive electric vehicle product alternative. Duke intends to explore further development of eFleet solutions to Workhorse customers which may include single-point management and financing of all the Behind the Meter infrastructure necessary to support depot wide electrification, vehicle/battery leasing and distributed energy resources. Duke and Workhorse believe a seamless/integrated solution will help reduce the overall costs of converting fleets to electric power enabling faster adoption of electric vehicles into commercial fleets.
Moog: The Company and Moog entered into a joint venture agreement for the development of the Company's Horsefly truck based electrically powered unmanned aerial systems (the "Horsefly Assets") and the related business (the “Horsefly Agreement”). Under the Horsefly Agreement, the Company contributed the Horsefly Assets and Moog contributed certain complementary assets to Certus Unmanned Aerial Systems LLC, (“Certus”) that is 50% owned by both the Company and Moog. Certus will license the Horsefly Assets to the Company and Moog so that each party may use the Horsefly Assets in their respective businesses. Through Certus, teams from Workhorse and Moog are improving HorseFly’s components and sub-systems with the goal of bringing the highest quality, most capable UAS to market. We believe combining the capabilities of the two companies brings significant value to the UAS marketplace, particularly in the area of high-reliability, safety-sensitive, certificated systems that require the highest levels of government approval for operations.
Research and Development
The majority of our research and development is conducted in-house at our facilities near Cincinnati, Ohio. Additionally, we contract with engineering firms to assist with validation and certification requirements as well as specific vehicle integration tasks. Our research and development activity has focused on improving the new model year C-Series, including enhancements needed to support production assembly efficiency, material component availability, cost reduction and customer feedback. These new revisions incorporate an aluminum skateboard chassis, which improves the options we have to expand our production capabilities and our sales growth through expanded channels that include specialty body builders and other third party up-fitters.
Competition
Traditional OEMs
Most, if not all, traditional OEM's have made announcements about their electrification efforts, which have primarily been highly focused on consumer-based vehicles, although due to a shift in consumer behavior stemming from the pandemic, there has been an increased focus on the commercial space in 2020. So far, the plans have primarily been focused on the lighter and smaller, last mile vehicles, such as Ford with their Transit Connect and eventually larger Transit models, or General Motors with their recent unveiling of the EV600. All of these vehicles have 600 cubic feet or less of cargo capacity. Workhorse is focused on the 650 - 1200 cubic feet categories. Our market research and direct customer engagements have led us to provide value to some of the largest and most efficient last mile delivery companies in North America. In this larger size category, customers would normally go to Freightliner, who has started providing a stripped chassis with an electric drive-train, built by a third-party similar to the Workhorse chassis produced until 2018. To our knowledge, Ford, another OEM producing such stripped chassis, has yet to announce any electrification plans within this segment, leaving Workhorse with little current competition from traditional OEMs.
Non-Traditional OEMs
As a result of the COVID pandemic, there has been a rapid global shift towards home delivery with multiple companies seeking to provide delivery solutions aimed at a sub 600 cubic feet cargo area. It is our expectation that the non-traditional OEMs will compete head-to-head with the likes of GM, Daimler and Ford, while the 650 - 1200 cubic feet cargo capacity space is left largely ignored. We believe one of the main reasons for this race towards smaller vehicles is to get to a sub 10,000 pound gross vehicle weight (“GVW”) as vehicles above 10,000 pound GVW require a more expensive but also more professional driver pool.
Regulatory
Our electric vehicles are designed to comply with required government regulations and industry standards. Government regulations regarding the manufacture, sale and implementation of products and systems similar to our electric vehicles are subject to future change. We cannot predict what impact, if any, such changes may have on our business.
Emission and fuel economy standards
Government regulation related to climate change is in effect at the U.S. federal and state levels. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) issued a final rule for greenhouse gas emissions and fuel economy requirements for trucks and heavy-duty engines on August 9, 2011, which is applicable for model years 2018 through 2020. EPA and NHTSA also issued a final rule on August 16, 2016 increasing the stringency of these standards for model years 2021 through 2027.
The rules provide emission standards for CO2 and fuel consumption standards for three main categories of vehicles: (i) combination tractors; (ii) heavy-duty pickup trucks and vans; and (iii) vocational vehicles. We believe Workhorse vehicles would be considered “vocational vehicles” and “heavy-duty pickup trucks and vans” under the rules. According to the EPA and NHTSA, vocational vehicles consist of a wide variety of truck and bus types, including delivery, refuse, utility, dump, cement, transit bus, shuttle bus, school bus, emergency vehicles, motor homes and tow trucks, and are characterized by a complex build process, with an incomplete chassis often built with an engine and transmission purchased from other manufacturers, then sold to a body manufacturer.
The EPA and NHTSA rule also establishes multiple flexibility and incentive programs for manufacturers of alternatively fueled vehicles, such as the Workhorse vehicles, including an engine Averaging, Banking and Trading (“ABT”) program, a vehicle 
ABT program and additional credit programs for early adoption of standards or deployment of advanced or innovative technologies. The ABT programs will allow for emission and/or fuel consumption credits to be averaged, banked or traded within defined groupings of the regulatory subcategories. The additional credit programs will allow manufacturers of engines and vehicles to be eligible to generate credits if they demonstrate improvements in excess of the standards established in the rule prior to the model year the standards become effective or if they introduce advanced or innovative technology engines or vehicles.
The Clean Air Act requires that we obtain a Certificate of Conformity (“CoC”) issued by the EPA and a California Executive Order issued by the California Air Resource Board (“CARB”) with respect to emissions and mileage requirements for our vehicles. Workhorse received its CoC from the EPA for both model year (“MY”) 2020 and MY2021 C-Series. The CoC is required for vehicles sold in states covered by the Clean Air Act’s standards and the Executive Order is required for vehicles sold in states that have sought and received a waiver from the EPA to utilize California standards. The California standards for emissions control for certain regulated pollutants for new vehicles and engines sold in California are set by CARB. States that have adopted the California standards as approved by EPA also recognize the Executive Order for sales of vehicles. Workhorse received Executive Order A-445-0003 for MY2020 vehicles and Executive Order A-445-0004 for MY2021 vehicles.
Vehicle safety and testing
The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 (the “Safety Act”) regulates motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment in the United States in two primary ways. First, the Safety Act prohibits the sale in the United States of any new vehicle or equipment that does not conform to applicable motor vehicle safety standards established by NHTSA. Meeting or exceeding many safety standards is costly, in part because the standards tend to conflict with the need to reduce vehicle weight in order to meet emissions and fuel economy standards. Second, the Safety Act requires defects related to motor vehicle safety be remedied through safety recall campaigns. A manufacturer is obligated to recall vehicles if it determines the vehicles do not comply with a safety standard. Should we or NHTSA determine either a safety defect or noncompliance exists with respect to any of our vehicles, the cost of such recall campaigns could be substantial.
In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulates almost everything any customer can do with our aerospace vehicles. Those regulations govern two important areas: operating rules and aircraft certification rules. The FAA’s operating rules govern all operations of all aerial vehicles in the National Airspace System (NAS) of the United States. The FAA’s certification rules help define the safety and reliability requirements of certain aircraft and systems. Not every aircraft and system are required to be FAA certificated, though typically certification is required for commercial operations like package delivery. 
Workhorse is applying for FAA Type Certification for its small unmanned aerial system, the HorseFly. We believe it is important to achieve FAA certification of our products. Though we believe our design and execution comply with FAA requirements for certification, should we or the FAA determine either a safety defect or noncompliance exist with respect to our aircraft or its systems, it could add substantially to the time and expense of certification. Should the FAA change its rules for either certification or operations, it could render our designs non-competitive in the marketplace. 
Vehicle dealer and distribution regulation
Certain state and city laws require motor vehicle manufacturers and dealers to be licensed in such locations to conduct manufacturing and sales activities. To date, we are registered as a motor vehicle manufacturer in Indiana and Ohio and as a dealer in California, New York, Iowa and Chicago. We have not yet sought formal clarification of our ability to manufacture or sell our vehicles in any other states or cities.
