ITEM 1. BUSINESS
History
 
Environmental Control Corp. (“we,” “us,” the “Company” or like terms) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 17, 2004 under the name Boss Minerals, Inc. to pursue the exploration and development of mining claims located in British Columbia, Canada. 
 
During the quarter ended June 30, 2004, the Company filed a registration statement on Form SB-2 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) to register shares of common stock for public resale by certain stockholders identified in the registration statement. Upon the effective date of the registration statement, the Company became subject to the reporting requirements of Section 12(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) and commenced filing reports under the Exchange Act through the quarter ended June 30, 2012. 
 
In March 2006, the Company acquired the assets of Environmental Control Corporation, which developed vehicle emission control devices and filed a certificate of amendment to its articles of incorporation in April 2013 to change its name to Environmental Control Corp. The Company filed reports under the Exchange Act through the quarter ended June 30, 2012.
 
On May 2, 2016, the Eight Judicial District Court of Nevada entered an order appointing Bryan Glass as custodian of the Company, authorizing and directing him to, among other things, take any action reasonable, prudent and for the benefit of the Company, including reinstating the Company under Nevada law, appointing officers and convening an annual meeting of stockholders (the “Order”). Mr. Glass was a shareholder of the Company on the date that he applied to serve as a custodian of the Company. From time to time, Mr. Glass submits applications to the courts of the state of Nevada to be appointed as the custodian of corporations in which he already is a shareholder that have forfeited their right to exist as a corporation for reasons such as failure to file annual reports or to pay required fees, and such applications may or may not be successful. If the court approves the application, Mr. Glass is appointed to serve as the custodian of such corporations. In the past, he either has contributed assets or sold them to third parties. Thereafter, the board of directors and Mr. Glass, in his role as custodian, appointed himself to serve as the President of the Company.
 
On May 5, 2016, the Company filed a Certificate of Reinstatement with the state of Nevada to reestablish the Company’s existence.
 
On May 9, 2016, the board of directors and Bryan Glass, in the exercise of his power as the court-appointed custodian of the Company, appointed Bryan Glass as our President, Secretary and Treasurer and authorized the issuance of 60,000,000 shares of stock to Mr. Glass for an aggregate price of $60,000, which sum was paid by the performance of services to the Company and the reimbursement of expenses incurred by Mr. Glass on the Company’s behalf in the amount of $6,685. The expenses incurred by Mr. Glass included $5,160 to the state of Nevada for fees in connection with reinstating the Company and other filings to bring the Company current under the requirements of Nevada corporate law; $1,250 to the transfer agent for outstanding fees; and $275 to the state of Nevada as a filing fee in connection with the amendment to the articles of incorporation.
 
On June 15, 2016, the Company held a stockholders meeting at which the stockholders adopted Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Company under which the Company increased the total number of shares it is authorized to issue to 190 million shares consisting of 180 million shares of common stock and 10 million shares of blank check preferred stock. 
 
In December 2018, Mr. Glass sold 60 million shares of common stock, representing all of the shares he owned in the Company, and equal to 56.83% of the total number of outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock, to Lili Xin for the sum of $90,000. Ms. Chang became acquainted with Mr. Glass through a mutual associate and they subsequently negotiated a deal for his control bloc of shares in the Company. Concurrent with the sale of his shares, the board of directors appointed Ms. Chang as the President and as a director of the Company and resigned from all positions he held with the Company.
 
On May 22, 2019, the Company filed a Form 15 with the SEC terminating the registration of its class of common stock under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and its duty to file periodic and other reports with the SEC.

On October 29, 2020, Chang Qi voluntarily resigned as a director and officer of the Company for personal reasons. She did not resign because of any disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company’s operations, policies or practices, or if a director has been removed for cause from the board of directors, disclose the following information. 
 
Prior to her departure as a director and officer of the Company, on October 29, 2020, Ms. Chang appointed Lili Xin to serve as the sole director and as the president of the Company.
 
As of the date of this Report, Ms. Xin serves as our only director and officer.
 
Current Operations and Strategy
 
The Company currently does not engage in any business operations or generate revenue from any sources. Management has determined to direct its efforts and limited resources to pursue a potential new business opportunity by way of a merger or acquisition with an unidentified company or an acquisition of assets, or other form of business combination which we refer to collectively throughout this Report as a business transaction. 
 
We anticipate that the selection of an appropriate target for a business transaction will be complex and extremely risky and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in concluding a business transaction or if we do, that we will be successful thereafter. Our lack of financial and personnel resources may negatively impact our ability to consummate an attractive business transaction or cause us to discontinue operations before we enter such a transaction. 
 
We do not have any specific business transaction under consideration. We have not identified or been provided with the identity of, or had any direct or indirect contact with, potential targets. Additionally, we have not engaged or retained any agent or other representative to identify or locate a suitable target, although we may do so after the effective date of this Report. Our efforts to identify a prospective target business will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic location.
 
We will not engage in any substantive commercial business following the effective date of this Report until we identify a target and conclude a business transaction, if ever. We may never realize any revenues or generate any income from our operations.
 
Ramifications of Our Status as a Blank Check Company and Shell Company
 
At present, we have no revenues, no assets and no specific business plan or purpose. Our business plan is to seek new business opportunities by entering into a business transaction. Based upon these conditions, under the Exchange Act, we are deemed to be “blank check” company and a “shell company.” Our status as a blank check company and a shell company will impact our Company and stockholders in many ways, some of which are described below.
Blank Check Company Status and Securities Offerings
 
As a blank check company, any offerings of our securities under the Securities Act must comply with Rule 419 promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act. Rule 419 requires that a blank check company filing a registration statement deposit the securities being offered and proceeds of the offering into an escrow or trust account pending the execution of an agreement for an acquisition or merger. In addition, an issuer is required to file a post-effective amendment to the registration statement upon the execution of an agreement for such acquisition or merger. The rule provides procedures for the release of the offering funds in conjunction with the post effective acquisition or merger. The obligations to file post-effective amendments are in addition to the obligations to file Forms 8-K to report for both the entry into a material definitive (non-ordinary course of business) agreement and the completion of the transaction. Rule 419 applies to both primary and re-sale or secondary offerings. Within five (5) days of filing a post-effective amendment setting forth the proposed terms of an acquisition, the Company must notify each investor whose shares are in escrow. Each investor then has no fewer than 20 and no greater than 45 business days to notify the Company in writing if they elect to remain an investor. A failure to reply indicates that the person has elected to not remain an investor. As all investors are allotted this second opportunity to determine to remain an investor, acquisition agreements should be conditioned upon enough funds remaining in escrow to close the transaction.

Shell Company Status
 
We are a shell company as defined in Rule 405 promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act. A shell company is one that has no or nominal operations and either: (i) no or nominal assets; or (ii) assets consisting primarily of cash or cash equivalents. As a shell company, we are subject to various laws, regulations and restrictions, including that we will be subject to restrictions on our use of Form S-8 to register stock that we may issue to our employees and consultants and you will be subject to restrictions from relying on Rule 144 for the resale of your common stock, as described below.
 
Shell companies are prohibited from using Form S-8 to register securities under the Securities Act. If a company ceases to be a shell company, it may use Form S-8 sixty calendar days after the date on which it makes required filings with the SEC disclosing the cessation of its status as shell company, provided it has filed all reports and other materials required to be filed under the Exchange Act during the preceding 12 months (or for such shorter period that it has been required to file such reports and materials after the company files “Form 10 information,” which is information that a company would be required to file in a registration statement on Form 10 if it were registering a class of securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. This information would normally be reported on a current report on Form 8-K reporting the completion of a transaction that caused the company to cease being a Shell Company.
 
Rule 144 under the Act provides an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and allows the holders of restricted securities to sell their securities utilizing one of the provisions of this Rule. However, Rule 144 specifically precludes reliance by holders of securities of shell companies such as ours or any issuer that has been at any time previously a shell company, except if the following conditions are met:
 

· | The issuer of the securities that was formerly a shell company has ceased to be a shell company; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | The issuer of the securities is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act; 
· | The issuer of the securities has filed all Exchange Act reports and material required to be filed, as applicable, during the preceding 12 months (or such shorter period that the issuer was required to file such reports and materials), other than current reports on Form 8-K; and
· | At least one year has elapsed from the time that the issuer filed current comprehensive disclosure with the SEC reflecting its status as an entity that is not a shell company. 

 
As a result of our classification as a shell company, our investors are not permitted to rely on the “safe harbor” provisions of Rule 144, promulgated pursuant to the Securities Act, so as not to be considered underwriters in connection with the sale of our securities until one year from the date that we cease to be a shell company. This will likely make it more difficult for us to attract additional capital through subsequent unregistered offerings because purchasers of securities in such unregistered offerings will not be able to resell their securities in reliance on Rule 144, a safe harbor on which holders of restricted securities usually rely to resell securities.
 
Application of Penny Stock Rules
 
Our common stock is a “penny stock,” as defined in Rule 3a51-1 promulgated by the SEC under the Exchange Act. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, among other things, prior to a transaction in penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. A broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its sales person in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account. In addition, the penny stock rules require that the broker-dealer, not otherwise exempt from such rules, must make a special written determination that the penny stock is suitable for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure rules have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for a stock that becomes subject to the penny stock rules. So long as our common stock is subject to the penny stock rules, it may be more difficult for us and you to sell your common stock.

Benefits and Detriments of a Business Transaction for a Private Company
 
There are certain perceived benefits to being a public company the securities of which are authorized to trade in a public market. The perceived benefits to being a public trading company are commonly thought to include the following:
 

· | increased visibility in the financial community; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | increased valuation; 
· | greater ease in raising capital; 
· | compensation of key employees through stock options for which there may be a market valuation;
· | enhanced corporate image. 

 
There are also certain perceived disadvantages to being a public company. These are commonly thought to include the following:
 

· | requirement for audited financial statements which may be at significant cost to the company; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | required publication of corporate information and biographical information of management which the company may perceive as private or competitive information;
· | required filings of periodic and episodic reports with the SEC which can be time consuming. 

 
Private companies that may have interest in a combination with us may include the following:
 

· | a company for which a primary purpose of becoming public is the use of its securities for the acquisition of assets or businesses; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | a company which is unable to locate an underwriter of its securities or is unable to locate an underwriter of securities on terms acceptable to it; 
· | a company that desires to become public with potentially less dilution of its securities than may occur upon an underwritten offering; 
· | a company which believes that it will be able to obtain investment capital on more favorable terms after it has become public; 
· | a foreign company which may wish to gain initial entry into the United States’ securities market; 
· | a special situation company, such as a company seeking a public market to satisfy redemption requirements under a qualified employee stock option plan; and
· | a company seeking one or more of the other perceived benefits of becoming a public company. 

 
Entering into a Business Transaction
 
General.
 
A business transaction may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, an operating or development stage company or the acquisition of assets that we will develop into an operating company.
 
Our management has not developed a specific plan or process for identifying a business opportunity. Our business is predicated upon relationships built by management and the ongoing effort to develop new contacts through which our management may be introduced to prospective business opportunities. Moreover, given the wide-ranging variables inherent in our business, management cannot predict when we will effectuate a business transaction, if ever, or the amount of capital we will require for such purpose. 
 
Search for a target.
 
We are currently in the process of identifying and evaluating potential business opportunities. As described below, our management has broad discretion with respect to selecting prospective acquisition candidates. At such time as we affect a business transaction, if ever, we will be impacted by numerous risks inherent in the business and operations in connection with such business. The risks attendant to such business opportunity may include risks typical of a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stage of development or growth, including entities without established records of sales or earnings. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
 
Sources of business opportunities.
 
We intend to source our target opportunities from various internal and external sources. Business opportunities may be brought to our attention from affiliated and unaffiliated sources. Our management may call upon personal contacts and relationships she and her affiliates have developed and maintain with various professionals, including accountants, consultants, bankers, attorneys and other advisors. In addition, management may initiate formal or informal inquiries or attend trade shows or conventions. In no event will any of our affiliates be paid any finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to or for any services they render in connection with the consummation of a business transaction.

Business opportunities may be brought to our attention by unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to business opportunities in which they believe we may have an interest. We may retain the services of agents or other representatives to identify or locate suitable targets on our behalf, though, to date, we have not engaged any such persons. We have not adopted any policy with respect to utilizing the services of consultants or advisors to assist in the identification of a business opportunity, the criteria to be used in selecting such consultants or advisors, the services to be provided, the term of service or the amount of fees we may pay to them. In the event that we retain the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions, we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation.
 
Selection criteria for a business opportunity.
 
Our management has virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective target. We have not established any specific attributes or criteria (financial or otherwise) for prospective business opportunities. In evaluating a prospective business opportunity, our management will consider, among other factors, the following:
 

· | financial condition and results of operation; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | growth potential; 
· | experience and skill of management and availability of additional personnel; 
· | capital requirements; 
· | competitive position; 
· | barriers to entry in the industry; 
· | stage of development of the products, processes or services; 
· | degree of current or potential market acceptance of the products, processes or services; 
· | proprietary features and degree of intellectual property or other protection of the products, processes or services;
· | regulatory environment within the industry; and 
· | the costs associated with affecting the business transaction with a particular business opportunity. 

 
These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive or to in any way limit the board of director’s unrestricted discretion to enter into a business transaction for any business opportunity. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular business transaction will be based, to the extent relevant, on the above factors as well as other considerations deemed relevant by our management. 
 
We will not target a business if audited financial statements based on United States generally accepted accounting principles or International Financial Reporting Standards cannot be prepared for the target business. The Company cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by the Company as a potential acquisition candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with such accounting standards or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with such standards. To the extent that this requirement cannot be met, the Company may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, the Company does not believe that this limitation will be material.
 
Due Diligence Investigation.
 
In evaluating a prospective business opportunity, we will conduct as extensive a due diligence review of potential targets as reasonably possible. Our review will be constrained by our limited capital resources, lack of full-time employees and management’s inexperience in such endeavors. We may enter into a business transaction with a privately-held company in its early stages of development or that has only a limited operating history on which we could base our decision. Since little public information typically is available about these companies, we will be required to rely on the ability of management to obtain adequate information to evaluate the potential risks and returns from entering into a business transaction with such a company. We expect that our due diligence may include, among other things, meetings with the target business’s incumbent management, an inspection of its facilities and a review of financial and other information made available to us. This due diligence review will be conducted by our management, possibly with the assistance of our counsel, accountants or other third parties.

5

 
Our financial and personnel limitations may render it impractical for us to conduct an exhaustive investigation and analysis of a target candidate before we consummate a business transaction. Management’s decisions, therefore, will likely be made without detailed feasibility studies, independent analyses and market surveys or other methodologies which, if we had more funds available to us, would be desirable. We will be particularly dependent in making decisions upon information provided by the principals, promoters, sponsors or others associated with the business opportunity seeking our participation.
 
Upon the consummation of a business combination, the Company will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission a current report on Form 8-K to disclose the business transaction, the terms of the transaction and a description of the business and management of the target business, among other things, and will include audited consolidated financial statements of the Company giving effect to the business combination. Holders of the Company’s securities will be able to access the Form 8-K and other filings made by the Company on the EDGAR Company Search page of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Web site, the address for which is www.sec.gov. The public may read and copy any materials the Company files with the SEC at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at Room 1518, 100 F. Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.
 
Lack of diversification.
 
We expect that we will be able to consummate a business transaction with only one candidate given that, among other considerations, we will not have the resources to diversify our operations. Moreover, given that we likely will offer a controlling interest in our Company to the persons with which we enter into business transaction in order to achieve a tax-free reorganization, the dilution of interest to present and prospective stockholders will render more than one business transaction unlikely. Therefore, at least initially, the prospects for our success may be entirely dependent upon the future performance of a single business and we will not benefit from the possible diversification of risks or offsetting of losses that business transactions with multiple operating entities would offer. By consummating a business transaction with a single entity, our lack of diversification may result in our dependency upon the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services and subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to a business transaction.
 
Competition
 
We expect that in the course of identifying, evaluating and selecting a target for a business transaction, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. These include:

· | blank check companies that have raised significant capital through sales of securities registered under federal securities laws that have a business plan similar to ours;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | venture capital firms and leveraged buyout firms; and 
· | operating businesses looking to expand their operations through acquisitions. 

 
Many of these entities are well established, possess significant capital, may be able to offer securities for which a trading market exists and have extensive experience identifying and affecting these types of business transactions directly or through affiliates. Moreover, nearly all of these competitors possess greater technical, personnel and other resources than us. In addition, we will experience competition from other modestly capitalized shell companies that are seeking to enter into business transactions with targets similar to those we expect to pursue. 
 
If we succeed in closing a business transaction, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors within the industry in which we will operate. We cannot currently apprise you of these risks nor can we assure you that, subsequent to a business transaction, we will have the resources or ability to compete effectively.
 
Smaller Reporting Company Status
 
We qualify as a “smaller reporting company” under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, which is defined as a company with a public equity float of less than $250 million or it has less than $100 million in annual revenues and no public float or public float of less than $700 million. To the extent that we remain a smaller reporting company, we will have reduced disclosure requirements for our public filings, including: (1) less extensive narrative disclosure than required of other reporting companies, particularly in the description of executive compensation and (2) the requirement to provide only two years of audited financial statements, instead of three years. In addition, until such time as the public float of our common stock exceeds $75 million, we will be a non-accelerated filer and will not be required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes Oxley Act.

Employees
 
We have one executive officer who has other business interests and who is not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters. She intends to devote only as much time as she deems necessary to our affairs, which may hinder our ability to enter into a business transaction. These circumstances represent a potential conflict of interest between our officer / director and the Company. The amount of time our officer will devote to our affairs in any time period will vary based on whether a business opportunity has been selected for the business transaction and the stage of the business transaction process the Company is in. Accordingly, if and when management identifies suitable business opportunities, we expect that our management will spend more time investigating such business opportunity and will devote additional time and effort negotiating and processing the business transaction as developments warrant. 
 
We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the consummation of a business transaction.
