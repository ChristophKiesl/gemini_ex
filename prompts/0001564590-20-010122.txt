ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview
 Conatus is a biotechnology company that has been focused on the development and commercialization of novel medicines to treat chronic diseases with significant unmet need. Conatus has been developing emricasan, an orally active pan-caspase inhibitor, for the treatment of patients with chronic liver disease. Emricasan is designed to reduce the activities of human caspases, which are enzymes that mediate inflammation and apoptosis. Conatus has also been developing CTS-2090, an orally active selective caspase inhibitor, for diseases involving inflammasome pathways.
 In June 2019, Conatus announced that top-line results from its ENCORE-LF clinical trial of emricasan did not meet the primary endpoint. The ENCORE-LF trial was the third and last of its ENCORE clinical trials, which tested emricasan in NASH patients with varying degrees for fibrosis or cirrhosis. The two prior trials, the ENCORE-PH and ENCORE-NF trials, also failed to meet the primary endpoint in each study. In connection with the emricasan trial results, Conatus began discontinuing development activities for emricasan, as well as its inflammasome disease product candidate, CTS-2090.
 Conatus also commenced a restructuring plan in June 2019 that included reducing staff by approximately 40% and suspending development of CTS-2090 and a restructuring plan in September 2019 that included reducing staff by another approximately 40% in 
 3

order to extend Conatus’ resources. In addition, Conatus engaged a financial advisor to assist in the exploration and evaluation of strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value, including a merger, an acquisition or sale of assets or a dissolution and liquidation of the company.
 In September 2019, Conatus and Novartis Pharma AG, or Novartis, entered into an amendment to the Option, Collaboration and License Agreement entered into between Conatus and Novartis in December 2016, or the Collaboration Agreement, pursuant to which they mutually agreed to terminate the Collaboration Agreement. Under the Collaboration Agreement, Conatus granted Novartis an exclusive license for the global development and commercialization of emricasan.
 On January 28, 2020, Conatus, Chinook Merger Sub, Inc., or Merger Sub, a wholly owned subsidiary of Conatus, and Histogen Inc., or Histogen, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, or the Merger Agreement, pursuant to which, among other matters, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Histogen, with Histogen continuing as Conatus’ wholly owned subsidiary and the surviving corporation of the merger. If the merger is completed, the business of Conatus will become the business of Histogen as described in Conatus’ Form S-4 (registration file number 333-236332) initially filed with the SEC on February 7, 2020, as amended, or the Form S-4.
 If the proposed merger is not completed, Conatus will reconsider its strategic alternatives and could pursue one of the following courses of action, which Conatus currently believes to be the most likely alternatives if the merger with Histogen is not completed:
  
• | Pursue another strategic transaction. Conatus may resume its process of evaluating a potential merger, reorganization or other business combination transaction.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursue development of CTS-2090 or emricasan. Conatus may re-initiate development of CTS-2090, which is a pre-IND product candidate for inflammatory diseases or of emricasan, for which Conatus would expect to pursue orphan indications.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Dissolve and liquidate its assets. If Conatus does not believe it can find a suitable alternate merger partner in the near-term, Conatus may dissolve and liquidate its assets. Conatus would be required to pay all of its debts and contractual obligations, and to set aside certain reserves for potential future claims, and there can be no assurances as to the amount or timing of available cash remaining to distribute to stockholders after paying the Conatus obligations and setting aside funds for reserves.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Until the proposed merger with Histogen is completed, Conatus cannot predict whether or to what extent it might resume development activities, or what its future cash needs would be for any such activities.

Emricasan
 Emricasan is a proprietary and orally active caspase protease inhibitor designed to slow or halt the progression of chronic liver disease caused by fibrosis and cirrhosis. Emricasan has also been extensively profiled in in vitro tests and studied in many preclinical models of human disease. Preclinical studies and clinical trials yielded results that suggested emricasan may have clinical utility in slowing the progression of liver disease regardless of the original cause of the disease. To date, emricasan has been administered to over 1,000 subjects in eight completed Phase 1 and twelve completed Phase 2 clinical trials and has been generally well-tolerated in both healthy volunteers and patients with liver disease. Conatus most recently completed three EmricasaN, a Caspase inhibitOR, for Evaluation Phase 2b clinical trials, or the ENCORE trials, designed to provide further information on doses leading to clinically relevant efficacy, including improvement in severe portal hypertension and hepatic function in patients with NASH cirrhosis and improvement in biopsy-proven fibrosis and inflammation in patients with NASH fibrosis.
 In November 2016, Conatus initiated the ENCORE-PH clinical trial, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b clinical trial to evaluate the effect of emricasan in reducing hepatic venous pressure gradient (“HVPG”), in approximately 240 compensated or early decompensated NASH cirrhosis patients with severe portal hypertension, established by baseline HVPG values of 12 mmHg or higher. Patients were randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive 5 mg of emricasan, 25 mg of emricasan, 50 mg of emricasan, or placebo twice daily for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was the mean change in HVPG from week 0 to week 24 for each dosing group compared with placebo. In December 2018, Conatus announced the trial did not meet its primary endpoint.
 In January 2016, Conatus initiated the ENCORE-NF clinical trial, a Phase 2b clinical trial to evaluate emricasan’s potential long-term benefits for patients with liver fibrosis resulting from NASH. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluated the effect of emricasan in reducing fibrosis and steatohepatitis in approximately 330 patients with NASH fibrosis, but not cirrhosis. Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive 5 mg of emricasan, 50 mg of emricasan, or placebo twice daily for 72 weeks. The primary endpoint was a biopsy-based one point or greater improvement in NASH Clinical Research Network fibrosis score compared with placebo at week 72, with no worsening of steatohepatitis. In March 2019, Conatus announced the trial did not meet the primary endpoint.
 In May 2017, Conatus initiated the ENCORE-LF clinical trial, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b clinical trial to evaluate emricasan in approximately 210 patients with decompensated NASH cirrhosis. Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive 5 mg of emricasan, 25 mg of emricasan, or placebo twice daily for at least 48 weeks. The primary endpoint was event-free survival for each treatment group compared with the placebo group. In June 2019, Conatus announced the trial did not meet the primary endpoint.
 In May 2017, Novartis exercised its option under the Option, Collaboration and License Agreement, or the Collaboration Agreement, Conatus entered into with Novartis in December 2016. Pursuant to such exercise, Conatus granted Novartis an exclusive, worldwide license to Conatus’ intellectual property rights relating to emricasan to collaborate with Conatus for the global development and commercialization of products containing emricasan either as a single active ingredient or in combination with other Novartis compounds for liver cirrhosis or liver fibrosis, including but not limited to Farnesoid X receptor agonists that Novartis is currently developing for the treatment of chronic liver diseases.
 In June 2019, Conatus announced that top-line results from its ENCORE-LF clinical trial of emricasan did not meet its primary endpoint, and, Conatus and its partner, Novartis had no further plans for emricasan and in September 2019, Conatus and Novartis entered into an amendment to the Collaboration Agreement, pursuant to which they mutually agreed to terminate the Collaboration Agreement. 
 CTS-2090
 Inflammasomes are a collection of large multiprotein structures responsible for the activation of inflammatory responses. There are six known inflammasome subtypes - NLRP1, NLRP3, NLRC4, NLRP6, AIM2 and IFI 16 - that respond to different stimuli. A primary function of the inflammasomes is to generate active caspase 1 from procaspase 1 in response to various pathogens and other stimuli. The ultimate products produced by the activation of caspase 1 are highly pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1ß and IL-18. In addition, caspase 1 initiates pyroptosis, a highly inflammatory form of cell death, through the cleavage of gasdermin D.
 The NLRP3 inflammasome pathway, for example, is dependent upon caspase 1, which activates IL-1ß. As such, caspase 1 occupies a uniquely central position in the inflammasome pathway, and Conatus has leveraged its scientific expertise in caspase research and development to design potent, selective and orally bioavailable inhibitors of caspase 1. Excess IL-1ß has been linked to a variety of diseases including rare genetic inflammatory diseases, cancer, liver and other gastrointestinal diseases, and cardiovascular diseases. Inhibition of IL-1ß is a clinically validated approach to treating inflammatory diseases, with several injectable biologic products using that mechanism of action already on the market. Currently, there are marketed biologic treatments directed at blocking 
 5

IL-1ß activity, but to Conatus’ knowledge, there are no approved small molecules specifically targeted at reducing IL-1ß activation. Conatus believes an effective, oral caspase 1 inhibitor could have impact across a number of inflammasome-related diseases.
 Conatus has assembled an internal development program containing proprietary portfolio of orally active molecules that inhibit inflammasome pathways and the activation of the potent inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1ß, or IL-1ß. In March 2019, Conatus announced the selection of its first internally developed product candidate, CTS-2090, based on the product candidate’s preclinical profile, including oral availability and high selectivity for caspase 1, and drug-like properties. In connection with the emricasan trial results and Conatus’ decision to pursue strategic alternatives, Conatus discontinued development of CTS-2090 in June 2019.
 
Competition
 The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense competition and rapid innovation. Although Conatus believes that it holds a leading position in its understanding of caspase inhibition related to liver disease, its competitors may be able to develop other compounds or drugs that are able to achieve similar or better results. Potential competitors include major multinational pharmaceutical companies, established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and universities and other research institutions. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. Conatus believes the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of its product candidates are efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, reliability, convenience of dosing, price and reimbursement.
Material Contracts
 Pfizer Inc. 
 In July 2010, Conatus entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Pfizer pursuant to which Conatus acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Idun, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pfizer at the time, in consideration for an upfront payment of $250,000 and a promissory note in the principal amount of $1.0 million. In July 2013, the promissory note was amended to become convertible into shares of Conatus common stock following the completion of its initial public offering, at the option of the holder, at a price per share equal to the fair market value of Conatus common stock on the date of conversion. Conatus had the right to prepay the promissory note at any time, and in January 2017, Conatus voluntarily prepaid the entire balance of the principal and accrued interest of the promissory note. The promissory note bore interest at a per annum interest rate equal to 7%, compounded quarterly, and interest was payable on a quarterly basis during the term of the promissory note. Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, Conatus will be required to make additional payments to Pfizer totaling $18.0 million upon the achievement of specified regulatory milestones relating to emricasan. 
Idun Distribution Agreement
 In January 2013, Conatus conducted a spin-off of its subsidiary Idun, which Conatus had acquired from Pfizer in the transaction described above, to Conatus stockholders at that time. Immediately prior to the spin-off, all rights relating to emricasan were distributed to Conatus pursuant to a distribution agreement.
Novartis Pharma AG
 In December 2016, Conatus entered into the Collaboration Agreement with Novartis, pursuant to which Conatus granted Novartis an exclusive option to collaborate with Conatus to develop products containing emricasan. In May 2017, Novartis exercised its option under the Collaboration Agreement. Pursuant to such exercise, Conatus granted Novartis an exclusive, worldwide license to its intellectual property rights relating to emricasan to collaborate with Conatus for the global development and commercialization of products containing emricasan either as a single active ingredient or in combination with other Novartis compounds for liver cirrhosis or liver fibrosis, for the treatment, diagnosis and prevention of disease in all indications in humans. The license became effective upon Conatus’ receipt of a $7.0 million option exercise payment in July 2017. In September 2019, Conatus and Novartis entered into an amendment to the Collaboration Agreement, pursuant to which they mutually agreed to terminate the Collaboration Agreement.
 Under the Collaboration Agreement, Conatus was responsible for completing the three ENCORE trials. Conatus shared the costs of these three trials equally with Novartis. In addition, until the completion of the three Phase 2b trials, Conatus and Novartis were to share the costs of the non-treatment observational study that will follow patients from the three ENCORE Phase 2b trials and the previously completed Phase 2b POLT-HCV-SVR trial. After the completion of the three ENCORE Phase 2b trials, Novartis would have assumed 100% of the observational study costs. Novartis was also responsible for 100% of certain expenses for required registration-supportive nonclinical activities. Novartis was responsible for Phase 3 development of products containing only emricasan as an active ingredient, or Emricasan Only Products, and all development for products containing emricasan and one or more other Novartis active ingredients, or Combination Products. Emricasan Only Products and Combination Products are collectively referred to 
 6

as Emricasan Products. A joint steering committee comprised of senior personnel from Conatus and Novartis oversaw the collaboration, development and commercialization of the Emricasan Products. Pursuant to the terms of termination, Novartis and Conatus will continue to share the costs of the Phase 2b trials equally until December 31, 2019 and Novartis will pay up to $150,000 for its share of the costs of the Phase 2b trials, if any, in 2020.
 Pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement, Conatus received an upfront payment of $50.0 million and the option exercise payment of $7.0 million from Novartis. Conatus was eligible to receive up to an aggregate of $650.0 million in milestone payments over the term of the Collaboration Agreement, contingent on the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones. Novartis would have been required to pay Conatus tiered royalties ranging from the high-teens to the high-twenties as a percentage of net sales of Emricasan Only Products, and tiered royalties ranging from the high-single digits to the mid-teens as a percentage of net sales of Combination Products, subject to reduction in certain cases. After the initiation of the first Phase 3 clinical trial for an Emricasan Product, Conatus had an option to elect to enter into a co-commercialization agreement with Novartis under which Conatus was eligible receive up to 30% of the commercial profits less the same percentage of the commercial losses for Emricasan Products in the United States, subject to certain reductions in milestone and royalty payments. As a result of the termination of the Collaboration Agreement, Conatus will not receive any future milestone, royalty or profit and loss sharing payments under the Collaboration Agreement.
 Concurrent with the entry into the Collaboration Agreement, Conatus entered into an Investment Agreement with Novartis, or the Investment Agreement, whereby Conatus agreed to sell and Novartis agreed to purchase, convertible promissory notes, in one or two closings, for an aggregate principal amount of up to $15.0 million. In February 2017, Conatus issued a convertible promissory note, or the Novartis Note, in the principal amount of $15.0 million, pursuant to the Investment Agreement. The maturity date of the Novartis Note was December 31, 2019, and it bore interest on the unpaid principal balance at a rate of 6% per annum. In December 2018, Conatus, at its option, converted the entire outstanding principal of $15.0 million and accrued and unpaid interest of the Novartis Note into 2,882,519 shares of Conatus common stock. Pursuant to the terms of the Novartis Note, the principal and accrued and unpaid interest converted into shares of Conatus common stock at a conversion price equal to 120% of the 20-day trailing average closing price per share of the common stock immediately prior to the conversion date.
 Intellectual Property
 The proprietary nature of, and protection for, Conatus’ product candidates and discovery programs and know-how are important to its business. Conatus has sought patent protection in the United States and internationally for emricasan, crystalline forms of emricasan and certain methods of treatment with emricasan. In addition, Conatus has patent protection covering certain other preclinical stage compounds. Conatus’ policy is to pursue, maintain and defend patent rights whether developed internally or licensed from third parties and to protect the technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of its business.
 Conatus’ commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and trade secret protection of its current and future product candidates and the methods used to develop and manufacture them, as well as successfully defending these patents against third-party challenges. Conatus’ ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing its products depends on the extent to which it has rights under valid and enforceable patents that cover these activities. Conatus cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of its pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by it in the future, nor can it be sure that any of its existing patents or any patents that may be granted to it in the future will be commercially useful in protecting its product candidates, discovery programs and processes. For this and more comprehensive risks related to Conatus’ intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Conatus’ Intellectual Property.”
 Conatus’ patent portfolio includes patents directed to crystalline forms of emricasan. As of December 31, 2019, Conatus had received one United States patent and corresponding foreign patents directed to crystalline forms of emricasan. Foreign patents have been granted in Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Hong Kong, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan and Turkey. Conatus expects that the crystalline forms and methods of use patent, if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees are paid, will expire in 2028 (United States) and 2027 (international). It is possible that the term of a crystalline forms patent in the United States could be extended up to five additional years under the provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act. Patent term extension may be available in certain foreign countries upon regulatory approval. Conatus’ patent portfolio also includes patent applications directed to composition of matter and methods of use for its internally developed caspase inhibitors, including CTS-2090.

Government Regulation
 Government authorities in the United States (at the federal, state and local level) and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug products such as those Conatus develops. Emricasan, CTS-2090 and any other product candidates that Conatus develops must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the United States and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agency before they may be legally marketed in foreign countries.
United States Drug Development Process
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, (“FDCA”), and implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA sanctions could include, among other actions, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on Conatus. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

• | completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests, preclinical animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA’s current good clinical practice regulations, or GCPs, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its proposed indication;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA, for a new drug product;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to accept the NDA for filing and review;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug is produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s cGMP, which are regulations to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA audit of the preclinical and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

 
Before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, a product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human studies. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trials and places the IND on clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Accordingly, Conatus cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trials.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the clinical trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers issues such as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must 
 8

monitor the clinical trial until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
  
• | Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness. In the case of some drugs for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the drug may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2: The drug is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the drug for specific targeted diseases or conditions and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule. Phase 2 clinical trials can be further divided into Phase 2a and Phase 2b clinical trials. Phase 2a clinical trials are typically smaller and shorter in duration and generally consist of patient exposure-response trials, which focus on proving the hypothesized mechanism of action. Phase 2b clinical trials are typically higher enrolling and longer in duration and generally consist of patient dose-ranging trials, which focus on finding the optimum dose at which the drug shows clinical benefit with minimal side effects.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3: Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the drug and provide an adequate basis for drug approval. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA. Phase 3 clinical trials usually involve several hundred to several thousand participants.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 4 or post-approval studies: Clinical trials may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 studies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDCA permits the FDA and an IND sponsor to agree in writing on the design and size of clinical trials intended to form the primary basis of a claim of effectiveness in an NDA. This process is known as a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA. An SPA agreement may not be changed by the sponsor or the FDA after the clinical trial begins except with the written agreement of the sponsor and the FDA, or if the FDA determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or effectiveness of the drug was identified after the testing began. For certain types of protocols, including carcinogenicity protocols, stability protocols and Phase 3 protocols for clinical trials that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim, the FDA has agreed under its performance goals associated with the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, (“PDUFA”), to provide a written response on most protocols within 45 days of receipt. However, the FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goals, and additional FDA questions and resolution of issues leading up to an SPA agreement may result in the overall SPA process being much longer, if an agreement is reached at all.
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may fail to be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or data monitoring committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated checkpoints based on access to certain data from the clinical trial. A trial may also be suspended or terminated based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the drug in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 FDA Review and Approval Processes
 The results of drug development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of a drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug. The application includes both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical and clinical trials as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a drug or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support 
 9

marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational product candidate to the satisfaction of the FDA. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances.
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, (“PREA”), an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. However, if only one indication for a drug has orphan designation, a pediatric assessment may still be required for any applications to market that same drug for the non-orphan indication(s).
 The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting an NDA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has ten months from the 60-day filing date in which to complete its initial review of a standard NDA and respond to the applicant and six months for a priority NDA, if the drug is a new molecular entity. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
 After the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the drug is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer applications for drug or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the drug unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the drug within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements. After the FDA evaluates the application, manufacturing process and manufacturing facilities, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive, and the FDA may interpret data differently than Conatus interprets the same data.
 If a drug receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the drug. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling or may condition the approval of the NDA on other changes to the proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications or a commitment to conduct one or more post-market studies or clinical trials. For example, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug’s safety and effectiveness, and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. The FDA may also determine that a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Following approval of an NDA with a REMS, the sponsor is responsible for marketing the drug in compliance with the REMS and must submit periodic REMS assessments to the FDA.

Orphan Drug Designation
  In the United States, under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition. Such diseases and conditions are those that affect fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if they affect more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug available in the United States for these types of diseases or conditions will be recovered from sales of the drug. Orphan Drug Designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. If the FDA grants Orphan Drug Designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by that agency. Orphan Drug Designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process, but it can lead to financial incentives, such as opportunities for grant funding toward clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers.
 If a drug that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the drug is entitled to orphan drug marketing exclusivity for a period of seven years. Orphan drug marketing exclusivity generally prevents the FDA from approving another application, including a full NDA, to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, including if the FDA concludes that the later drug is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. For purposes of small molecule drugs, the FDA defines “same drug” as a drug that contains the same active chemical entity and is intended for the same use as the drug in question. A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug marketing exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. Orphan drug marketing exclusivity rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
 Conatus submitted applications for orphan drug designation for emricasan for the treatment of fibrosis in HCV-POLT patients in the United States and the EU. In late 2013, Conatus received orphan drug designation from the FDA for the treatment of POLT patients with reestablished fibrosis in their liver to delay the progression to cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease. In the EU, Conatus withdrew the application based on feedback from the applicable regulatory body that emricasan may have efficacy in fibrosis outside of the HCV-POLT patient population.
 Expedited Development and Review Programs
 The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended, alone or in combination with one or more drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. If a product candidate receives Fast Track designation, the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.
 Any drug submitted to the FDA for approval, including a drug with a Fast Track designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as Priority Review and Accelerated Approval. A drug is eligible for Priority Review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug designated for Priority Review in an effort to facilitate the review. Additionally, a drug may be eligible for Accelerated Approval. Drugs studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive Accelerated Approval upon a determination that the drug has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving Accelerated Approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires, as a condition for Accelerated Approval, pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the drug.
 
11

The FDA may also accelerate the approval of a designated Breakthrough Therapy, which is a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The sponsor of a Breakthrough Therapy may request the FDA to designate the drug as a Breakthrough Therapy at the time of, or any time after, the submission of an IND for the drug. If the FDA designates a drug as a Breakthrough Therapy, it must take actions appropriate to expedite the development and review of the application, which may include holding meetings with the sponsor and the review team throughout the development of the drug; providing timely advice to, and interactive communication with, the sponsor regarding the development of the drug to ensure that the development program to gather the nonclinical and clinical data necessary for approval is as efficient as practicable; involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor; and taking steps to ensure that the design of the clinical trials is as efficient as practicable, when scientifically appropriate, such as by minimizing the number of patients exposed to a potentially less efficacious treatment.
 Fast Track designation, Priority Review, Accelerated Approval and Breakthrough Therapy designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. In February 2016, Conatus announced that the FDA granted Fast Track designation to the emricasan development program for the treatment of liver cirrhosis caused by NASH.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Any drugs for which Conatus receives FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among other requirements, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drug’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), limitations on industry sponsored scientific and educational activities and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses.
 In addition, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to applicable manufacturing requirements after approval. Conatus relies, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of its product candidates and products in accordance with cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. Other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
 The FDA also may require Phase 4 testing and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors and civil or criminal penalties, among others.
 Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures, such as a REMS. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of Conatus’ product candidates under development.
 12

United States Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of Conatus’ product candidates, some of its United States patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, Conatus may apply for restoration of patent term for one of its currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA.
 Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain competing marketing applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, (“ANDA”), or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovative drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, clinical investigations to support new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of any full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical and clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 Other types of non-patent marketing exclusivity include orphan drug exclusivity under the Orphan Drug Act, which may offer a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity as described above, and pediatric exclusivity under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, which may add six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month pediatric exclusivity may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial.
 Foreign Government Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, Conatus will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, manufacturing and any commercial sales, promotion and distribution of its products.
 Whether or not Conatus obtains FDA approval for a product candidate, it must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like an IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the EU, for example, a clinical trial application, or CTA, must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB requirements in the United States, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trials may proceed.
 The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 In the European Economic Area, or EEA (comprised of the 28 EU Member States plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway), medicinal products must be authorized for marketing by using either the centralized authorization procedure or national authorization procedures.
 13

Centralized procedure: Under the centralized procedure, following the opining of the European Medicines Agency’s, (“EMA’s”), Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, (the “CHMP”), the European Commission issues a single marketing authorization valid across the EEA. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines derived from biotechnology processes advanced therapy medicinal products (such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy and tissue engineered products), products that contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, viral diseases, and officially designated orphan medicines. For medicines that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of submitting an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the EMA, as long as the medicine concerned contains a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health in the EEA. Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application, or MAA, by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA under the accelerated assessment procedure is 150 days, excluding clock stops.
 National authorization procedures: There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several countries, which are available for products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure:
  
• | Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one EU country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any EU country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one EU Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other EU countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In the EEA, new products authorized for marketing, or reference products, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity period prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from relying on the preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic or biosimilar applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until 10 years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EU. The 10-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those 10 years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
 The criteria for designating an “orphan medicinal product” in the EEA are similar in principle to those in the United States. In the EEA, a medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (a) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (b) either (i) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made, or (ii) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the EU to justify investment; and (c) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the EU, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a marketing authorization, entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. During this ten-year orphan market exclusivity period, no similar medicinal product for the same indication may be placed on the market. An orphan product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity in the EU for pediatric studies. The ten-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time if the: (a) second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior; (b) applicant consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or (c) applicant cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product.
 If Conatus fails to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, it may be subject in those countries to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 Sales of Conatus’ products will depend, in part, on the extent to which its products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health care programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly limiting coverage and/or reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. In addition, the United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price 
 14

controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures could further limit Conatus’ net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for Conatus’ product candidates or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover its product candidates could reduce physician usage of its products once approved and have a material adverse effect on its sales, results of operations and financial condition.
 Healthcare Reform
 A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products, implementing reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, and applying new payment methodologies. For example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act, was enacted, which, among other things, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; introduced a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans; imposed mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries as a condition for manufacturers’ outpatient drugs coverage under Medicare Part D; subjected drug manufacturers to new annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal healthcare programs; created a new Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and establishment of a Center for Medicare Innovation at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending.
 Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. Conatus expects that the current presidential administration and U.S. Congress will likely continue to seek to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the Affordable Care Act. Recently, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act, was enacted, which, among other things, removes penalties for not complying with the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate to carry health insurance. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the Affordable Care Act, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are invalid as well. While the Trump Administration and CMS have both stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, if any, and other efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act will impact the Affordable Care Act and Conatus’ business. As such, there is still uncertainty with respect to the impact President Trump’s administration and the U.S. Congress may have, if any, and any changes will likely take time to unfold, and could have an impact on coverage and reimbursement for healthcare items and services covered by plans that were authorized by the Affordable Care Act. Conatus cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or the impact of potential legislation on it.
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act to reduce healthcare expenditures. These changes include aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year that, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional action is taken by Congress. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.

Fraud and Abuse Laws
  Conatus will also be subject to healthcare fraud and abuse laws and other regulations and enforcement by the federal government as well as the state and foreign governments in which Conatus will conduct its business if a product candidate developed by Conatus is approved and commercialization of such product candidate begins. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, false claims, privacy and security and physician sunshine laws and regulations. Violations of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations may result in penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs or similar programs in other countries or jurisdictions, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, and individual imprisonment.
Geographic and Financial Segment Information
 To date, Conatus has viewed its operations and managed its business as one segment operating primarily in the United States.
 
Employees
 As of March 2, 2020, Conatus had 6 employees, 5 of whom are full-time, 3 of whom hold Ph.D. or M.D. degrees, 1 of whom was engaged in research and development activities and 5 of whom were in general and administrative positions. None of its employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. Conatus considers its relationship with its employees to be good.
