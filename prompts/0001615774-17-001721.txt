ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview 
 
We are an early-stage, pre-revenue, pharmaceutical company focused on the development of prodrug cancer therapeutics for the treatment of solid tumors. A prodrug is an inactive precursor of a drug that is converted into its active form only at the site of the tumor. Our technology platform combines a powerful cytotoxin with a patented prodrug delivery system that targets the release of the drug within the tumor. We believe our cancer prodrugs have the potential to provide a targeted therapeutic approach to a broad range of solid tumors with fewer side effects than those related to current cytotoxic chemotherapy treatments. Our lead drug candidate, mipsagargin, has completed an open label single arm Phase II clinical trial in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or liver cancer.

Our major focus for the next twelve to eighteen months is the (i) development of a clinical protocol for and enrollment into a dose optimization trial of single-agent mipsagargin followed by a clinical trial in patients with advanced HCC, (ii) completion of the non-clinical study of mipsagargin in combination with Nexavar® in liver tumor models (iii) development of a Phase 1b clinical protocol of mipsagargin in combination with Nexavar® in patients with Nexavar® naïve HCC in anticipation of positive non-clinical data, (iv) completion of a nonclinical study of mipsagargin in combination with paclitaxel and in combination with DC101 (Cyramza surrogate antibody) in gastric cancer tumor models, (v) ongoing business development discussions with potential development partners, (vi) evaluation of mipsagargin (single agent and in combination with standard of care) in nonclinical models of other solid tumor types that express PSMA, (vii) evaluate our PSMA-peptide prodrug technology with new linkers and new payloads in non-clinical models, and (viii) explore collaborations utilizing mipsagargin in new, non-clinical solid tumor models with leading researchers in the oncology field.
 
A review of ongoing investigator led clinical trials resulted in the discontinuation of studies to realign with our mipsagargin clinical strategy of prioritizing smaller, fast to market indications, pursuing mipsagargin combinations with standard of care, and conducting key clinical trials as company sponsored studies. Larger market indications will be pursued subsequently. The investigator led studies that were discontinued during the realignment were G202-004 (An Open-Label, Single-Arm, Phase II Study to Evaluate the Efficacy, Safety and CNS Exposure of G-202 in Patients with Recurrent or Progressive Glioblastoma), G202-005 (An Open-Label, Single-Arm, Phase II Study to Evaluate the Safety and Activity of G-202 Administered in the Neoadjuvant Setting Followed by Radical Prostatectomy in Patients with Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate) and G202-006 (An Open-Label, Single-Arm, Phase II Study to Evaluate the Safety and Activity of G-202 in Patients with Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma that Expresses PSMA); all studies were closed December 2016
 
In January 2015, we presented preliminary results from our Phase II study of mipsagargin in advanced liver cancer patients, and these data were updated in May 2015 when we received a final clinical study report. We consider the results of the study to be positive, with 41% of evaluable patients demonstrating a reduction in tumor burden, 63% of treated patients having stable disease, and a median time to progression of 4.5 months. Additionally, the trial demonstrated that mipsagargin is effective at destroying the vascularity of solid tumors thereby starving the tumor. These results support our plans to continue the development of mipsagargin for patients with liver cancer, as well as proceed with our development strategy in other indications.
 
In January 2017, we announced the initiation of development programs focused on mipsagargin combination therapies with the start of the first nonclinical combination study of mipsagargin in combination with Nexavar® in HCC tumor models.
 
In February 2017, we announced the start of our second nonclinical combination study of mipsagargin in combination with paclitaxel in gastric cancer tumor models. In addition, the Company plans to evaluate Mipsagargin in combination with DC101 (Cyramza® surrogate antibody).
 
While we believe that the data from our nonclinical and completed clinical studies appear promising, the outcome of our ongoing or future studies may ultimately be unsuccessful.
 
Our ability to execute our business plan is dependent on the amount and timing of cash, if any, that we are able to raise. Should we not raise sufficient funds to execute our business plan, our priority is the completion of the nonclinical studies of mipsagargin in HCC and gastric cancer and continuing business development discussions with potential development partners.
 
Going Concern
 
Our auditors’ report on our December 31, 2016 financial statements expressed an opinion that our capital resources as of the date of their Audit Report were not sufficient to sustain operations or complete our planned activities for the upcoming year unless we raised additional funds. Accordingly, notwithstanding our recent financings, our current cash level raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern past the second quarter of 2017. If we do not obtain additional funds by such time, we may no longer be able to continue as a going concern and will cease operation which means that our shareholders will lose their entire investment.

Product Development of Mipsagargin
 
Mipsagargin is a prodrug targeting the tumor vasculature that has therapeutic potential in a wide range of malignancies. However, hepatocellular carcinoma, with promising phase II study results, is our most advanced indication and our initial continued clinical focus. We are actively seeking a potential development and commercialization partner at both multi-national and regional levels to assist with the development of mipsagargin through clinical trials in liver cancer. Our current product development plan of mipsagargin contemplates the following major initiatives:

· | Initiation and completion of a clinical dose optimization study.

Our Technology
 
Our approach is to identify specific enzymes that are found at high levels in tumors relative to other tissues in the body. Upon identifying these enzymes, we attempt to create a peptide that is recognized predominantly by those enzymes in the tumor and not by enzymes in normal tissues. We then use the peptide as the masking/targeting agent and attach it to our “cytotoxin” to create a prodrug. We believe that this double layer of recognition adds to the tumor-targeting found in our prodrugs.
 
Cytotoxin-Thapsigargin
 
Thapsigargin is a cytotoxin found within the plant Thapsia garganica that grows wild in the Mediterranean region. Thapsigargin is a potent inhibitor of the intracellular sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium adenosine triphosphastase (SERCA) pump protein, consequently causing calcium levels to rise significantly and trigger apoptosis (cell death). We chemically modify thapsigargin to create the molecule 12ADT that retains all the potent cell-killing attributes of thapsigargin, but contains a new structure that can be coupled to a masking/targeting agent. Our prodrugs are manufactured by attaching a specific peptide to 12ADT.
 
Masking/Targeting Agent
 
We use peptides to mask the cytotoxin and target the tumor (masking/targeting agents). Peptides are short strings of amino-acids, the building blocks of many components found in cells. When attached to 12ADT, they have the potential to render the cytotoxin inactive and once the peptide is removed from 12ADT, the cytotoxin is active again. Our technology attempts to take advantage of the fact that the masking peptides can be removed by chemical reactors in the body called enzymes, and that the recognition of particular peptides by particular enzymes can be very specific. The peptides also make 12ADT soluble in blood. When the masking peptide is removed, 12ADT returns to its natural insoluble state and precipitates directly into nearby tumor cells.

Our Prodrug Therapies
 
Cancer chemotherapy involves treating patients with cytotoxic drugs (compounds or agents that are toxic to cells). Chemotherapy is often combined with surgery or radiation in the treatment of early-stage disease and it is the preferred, or only, treatment option for many forms of cancer in later stages of the disease. However, major drawbacks of cytotoxic chemotherapy include, but are not limited to:

· | Side effects - non-cancer cells in the body are also affected, often leading to serious side effects, which may include the destruction of bone marrow, damage to digestive tract cells, and hair loss. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Incomplete tumor kill - many of the leading chemotherapeutic agents act during the process of cell division and may be effective on tumors comprised of rapidly-dividing cells, but are much less effective on tumors that contain slowly dividing cells. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Resistance - tumors will often develop resistance to current drugs after repeated exposure, thereby limiting the effectiveness of such therapies over multiple dosing. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Prodrug chemotherapy is a relatively new approach to cancer treatment that is being explored as a means of delivering higher concentrations of cytotoxic agents at the tumor location while avoiding or decreasing toxicity in the rest of the body. An inactive form of a cytotoxin is administered to the patient. The prodrug is converted into the active cytotoxin preferentially at the tumor site. We believe that our lead compound, mipsagargin, may overcome a number of drawbacks associated with current cancer drugs, including:
 

· | Reduced side effects - our lead compound, mipsagargin, appears to be well-tolerated in cancer patients with reduced side effects compared to traditional chemotherapeutic agents, particularly exhibiting significantly less or no effect on the patient’s bone marrow. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Cell-killing activity - our prodrugs have been shown in animal cancer models to kill slowly-dividing, non-dividing, as well as rapidly-dividing cancer cells. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Lack of acquired drug resistance - testing in animal models of cancer indicated no development of resistance to mipsagargin after multiple cycles of treatment. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Prodrug Development Candidates
 
We currently have identified four prodrug candidates based on our technology, as summarized in the table below. At this time we are focused exclusively on the clinical development of mipsagargin and have deferred further development of the other prodrug candidates.

Prodrug Candidate | Activating Enzyme | Target Location of Active Enzyme | Status/Developments 
------------------+-----------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mipsagargin | Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) | The blood vessels of most solid tumors | Completed patient enrollment in Phase II clinical trial of patients with liver cancer and presented data in January of 2015.

Mipsagargin
 
The enzymes that we target with our prodrugs are found in very specific places within the body and within the tumors. Our lead drug candidate, mipsagargin, is activated by the enzyme Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen, or PSMA, which is found in prostate epithelial cells in the normal prostate, in prostate cancer cells, and in vascular endothelial cells (blood vessels) in most solid tumors. Thus, we expect that mipsagargin may be used in the treatment of many solid tumors. Importantly, we believe that mipsagargin may work by destroying the tumor vasculature, thus starving the tumor of required nutrients resulting in tumor death.
 
G-115
 
G-115 is activated by the enzyme Prostate Specific Antigen, or PSA, which is secreted by prostate epithelial cells in the normal prostate and by prostate cancer cells. PSA is found in the bloodstream and is a known tumor marker for prostate cancer, but it is inactive in the bloodstream due to potent binding by a protein inhibitor. However, PSA is enzymatically active on the surface of prostate cancer cells as it is being secreted and this activity forms the basis for tumor targeting with G-115.
 
G-301
 
G-301 is activated by the enzyme Human Glandular Kallikrein 2, or hK2, which is secreted by prostate epithelial cells in the normal prostate and by prostate cancer cells. The enzyme hK2 is found in the bloodstream and is known as a tumor marker for prostate cancer but it is inactive in the bloodstream due to potent binding by a protein inhibitor. However, hK2 is enzymatically active on the surface of prostate cancer cells as it is being secreted and this activity forms the basis for tumor targeting with G-301.
 
Both G-115 and G-301 are believed to be useful in the treatment of prostate cancers only and not to be useful for the treatment of other cancers.
 
Therapeutic Opportunity for Our Drug Candidates and Market
 
We believe that current anti-angiogenesis drugs (drugs that disrupt the blood supply to tumors) validate the clinical approach and market potential of our drug candidate. Angiogenesis is the physiological process involving the growth of new blood vessels from pre-existing vessels and is a normal process in growth and development, as well as in wound healing. Angiogenesis is also a fundamental step in the development of tumors from a clinically insignificant size to a malignant state because no tumor can grow beyond a few millimeters in size without the nutrition and oxygenation that comes from an associated blood supply. Interrupting this process has been targeted as a point of intervention for slowing or reversing tumor growth. An example of an anti-angiogenic approach is the FDA approved drug, Avastin®, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits the activity of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor, which is important for the growth and survival of endothelial cells. Avastin and other anti-angiogenic drugs have only a limited therapeutic effect with increased median patient survival times of only a few months. Antiangiogenic therapies target newly forming vessels but existing vasculature continues to feed the tumor. Our approach is designed to destroy both the existing and newly growing tumor vasculature, rather than just block new blood vessel formation. We anticipate that this approach will lead to a more immediate collapse of the tumor’s nutrient supply and consequently an enhanced rate and degree of tumor destruction. Additionally, there are opportunities to combine mipsagargin with anti-angiogenic agents to improve upon anti-tumor activity by targeting tumor vasculature through two different modes of action.

Clinical and Pre-Clinical Development Strategy
 
 Under the planning and direction of key personnel, we expect to continue to outsource all our nonclinical development (e.g., toxicology) and manufacturing, and the majority of our clinical development activities to contract research organizations (CROs) and contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs). Our contract CROs and CMOs are required to comply with federal, state and United States Food and Drug Administration or FDA regulations including Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP), Good Clinical Practices (GCP), and Good Lab Practices (GLP).

We intend to conduct several clinical trials to determine the therapeutic efficacy of mipsagargin in cancer patients. We anticipate that mipsagargin will be therapeutically effective in a wide range of solid tumor types and have chosen to first evaluate the drug in liver cancer and gastric cancer.,. We believe this strategy will validate mipsagargin as a platform technology over multiple indications while at the same time diversifying the risk associated with any individual indication.
 
Clinical Development Summary 
 

Indication | Status 
--------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solid Tumors | Completed Phase I safety, tolerability and dosing refinement study. 
Hepatocellular Carcinoma (liver cancer) | In 2012, we obtained clearance from the FDA to initiate our Phase II clinical trial entitled, “A Phase II, Multicenter, Single-Arm Study of G-202 as Second-Line Therapy Following Sorafenib for Adult Patients with Progressive Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma.” In October of 2014 we closed patient enrollment in the trial. In total, we treated 25 patients. We presented trial data at a poster session at the American Society for Clinical Oncology 2015 Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium on January 2015 in San Francisco, CA and presented final data at the BIO International Convention 2015 held in Philadelphia, PA. in June of 2015. 

Clinical Trials
 
Phase II Clinical Development of G-202 – Hepatocellular Carcinoma (Liver Cancer)
 
Hepatocellular carcinoma is cancer that forms in the tissues of the liver. Estimates for liver and intrahepatic bile duct cancer in the U.S. for 2016 are approximately 39,000 new cases and 27,000 deaths. Incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in the U.S. is rising, principally in relation to the spread of hepatitis C infection. Hepatocellular carcinoma is potentially curable by surgical resection, but surgery is the treatment of choice for only the small fraction of patients with localized disease. Prognosis depends on the degree of local tumor replacement and the extent of liver function impairment. Treatment options for people with liver cancer are surgery (including liver transplant), ablation, embolization, targeted therapy, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, for which there is only one approved drug (sorafenib), or a combination of these options. There is no standard therapy for patients with advanced metastatic liver cancer after treatment with sorafenib.
 
In 2012, we obtained clearance from the FDA to initiate our Phase II clinical trial entitled, “A Phase II, Multicenter, Single-Arm Study of G-202 as Second-Line Therapy Following Sorafenib for Adult Patients with Progressive Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma.” This trial was conducted at multiple sites in the U.S. and measured disease progression in 25 patients with advanced stage liver disease and poor liver reserves who had failed first line treatment with sorafenib. Patients were administered episodic dosing of mipsagargin on the first three days of each treatment cycle.
 
In January 2015, we presented Phase II results that demonstrated that mipsagargin appears to be effective and is well-tolerated by HCC patients. Mipsagargin targets the enzyme prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), which is highly expressed in tumor vasculature and prostate cancer cells. The Phase II study results (n=25) demonstrate that the prodrug effectively stabilizes progression of HCC by reducing blood flow within tumors while not affecting blood flow within normal tissues. Study participants experienced a median time to progression of 4.5 months, nearly twice the time demonstrated in prior studies with placebo or ineffective agents. Additionally, mipsagargin demonstrated decreased blood flow in liver tumors as measured by DCE-MRI. We plan to develop subsequent studies to further advance mipsagargin ourselves and with a development partner with the ultimate goal of seeking regulatory approval to market our drug on a global basis. Notwithstanding that the data from our study appears promising, future trials may ultimately be unsuccessful.
  
Generic Name Designation
 
In August of 2014, we were notified that the World Health Organization’s or the WHO’s International Nonproprietary Name group or the INN recommended the generic name “mipsagargin” for our lead compound G-202. Mipsagargin was also recommended by the United States Adopted Names Council of the American Medical Association. Our generic name includes a new or novel pre-stem that we believe was proposed based on our compound possessing a unique mechanism of action or structure.

-

Commercialization Strategy
 
We intend to (i) license or sell the underlying technology of our drug compounds to third parties during or after Phase II clinical trials, (ii) seek a corporate partner for further development, or (iii) continue developing our drug candidates ourselves. It is expected that such third parties would then continue to develop, market, sell, and distribute any resulting products. As part of our overall strategic plan, we are exploring our options and actively seeking to engage in a collaborative, strategic and/or licensing arrangement with another pharmaceutical company. If we enter into any such transaction, we may be required to give up certain rights to our technology and control over its future development.
Competition
 
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are very competitive, fast moving and intense, and expected to be increasingly so in the future. Although we are not aware of any competitor who is developing a drug that is designed to destroy both the existing and newly growing tumor vasculature in a manner similar to our drug candidates, there are several marketed drugs and drugs in development that attack tumor-associated blood vessels to some degree. For example, Avastin ® is a marketed product that acts predominantly as an anti-angiogenic agent. Zybrestat ® is another drug in development that is described as a vascular-disrupting agent that inhibits blood flow to tumors. Nexavar ® and Sutent ® are two other approved drugs that appear to work in part through anti-angiogenic mechanisms. It is impossible to accurately ascertain how well our drugs will compete against these or other products that may be in the marketplace until we have more complete human patient data for comparison.
Intellectual Property
 
We regard the protection of patents and other intellectual property rights that we own or license as critical to our business and competitive position. To protect our intellectual property, we rely on patent, trade secret and copyright law, as well as confidentiality, nondisclosure, assignment of invention and other contractual arrangements with our officers, directors, employees, consultants, investigators, clinical trial sites, contractors, collaborators and other third parties to whom we disclose confidential information. Our policy is to pursue patent applications on inventions and discoveries that we believe are commercially important to the development and growth of our business. We solely own or have exclusive licenses to all of our patents and patent applications.
 
Our pipeline currently includes four drug product candidates: mipsagargin (solid tumors), G-114 (prostate cancer), G-115 (prostate cancer) and G-301 (prostate cancer). Our patent portfolio is currently composed of: 15 issued U.S. patents; 4 pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications; 1 pending Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, application; and more than 30 pending applications throughout the world, including European, Japan, China and Hong Kong, among others.
 
When appropriate, we plan to continue to seek patent protection for inventions in our core technologies and in ancillary technologies that support our core technologies or which we otherwise believe would provide us with a competitive advantage. We expect to be able to accomplish this by filing and maintaining patent applications for discoveries we make, either alone or in collaboration with scientific collaborators and strategic partners. Typically, we plan to file patent applications in the United States as well as foreign countries, where applicable. In addition, we may obtain licenses or options to acquire licenses to patent filings from other individuals and organizations that we anticipate could be useful in advancing our research, development and commercialization initiatives and our strategic business interest.
 
In addition to and separate from patent protection, mipsagargin for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma has been granted orphan drug designation under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, as amended, which was enacted to provide incentives to pharmaceutical companies who create treatments for rare diseases. It does so by granting seven years of exclusivity after approval of a drug in the rare disease, or "orphan" indication. During the seven-year period, the FDA may not grant marketing authorization (e.g. to a generic manufacturer) for the same drug for the orphan indication
 
Manufacturing and Supply
 
We do not plan to develop company-owned or company-operated manufacturing facilities. We outsource all drug manufacturing to contract manufacturers that are required to operate in compliance with cGMP. We may also seek to refine the current manufacturing process in order to achieve improvements in efficiency, costs, purity and the like as well as address different drug formulations to achieve improvements in stability and/or drug delivery.
Supply of Raw Materials - Thapsibiza SL
 
To our knowledge, there is only one commercial supplier of Thapsia garganica seeds. In April 2007, we obtained the proper permits from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (the USDA) for the importation of Thapsia garganica seeds. In April 2012, we entered into a five year sole source agreement with Thapsibiza, SL. Either party can extend the agreement for an additional five years by providing 30 days written notice prior to the expiration date. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Thapsibiza, SL has agreed to exclusively provide us Thapsia garganica seeds while we retain the right to seek additional suppliers. The agreement requires us to purchase minimum quantities of seeds per harvest period.

Long-term Supply of Raw Materials
 
We believe that we have sufficient supply of Thapsia garganica seeds in storage to complete our clinical trials as currently planned. However, in order to secure a long-term, stable supply of thapsigargin starting material, we are engaged in two ongoing research projects, including traditional cultivation and metabolic engineering of moss cells.
 
We are funding an ongoing Thapsia garganica cultivation project with Thapsibiza, SL. It is known that thapsigargin is produced in the various parts of the plant and we are evaluating the most cost-effective way to produce thapsigargin, whether it is extracted from seedlings, early roots, stems and/or shoots or from seeds of the mature plant. Reliable germination methods are established and transfer of plantings from greenhouse to fields appears straightforward. At the current time, we believe traditional cultivation, farming and harvesting of Thapsia garganica is the most reliable and straightforward source of thapsigargin starting material.
 
Manufacturing Partnership
 
In February 2014, we entered into an agreement with Phyton Biotech GmbH (Phyton) to conduct a feasibility study to evaluate plant cell suspension cultures derived from Thapsia garganica as a potential source of thapsigargin, the key ingredient in the company's investigational agent mipsagargin. In November 2014, we expanded our strategic partnership to have Phyton develop a method for a high producing cell line derived from the Thapsia garganica expressing thapsigargin. We anticipate this method development will provide us with a sustainable source of high quality thapsigargin, and assist us in achieving commercial production of our active pharmaceutical ingredient.
Governmental Regulations
 
FDA Approval Process
 
Prior to commencement of clinical studies involving humans, preclinical testing of new pharmaceutical products is generally conducted on animals in the laboratory to evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of the product candidate. The results of these studies are submitted to the FDA as part of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application, which must become effective before clinical testing in humans can begin. Typically, human clinical evaluation involves a time-consuming and costly three-phase process. In Phase I, clinical trials are conducted with a small number of people to assess safety, tolerability and to evaluate the pattern of drug distribution within the body. In Phase II, clinical trials are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease in order to determine preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety. (In some cases, an initial trial is conducted in diseased patients to assess both preliminary efficacy and preliminary safety, in which case it is referred to as a Phase I/II trial.) In Phase III, large-scale, multi-center, comparative trials are conducted with patients afflicted with a target disease in order to provide enough data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety required by the FDA. The FDA closely monitors the progress of each of the three phases of clinical testing and may, at its discretion, re-evaluate, alter, suspend, or terminate the testing based upon the data which have been accumulated to that point and its assessment of the risk/benefit ratio to the patient. All adverse events must be reported to the FDA. Monitoring of all aspects of the study to minimize risks is a continuing process.
 
The results of the preclinical and clinical testing on non-biologic drugs and certain diagnostic drugs are submitted to the FDA in the form of a New Drug Application (NDA) for approval prior to commencement of commercial sales. In responding to an NDA submission, the FDA may grant marketing approval, may request additional information, may deny the application if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval, and may also refuse to review an application that has been submitted if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for filing and review. There can be no assurance that approvals would be granted on a timely basis, if at all, for any of our proposed products.
 
Orphan Drugs
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same orphan indication, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee.
European and Other Regulatory Approval
 
Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by comparable regulatory authorities in Europe and other countries is necessary prior to commencement of marketing the product in such countries. The regulatory authorities in each country may impose their own requirements and may refuse to grant an approval, or may require additional data before granting it, even though the relevant product has been approved by the FDA or another authority. As with the FDA, the regulatory authorities in the European Union (EU), and other developed countries have lengthy approval processes for pharmaceutical products. The process for gaining approval in particular countries varies, but generally follows a similar sequence to that described for FDA approval. In Europe, the European Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products provides a mechanism for EU-member states to exchange information on all aspects of product licensing. The EU has established a European agency for the evaluation of medical products, with both a centralized community procedure and a decentralized procedure, the latter being based on the principle of licensing within one member country followed by mutual recognition by the other member countries.

Reimbursement and Health Care Cost Control
 
Reimbursement for the costs of treatments and products such as ours from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and others, both in the United States and abroad, is a key element in the success of new health care products. Significant uncertainty often exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products. The revenue and profitability of some health care-related companies have been affected by the continuing efforts of governmental and third party payors to contain or reduce the cost of health care through various means. Payors are increasingly attempting to limit both coverage and the levels of reimbursement for new therapeutic products approved for marketing by the FDA, and are refusing, in some cases, to provide any coverage for uses of approved products for disease indications for which the FDA has not granted marketing approval. In certain foreign markets, pricing or profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control.
 
In the United States, there have been a number of federal and state proposals to implement government control over health care costs. The U.S. Patient Protection and Affordance Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act were signed into law in March 2010. A number of provisions of those laws require further rulemaking action by governmental agencies to implement. The laws change access to health care products and services and create new fees for the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. Future rulemaking could increase rebates, reduce prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, or require additional reporting and disclosure. The laws also include new authorization to the FDA to approve companies to market biosimilar products within the United States, although to date FDA rulemaking under this legislation has been limited. We cannot predict the timing or impact of any such future rulemaking on our business.
 
Other Regulations
 
We are also subject to various U.S. federal, state, local and international laws, regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents, used in connection with our business. Additionally, we are subject to regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and Securities and Exchange Commission regulations. We cannot accurately predict the extent of government regulation which might result from future legislation or administrative action.
Scientific Advisory Board 
 
We have access to a number of academic and industry advisors with expertise in clinical and pharmaceutical development. Members of our Scientific Advisory Board, or SAB, meet with our management and key scientific employees on an ad hoc basis to provide advice in their respective areas of expertise and further assist us by periodically reviewing with management our preclinical and clinical activities. The members of our SAB are Søren Brøgger Christensen, PhD, Samuel R. Denmeade, MD, John T. Isaacs, PhD and Santosh Kesari, MD, PhD. Our SAB members possess deep insight into our technologies and our drug candidate’s mechanism of action which is instrumental in advancing our clinical and development programs. In connection with a member’s retention on our SAB, we have entered into confidentiality agreements as well as assignment of invention agreements, subject to the member respective obligations and responsibilities to any institution or institutions at which they are employed.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016 we employed four full-time individuals, three of whom are also our executive officers, all of whom hold advanced degrees. In addition, we contract with approximately 5 to 10 consultants to assist in activities related to our operations and research and development plan. In January 2017 we hired two full-time employees. On February 28, 2017, our chief operating officer resigned.
Corporate History
 
We were incorporated in the State of Delaware in November 2003 and our principal office is located in Westlake Village, California. On November 17, 2016, we completed a 1:30 reverse stock split of our common stock. Since our inception, we have invested a substantial portion of our efforts and financial resources in the development of mipsagargin (G-202). Mipsagargin is the only product candidate for which we have conducted clinical trials, and to date we have not marketed, distributed, or sold any products. We have generated no revenues from the sale of our product candidates and have experienced substantial net operating losses.
