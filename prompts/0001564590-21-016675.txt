Item 1. Business. 
Overview
 We are a biotechnology company pioneering the development of engineered IgM antibodies for the treatment of multiple diseases. IgM antibodies have inherent properties that we believe may enable them to bind more strongly to cells than comparable IgG antibodies. We have created a proprietary IgM antibody technology platform that we believe is particularly well suited for developing T cell engagers, receptor cross-linking agonists and targeted cytokines. Our lead product candidate, IGM-2323, a bispecific T cell engaging IgM antibody targeting CD20 and CD3 proteins, is in an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial for the treatment of relapsed/refractory B cell Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) patients. Our second product candidate, IGM-8444, is an IgM antibody targeting Death Receptor 5 (DR5) proteins which may prove to be useful for the treatment of patients with solid and hematologic malignancies. In September 2020, we announced the dosing of the first patient in our Phase 1 clinical trial of IGM-8444 for the treatment of solid cancers and NHL. Our pipeline also includes IGM-7354, a bispecific IgM antibody delivering interleukin-15 (IL-15) cytokines to PD-L1 expressing cells for the treatment of patients with solid and hematologic malignancies. We plan to file an investigational new drug (IND) application for IGM-7354 in 2021.
 We believe that we have the most advanced research and development program focused on engineered therapeutic IgM antibodies. We have created a portfolio of patents and patent applications, know-how and trade secrets directed to our platform technology, product candidates and manufacturing capabilities, and we retain worldwide commercial rights to all of our product candidates and the intellectual property related thereto.
 Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and Immunoglobulin M (IgM) are classes of antibodies that are naturally produced by the human immune system and are distinguishable by their structural properties.

▪ | Stronger binding to viral targets, which may result in more potent neutralization of viruses.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Despite these inherent biological advantages, while IgG antibodies have been broadly developed as therapeutic medicines, we believe the therapeutic potential of engineered IgM antibodies has remained largely unexplored.
 Our Platform
 We created our IgM platform to expand upon the inherent properties of IgM antibodies and to allow for the rapid development of engineered therapeutic antibodies. Significantly, our IgM platform allows us to create IgM antibodies with higher affinity and avidity than naturally occurring IgM antibodies. We believe our platform also allows us to utilize the strong and durable binding of IgM antibodies to kill cancer cells with T cells, induce programmed death of cancer cells or deliver immune stimulating cytokines to the region of the bound cell.
 The versatility of our IgM platform positions us to evaluate multiple approaches to treat patients with solid and hematologic malignancies. Our ability to develop engineered IgM antibodies against various targets allows for the creation of a broad and differentiated product pipeline. Our initial oncology efforts are focused on three broad applications of IgM antibodies:
  
▪ | T cell engagers: T cell to cancer cell engagement, including CD20 x CD3, CD123 x CD3, CD38 x CD3 and solid tumor target x CD3 programs, which we believe may have the potential to kill cancer cells through T cell directed cellular cytotoxicity (TDCC) and CDC while maintaining a favorable tolerability profile.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Receptor cross-linking agonists: Tumor Necrosis Factor receptor Superfamily (TNFrSF) agonists, including DR5, which induces programmed death of cancer cells, as well as OX40, glucocorticoid-induced TNFr-related protein (GITR) and other TNFrSF members, which we believe may enhance the ability of the immune system to fight cancer.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Targeted cytokines: Targeted cytokine delivery, including IL-15, which we believe may be helpful in inducing and maintaining immune responses to cancer.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Pipeline
 Our lead product candidate, IGM-2323, is a CD20 x CD3 bispecific IgM antibody for the treatment of patients with CD20-positive cancer. CD20 is a protein commonly expressed on the surface of NHL cells and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells, while CD3 is a protein expressed on the surface of T cells. IGM-2323 contains 10 binding domains for CD20 and one binding domain for CD3. In October 2019, we announced the dosing of the first patient in our Phase 1 clinical trial of IGM-2323 for the treatment of relapsed/refractory B cell NHL patients, which is B cell NHL that has either not responded to initial treatment or responded to treatment but then returns. In December 2020 we announced our first clinical data with IGM-2323. Treatment with combination chemo-immunotherapy, such as with rituximab-based regimens, or high dose chemotherapy and bone marrow transplant, is generally effective and may cure approximately 50-70% of patients with aggressive B cell NHL. Indolent B cell NHL, which represents approximately 40% of B cell NHL cases, remains mostly incurable at advanced stages with current therapies.

Our second product candidate, IGM-8444, is an IgM antibody targeting DR5 for the treatment of patients with solid and hematologic malignancies. DR5 receptors are expressed on a broad range of solid tumors as well as leukemias and lymphomas, but their intracellular apoptotic signaling requires efficient cross-linking of at least three DR5 receptors. IGM-8444 demonstrated significantly enhanced apoptotic signaling compared to an IgG antibody with the same binding domains, resulting in >1,000 fold increased potency in killing cancer cells from multiple cancer cell types in our studies outside of living organisms (in vitro). In our studies in living organisms (in vivo), specifically cynomolgus monkeys, no untoward toxicity was observed with IGM-8444. In September 2020, we announced the dosing of the first patient in our Phase 1 clinical trial of IGM-8444 for the treatment of solid cancers and NHL.
 Our third oncology product candidate, IGM-7354, is a bispecific IgM antibody that delivers IL-15 to PD-L1 expressing cells for the treatment of patients with solid and hematologic malignancies. In nature, IL-15 stimulates T cells and natural killer (NK) cells to proliferate and maintain their long-term survival. Our IgM platform allows us to attach IL-15 to the J chain of an IgM antibody targeting PD-L1. We expect to file an IND for IGM-7354 in 2021.

We estimate that these discovery programs are at least a year away from clinical studies, assuming they meet our requirements for advancement. We do not anticipate advancing all of these programs into clinical testing, and some of these programs may be supplanted by other IgM discovery programs. In addition to these oncology programs, we are also developing IgM antibodies for the possible prevention and treatment of COVID-19.

Our Team
 Our management team and board of directors have decades of biotechnology experience and perspective in areas such as cancer biology, immunotherapy, immunology, antibody discovery, protein engineering and clinical development. They bring a strong history of leadership, innovation and research and development experience at leading companies, including Roche/Genentech, Amgen, Gilead Sciences, Novartis, Merck & Co., Celgene, Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Shire, Kite Pharma, Bavarian Nordic, and Northern Biologics. Members of our team were involved in the discovery, development or commercialization of multiple therapeutics, including Tecentriq, Yescarta, Zydelig, Avastin, Lucentis, Vectibix, Activase, TNKase and Kogenate. 
Our Differentiated Approach and Proprietary Platform
 We are developing IgM antibodies that have properties which we believe may enable them to bind more strongly to cancer cells than comparable IgG antibodies in many therapeutic applications. IgM antibodies have 10 binding domains compared to 2 for IgG antibodies, which results in far greater binding power to a cell surface target.
 Over the past 40 years, the biotechnology industry’s development of antibodies has yielded effective therapeutic drugs for the treatment of patients with a variety of diseases including cancer and autoimmune diseases. According to market research, antibody related therapies generated over $140 billion in reported worldwide sales in 2019. All of these antibodies are members of the IgG class. We are pioneering the development of new therapies based on the IgM class of antibodies. We believe our IgM antibodies could have therapeutic applications across a wide range of diseases, including oncology and infectious and autoimmune diseases.
 There are two measures of target binding strength that are generally used in connection with antibodies:
  
▪ | Affinity—the binding strength of each individual binding domain of the antibody bound to the target; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Avidity—the combined binding strength of all of the binding domains of the antibody bound to the target.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The greater number of binding domains of an IgM antibody results in far greater avidity to a cell surface or virus as compared with an IgG antibody with the same affinity per binding domain. The greater number of binding domains also allows IgM antibodies to bind more cell surface or viral targets in close proximity with a single antibody. The inherent biological advantages of IgM antibodies enable:
  
▪ | Stronger binding to cell surface targets, including those with low expression levels, which may result in better and more complete targeting of cancer cells;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Stronger binding to viral targets, which may result in more potent neutralization of viruses;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Stronger binding to difficult targets, such as tumor associated carbohydrates and glycosylated proteins, which has the potential to expand the range of addressable cancer targets;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Greater ability to cross-link cell surface receptors, which may significantly enhance cellular signaling for killing cancer cells or stimulating T cells; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Substantially greater ability to utilize the complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) mechanism of killing targeted cells, which kills cancer cells without requiring the presence of immune cells.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Development of IgM antibodies has been historically limited by difficulties encountered in the recombinant expression and manufacture of these antibodies. Through our focused efforts which began in 2010, we have developed a broad range of skills, knowledge and trade secrets that have allowed us to successfully express and manufacture a wide range of IgM antibodies.

We created our IgM platform to expand upon the inherent qualities of IgM antibodies and to allow for the rapid development of engineered therapeutic antibodies. Through our efforts, we have developed a wide variety of proprietary methods and techniques designed to achieve the following goals:

▪ | Expression and manufacture: Overcome the traditional difficulties the pharmaceutical industry has experienced in recombinantly expressing and manufacturing IgM antibodies;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Engineered IgM antibodies: Create IgM antibodies recombinantly, by transferring IgG binding domains to IgMs, to include the benefits of high affinity and high specificity IgG variable regions;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Bispecific platform: Create bispecific antibodies with the benefits of the high avidity of 10 binding domains to one target combined with one binding domain to a second target;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Improved half-life: Extend the serum half-life of recombinantly generated IgM antibodies; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Complement modulation: Modulate the CDC mechanism of IgM antibodies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that our IgM platform creates significant competitive advantages and can serve as the foundation for the development of a broad range of IgM based therapeutic drugs. The following table compares the key properties of IgG antibodies to those of naturally occurring IgM antibodies, as well as to our engineered IgM bispecific antibodies:
 Properties of IgG vs IgM Antibodies

Our Antibodies
 T cell Engagers
 We have been able to utilize the natural features of IgM antibodies to create unique and patent protected bispecific T cell engagers, which we believe may have the potential to kill cancer cells through TDCC and CDC while maintaining a favorable tolerability profile. Bispecific T cell engagers are designed to simultaneously target a desired tumor associated antigen on a cancer cell and CD3 (a protein that is expressed on the surface of T cells) and redirect the T cells to kill the cancer cells. In contrast to other bispecific antibody formats that bind to one or two target molecules on the surface of the cancer cell and to one CD3 molecule on the surface of the T cell, our IgM bispecific format provides 10 binding domains to the cancer cell and one binding domain to CD3. We believe that our IgM bispecific antibodies may successfully bind to cancer cells for longer periods and with more avidity compared to IgG bispecific antibodies, which may prove to be particularly advantageous for those cancer cells that express relatively lower amounts of the targeted protein on their surface.
Receptor Cross-linking Agonists
 We are also using our IgM platform to develop IgM antibodies that bind to members of the TNFrSF. Members of the TNFrSF must be bound in clusters of at least three in order to send a strong biological signal to the cell. This family includes targets that will cause the death of cancer cells, such as DR5, and targets that will cause the proliferation of T cells, such as OX40 and GITR.
 
There have been multiple attempts to create IgG based therapeutic antibodies directed at DR5, OX40 and GITR. However, since IgG antibodies naturally bind only two DR5, OX40 or GITR cell surface proteins, their bivalent nature inherently limits their signaling efficacy. In contrast, we are utilizing the 10 binding domains of IgM antibodies to more efficiently cross-link these molecules on the cell surface. In multiple in vitro cell studies, we have observed that IgM antibodies have much greater potency than IgG antibodies with the same binding domains.
 Targeted Cytokines
 We are using our IgM platform to create bifunctional IgM antibodies with high avidity to selected cell surface targets to deliver potent, immune stimulating cytokines. These IgM antibodies will initially target the delivery of IL-15 to induce immune cell stimulation and proliferation. Targeted delivery of cytokines is designed to reduce systemic toxicities of cytokine therapy while enhancing immune system activity in the tumor microenvironment. Stimulation of the IL-15 pathway may be important in strengthening and maintaining both the endogenous and the synthetic T cell immune responses.
 We believe that our IgM platform has certain inherent advantages for this application. Importantly, we believe that the high avidity and long-lasting binding of our IgM antibodies may help to effectively position the cytokine for delivery to a target cell for an extended period. We also believe that the high avidity of the IgM antibodies may allow binding of the cytokine delivery antibody to cells that have relatively low density of the surface target. Targeted IL-15 may also provide complementary effects when combined in a treatment regimen with our T cell engaging antibodies, such as CD20 x CD3 or our solid tumor T cell engagers.
 Infectious Diseases
 We are also applying our IgM platform to infectious disease as we believe IgM antibodies may provide improved virus neutralization.  As we previously disclosed, we are working on a program to address the world-wide need to prevent and treat COVID-19 through targeting the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We believe that the extra avidity provided by an IgM antibody may produce more potent neutralization of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and subsequent mutated forms of the virus.

Our Product Candidates
 We are leveraging our IgM platform to discover and develop product candidates for the treatment of cancer patients. Our lead product candidate, IGM-2323, is a CD20 x CD3 bispecific IgM antibody designed to treat patients with B cell NHL and other B cell malignancies. Our second product candidate, IGM-8444, is an IgM antibody targeting Death Receptor 5 (DR5) proteins for the treatment of patients with solid and hematologic malignancies. Our pipeline also includes IGM-7354, a bispecific IgM antibody delivering interleukin-15 (IL-15) cytokines to PD-L1 expressing cells for the treatment of patients with solid and hematologic malignancies.
 

IGM-2323: CD20 x CD3 Bispecific IgM Antibody
 Our lead product candidate, IGM-2323, is a CD20 x CD3 bispecific IgM antibody designed to treat patients with B cell NHL and other B cell malignancies. Our initial therapeutic goal with IGM-2323 is to safely and effectively treat relapsed/refractory B cell NHL patients. CD20 is a protein that is frequently expressed on the surface of malignant B cells, while CD3 is a protein that is expressed on the surface of T cells and is an essential activating molecule of the T cell. IGM-2323 has 10 binding domains to CD20 and a single binding domain to CD3 (specifically CD3ɛ). In addition, IGM-2323 contains a human serum albumin molecule attached to the Joining chain (J chain) to enhance its pharmacokinetic properties. The J chain naturally occurs in IgM antibodies and joins the IgM subunits into pentameric antibodies.
 IGM-2323 is designed to simultaneously and stably bind a CD20 expressing cancer cell as well as CD3 on a cytotoxic T cell, bringing both cells into close proximity. This interaction mimics the normal T cell activation pathway leading the T cell to recognize and kill the cancer cell by releasing cytotoxic biochemicals (perforins and granzymes) that penetrate and perforate the cancer cell. The TDCC mediated killing mechanism of IGM-2323 on CD20 expressing cancer cells is shown in the diagram below.

Schematic diagram of IGM-2323 binding a CD20 expressing B cancer cell and a CD3 expressing T cell for T cell directed cellular cytotoxicity (TDCC). Shown is the IGM-2323 induced T cell release (degranulation) of cytotoxic biochemicals from T cell lytic granules in close proximity to the cancer cell to induce perforin pore formation in the cell membrane, allowing cell entry of the cytotoxic biochemicals and induction of cancer cell death.
 IGM-2323 also employs an additional mechanism to kill CD20 expressing cancer cells, known as complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). CDC is a mechanism by which antibodies can mediate specific targeted cell killing by activating the complement system. Components of the complement system are naturally present in humans, and IgM antibodies are the most efficient antibodies at engaging the complement system for CDC, with an approximately 100 fold increase in CDC relative to comparable IgG CD20 antibodies. The CDC mediated killing mechanism of CD20 expressing cancer cells by IGM-2323 is shown in the diagram below.
 IGM-2323 Binding to a CD20 Positive Cancer Cell and Inducing CDC
 

Schematic diagram of IGM-2323 binding a CD20 expressing B cancer cell and recruiting components of the complement system from the serum to induce complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) through formation of a membrane attack complex.
 
We believe the dual mechanisms of action of IGM-2323, both TDCC and CDC, may further enhance its efficiency in eliminating CD20 expressing cancer cells and may decrease the likelihood of cancer escape or resistance.
 We are planning to develop IGM-2323 as a treatment for patients diagnosed with CD20-expressing malignancies. In October 2019, we announced the dosing of the first patient in a Phase 1 clinical trial of IGM-2323 for the treatment of relapsed/refractory B cell NHL. In this multi-center open label trial, we are studying IGM-2323 initially as a single agent, where it is administered intravenously at a fixed-dose or via titration dosing, as part of a dose escalation in single patient cohorts followed by 3+3-based protocol, up to a planned maximum dose of 1000 mg, in patients with relapsed/refractory B cell NHL. IGM-2323 is being administered three times per cycle (each cycle is 21 days). The dose limiting toxicity window will be evaluated in the first cycle. The objective of this Phase 1 study is to provide an initial assessment of the safety, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of IGM-2323 in relapsed/refractory B cell NHL patients. If the therapy appears to be safe and tolerable and if significant evidence of efficacy is observed, we will expand the clinical testing of IGM-2323 in additional relapsed/refractory patients expected to express CD20 on their cancer cells, including diffuse large B cell lymphoma and/or relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma, and potentially further to relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia and/or

relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. Additional combination studies adding IGM-2323 to standard of care regimens in earlier lines of treatment may be developed based upon initial results from this Phase 1 study.
 We announced our first clinical data with IGM-2323 in December 2020, and we hope to announce a recommended Phase 2 dose for IGM-2323 in 2021.
 IGM-8444: Death Receptor 5 Agonist IgM Antibody
 Our second product candidate, IGM-8444, is an IgM antibody targeting DR5 for the treatment of patients with solid and hematologic malignancies. DR5 is a member of the TNFrSF and is often expressed on the surface of cancer cells. Similar to other members of the TNFrSF, strong signaling to effect a biological response requires that three or more DR5 receptor proteins be cross-linked together on the surface of a cancer cell through the binding of either the natural DR5 ligand (TRAIL) or an antibody or other therapeutic drug that can efficiently cross-link the DR5 receptors. Binding and cross-linking of DR5 receptors sends a signal to the cancer cell to induce programmed death of cancer cells, also known as apoptosis.
DR5 Signaling to Induce Programmed Death of Cancer Cells
 


DR5 is expressed in a broad range of solid tumors (e.g., colon, gastric, pancreatic, lung, breast and prostate tumors) as well as leukemias and lymphomas. Although DR5 is expressed on some normal cells in the body, cancer cells have been shown to be more sensitive to DR5 signaling compared to cells of healthy tissues. Various IgG DR5 antibodies have been tested in early stage clinical trials by other companies, but these IgG antibodies failed to demonstrate adequate efficacy. As IgG DR5 antibodies only bind to two DR5 receptors, these IgG antibodies may not have created sufficient cross-linking of DR5 to send an efficient apoptotic signal to the cancer cells, which may account for the relatively small number of monotherapy responses observed in the clinical trials of these IgG antibodies. In contrast, DR5 IgM antibodies have the capacity for multivalent binding of DR5, which results in cross-linked DR5 receptors on the cell surface.

In our laboratory studies, shown in the figure below, multiple DR5 IgM antibodies showed significantly enhanced in vitro efficacy compared to an IgG antibody with the same binding domains, often resulting in at least >1,000 fold increased potency in killing cancer cells from multiple cancer cell types with encouraging in vitro toxicity data. As shown in the figures below, we observed that multiple different engineered DR5 IgM antibodies were able to kill cancer cells at concentrations of 5,000-12,000 fold less than DR5 IgG antibodies with the same binding domains at equal concentrations.
Cell Line Killing Comparison of DR5 IgG and IgM Antibodies with Five Different Binding Domains
 

Human colon cancer cell line Colo205 was incubated in vitro with either DR5 IgG antibodies or IgM antibodies with the same binding domains at increasing concentrations. The ability of the antibodies to kill the cancer cells was tested after 24 hours of incubation. Shown are means + 1 standard deviations of the percent viable (surviving cancer cells) cells at each antibody concentration tested. Studies were repeated between 2-6 times with similar results.
 

We are planning to develop IGM-8444 as a treatment for patients with solid and hematologic malignancies. In September 2020, we announced the dosing of the first patient in our Phase 1 clinical trial of IGM-8444. In this multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation and expansion Phase 1 clinical trial, we are studying IGM-8444 intravenously administered as a monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy in patients with relapsed and/or refractory solid cancers and NHL. IGM-8444 is initially being administered on Days 1 and 15 of 28-day cycles until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, patient withdrawal of consent, or study termination. Alternative dosing schedules may be evaluated. Dose limiting toxicity will be evaluated during the first cycle. The key objectives of this trial are to provide an initial assessment of the pharmacokinetics, safety, biomarkers and preliminary efficacy of IGM-8444 both as a single agent and in combination with standard of care chemotherapy. Additional combination studies in different indications with regimens expected to act synergistically with IGM-8444 may be developed based upon initial results from this Phase 1 clinical trial. We expect to report initial data from this Phase 1 trial in 2021.
 IGM-8444 in Combination with Birinapant
 Inhibitors of Apoptosis Proteins (IAPs) are a family of anti-apoptotic proteins that are normally expressed in cells as part of the cellular homeostatic balance to proapoptotic proteins.  IAPs are overexpressed in a variety of human cancers contributing to unchecked cellular growth, tumor progression and resistance to treatments. Birinapant is a bivalent, small molecule Second Mitochondrial-derived Activator of Caspases (SMAC) mimetic that binds to and degrades IAPs.
 12


Index to Financial Statements
 
We believe SMAC-mimetics, such as birinapant, have the potential to inhibit the overexpressed IAPs and re-establish the apoptosis signal. Moreover, we believe that SMAC-mimetics can be synergistic with a DR5 agonist such as IGM-8444. Accordingly, we tested IGM-8444 preclinically in combination with a number of SMAC-mimetics.  Of all the combinations tested, the combination of IGM-8444 and birinapant showed the greatest cancer cell killing. In an in vivo study, the combination of IGM-8444 and birinapant nearly eliminated all tumor volume compared to vehicle and compared to IGM-8444 or birinapant alone.
 Killing Activity of IGM-8444 in Combination with Birinapant in vivo
 


Human triple negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 was injected subcutaneously in mice and when tumor volumes reached ~120 mm3, mice were injected with 5 mg/kg of IGM-8444 every two days for a total of eleven injections, birinapant at 2.5 mg/kg every three days for a total of seven injections, a combination of both therapeutics or vehicle.  The graph shows the mean tumor volumes + standard error of the means of a total of 10 mice per group.
 Based on these preclinical results, we intend to pursue IGM-8444 and birinapant as a combination therapy in a clinical study. 
 Birinapant was originally discovered and developed by TetraLogic Pharmaceuticals Corporation (TetraLogic) for the treatment of certain cancers and infectious diseases and was tested in various phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials as a monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs and other agents. All monotherapy and combination studies were terminated due to a lack of clinical efficacy with the exception of one combination study in chronic hepatitis B which was discontinued due to cranial nerve palsies and one study sponsored by the National Cancer Institute in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma which remains open, but in which no patients are currently enrolled. In 2016, Medivir AB (Medivir) acquired all rights to birinapant from TetraLogic. In January 2021, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Medivir through which we received global, exclusive development and commercialization rights for birinapant.
 IGM-7354: IL-15 x PD-L1 Bispecific IgM Antibody
 Our third oncology product candidate, IGM-7354, is a bifunctional IgM antibody delivering interleukin-15 (IL-15) cytokines to PD-L1 expressing cells for the treatment of patients with solid and hematologic malignancies.
 In nature, IL-15 stimulates T cells and NK cells to proliferate and maintain their long-term survival. Our IgM platform allows us to attach IL-15 to the J chain of a targeting IgM antibody. We believe that this targeted delivery system for IL-15 will lead to the proliferation of T cells and NK cells in the tumor microenvironment and immune tissues targeted by the IgM antibody.

 In an in vitro study, shown in the figure below, IL-15 x PD-L1 bifunctional IgM antibody mIGM-7354 enhanced proliferation in approximately 60% of CD8 T cells and 80% of NK cells, while a PD-L1 IgM antibody without IL-15 attached to the joining chain did not increase proliferation in CD8 T cells and NK cells. mIGM-7354 is the non-humanized version of IGM-7354 and was used as a surrogate molecule.
 Comparative Activity of the PD-L1 IgM Antibody with and without IL-15 Fused to the J Chain
 

The PD-L1 IgM antibody with (mIGM-7354) and without IL-15 fused to the J chain was incubated at increasing concentrations with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro and the proliferation of CD8+ effector T cell and NK cells was evaluated after three to four days. Shown is a representative study from >10 repeat studies.

We have also performed in vivo tumor efficacy studies using two mouse tumor models:1) a mouse colon cancer cell line (CT26) engineered to express human PD-L1; and 2) a human breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-231) that expresses PD-L1 in mice reconstituted with human immune cells.  In both tumor models, mIGM-7354 inhibited tumor growth compared to vehicle control treatment groups and mice treated with an anti-PD-L1 IgG.  In the CT26 tumor model, mice that were tumor free after treatment with mIGM-7354 rejected the growth of tumor when rechallenged.  These findings demonstrate that mIGM-7354 enhances anti-tumor immunity in mice and can potentially support anti-tumor immune memory responses. 
 We expect to file an IND for IGM-7354 in 2021 in order to begin clinical testing in solid and hematologic malignancies. The proposed multi-center open label Phase 1 clinical trial would study IGM-7354 intravenously administered as part of a staggered monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy 3+3 dose escalation in Phase 1 patients with solid tumor and hematologic malignancies. The objective of this Phase 1 clinical trial would be to provide an initial assessment of pharmacokinetics, safety, biomarker evaluation and preliminary efficacy of IGM-7354 as a single agent and in combination with a defined chemotherapy regimen, based on standard cancer response criteria.
 Research and Discovery Programs
 The following table highlights oncology discovery programs that we are currently prioritizing:


We estimate that most of these discovery programs are at least a year away from clinical studies, assuming they meet our requirements for advancement. We do not anticipate advancing all of these programs into clinical testing, and some of these programs may be supplanted by other IgM discovery programs. In addition to these oncology programs, we are also developing IgM antibodies for the possible prevention and treatment of COVID-19.

University of Texas Agreement
 In October 2020, we entered into a multi-year patent and materials license agreement with the Board of Regents of the University of Texas System on behalf of the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston for certain antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Under the terms of the agreement, we are obligated to pay an upfront payment of $0.1 million, an annual license fee of up to $0.1 million, research and development fees aggregating up to $2.8 million upon the achievement of clinical and regulatory milestones and single digit royalties on future net sales of antibody products stemming from this agreement.
 AvantGen Agreement
 In December 2020, we entered into a multi-year patent and license agreement with AvantGen Inc. for certain antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Under the terms of the agreement, we are obligated to pay an upfront payment of $0.2 million, an annual fee of up to $0.3 million upon the first and second anniversaries of the agreement, research and development fees aggregating up to $8.4 million upon the achievement of clinical and regulatory milestones and single digit royalties on future net sales of antibody products stemming from this agreement.
 Medivir Agreement
 In January 2021, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Medivir AB through which we received global, exclusive development and commercialization rights for birinapant, a clinical-stage SMAC-mimetic that binds to and degrades IAPs, leading to apoptosis in tumor cells. The combination of IGM-8444 and birinapant has been shown to enhance anti-tumor activity preclinically. Under terms of the agreement, we made an upfront payment of $1.0 million upon signing the agreement, to be followed by an additional $1.5 million payment when birinapant is included by us in our clinical Phase 1 studies. Under the terms of the agreement, should birinapant be successfully developed and approved, we are obligated to make milestone payments up to a total of approximately $350.0 million, plus tiered royalties from the mid-single digits up to mid-teens on net sales.
Other Agreements
 We have entered into certain other agreements pursuant to which we are evaluating antibody sequences from third parties. Under these agreements, we are able to research and initially develop some of our discovery programs and are required to make certain annual payments. Total expense recorded in connection with these agreements was $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. We also have the option to negotiate or enter into commercial license agreements with some of these third parties if we elect to continue development or commercialization of any product candidates resulting from these agreements. If we exercise our option to negotiate or enter into any commercial licenses with these third parties, we will be subject to additional payment obligations upon achievement of certain development, regulatory, commercialization and other milestones and low single digit royalty payments on product sales.
Manufacturing and Supply
 We do not currently operate a current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) manufacturing facility. We expect to continue to rely for some time, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing. We also rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to package, label, store and distribute our investigational product candidates.
 We have spent significant resources developing our current manufacturing processes and know-how to produce sufficient yields and optimize functionality in conjunction with our contract manufacturing partners. Typically, we use Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells to produce IgM and bispecific IgM antibodies by transfecting those cells with plasmids containing genes encoding heavy chain (HC), light chain (LC) and J chain (JC) domains. To construct a bispecific IgM we use a plasmid containing a modified JC gene that encodes a single chain fragment variable (scFv) domain. The IgM pentamers, containing HC, LC and JC in an appropriate ratio (e.g., 10:10:1), are assembled within the CHO cells, and secreted into the cell supernatant, all of which are contained in a large single-use

bioreactor. The product IgM is harvested and purified to homogeneity using methods and processes developed by us. Our processes provide for cost-effective purification and formulation stability in the manufacturing of IgM antibodies.
 We have completed construction of a cGMP manufacturing facility expected to be adequate for the manufacture of clinical trial drug materials. Once this facility becomes operational, we expect to manufacture clinical material for some of our current and future product candidates. We expect to continue to manufacture clinical materials for our first three product candidates, IGM-2323, IGM-8444 and IGM-7354, at outside partners for some extended period of time.
 Subject to the clinical trial success of our product candidates, we plan to design and build a commercial manufacturing facility for the future commercial manufacturing of some or all of our commercial products.
 To date, we have obtained bulk drug substance (BDS) for IGM-2323 and IGM-8444 from single-source third-party contract manufacturers. While any reduction or halt in supply of BDS from these contract manufacturers could limit our ability to develop our product candidates until replacement contract manufacturers are found and qualified, we believe that we have sufficient BDS to support our current clinical trial programs. Filling and finishing of the BDS for IGM-2323 and IGM-8444 has been completed at another third-party contract manufacturer.
 We also expect to obtain BDS for IGM-7354 from a single-source third-party contract manufacturer, and we expect that filling and finishing of the BDS for IGM-7354 will be completed at another third-party contract manufacturer.
 All of our product candidates are manufactured from a master cell bank of that antibody’s production cell line. We have or intend to have one master cell bank for each product candidate that was or will be produced and tested in accordance with cGMP and applicable regulations. Each master cell bank is or will be stored in two independent locations, and we intend to produce working cell banks for each product candidate later in product development. It is possible that we could lose multiple cell banks from multiple locations and have our manufacturing severely impacted by the need to replace the cell banks. However, we believe we have adequate backup should any particular cell bank be lost in a catastrophic event.
 Competition
 The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We face potential competition from many different sources, including major multinational pharmaceutical companies, established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, universities, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for the research, development, manufacturing and commercialization of cancer immunotherapies. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with new immunotherapies and other drug products that may become available in the future.
 We compete in the segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that develop cancer treatments. There are many other companies that have commercialized and/or are developing immuno-oncology treatments for cancer, including large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, such as AbbVie, Amgen, AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck, Novartis, Pfizer and Roche/Genentech.
 We face significant competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that target specific tumor-associated antigens using immune cells or other cytotoxic modalities. These generally include immune cell redirecting therapeutics (e.g., T cell engagers), adoptive cellular therapies (e.g., CAR-T), antibody drug conjugates, targeted radiopharmaceuticals, targeted immunotoxin and targeted cancer vaccines.
 With respect to our lead product candidate, IGM-2323, we are aware of other companies with competing clinical stage therapeutics that target CD20, which include, but are not limited to, Roche/Genentech, Regeneron, Xencor and Genmab.

With respect to our second product candidate, IGM-8444, we are aware of other companies with competing clinical stage therapeutics that target DR5, which include, but are not limited to, AbbVie, InhibRx, Genmab, Clover Biopharmaceuticals, Boehringer Ingelheim and Beijing Sunbio Biotech.
 With respect to our third product candidate, IGM-7354, we are aware of other companies with competing clinical stage therapeutics that utilize targeted and untargeted IL-15, which include, but are not limited to, Roche/Genentech, Kadmon, Nektar, Xencor, ImmunityBio and Cytune Pharma.
 Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved drugs than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and enrolling subjects for our clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
 We could see a reduction or elimination of our commercial opportunity if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we or our collaborators may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or foreign regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for product candidates, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we or our collaborators are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the effectiveness of companion diagnostics, if required, the level of biosimilar or generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
 Intellectual Property
 The proprietary nature and protection of our platforms, product candidates and discovery programs, as well as our processes and know-how, are important to our business. We have sought patent protection in the United States and internationally for our platform technologies, research discoveries and product candidates. For our product candidates, we seek to pursue patent protection covering compositions of matter, methods of use including various treatment indications and methods of creation and manufacture. Throughout the innovation process, and continuing into the product development process, we also plan to seek to identify additional means of obtaining patent protection that would potentially enhance our commercial success, including obtaining patent protection for additional methods of use, such as additional medical indications, for our product candidates, treatment methods for specific patient populations using our product candidates and methods and tests to identify those patient populations, and the manufacture of our product candidates. We also seek to obtain patent protection for refinements and enhancements to our platform technologies. Our policy is to pursue, maintain and defend patent rights in strategic areas and to protect the technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business. We may also rely on trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business, and we may seek to protect and maintain the confidentiality of proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
 To date, we have spent considerable effort securing intellectual property rights, including rights related to our platform technology and product candidates. Our patent portfolios covering our platform technology, product candidates, and related discovery programs, are summarized below.
 Platform Technologies
 As of December 31, 2020, our patent portfolio related to our platform technologies includes eleven patent families and includes issued U.S. and international patents directed to our modified J chain technology.

 Our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and trade secret protection of our current and future product candidates and the methods used to develop and manufacture them, as well as successfully defending these patents against any third-party challenges. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our product candidates depends on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our product candidates, discovery programs and processes.

The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, the patent term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent, insofar as the patent covers the FDA-approved product. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Similar provisions are available in foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our product candidates receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. While we plan to seek patent term extensions on any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted and, if granted, the length of such extensions.
 In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trademark registration, trade secrets, know how, other proprietary information and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect and maintain the confidentiality of proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. We may therefore not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specified circumstances. Our agreements with employees also provide that all inventions conceived by the employee in the course of employment with us or from the employee’s use of our confidential information are our exclusive property. However, such confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements can be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach.
 The patent positions of biotechnology companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development, commercial strategies, drugs or processes, or to obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or our failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights required to develop or commercialize our future products may have a material adverse impact on us. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in derivation proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention.
 For more information on these risks and other comprehensive risks related to our intellectual property, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 Government Regulation
 The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting of biologics such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates.

U.S. Biologics Regulation
 The process required by the FDA before biologic product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
  
▪ | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) regulation;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made;

▪ | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with cGMPs and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s continued safety, purity and potency, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with good clinical practices (GCPs); and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | FDA review and approval of a BLA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical and Clinical Development
 Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol or protocols for preclinical studies and clinical trials. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product, chemistry, manufacturing and controls information, and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site, and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain

data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing preclinical studies and clinical trials and clinical study results to public registries.
 For purposes of BLA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap.
  
▪ | Phase 1. The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, to identify possible side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Phase 2. The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Phase 3. The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.

 In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so-called Phase 4 studies may be made a condition to approval of the BLA. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate, and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product, or for biologics, the safety, purity and potency. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 BLA Submission and Review
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to the FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies.
 Once a BLA has been submitted, the FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. In both standard and priority reviews, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing

facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response letter will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the Complete Response letter without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the Complete Response letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
 If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a product and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.
 Expedited Development and Review Programs
 The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. The fast track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new products are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat patients with a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a fast track product has opportunities for frequent interactions with the review team during product development and, once a BLA is submitted, the product may be eligible for priority review. A fast track product may also be eligible for rolling review, where the FDA may consider for review sections of the BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA.
 A product intended to treat patients with a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product can receive breakthrough therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the fast track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product, including involvement of senior managers.
 25


Index to Financial Statements
 
Any marketing application for a biologic submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with a fast track designation and/or breakthrough therapy designation, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite the FDA review and approval process, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition. For original BLAs, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date (as compared to ten months under standard review).
 Additionally, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating patients with serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will generally require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
 Fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and regenerative medicine advanced therapy (RMAT) designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
 Orphan Drug Designation
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat patients with a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process.
 If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusive approval (or exclusivity), which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application fee.
 A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
 Post-approval Requirements
 Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. 
 26


Index to Financial Statements
 
After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing user fee requirements, under which the FDA assesses an annual program fee for each product identified in an approved BLA. Biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMPs and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
 The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
  
▪ | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of existing product approvals;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | product seizure or detention, or refusal of the FDA to permit the import or export of products;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.
 Biosimilars and Reference Product Exclusivity
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) includes a subtitle called the BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-approved reference biological product. To date, a number of biosimilars have been licensed under the BPCIA, and numerous biosimilars have been approved in Europe. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars.
 27


Index to Financial Statements
 
Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA.
 Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
 The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation, and impact of the BPCIA are subject to significant uncertainty.
 Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Such laws include, without limitation: the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and similar foreign, federal and state fraud and abuse, transparency and privacy laws.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase or recommendation of an item or service for which payment may be made under any federal healthcare program. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value, including stock options. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers, among others, on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, but they are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration, such as consulting agreements, that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act.
 Civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal False Claims Act, which can be enforced through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, and civil monetary penalty laws, which can be enforced through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to the federal government, including federal healthcare programs, that are false or fraudulent. For example, the federal False Claims Act prohibits any person or entity from knowingly 
 28


Index to Financial Statements
 
presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product.
 HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, and making false statements relating to healthcare matters. In addition, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), and their implementing regulations, impose certain requirements on HIPAA covered entities, which include certain healthcare providers, healthcare clearing houses and health plans, and individuals and entities that provide services on their behalf that involves individually identifiable health information, known as business associates, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information.
 The U.S. federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of covered drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to annually report to the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) information related to payments or other transfers of value made to cover recipients, as defined by law, including physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Effective in 2022, these reporting obligations will be expanded to include payments and transfers of value made during the previous year to certain non-physician covered recipients, including physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists and anesthesiologist assistants, and certified nurse-midwives.
 We are also subject to additional similar U.S. state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, which, in some cases, differ from each other in significant ways, and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government-funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid or similar programs in other countries or jurisdictions, integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance, disgorgement, imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any pharmaceutical or biological product for which we obtain regulatory approval. Sales of any product, if approved, depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state, and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement, if any, for such product by third-party payors. Decisions regarding whether to cover any of our product candidates, if approved, the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. Further, no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement exists in the United States, and coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our product candidates to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance.
 For products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs. Additionally, separate reimbursement for the product itself or the treatment or procedure in which the product is used may not be available, which may impact physician utilization.
 29


Index to Financial Statements
 
In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical or biological products, medical devices and medical services, in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product that receives approval. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product. No regulatory authority has granted approval for a personalized cancer immunotherapy based on a vaccine approach, and there is no model for reimbursement of this type of product.
Healthcare Reform
 The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of reform proposals to change the healthcare system. There is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by federal and state legislative initiatives, including those designed to limit the pricing, coverage, and reimbursement of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, especially under government-funded health care programs, and increased governmental control of drug pricing.
 The ACA, which was enacted in March 2010, substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States, and significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA contains a number of provisions of particular import to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including, but not limited to, those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, a new licensure framework for follow on biologic products, and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. For example, in November 2020, the United States Supreme Court held oral arguments on the ACA case from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, which upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate is unconstitutional, and is expected to issue a decision by mid-2021. It is uncertain how the Supreme Court will rule on this case. We cannot predict how this decision or future litigation will impact our business, or what other healthcare measures and regulations will ultimately be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect of any future legislation or regulation may have on our business.
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension implemented under various COVID-19 relief legislation from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021, unless additional action is taken by Congress.
 Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, for example, in September 2018, CMS announced that it will allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option to use step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2019. Additionally, CMS issued a final rule, effective on July 9, 2019, that requires direct-to-consumer television advertisements of prescription drugs and biological products, for which payment is available through or under Medicare or Medicaid, to include in the advertisement the Wholesale Acquisition Cost, or list price, of that drug or biological product if it is equal to or greater than $35 for a monthly supply or usual course of treatment. Prescription drugs and biological products that are in violation of these requirements will be included on a public list. In 2020, HHS and CMS issued various rules that are expected to impact, among others, price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and 
 30


Index to Financial Statements
 
manufacturers, importation of prescription drugs from Canada and other countries, manufacturer price reporting requirements under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including regulations that affect manufacturer-sponsored patient assistance programs subject to pharmacy benefit manager accumulator programs and Best Price reporting related to certain value-based purchasing arrangements. Multiple lawsuits have been brought against the HHS challenging various aspects of these new rules. In January 2021, the Biden administration issued a “regulatory freeze” memorandum that directs department and agency heads to review new or pending rules of the prior administration. It is unclear whether these new regulations will be withdrawn or when they will become fully effective under the current administration. The impact of these lawsuits as well as legislative, executive, and administrative actions of the current administration on us and the biopharmaceutical industry as a whole is unclear. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
 Additionally, the Right to Try Act, which was enacted on May 30, 2018, provides a federal framework for certain patients with life-threatening diseases to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.
