 Our principal executive offices are located at 1101 N. Keller Rd., Suite G, Orlando, Florida 32810, and our telephone number is (407) 804-1000.
   
  Our Markets
  
 We offer the latest generation of laser material processing equipment for a variety of industrial markets and applications, including for defense, space exploration, aerospace, automotive, medical, industrial, electronic and agriculture markets.
  
 The laser cleaning market is estimated to be valued at $611.4 million in 2020 and is expected to be worth $713.6 million by 2023, growing at a CAGR of 3.9% between 2020 and 2024 according to Absolute Reports and Data Bridge Market Research.
  
 Unique Laser Blasting Opportunity for North America
  
 We believe that the laser cleaning equipment market has even a greater potential for growth in light of the size of the $10 billion abrasive cleaning market, and the ancillary $1 billion sandblasting media market, which are being pressured into obsolescence from regulatory agencies from above and labor from below. These market pressures, driven by health, safety and environmental concerns, are accelerating the replacement of abrasive blasting and laser cleaning is emerging as the safe, clean, efficient and affordable alternative.

 The growth of the laser cleaning market is attributable to the benefits it provides over traditional cleaning methods, such as abrasive media blasting (a.k.a. sandblasting), dry-ice blasting, and chemical cleaning processes; all of which are inherently hazardous to the health of workers, as well as to the environment since they generate a considerable amount of potentially harmful waste.
  
 In contrast, laser cleaning is a non-contact and non-abrasive process to remove contaminants or impurities on the surface of metals by physically removing the upper layer of the substrate using laser irradiation and where a desired depth can be achieved with a high degree of accuracy. We expect to approach owners of nuclear facilities that have been decommissioned where studies have shown that for metal surfaces have been exposed to radiation and that the radioactivity is primarily located in the oxide layer. Accordingly, we propose to develop the decontamination of metallic surfaces by laser ablation which consists in ejecting surface contamination using high energy pulses and trapping ablated matter (the impurities removed from the metal’s surface) in a filter to avoid its release into the environment. We believe that laser cleaning has many advantages over abrasive cleaning methods such as the minimization of secondary waste, the absence of effluents and the reduction of the exposure of workers to toxic waste through automation of the cleaning process.

 The diverse lines of laser cleaning equipment are used in work environments to improve and promote programs to address significant concerns about the exposure of employees to toxic airborne materials to reduce the risk of lung cancer and silicosis triggered by inhalation of crystalline silica powders released from abrasive blasting.
  
  Our laser cleaning equipment also facilitates a company’s compliance with OSHA and EPA regulations to protect the health of workers using conventional abrasive blasting equipment.
  
 We are now or will soon address the following market opportunities:

  Growth Strategy
  
 Our objective is to achieve a leadership position in our industry by pursuing the following key elements of our growth strategy:
  
 Multi-market and Multi-product Approach. We intend to develop and manufacture laser systems for a variety of markets to reduce the financial impact that a downturn in any one market would have.
  
 Accent on Developing Standard Systems for Specific Markets. We expect to increase sales through an industry recognized expertise in clearly defined markets with substantial sales demand such as rust removal equipment for the shipbuilding industry, laser de-contamination equipment for the nuclear industry, laser blasting cabinets for the general manufacturing industry, etc.
  
 Broaden Customer Relationships. We expect to develop a global diversified customer base in a variety of industries. We seek to differentiate ourselves from our competitors through superior product pricing, performance and service. We believe that a global presence and investments in application engineering and support will create competitive advantages in serving multinational and local companies.
  
 New Product Development. We intend to target new applications early in the development cycle and drive adoption by leveraging our strong customer relationships, engineering expertise and competitive production costs.
 
  Our Products
  
 Our products are used in a broad range of commercial and industrial applications across a wide range of industries. Laser cleaning products comprised 90% of our sales in 2020. 95% of our sales pipelines for Q1, 2021 are for industrial laser cleaning systems to replace obsolete hazardous abrasives blasting and chemical cleaning equipment. Government health, safety and environmental regulations designed to protect laborers and the environment are pressuring the market to abandon dangerous 19th century abrasives blasting and chemical cleaning processes for safe, clean & green alternatives.
  
 In terms of replacing legacy cleaning systems to safeguarding workers’ health and the environment in a practical, cost-effective manner, we see the laser ablation process as the only viable alternative. Our technology-driven products are already disrupting the abrasives cleaning market, and as a recognized leader in laser photonics research, systems development and product production, we are well-positioned to own a sizable piece of the laser cleaning market.
  
 Our products are researched, designed, tested and built in-house by credentialed laser physicists, software engineers and industrial design engineers. Because we pioneer the innovations that shape the laser photonics industry and we own the intellectual property (IP) that we develop, our systems are cutting-edge and state-of-the-art. Our solid state, integrated optics systems are the most imitated on the market.
  
 Consequently, we expect that our superior quality, Made in America laser blasting products will disrupt and dislodge a significant part of the estimated $50 billion annual global abrasive blasting market, especially in the United States, where government remedies in the form of tough regulations are driven by pressure from labor groups and environmental advocates. The price to operate abrasives-based systems has simply become too high, in terms of fines, law suites, environmental damage and human suffering.

 Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act
  
 We are subject to the laser radiation safety regulations of the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act administered by the National Center for Devices and Radiological Health, a branch of the United States Food and Drug Administration. Among other things, those regulations require laser manufacturers to file new product and annual reports, to maintain quality control and sales records, to perform product testing, to distribute appropriate operating manuals, to incorporate design and operating features in lasers sold to end-users and to certify and label each laser sold to end-users as one of four classes (based on the level of radiation from the laser that is accessible to users). Various warning labels must be affixed and certain protective devices installed depending on the class of product. The National Center for Devices and Radiological Health is empowered to seek fines and other remedies for violations of the regulatory requirements.
  
  CE Marking
  
 We are subject to certain regulations in Europe as administered by the European Commission. CE Marking is required for products marketed within the European Economic Area (EEA) and confirms that the manufacturer meets certain safety, health and environmental protection requirements administered by the European Union. Non-compliance with these regulations could result in warnings, penalties or fines. We believe that we are currently in compliance with these regulations.
  
  United States Food and Drug Administration
  
 Certain products manufactured by us are integrated into systems by our customers that are subject to certain regulations administered by the United States Food and Drug Administration. We must comply with certain quality control measurements for our products to be effectively used in our customers’ end products.

  Available Information
  
 We maintain a website with the address www.laserphotonics.com.
  
 We are not including the information contained in our website as part of, or incorporating it by reference into, this on Form 10-K. We will make available, free of charge through our website, our annual reports on Form 10-K-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-K, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to these reports as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file these materials with, or otherwise furnish them to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
 Emerging Growth Company
  
 We are and we will remain an “emerging growth company” as defined under The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”), until the earliest to occur of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which our total annual revenues equal or exceed $1 billion (subject to adjustment for inflation), (ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt securities, or (iv) the date on which we are deemed a “large accelerated filer” (with at least $700 million in public float) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
  
 As an “emerging growth company”, we may take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:
  
 ● only two years of audited financial statements in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements with correspondingly reduced “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” disclosure;
  
 ● reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements;
  
 ● no requirement that we hold non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements; and
  
 ● exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting.
  
 We have taken advantage of some of these reduced burdens, and thus the information we provide stockholders may be different from what you might receive from other public companies in which you hold shares.
  
 In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable. We are choosing to take advantage of such extended transition period, and as a result, we will not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies.
  
 Notwithstanding the above, we are also currently a “smaller reporting company”, meaning that we are not an investment company, an asset-backed issuer, or a majority-owned subsidiary of a parent company that is not a smaller reporting company and have a public float of less than $75 million and annual revenues of less than $50 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. In the event that we are still considered a “smaller reporting company”, at such time as we cease being an “emerging growth company”, the disclosure we will be required to provide in our SEC filings will increase, but will still be less than it would be if we were not considered either an “emerging growth company” or a “smaller reporting company”.  Specifically, similar to “emerging growth companies”, “smaller reporting companies” are able to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures in their filings; are exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (“SOX”) requiring that independent registered public accounting firms provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting; and have certain other decreased disclosure obligations in their SEC filings, including, among other things, only being required to provide two years of audited financial statements in annual reports.
