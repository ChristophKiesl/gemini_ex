Company Overview and Developments
 Simply, Inc.’s business is currently centered on its wholly owned subsidiary, Simply Mac, Inc. (“Simply Mac”), and its relationship with Apple® as an Apple Premier Partner authorized to operate retail consumer electronics stores that sell the entire line of Apple products and provide service by Apple-certified technicians.  As of January 30, 2021, Simply Mac had 43 retail stores across 17 states in the United States. 
 We incorporated under the laws of the State of California on February 7, 1994, under the name InfoSonics Corporation. On September 11, 2003, we reincorporated under the same name under the laws of and into the State of Maryland.  Our corporate headquarters are in Miami, Florida, with the administrative office of Simply Mac located in Salt Lake City, Utah.  On June 8, 2018, we changed our name to Cool Holdings, Inc., and on October 14, 2020, changed our name to Simply, Inc.
 During 2019, we conducted a number of fundraising transactions.  In May 2019, we sold convertible notes and warrants to raise $3.5 million.  In July, August and September 2019, we sold convertible notes and warrants to raise an aggregate of $4.5 million that was used to purchase Simply Mac.
 On September 25, 2019, pursuant to a Stock Purchase Purchase Agreement dated May 9, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Simply Mac.  Total consideration amounted to approximately $12.6 million.  The results of Simply Mac are included in our consolidated financial statements for periods subsequent to the acquisition.
 We also formerly operated other businesses, which have since been discontinued or sold.  We had two wholly owned international subsidiaries that operated retail consumer electronics stores as Apple Premier Partners under the OneClick name in Argentina and the Dominican Republic.  The Argentina subsidiary, that operated 6 OneClick stores, was sold on January 31, 2020.  The Dominican Republic subsidiary, that operated 7 OneClick stores, was sold on April 6, 2020.  Both entities have been classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements.  Cooltech Distribution, a subsidiary that formerly distributed various consumer electronics to resellers, retailers and small and medium-sized businesses, was wound down by August 1, 2020.
 During March 2020, we restructured substantially all of our then remaining outstanding debt.  At September 30, 2019, after the acquisition of Simply Mac, the principal amount of our outstanding debt amounted to $24.2 million.  During October 2019, approximately $7.8 million of the debt was converted into common stock, leaving $16.4 million outstanding at December 31, 2019.  After the March restructuring, our outstanding debt was reduced by $14.6 million through a combination of debt forgiveness and conversion into common stock, leaving $1.8 million outstanding with extended maturity dates.  On April 16, 2020, we received a $3.1 million loan pursuant to the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”) Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) under Title I of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act passed by Congress and signed into law on March 27, 2020 (“CARES Act”).  On October 19, 2020, we filed a forgiveness application in which we certified that 100% of the funds were spent on qualified payroll and related costs and requested that the entire principal balance be forgiven.  The forgiveness application has been approved by the lender, and we are awaiting SBA approval and funding to extinguish the loan.
 Prior to its acquisition, Simply Mac operated on a 52-53 fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to January 31st.  We subsequently decided to change the fiscal year of Simply, Inc. from a calendar year to mirror the Simply Mac fiscal year effective beginning with the fiscal year ending January 30, 2021 (“Fiscal 2021”) in order to align our financial reporting periods to the operational periods of the Simply Mac stores and be more consistent with peer retail companies. We made the fiscal year change on a prospective basis and did not adjust operating results for prior periods.  This Form 10-K includes audited consolidated financial statements for the calendar year ended December 31, 2019, the one-month transition period for the month of January 2020, and the fiscal year ended January 30, 2021. As permitted under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), prior period financial statements have not been recast, as management believes (i) the calendar year ended December 31, 2019 is comparable to the fiscal year ended January 30, 2021, and (ii) recasting prior period results was not practicable nor cost justified.

Effective October 14, 2020, we effected a one-for-ten reverse split of our issued and outstanding common stock.  All share and per share numbers in this report have been retroactively restated to account for the reverse split.  In addition, certain accounts in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2019 were reclassified to conform to their presentation at February 1, 2020 and at January 30, 2021.
 Reportable Segments and Geographic Areas
 We currently operate our business in a single segment in the United States through our Simply Mac retail stores.  We previously operated a second segment through our Cooltech Distribution business, but this unit was wound down by August 1, 2020.  Financial information about our segments is included in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Note 13, "Segments," of the notes to the consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Store Operations, Merchandise and Seasonality
 As an Apple Premier Partner, we work with Apple to develop our network of Simply Mac stores in locations and markets where Apple has limited or no presence.  Our stores are generally located in high-traffic or local neighborhood strip centers or shopping malls.  In our stores, we sell Apple and Apple-approved products and accessories, including accessories that we source from independent third parties.  We also provide repair service for Apple products performed by our Apple-certified employee technicians.  Retail customers may book a repair appointment at one of our SimplyMac stores either through our website or, alternatively, through the Apple website.  Our Simply Mac business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal, with a large portion of our sales and operating profit realized during the fourth calendar quarter of the year.
Purchasing and Suppliers
 The majority of our product purchases are of Apple products, which we buy both directly from Apple as well as from a tier‑one distributor facilitated by our license agreement with Apple.  We also have direct relationships with certain accessory manufacturers and purchase other accessories from distributors.  We believe that maintaining and strengthening our relationships with Apple and our other vendors is essential to our operations and continued expansion.
Competition
 The consumer electronics and accessory industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid changes in consumer preferences and frequent new product introductions. We compete with mass merchants such as Wal-Mart, Best Buy and Target, and regional chains; specialty computer product and consumer electronics stores; and online retailers such as Amazon.  We also technically compete with Apple-owned stores and Apple’s online store.
Sustainability
 We are committed to sustainability and to operating our business in a manner that results in a positive impact to the environment and our communities. Through our trade-in programs, we buy back or take in used consumer electronics that are otherwise destined for landfills and either refurbish them or recycle them. In addition, we continuously look for cost-effective ways to reduce our carbon emissions.
Employees
 As of January 30, 2021, we had 293 full-time salaried employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are members of a collective bargaining unit.
