Item 1. Business
General
We are a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company on March 15, 2021 for the purpose of effecting the Initial Business Combination. Our Sponsor is a Delaware limited liability company. We have reviewed, and continue to review, a number of opportunities to enter into an Initial Business Combination with an operating business, but we are not able to determine at this time whether we will complete an Initial Business Combination with any of the target businesses that we have reviewed or with any other target business. We also have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date. Based on our business activities, the Company is a “shell company” as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash.
On July 6, 2021, we consummated our Initial Public Offering of 25,000,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one Class A Ordinary Share, par value $0.0001 per share, and one-third of one redeemable warrant of the Company. Each whole warrant is exercisable to purchase one Class A Ordinary Share of the Company at a price of $11.50 per share. Only whole warrants are exercisable. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $250,000,000 (before underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses).
Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, pursuant to (i) the Private Placement Warrants Purchase Agreement between us and our Sponsor, dated June 30, 2021, and (ii) the Amended and Restated Subscription Agreements by and among us, the Sponsor and certain funds and accounts managed by subsidiaries of BlackRock, Inc (the “Anchor Investor”), dated June 17, 2021, we completed the private sale of 4,666,667 warrants to the Sponsor and 2,000,000 warrants to the Anchor Investor, respectively (collectively, the “Initial Private Placement”), at a purchase price of $1.50 per warrant, generating gross proceeds of $10,000,000.
On July 6, 2021, a total of $252,500,000, comprised of $245,000,000 of the proceeds from the Initial Public Offering (which amount includes $8,750,000 of the underwriters’ deferred discount payable to the underwriters solely in the event that the Company completes an Initial Business Combination, subject to the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, dated June 30, 2021, by and between us and B. Riley Securities, Inc., as underwriter) and $7,500,000 of the proceeds from the sale of the Initial Private Placement, was placed in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee.
Subsequently, on August 5, 2021, the underwriter fully exercised its 45-day option (the “Over-Allotment Option”) to purchase an additional 3,750,000 Units (the “Over-Allotment Units”) to cover over-allotments, and the closing of the issuance and sale of the Over-Allotment Units occurred on August 10, 2021. The issuance of the Over-Allotment Units at a price of $10.00 per Over-Allotment Unit resulted in total gross proceeds of $37,500,000. On August 10, 2021, simultaneously with the issuance and sale of the Over-Allotment Units, we consummated the sale of an additional 525,000 warrants to the Sponsor and 225,000 warrants to the Anchor Investor (the “Over-Allotment Private Placement, and, together with the Initial Private Placement, the “Private Placements,” and each warrant issued in the Private Placements, a “Private Placement Warrant”), at a purchase price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant generating gross proceeds of $1,125,000. The Private Placement Warrant issued in connection with the Over-Allotment Private Placement were issued pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), as the transaction did not involve a public offering.
Business Strategy
To be successful in today’s competitive technology landscape, we believe it is important to have recent and relevant operational experience in high-growth companies coupled with deep ties to the venture capital and private equity funding ecosystem and experience working on public company boards. It is vital that the team have experience working together, aligned interests, and a mindset that puts the company first. We have applied this lens when building our team and business strategy.
Our team is comprised of industry leaders who have deep experience as executives, investors and board members in some of the most significant technology companies and platforms of this era. We intend to source Initial Business Combination opportunities through our team’s extensive networks. Over the course of their careers, the members of our team have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships across the venture capital, growth equity and private equity landscape, and including founders, seasoned 

1



executives and operators at the premier and emerging technology companies. Our team will activate these close relationships to quickly build a robust flow of acquisition opportunities.
We intend to partner with the management, owners and founders of a target business to understand their goals, objectives, opportunities and limitations in order to align on the best long-term path for the company. We intend to focus our efforts on excellent companies where we believe the combination of our operating experience and professional relationships can be beneficial to the growth strategy of the target business. We will trust them to build an enduring, successful company, and we will be there as a partner to support them through the ups and downs on that journey. We believe that our team will be an attractive partner to the founders, executives and board members of target companies given our collective experience helping to build some of the most iconic companies of today.
Business Combination Targets
We believe our management team’s significant operating and transaction experience and relationships with companies will provide us with a substantial number of potential business combination targets. Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships around the world. This network has grown through the activities of our management team sourcing, acquiring, financing and selling businesses, our management team’s relationships with sellers, financing sources and target management teams and the experience of our management team in executing transactions under varying economic and financial market conditions.
We believe this network has provided our management team with a robust and consistent flow of acquisition opportunities which were proprietary or where a limited group of investors were invited to participate in the sale process. We believe that the network of contacts and relationships of our management team will provide us with important sources of acquisition opportunities. In addition, we anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity funds and large business enterprises seeking to divest non-core assets or divisions.
We are not prohibited from pursuing an Initial Business Combination with a company that is affiliated with our Sponsor, directors or officers, or making the acquisition through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our Sponsor, directors or officers. In the event we seek to complete an Initial Business Combination with a target that is affiliated with our Sponsor, directors or officers, we, or a committee of independent and disinterested directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or from an independent accounting firm that such an Initial Business Combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.
Members of our management team and our directors own our Founder Shares, Class A Ordinary Shares and/or Private Placement Warrants, and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our Initial Business Combination. In particular, because the Founder Shares were purchased at approximately $0.003 per share, the holders of our Founder Shares (including members of our management team that directly or indirectly own Founder Shares) could make a substantial profit after our Initial Business Combination even if our public shareholders lose money on their investment as a result of a decrease in the post-combination value of their ordinary shares (after accounting for any adjustments in connection with an exchange or other transaction contemplated by the Initial Business Combination). Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors were to be included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our Initial Business Combination.
If any of our directors or officers becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. Our directors and officers currently have fiduciary duties or contractual obligations that may take priority over their duties to us.
Business Combination Criteria
We have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We will use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating Initial Business Combination opportunities, but we may decide to consummate our Initial Business Combination with a target business that does not meet one or more of these criteria and guidelines.

2



Middle-Market Businesses.  We will seek to acquire one or more businesses with an enterprise value of approximately $1.5 billion and up, although we may find an attractive deal below that range.
Strong Management Teams with a Proven Track Record.  We intend to seek target companies who serve a large addressable market, have strong management teams, and a proven track record of driving technological innovation and growth.
Targets that can Benefit from our Team’s Relationships and Experience.  We intend to capitalize on the ability of our team to identify and acquire a business or businesses that can benefit from our team’s operating expertise and relationships. We will seek to partner with potential target’s management team and expect that the operational abilities of our management and board will help potential target company to unlock opportunities for future growth. Our team is committed to providing support, guidance and, where necessary, additional management talent to help the company achieve the next level of excellence.
Growth Opportunities through Capital Investment. We intend to seek candidates with significant growth potential who will benefit from additional capital investment through a business combination. These target companies may have the opportunity to expand product lines, geographical regions, teams, grow through acquisition or all of the above.
Benefit from being a Public Company.  We plan to evaluate companies that are well run, serve a large market, and can benefit greatly from becoming a public company and the associated public profile and broader access to capital.
Risk-Adjusted Return.  We intend to acquire one or more companies that we believe can offer attractive risk-adjusted returns on investments for our shareholders.
These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular Initial Business Combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management team may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our Initial Business Combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our shareholder communications related to our Initial Business Combination, which would be in the form of proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, that we would file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management, board members and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspections of facilities, as well as reviewing financial and other information which will be made available to us.
Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of our Initial Business Combination
To the extent we effect our Initial Business Combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot promise that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information, which will be made available to us.
The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our Initial Business Combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our Initial Business Combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.
Initial Business Combination
Nasdaq listing rules require that our Initial Business Combination must be with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account). We refer to this as the 80% fair market value test. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with 

3



respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not currently intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our Initial Business Combination, although there is no assurance that will be the case. Additionally, pursuant to Nasdaq rules, any Initial Business Combination must be approved by a majority of our independent directors.
We anticipate structuring our Initial Business Combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our Initial Business Combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the issued and outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to our Initial Business Combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the Initial Business Combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity securities of a target business or issue a substantial number of new shares to third-parties in connection with financing our Initial Business Combination. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our Initial Business Combination could own less than a majority of our issued and outstanding shares subsequent to our Initial Business Combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% fair market value test. If our Initial Business Combination involves more than one target business, the 80% fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses.
We have until January 6, 2023 or April 6, 2023 (within 18 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering or 21 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering if we have executed a definitive agreement for an Initial Business Combination within 18 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering but have not completed an Initial Business Combination within such 18 month period), as applicable, to complete our Initial Business Combination.
Shareholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve Our Initial Business Combination
We may conduct redemptions without a shareholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC subject to the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. However, we will seek shareholder approval if it is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we may decide to seek shareholder approval for business or other reasons.
Redemption Rights for Public Shareholders upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination
We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our Initial Business Combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the Initial Business Combination, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. At the completion of our Initial Business Combination, we will be required to purchase any ordinary shares properly delivered for redemption and not withdrawn. The amount held in the trust account is $10.10 per public share. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. The redemption rights will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our Initial Business Combination with respect to our warrants. Our Initial Shareholders, directors and officers have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares and public shares held by them in connection with the completion of our Initial Business Combination.
Limitations on Redemptions
Our second amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets, after payment of the deferred underwriting commissions, to be less than $5,000,001 following such redemptions. Redemptions of our public shares may also be subject to a higher net tangible asset test or cash requirement pursuant to an agreement relating to our Initial Business Combination. For example, the proposed business combination 

4



may require: (1) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners; (2) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes; or (3) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all public shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all ordinary shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof, and we instead may search for an alternate business combination.
Limitation on Redemption Rights of Shareholders Holding More than 20% of the Shares Sold in the Initial Public Offering if we Hold a Shareholder Vote
If we seek shareholder approval of our Initial Business Combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our Initial Business Combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our second amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to Excess Shares, without our prior consent. We believe this restriction discourages shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our Sponsor or its affiliates to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 20% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us or our Sponsor or its affiliates at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders’ ability to redeem no more than 20% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our Initial Business Combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our shareholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our Initial Business Combination.
Redemption of Class A Ordinary Shares and Liquidation if No Initial Business Combination
We only have 18 months (or 21 months, as applicable) from the closing of the Initial Public Offering to complete our Initial Business Combination. If we have not completed our Initial Business Combination within such time period, we will: (1) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (2) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses and which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any); and (3) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our Initial Business Combination within the allotted time period.
Our Initial Shareholders have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their Founder Shares if we fail to complete our Initial Business Combination within 18 months (or 21 months, as applicable) from the closing of the Initial Public Offering. However, if our Initial Shareholders acquire public shares, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our Initial Business Combination within the allotted time period.
Our Sponsor, directors and officers have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our second amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our Initial Business Combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our Initial Business Combination within 18 months (or 21 months, as applicable) from the closing of the Initial Public Offering or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-Initial Business Combination activity, unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Class A Ordinary Shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public 

5



shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets, after payment of the deferred underwriting commissions, to be less than $5,000,001 following such redemptions.
Other Corporate Information
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We are taking advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of the Initial Public Offering (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non- affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of the prior fiscal year’s second quarter and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.00 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter.
We are a Cayman Islands exempted company. Exempted companies are Cayman Islands companies wishing to conduct business outside the Cayman Islands and, as such, are exempted from complying with certain provisions of the Companies Act. As an exempted company, we have applied for and have received a tax exemption undertaking from the Cayman Islands government that, in accordance with Section 6 of the Tax Concessions Act (As Revised) of the Cayman Islands, for a period of 20 years from the date of the undertaking, no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations shall apply to us or our operations and, in addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations or which is in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax shall be payable (1) on or in respect of our shares, debentures or other obligations or (2) by way of the withholding in whole or in part of a payment of dividend or other distribution of income or capital by us to our shareholders or a payment of principal or interest or other sums due under a debenture or other obligation of us.
Competition
We expect to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be individuals or investment partnerships), other blank check companies and other entities, domestic and international, competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire. Many of these individuals and entities are well established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources or more local industry knowledge than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there are numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire with the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore, in the event we seek shareholder approval of our Initial Business Combination and 

6



we are obligated to pay cash for our Class A Ordinary Shares, it will potentially reduce the resources available to us for our Initial Business Combination. Any of these obligations may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. If we have not completed our Initial Business Combination within the required time period, our public shareholders may receive only approximately $10.10 per share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless.
Facilities
We currently maintain our executive offices at 2995 Woodside Road, Suite 250, Woodside, CA 94062. The cost for our use of this space is included in the $5,000 per month fee we will pay to our Sponsor for office space, administrative and support services. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.
Employees
We currently have two officers: R. Grady Burnett, Co-Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our board of directors and W. Lance Conn, Co-Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and one of our directors. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our Initial Business Combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our Initial Business Combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the completion of our Initial Business Combination.
Available Information
We are required to file Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q with the SEC on a regular basis, and are required to disclose certain material events in a Current Report on Form 8-K. The SEC maintains an Internet website that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. The SEC’s Internet website is located at http://www.sec.gov. In addition, the Company will provide copies of these documents without charge upon request from us in writing at 2995 Woodside Road, Suite 250, Woodside, CA 94062 or by telephone at (650) 995-7205.
