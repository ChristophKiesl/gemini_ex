ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We are a technology driven distributor of Medicare, health and life insurance products that meet the demands and needs of our consumers. Our business is comprised of two operating segments: our Medicare Segment, which includes our offering of Medicare-related health insurance plans, and our IFP Segment which includes individual and family health insurance plans ("IFP"), short-term medical ("STM") insurance plans, health benefit insurance plans ("HBIP") and supplemental products which include a variety of additional insurance and non-insurance products. We actively market products to individuals through televised commercials, e-commerce platforms and digital marketing campaigns, strategic marketing partner relationships, and other licensed-agent distribution channels, consisting of both our internal distribution network, and an external distribution network of independently owned and operated distributors.
The health insurance products we sell are underwritten by third-party insurance carriers with whom we have no affiliation apart from our contractual relationships. Other than with respect to the activities of Benefytt Reinsurance, which is described further below, we are not an insurer, we assume no underwriting, insurance or reimbursement risk. 
Medicare Segment
Our Medicare segment is centered around two activities: consumer engagement and Medicare insurance distribution. The consumer engagement business operates through a direct-to-consumer platform which connects individuals with licensed insurance agents serving the Medicare insurance market through inbound live telephone calls via a third-party telephony platform which transfers inbound calls in real time. In the Medicare insurance business, we route inbound calls to both our internal captive distribution channel as well as to our business process outsourcing partners ("BPO") distribution channel, who distribute Medicare-related health insurance plans on our behalf. Medicare products offered include Medicare Advantage, Medicare Supplement, and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans.
The Company's entrance into the Medicare distribution and consumer engagement business was marked by the purchase of TogetherHealth on June 5, 2019. This acquisition marked the beginning of the Company's strategic shift toward Medicare as the core product line and during the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company concluded that the Company's chief operating decision maker required a two-segment reporting view to better measure performance and profitability of the two lines of business. The Company has previously announced a de-emphasis of the IFP segment, allowing continued new product distribution only with select e-commerce focused distributors, so the Company can focus on accelerating growth of the Medicare segment.
The Company has also acquired a premier domain name and has complemented that investment with the development of powerful online shopping and comparison tools for Medicare-related insurance plans as well as educational resources specific to the Medicare segment. The domain will serve as an industry-defining private e-commerce marketplace for Medicare insurance products where consumers can shop, compare, and purchase plans online. We also expect the domain to generate a significant amount of consumer demand which will flow through to all distribution channels.
IFP Segment
We partner with e-commerce distributors to provide affordable IFP plans to individuals and families. We also market IFP through licensed-agent distribution channels, consisting of both our internal distribution network and an external distribution network of independently owned and operated distributors. STM plans feature a streamlined underwriting process offering immediate purchase options. STM plans offer qualifying individuals, under the age of 65, fixed duration insurance benefits. STM plans generally provide health insurance coverage with an open-provider network and a wide range of deductible and copay levels.
HBIPs are insurance products with undefined policy term lengths that include both guaranteed-issue and underwritten plans that pay fixed cash benefits, and additional benefits for certain plans, for covered procedures and services for individuals under the age of 65. 
Supplemental insurance and non-insurance products include life insurance policies, dental plans, vision plans, cancer/critical illness plans, deductible and gap protection plans, and pharmacy benefit cards, that are frequently purchased as supplements to IFPs. These supplemental products typically do not have defined policy term lengths and are not affected by regulations relating to maximum duration or renewal of STM products.

Through our website, HealthPocket.com, we provide consumers with access to health insurance information search and comparison technology. This website allows consumers to easily and clearly compare and rank health insurance plans available for an individual, family or small business, empowering consumers to make informed health plan decisions. The Company also has a direct-to-consumer insurance website that allows consumers to research health insurance trends, comparison shop, and purchase IFPs under the AgileHealthInsurance® brand ("Agile").
In May 2019, the Company formed Benefytt Reinsurance, a captive reinsurance company which only engages in the reinsurance of certain insurers' IFP business that was provided and administered by HIIQ. The current operations of Benefytt Reinsurance have not been material to the Company's financial statements.
We are a Delaware corporation, and we were incorporated on October 26, 2012.
Recent Developments
Acquisition of TogetherHealth and Entrance into Medicare Business
On June 5, 2019, the Company purchased TogetherHealth, which marked the beginning of the Company's strategic shift toward Medicare as the core product line.
Exploration of Strategic Alternatives
On July 26, 2019, we announced that our Board of Directors commenced a process to explore, review and evaluate a range of potential strategic alternatives focused on maximizing shareholder value. These alternatives could include, among other things, a sale of the Company or a portion thereof, a strategic business combination, changes in the Company’s operations or strategy, or continuing to execute on the Company’s current business plan. On March 3, 2020, the Company announced that the review of potential strategic alternatives was ongoing.
Change in Business Strategy
On December 20, 2019, we announced a change in our overall business strategy to accelerate growth within the Medicare segment. The IFP segment will be de-emphasized moving forward and our focus for IFP will be to maximize cash flows and enhance e-commerce capabilities. By decreasing emphasis on new business within the IFP segment, we will be able to use cashflows from the IFP segment to invest in accelerating growth of the Medicare segment. 
Exchange of Remaining Class B Common Stock
On February 12, 2020, the holders of our Class B common stock notified the Company that have elected to exchange all remaining shares of Class B common stock, together with an equal number of Series B Membership Interests in HPIH, into an aggregate of 1,016,667 shares of our Class A common stock (the “Final Class B Exchange”) pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, dated February 13, 2013, among the Company, HPIH, and the holders of the Class B common stock (the “Exchange Agreement”). Under the terms of the Exchange Agreement, the closing of the Final Class B Exchange is scheduled to occur on April 7, 2020 unless the Company elects to effectuate the Final Class B Exchange on an earlier date. Upon the closing of the Final Class B Exchange, the Company will cease to have any shares of Class B common stock outstanding and will own 100% of the equity interest in HPIH. 
Corporate Name Change and Ticker Symbol Change
On March 3, 2020, the Company announced that the Company will file a Certificate of Amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation to change the Company’s name to “Benefytt Technologies, Inc.” effective as of March 6, 2020, and the Company’s trading symbol on the Nasdaq Global Market will also be changed from “
Health Insurance Industry and Market Opportunity

Medicare is a federal program that provides persons 65 years of age and over, and some persons under the age of 65 who meet certain conditions, with hospital and medical insurance benefits. Medicare beneficiaries generally have a choice between Medicare Fee-For-Service and Medicare Advantage plans. Medicare Fee-For-Service is a government health insurance plan where the consumer is responsible for select health care related payments with no limit on out-of-pocket expenses. To increase coverage, Medicare Fee-For-Service beneficiaries can purchase commercially offered Medicare Supplement plans. Medicare Advantage is an alternative to Medicare Fee-For-Service. Under Medicare Advantage Plans, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
6

("CMS") contracts with private health insurance carriers under the Medicare Advantage program and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans. Under these programs, the government generally pays insurers a fixed amount of money each year per enrollee to cover healthcare expenses rather than making payments directly to providers under Medicare Fee-For-Service. Medicare Advantage plans are required to cover the same services as Medicare Fee-For-Service and usually cover a variety of other health care services and include a cap on out-of-pocket spending for the consumer. 
In recent years there have been major changes to health insurance laws. Some of these changes were implemented under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“PPACA”) and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 ("HCERA"), which we collectively refer to as "Healthcare Reform." Healthcare Reform imposed requirements on a broad segment of the population, including, through December 31, 2018, a mandate that most individuals carry health insurance or face tax penalties (the "Individual Mandate Penalty"); tax credits and subsidies for the policy premium costs of individual major medical plans ("IMM") for qualifying individuals; the establishment of a mandatory set of ten Essential Health Benefits for IMM plans; a mandate that certain employers offer most of their employees group health insurance coverage or face tax penalties; prohibitions against insurance companies that offer IMM insurance plans using pre-existing health conditions as a reason to deny an application for health insurance; and medical loss ratio ("MLR") requirements that require each health insurance carrier to spend a certain percentage of its IMM premium revenue on reimbursement for clinical services and activities that improve healthcare quality.

Healthcare Reform has, among other things, contributed to a dramatic increase in the unsubsidized average premium for IMM plans, caused carriers to narrow networks available under IMM plans and restricted the availability (except in limited circumstances) of open enrollment periods. Our IFP plans' affordable premium prices, wide acceptance among healthcare providers and year-round availability provide value to the consumer that may not be available under PPACA health plans. Our IFP products are not subject to narrow networks and are exempt from the minimum MLR thresholds, pre-existing condition provision restrictions, and Essential Health Benefits requirements under Healthcare Reform, allowing us to provide health insurance products with average premium cost typically more affordable than unsubsidized PPACA health plans. We believe that these dynamics in the health insurance industry present an opportunity to increase our market share in the individual health insurance market.
Ongoing changes in the health insurance industry have expanded and reshaped our target market and we believe the market will continue to evolve. We intend to continue to pursue opportunities to help meet consumers' needs for affordable health insurance. We believe that our technology platform, product focus, and industry expertise will allow us to gain an increasing share of this dynamic market.

Our Strategy

Our objective is to increase shareholder value by increasing our demand generation capabilities, expanding capacity of our Medicare distribution channels, leveraging our technology to serve our existing consumer base and continuing to provide an outstanding member experience. Our principal strategies to meet these objectives are:

• | Medicare Market. With the strategic acquisition of TogetherHealth and our expanded captive distribution, the Company positioned itself for a strong entrance into the Medicare space prior to the 2019 Medicare annual open enrollment period. Continued investment in technology, distribution, compliance, and marketing is expected to drive continued growth.


• | Data-Driven Product Innovation. We will continue to utilize vast amounts of data to constantly enhance and diversify our product portfolio to provide consumers with more robust choices for their health insurance needs.


• | Outstanding Member Experience. We have invested significant resources and strive to be market leaders in our member services. We continue to invest in technologies that improve the member experience and increase member retention.


• | Maximize e-Commerce Opportunity. We believe that e-commerce is an efficient and compliant distribution channel that we see as a continued investment opportunity. We will continue to expand our direct to consumer web presence with continued focus on its profitability.


• | Expand Compliant Distribution. The traditional distribution network we access includes independently owned and operated internet distributors and licensed-agent call centers to sell insurance products. The technology platform and other support that we provide, and the terms on which we trade with our distribution network, motivates distributors to work with us. We provide distributors with training, audit and other support, and monitoring, and we continue to improve our distributor compliance.

7


• | Increased Consumer Awareness. We believe that increased consumer awareness will enhance consumer choice and increase understanding of products that are available in the health insurance market. Through our enhanced member experience, e-commerce platforms, targeted marketing campaigns, and collaboration with regulatory and government entities, we will continue to drive awareness and education in the market.


• | Focus on Scalability and Leverage. We believe that continuing to invest in technology will improve our scalability and on a per-policy basis, reduces the costs associated with marketing, selling, and other obligations.


• | Strategic Acquisitions and Other Transactions. We may acquire, or invest in, companies, products or technologies that complement our current products, enhance our market coverage, technical capabilities or production capacity, or offer growth opportunities.

Our Competitive Strengths

Proprietary, Web-Based, Direct-to-Consumer Technology Platforms
Our business utilizes a unique and scalable proprietary, web-based technology platform for products offered in our IFP segment. Our technology represents a distinct competitive advantage as it reduces the need for member support agents, the time associated with quoting, billing, underwriting, fulfillment, sale and marketing, and provides significant operating leverage as we add members and product offerings.
Our Core Technology

Our core technology platform processes and combines data that is used in insurance plan and product design, sales and distribution of insurance products, member services, business and regulatory compliance, and general reporting. Key elements of our core technology platform include:

• | Quote-Buy-Print. Individuals access our technology platform through our distribution channels and can quote products and buy and print their policy documents and identification cards at any time.


• | Automated Underwriting. The entire underwriting process is handled by our core technology platform through the use of health questionnaires approved by the insurance carriers. Underwriting for IFP products is an immediate accept or reject decision based on a prospective member's answers to an abbreviated online health-related questionnaire.


• | Payment. Through our online platform, we receive credit card and Automated Clearing House ("ACH") payments directly from members at the time of sale and automatically process recurring payments.


• | Member Services. Members have the ability to log-in and change payment information and print new identification cards, all without the need of a customer service representative.


• | Verification and Compliance. We incorporate eSign technology from Adobe Sign, part of Adobe Inc., on our platform to streamline compliance by providing real-time verification to our members' mobile devices. This technology has allowed us to further automate our compliance program, enhancing quality while minimizing overhead.


• | Adaptability. Our core technology platform is highly adaptable and can support a wide range of insurance products. This allows us to be product agnostic and quickly add or remove products as required by shifting market dynamics.

MyBenefitsKeeper® ("MBK")
The addition of MBK has further enhanced our technological advantage by simplifying and improving the member experience by allowing members to manage benefits and purchase products via our online member portal. MBK will continue to be an integral component of our strategic advantage and value proposition, regardless of product mix, helping to increase retention as well as revenue per member.
Established Long-Standing Insurance Carrier Relationships

Our management team has developed close relationships with the senior management teams of many of our insurance carriers. We believe that the nature of our relationships with our insurance carriers, combined with our product knowledge and 
8

technology platform, allow us to provide value-added products to our members. We also continue to develop relationships with new carriers to help us expand our Medicare product portfolio.

Long-Term Relationships with Licensed Insurance Distributors

Our scalable technology platforms, our relationships with multiple insurance carriers, our focus on compliance, and our product expertise make us a partner of choice for our distributors. We leverage our long-standing insurance carrier relationships to access highly competitive products which are desirable to distributors. Our management team has built a broad network of e-commerce focused distribution partners and is continuously vetting new, highly compliant, third-party licensed independent distributors.
Seasoned Management Team

Our management team has substantial experience and long-standing relationships developed over long periods in the insurance and risk management industries. Our management team draws on its broad industry experience to identify opportunities to expand our business and collaborate with insurance carriers and distributors to help develop products and respond to market trends.
Sales and Marketing

Our commercial sales and marketing initiatives primarily consist of hiring experienced sales professionals to strengthen our relationships with existing and potential third-party distributors, implementing marketing campaigns, attending industry-sponsored events, and direct-to-consumer via the internet.

We derive a significant portion of our website traffic through contractual marketing relationships with online businesses. These marketing relationships include online advertisers, content providers and insurance lead aggregators. We also attract website traffic from consumers who search for health insurance through internet search engines. A critical factor in attracting consumers to our website is whether we are prominently displayed in response to internet searches broadly relating to health insurance topics. As part of this marketing strategy, we employ both algorithmic listings and paid advertisements to attract consumers to our website.

Seasonality

The distribution of Medicare-related insurance plans is impacted by Healthcare Reform and the majority of Medicare policies are sold during the fourth quarter's annual Medicare open enrollment period. During these periods, Medicare eligible individuals can enroll or change their Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D coverage.
During the times that these open enrollment periods are closed, consumers continue to age into Medicare throughout the year and are able to enroll in plans through an initial enrollment period. We also have the ability to sell our IFP and supplemental products as health insurance to consumers who are unable to enroll in plans under PPACA. Other seasonality trends may develop and the existing seasonality and consumer behavior that we have experienced to date may change as legislative and/or regulatory changes to Healthcare Reform continue and our markets change.
The marketing and sale of IFP and supplemental plans is also subject to seasonal fluctuations. The open enrollment period was open in the fourth quarter of 2019, at which time individuals could enroll in PPACA compliant individual insurance programs. During the times that the open enrollment period is closed, we have the ability to sell our IFP products as an alternative health insurance option for consumers who are ineligible for plans offered by PPACA.
Competition

The market for selling insurance products is highly competitive and the sale of health insurance over the internet is rapidly evolving. We compete with individuals and entities that offer and sell health insurance products utilizing traditional distribution channels, as well as the internet. Our current and potential competitors include:

Exchanges. Government and privately administered exchanges ("Exchanges") have been established under Healthcare Reform where individuals can select and purchase health insurance plans. With respect to Medicare, we compete with the federal government’s original Medicare program. CMS also offers Medicare plan online enrollment, information and comparison tools and has established call centers for the sale of Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans. CMS has regulatory authority over the Medicare Advantage program and can influence the competitiveness of Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part 
9

D prescription drug plans compared to the original Medicare program, as well as the compensation that health insurance carriers are allowed to pay us.
Traditional Local Insurance Agents. There are thousands of local insurance agents across the United States who sell health insurance products in their communities. We believe that the vast majority of these local agents offer health insurance without significantly utilizing the internet or technology other than simple desktop applications such as word processing and spreadsheet programs. Some traditional insurance agents, however, utilize general agents that offer online quoting services and other tools to obtain quotes from multiple carriers and prepare electronic benefit proposals to share with their potential members. These general agents typically offer their services only for the small and mid-sized group markets (not the individual and family markets) and operate in only a limited geographic region. Additionally, some local agents use the internet to acquire new consumer referrals from companies that have expertise in internet marketing. These "lead aggregator" companies utilize keyword search, primarily paid keyword search listings on various online search engines and other forms of internet advertising, to drive internet traffic to the lead aggregator's website. The lead aggregator then collects and sells consumer information to agents and, to a lesser extent, to carriers, both of whom endeavor to close the referrals through traditional offline sales methods.

Health Insurance Carriers' "Direct-to-Member" Sales. Some carriers directly market and sell their plans and products to consumers through call centers and their own websites. Although we offer health insurance plans and products for many of these carriers, they also can compete with us by offering their products directly to consumers. Most of these carriers have brand recognition, extensive marketing budgets and significant financial resources to influence consumer preferences for searching and buying health insurance online. 

Online Agents. There are a number of agents that operate websites and provide an online shopping experience for consumers interested in purchasing health insurance (e.g., online quoting of health insurance product prices). Some online agents also sell non-health insurance products such as auto insurance, life insurance and home insurance.

We believe the principal factors that determine our competitive advantage in the online distribution of health insurance include the following:

• | direct-to-consumer engagement platform;


• | proprietary, web-based technology platform;


• | powerful shopping and comparison tools;


• | strength of carrier relationships and depth of technology integration with carriers;


• | data-driven product strategy;


• | highly automated compliance program;


• | strength of distribution relationships; and


• | seasoned management.

 Intellectual Property

Our success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology, and to operate our business without infringing or violating the intellectual property or proprietary rights of others. We rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, domain names, trade secrets, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights (including confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements), including our proprietary technology. However, these intellectual property rights may not prevent others from creating a competitive online platform or otherwise competing with us.

For more information see Item 1A. Risk Factors—"We rely on third-party vendors to develop, host, maintain, support and enhance our technology platform" and Item 1A. Risk Factors—"Our failure to obtain, maintain and enforce the intellectual property rights on which our business depends could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations."

Healthcare Laws and Regulations

Our business is subject to extensive, complex and rapidly changing federal and state laws and regulations. Various federal and state agencies have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce healthcare laws. While we believe we comply in all material respects with applicable healthcare laws and regulations, these regulations can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and interpretation of existing laws and regulations may change. Federal and state legislatures may also enact various legislative proposals that could materially impact certain aspects of our business.
In addition to federal and state healthcare laws, we are also subject to regulations and guidelines issued by CMS that place a number of requirements on health insurance carriers and agents and brokers in connection with the marketing and sale of Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans. We are subject to similar requirements of state insurance departments with respect to our marketing and distribution of Medicare Supplement plans. CMS and state insurance department regulations and guidelines include a number of prohibitions regarding the ability to contact Medicare-eligible individuals and place many restrictions on the marketing of Medicare-related plans. For example, our health insurance carrier partners are required to file with CMS and state departments of insurance certain of our platforms, our call center scripts and other marketing materials we use to market Medicare-related plans. In some instances, CMS or state departments of insurance must approve the material before we use it. In addition, the laws and regulations applicable to the marketing and distribution of Medicare-related plans are ambiguous, complex and, particularly with respect to regulations and guidance issued by CMS for Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans, change frequently. 
Healthcare Reform

In March 2010, Healthcare Reform was signed into law. Healthcare Reform contains provisions that have changed and will continue to change the health insurance industry in substantial ways. For example, Healthcare Reform includes a mandate that employers with over 50 employees offer their employees group health insurance coverage or face tax penalties; prohibitions against insurance companies that offer IMM plans using pre-existing health conditions as a reason to deny an application for health insurance; MLR requirements that require each health insurance carrier to spend a certain percentage of their premium revenue on reimbursement for clinical services and activities that improve healthcare quality; establishment of Exchanges to facilitate access to, and the purchase of, health insurance; and subsidies and cost-sharing credits to make health insurance more affordable for those below certain income levels.

Healthcare Reform amended various provisions in many federal laws, including the Internal Revenue Code, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Public Health Services Act. Healthcare Reform has been implemented by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Labor and the Department of Treasury. Many of the PPACA regulations became effective on or before January 1, 2014, but regulatory changes continue. Through these regulations, the federal government and its implementing agencies may regulate or otherwise impose restrictions upon all types of health insurance including the IFP products that we sell. Although the U.S. Supreme Court upheld Healthcare Reform's mandate requiring individuals to purchase health insurance in 2012, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act") has eliminated the Individual Mandate Penalty for individuals who do not purchase such health insurance beginning in 2019, and there is continuing uncertainty about whether other parts of Healthcare Reform or PPACA regulations will remain in effect or be further amended, with the possibility of future litigation with respect to certain provisions as well as legislative efforts to repeal and defund portions of Healthcare Reform or Healthcare Reform in its entirety. We cannot predict the outcome of any future legislation or litigation related to Healthcare Reform. As described under "Item 1. Business—Health Insurance Industry and Market Opportunity," Healthcare Reform has resulted in profound changes to the individual health insurance market and our business, and we expect these changes to continue.

Short-Term, Limited-Duration Insurance: Final Rule

The Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, and Treasury, effective October 2, 2018, published a rule that changed the way that short-term, limited duration insurance coverage is regulated. The new rule extended the maximum duration of these plans allowing for renewal or extensions for up to 36 months, subject to state law. The new rule included updated notice requirements and made STM a more practical and flexible form of coverage than it had been previously. Additionally, as of January 1, 2019, the tax penalty for individuals not maintaining minimum essential coverage was reduced to $0. This removed another obstacle that may have prevented certain consumers from previously purchasing STM.

Anti-Kickback Laws

In the United States, there are federal and state anti-kickback laws that generally prohibit the payment or receipt of kickbacks, bribes or other remuneration given with the intent to induce the referral of patients or other health-care program related business. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it a crime for individuals or entities to, among other things, knowingly and willfully 
11

offer, pay, solicit, or receive any remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce or reward referrals of items or services reimbursable by a federal healthcare program. Where remuneration is paid knowingly and willfully to induce or reward referrals of items or services payable by a federal healthcare program, the Anti-Kickback Statue is violated. For purposes of the Anti-Kickback Statute, "remuneration" includes the transfer of anything of value, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind. There are also state law corollaries to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Penalties for violations include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment, and possible exclusion from federal healthcare programs. While federal and state Anti-Kickback Statutes are drafted broadly, there are also extensive safe harbors that can protect arrangements that may otherwise implicate and violate the law if the arrangements are structured to fit within an applicable safe harbor. Our future activities relating to the manner in which we sell and market our services may be subject to scrutiny under these laws and we will need to carefully structure our operations to comply with these laws which may limit how we conduct business.

Federal Civil False Claims Act and State False Claims Laws

The federal civil False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The "qui tam" or "whistleblower" provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. There are also state law corollaries to the federal False Claims Act. Our future activities relating to the manner in which we sell and market our services may be subject to scrutiny under these laws, and we will need to carefully structure our operations to comply with these laws which may limit how we conduct business.
HIPAA, Privacy Laws and Data Security Regulations

By processing data on behalf of our clients and members, we are subject to specific compliance obligations under privacy and data security-related laws, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ("HIPAA"), the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (the "HITECH Act"), and related state laws. We are also subject to federal and state security breach notification laws, as well as state laws regulating the processing of protected personal information, including laws governing the collection, use and disclosure of social security numbers and related identifiers.

The regulations that implement HIPAA and the HITECH Act establish uniform standards governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of individually identifiable health information maintained or transmitted by healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, all of which are referred to as "covered entities," and their "business associates" (which includes anyone who performs a service on behalf of a covered entity involving the use or disclosure of protected health information and is not a member of the covered entity's workforce). Our carrier companies' and our clients' health plans generally will be covered entities, and as their business associate, we will be subject to many of the same laws and may be asked to contractually comply with certain additional aspects of these standards by entering into requisite business associate agreements with the covered entities. Under the HIPAA implementing regulations, business associates and covered entities can each be held individually responsible for privacy and data security breaches.

State Privacy Laws
In addition to federal regulations issued under HIPAA, some states have enacted privacy and security statutes or regulations, or "State Privacy Laws," that govern the use and disclosure of a person's medical information or records and, in some cases, are more stringent than those issued under HIPAA. These State Privacy Laws include regulation of health insurance providers and agents, regulation of organizations that perform certain administrative functions such as utilization review or third-party administration, issuance of notices of privacy practices, and reporting and providing access to law enforcement authorities. In those cases, it may be necessary to modify our operations and procedures to comply with these more stringent State Privacy Laws. If we fail to comply with applicable State Privacy Laws, we could be subject to additional sanctions.
Consumer Protection Laws

Federal and state consumer protection laws are being increasingly enforced by the United States Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"), the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC"), and the various states' attorneys general to regulate the collection, use, storage and disclosure of personal or patient information, through websites or otherwise, and to regulate the presentation of website content and to regulate direct marketing, including telemarketing and telephonic communication. Courts may also adopt the standards for fair information practices promulgated by the FTC, concerning consumer notice, choice, security and access.
Certain laws, such as the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, give the FTC, FCC and state attorneys general the ability to regulate, and bring enforcement actions relating to, telemarketing practices and certain automated outbound contacts such as phone 
12

calls, texts or emails. Under certain circumstances, these laws may provide consumers with a private right of action. Violations of these laws could result in substantial statutory penalties and other sanctions.

As part of the payment-related aspects of our business, we may also undertake security-related obligations arising out of the USA Patriot Act, Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Payment Card Industry guidelines applicable to card systems. These requirements generally require safeguards for the protection of personal and other payment related information.

State Insurance Laws

Some of the states in which we operate have laws prohibiting unlicensed persons or business entities, including corporations, from making certain direct and indirect payments or fee-splitting arrangements with licensed insurance agents and brokers. Possible sanctions for violation of these restrictions include loss of license and civil penalties. These statutes vary from state to state, are often vague, and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies.

State insurance laws also require us to maintain any combination of insurance agency, broker, and third-party administrator licenses in each state in which we transact health insurance business and adhere to sales, documentation and administration practices specific to that state. Where there is any ambiguity or uncertainty in statutes as to whether we require a particular type of license in a state, we seek to obtain that license. In addition, each of our employees who solicits, negotiates, sells or transacts health insurance business for us must maintain an individual insurance agent or broker license in one or more states. Because we transact business in the majority of states, compliance with health insurance-related laws, rules and regulations is difficult and imposes significant costs on our business.

In certain states, some of our products may only be available as a group association plan. In these states, members must enroll in group programs or associations in order to access certain of our insurance products, benefits and services. We have entered into relationships with such associations in order to provide individuals access to our products. For example, we have an agreement with Med-Sense Guaranteed Association ("Med-Sense"), a non-profit association that provides membership benefits to individuals and gives members access to certain of our products. Under the agreement, we primarily market membership in the association and collect certain fees and dues on its behalf. In return, we have sole access to its membership list, Med-Sense exclusively endorses the insurance products that we offer, and we receive compensation for our services. Our agreement with Med-Sense is automatically renewable for one-year terms, unless terminated on 120 days written notice by either party. The agreement is also terminable on 15 days' written notice by either party under certain circumstances, such as in the case of a breach.

Employees

As of December 31, 2019, we had 345 employees, of which 342 were full-time employees. We have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our employee relations to be good. None of our employees are represented by a labor union.
