ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Teleflex Incorporated is referred to herein as “we,” “us,” “our,” “Teleflex” and the “Company.”
THE COMPANY
Teleflex is a global provider of medical technology products that enhance clinical benefits, improve patient and provider safety and reduce total procedural costs. We primarily design, develop, manufacture and supply single-use medical devices used by hospitals and healthcare providers for common diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in critical care and surgical applications. We market and sell our products to hospitals and healthcare providers worldwide through a combination of our direct sales force and distributors. Because our products are used in numerous markets and for a variety of procedures, we are not dependent upon any one end-market or procedure. We manufacture our products at approximately 30 manufacturing sites, with major manufacturing operations located in the Czech Republic, Germany, Malaysia, Mexico and the United States.
We are focused on achieving consistent, sustainable and profitable growth and improving our financial performance by increasing our market share and improving our operating efficiencies through:

• | development of new products and product line extensions;


• | investment in new technologies and broadening their applications;


• | expansion of the use of our products in existing markets and introduction of our products into new geographic markets;


• | achievement of economies of scale as we continue to expand by leveraging our direct sales force and distribution network for new products, as well as increasing efficiencies in our sales and marketing and research and development structures and our manufacturing and distribution facilities; and


• | expansion of our product portfolio through select acquisitions, licensing arrangements and business partnerships that enhance, extend or expedite our development initiatives or our ability to increase our market share.

Our research and development capabilities, commitment to engineering excellence and focus on low-cost manufacturing enable us to bring cost effective, innovative products to market that improve the safety, efficacy and quality of healthcare. Our research and development initiatives focus on developing these products for both existing and new therapeutic applications, as well as enhancements to, and line extensions of, existing products. We introduced 25 new products and line extensions during 2016. Our portfolio of existing products and products under development consists primarily of Class I and Class II devices, most of which require 510(k) clearance by the United States Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"), for sale in the United States, and some of which are exempt from the requirement to obtain 510(k) clearance. We believe that 510(k) clearance (or 510(k)-exempt status) reduces our research and development costs and risks, and typically results in a shorter timetable for new product introductions as compared to the premarket approval, or PMA, process that would be required for Class III devices. See "Government Regulation" below.
OUR SEGMENTS
We have the following six reportable operating segments: Vascular North America, Anesthesia North America, Surgical North America, EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa), Asia and OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer and Development Services). In connection with our presentation of segment information for our reportable segments, we also present, in the "All other" category, information pertaining to several immaterial operating segments. The following charts depict our net revenues by reportable operating segment and by the operating segments in the "all other" category as a percentage of our total consolidated net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.

Vascular North America: Our Vascular North America segment is comprised of our North American vascular and interventional access businesses, which offer products that facilitate a variety of critical care therapies and other applications.
Vascular Access Products
Our vascular access products primarily consist of our Arrow branded catheters and related devices, including catheter positioning systems, that are used in a wide range of procedures, including the administration of intravenous medications and other therapies, the measurement of blood pressure and the withdrawal of blood samples through a single puncture site.
The vascular access product portfolio principally consists of the following products:

• | Arrow Central Venous Catheters (CVCs): Arrow CVCs are inserted in the neck or shoulder area and come in multiple lengths and up to four channels, or lumens. The Arrow CVC has a pressure injectable option which gives clinicians who perform contrast-enhanced CT scans the ability to use an indwelling (in the body) pressure injectable Arrow CVC to inject contrast dye for the scan without having to insert a second catheter.


• | Arrow EZ-IO Intraosseous Vascular Access System: The Arrow EZ-IO system provides vascular access for the delivery of medications and fluids via intraosseous, or in the bone, infusion when traditional vascular access is difficult or impossible. Sales of the Arrow EZ-IO system to our hospital customers are included in our Vascular North America segment results. As discussed below, sales of the Arrow EZ-IO to pre-hospital care customers, such as emergency medical service providers, are included in our Anesthesia North America segment results. 


• | Arrow Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters (PICCs): Arrow PICCs are soft, flexible catheters that are inserted in the upper arm and advanced into a vein that carries blood to the heart to administer various types of intravenous medications and therapies. Arrow PICCs have a pressure injectable option that can withstand the higher pressures required by the injection of contrast media for CT scans.


• | Arrow Jugular Axillo-subclavian Central Catheters (JACCs): Arrow JACCs are designed to be inserted in the neck or shoulder area and provide an alternative to traditional CVCs and PICCs for acute care. Arrow JACCs may be used for short or long term periods to treat patients who may have poor peripheral circulation. 


• | Arrow Midline Catheters (Midlines): Arrow Midlines are made of medical grade, flexible polyurethane material and are inserted in the upper arm. Midlines are appropriate when patients face difficult intravenous catheter insertions or therapy will last no longer than one to four weeks. 


• | Arrow® Catheter Tip Positioning Systems: We offer two distinct catheter tip positioning systems that are designed to facilitate precise placement of catheters within the heart. The first is our VPS G4 Vascular Positioning System, which is an advanced vascular positioning system designed to facilitate precise placement of CVCs within the heart. Indicated as an alternative to chest x-ray confirmation for CVC tip placement confirmation in adult patients, the VPS G4 analyzes multiple metrics, in real time, to help clinicians navigate through the circulatory system and identify the correct catheter tip placement in the heart. We also offer the Arrow® VPS Rhythm™ System, which provides electrocardiogram (ECG)-based tip confirmation in a highly portable, lightweight and versatile design. ECG technology facilitates catheter tip placement and confirmation within the superior vena-cava-cavatorial junction in the heart, and can be used with a broad range of catheter types. When paired with our VPS TipTracker™ 

5

stylet for insertion of PICCS, the Arrow VPS Rhythm System provides real-time visual navigation by tracing the catheter pathway with a blue line on a color screen.

• | Arrow Arterial Catheterization Sets: Our Arrow arterial catheterization sets facilitate arterial pressure monitoring and blood withdrawal for glucose, blood-gas and electrolyte measurement in a wide variety of critical care and intensive care settings.


• | Arrow Multi-Lumen Access Catheters (MAC): The Arrow MAC combines the access of a sheath introducer with the high-flow lumens of a central line. The MAC's hemostasis valve allows for easy access for additional devices, such as a thermodilution catheter or ARROW® MAC Companion Catheter, adding up to three additional lumens. 


• | Arrow Percutaneous Sheath Introducers: Our Arrow percutaneous sheath introducers are used to insert cardiovascular and other catheterization devices into the vascular system during critical care procedures.

The large majority of our CVCs are treated with solutions based on our ARROWg+ard or ARROWg+ard Blue Plus antimicrobial technology, which have been shown to reduce the risk of catheter related bloodstream infection. Our Chlorag+ard technology, available on our PICCs, JACCs and Midlines, provides antimicrobial and antithrombogenic protection on inner and outer catheter surfaces as well as the entire fluid pathway of the catheter. Chlorag+ard technology has been shown to be effective in reducing microbial colonization and thrombus accumulation on catheter surfaces. 
We also offer many of our vascular access catheters in Maximal Barrier Precautions trays, which are designed to assist healthcare providers in complying with clinical guidelines for reducing catheter-related bloodstream infections. These trays are available for CVCs, PICCs and multi access catheters and include a full body drape, coated or non-coated catheters and other accessories. In addition, our ErgoPACK system offers clinicians a broad range of tray configurations with components packaged in the tray in the order in which they will be needed during the procedure, and incorporates features designed to promote ease of use and patient and provider safety.
Interventional Access Products
Our interventional access products are used in a wide range of applications, including dialysis, oncology and critical care therapies. Our interventional access portfolio also includes several Arrow branded products, such as diagnostic and drainage kits, embolectomy balloons, and reinforced percutaneous sheath introducers. Our interventional access products include:

• | Arrow OnControl® Powered Bone Marrow / Bone Access System: The Arrow OnControl powered bone access system enables access for hematology and oncology diagnostic procedures. The system is used to obtain bone marrow samples, aspirate the bone and access bone lesions. 


• | Arrow Trerotola™ Percutaneous Thrombectomy Device ("PTD"): The Arrow Trerotola PTD is used for declotting of dialysis grafts and fistulas. 


• | Arrow Chronic Hemodialysis Catheters: The Arrow chronic hemodialysis catheters include both antegrade and retrograde insertion options for split, step and symmetrical tip configurations. 


• | ARROW-Clark™ VectorFlow™ Hemodialysis Catheter: The Arrow-Clark VectorFlow catheter is a symmetrical tip tunneled hemodialysis catheter designed to reduce loss of lock solution (which is used on catheters to reduce the risk of thrombosis), give sustained high flows and reduce the risk of thrombus accumulation due to platelet activation. Additionally, the specially designed catheter tip allows for placement flexibility with minimal impact on recirculation. 


• | Arrow Acute Hemodialysis Catheters: Similar to the Arrow CVC portfolio, the Arrow Acute hemodialysis catheters are offered with or without ARROWg+ard antimicrobial surface treatment. 


• | Arrow Polysite® Low Profile Hybrid Ports: The Arrow Polysite Low Profile Hybrid Port is used for long-term access to the central nervous system and to facilitate repeated vascular access. It is available in multiple standard French sizes. The hybrid design provides a strong titanium reservoir and lightweight plastic body delivering the strength and the comfort needed for long-term treatment in patients of all sizes.

Airway Management Products
Our airway management products and related devices consist principally of the following:

• | LMA® Airways: Our LMA laryngeal masks are used by anesthesiologists and emergency responders to establish an airway to channel anesthesia gas or oxygen to a patient's lungs during surgery or trauma. The LMA Protector™ Airway, our latest airway management device, is the first single-use laryngeal mask with a dual gastric drainage channel and pharyngeal chamber designed specifically to channel high volume, high pressure gastric contents away from the airway. It also integrates our Second Seal™ technology to isolate the respiratory tract from the digestive tract, reducing the risk of aspiration of gastric contents. The LMA Protector Airway also includes our Cuff Pilot™ technology, which enables clinicians to confirm that the inserted cuff is properly inflated and to monitor pressure levels. 


• | LMA® Atomization: Our LMA atomization portfolio includes products designed to facilitate atomized delivery of certain medications. Included in the portfolio is our LMA MAD Nasal™, an intranasal mucosal atomization device that is designed to provide a safe and painless way to deliver medications approved for intranasal delivery to a patient's blood stream without an intravenous line or needle. 


• | RUSCH® Endotracheal Tubes and Laryngoscopes: We offer a broad portfolio of products to facilitate and support endotracheal intubation to administer oxygen, and anesthetic gases in multiple settings (surgery, critical care and emergency settings). We also provide a broad range of products for laryngoscopy, a procedure that is primarily used to obtain a view of the airway to facilitate tracheal intubation during general anesthesia or cardiopulmonary resuscitation ("CPR"). Among these products is the Rusch DispoLED™ Laryngoscope Handle and Green Rusch Lite Blade, a single-use system designed to help facilities comply with standards designed to reduce the potential for patient cross-contamination associated with reusable devices during intubation. 

Pain Management Products
Our pain management products, which are designed for use in a broad range of surgical and obstetric procedures, consist principally of the following: 

• | Arrow Epidural Catheters, Needles and Kits: We offer a broad range of Arrow epidural products, including the Arrow FlexTip Plus epidural catheter, to facilitate epidural analgesia. Epidural analgesia may be used separately for pain management, as an adjunct to general anesthesia, as a sole technique for surgical anesthesia and for post-operative pain management. 


• | Arrow Peripheral Nerve Block ("PNB") Catheters, Pumps, Needles and Kits: Our portfolio of Arrow PNB products, which includes the Arrow Stimucath and FlexBlock catheters, are designed to be used by anesthesiologists to provide localized pain relief by injecting anesthetics to deliberately interrupt the signals traveling along a nerve. Nerve blocks are used in a variety of different procedures, including orthopedics. 


• | AutoFuser Disposable Pain Pumps: Our AutoFuser Disposable Pain Pumps are designed for general infusion use, which includes regional anesthesia and pain management. Routes of administration include percutaneous, subcutaneous and epidural, and into the intra-operative (soft tissue/body cavity) sites. The AutoFuser offers multiple reservoir sizes and configurations to meet a variety of clinical demands. 


• | Arrow EZ-IO System: The EZ-IO system, as described in the Vascular North America segment summary above, complements our pain management product portfolio when administered in pre-hospital emergency settings.

Surgical North America: Our surgical products are designed to provide surgeons with a comprehensive range of devices for use in a variety of surgical procedures. Our portfolio consists of single-use and reusable products, including the following:

• | Weck®Ligation Systems: Our Weck Ligation Systems feature the Weck Ligating Clips and Hem-o-lok® Ligating Clips. Weck Ligating Clips are intended for use in procedures involving vessels or anatomic structures and are sold in various sizes, types and materials. Our Hem-o-lok Ligating Clips are intended for use in procedures involving ligation of vessels or tissue structures and are sold in various sizes.

• | Weck EFx Fascial Closure Systems: Our Weck fascial closure systems are used in laparoscopic surgical procedures and are intended to facilitate placement and withdrawal of suture loops to repair port site defects following laparoscopic surgery. Our Weck EFx endo fascial closure system is a port site closure device intended to minimize complications and costs associated with port-site herniation. We expanded this product line in 2015 to include the EFx Shield fascial closure system, which uses a shielded wing design for enhanced sharps protection, and a more basic cone and suture system called EFx Classic. 


• | Percutaneous Surgical Systems: Our Mini-Lap surgical instruments, which we added to our product portfolio through our December 2014 acquisition of Mini-Lap Technologies, Inc. ("Mini-Lap"), are designed to be inserted percutaneously (through the skin) to enable surgeons to perform laparoscopic surgery without the need for a trocar. The MiniLap family of surgical instruments consists of a ThumbGrip option on a 2.3mm shaft or a pistol design called MiniGrip option on a 2.4mm shaft. In addition, we have developed the PercuvanceTM percutaneous surgical system - 2.9mm device shaft with 5 mm operating tips. Percuvance, is used to penetrate soft tissue to access certain areas of the human abdomen and to grasp, hold and manipulate tissue, and, like Minilap, enables surgeon to access the abdominal cavity without the need for access ports. We received 510(k) clearance for this product in January 2015 and initiated a controlled launch of the product in the United States and Europe in 2015. In 2016, we initiated a limited market release in the United States and Europe. 

Our other branded surgical products include our Weck Vista bladeless access ports, Deknatel sutures and our Pilling® and Kmedic® surgical instruments. 
Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”): Our EMEA segment designs, manufactures and distributes medical devices primarily used in critical care, surgical applications and cardiac care and generally serves two end markets: hospitals and healthcare providers, and home health. The products offered by our EMEA segment are most widely used in acute care settings for a range of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and in general and specialty surgical applications, such as urology.
Asia: Our Asia segment, like our EMEA segment, designs, manufactures and distributes medical devices primarily used in critical care, surgical applications and cardiac care and generally serves hospitals and healthcare providers. The products offered by our Asia segment are most widely used in acute care settings for a range of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and in general and specialty surgical applications.
OEM: Our OEM segment designs, manufactures and supplies devices and instruments for other medical device manufacturers. Our OEM division, which includes the TFX OEM® and Deknatel® OEM brands, provides custom-engineered extrusions, diagnostic and interventional catheters, balloon sheath/dilator sets (introducers) and kits, sutures, performance fibers, and bioresorbable resins and fibers. We offer an extensive portfolio of integrated capabilities, including engineering, material selection, regulatory affairs, prototyping, testing and validation, manufacturing, assembly and packing.
All other businesses:  Our other operating segments do not meet the threshold for separate disclosure under applicable accounting guidance and are therefore included in the “All other” line item in tabular presentations of segment information. Products offered by these operating segments include single-use respiratory, urology and cardiac care products, as well as capital equipment, which are provided to hospitals and other alternative channels of care. Also included in the "All other" line item is our Latin American business. 
Respiratory/Urology Product Portfolio
In 2015, we combined our respiratory and urology businesses. Our respiratory products are used in a variety of care settings and include oxygen therapy products, aerosol therapy products, spirometry products, and ventilation management products. Our Hudson RCI brand has been a prominent name in respiratory care for over 65 years. 
Our urology product portfolio provides bladder management for patients in the hospital and individuals in the home care markets. The product portfolio consists principally of a wide range of catheters (including Foley, intermittent, external and suprapubic), urine collectors, catheterization accessories and products for operative endourology marketed under the Rusch brand name. 
8

Cardiac Care Product Portfolio
Products in this portfolio include diagnostic and intra-aortic balloon catheters and capital equipment. Our diagnostic catheters include thermodilution and wedge pressure catheters; specialized catheters used during the x-ray examination of blood vessels, such as Berman and Reverse Berman catheters; therapeutic delivery catheters, such as temporary pacing catheters; sheaths for femoral and trans-radial aortic access used in diagnostic and therapeutic procedures; and intra-aortic balloon, or IAB, catheters. Capital equipment includes our intra-aortic balloon pump, or IABP, consoles. IABP products are used to augment oxygen delivery to the cardiac muscle and reduce the oxygen demand after cardiac surgery, serious heart attack or interventional procedures. We market our cardiac care products under the Arrow brand name.
Latin America
Our Latin America business generally engages in the same type of operations, and serves the same type of end markets, as the EMEA and Asia segments.
OUR MARKETS
We generally serve three end-markets: hospitals and healthcare providers, medical device manufacturers and home care. These markets are affected by a number of factors, including demographics, utilization and reimbursement patterns. The following charts depict the percentage of net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 derived from each of our end markets.
HISTORY AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
Teleflex was founded in 1943 as a manufacturer of precision mechanical push/pull controls for military aircraft. From this original single market, single product orientation, we expanded and evolved through entries into new businesses, development of new products, introduction of products into new geographic or end-markets and acquisitions and dispositions of businesses. Throughout our history, we have continually focused on providing innovative, technology-driven, specialty-engineered products that help our customers meet their business requirements.
Beginning in 2007, we significantly changed the composition of our portfolio of businesses, expanding our presence in the medical device industry, while divesting all of our other businesses, which served the aerospace, automotive, industrial and marine markets. Following the divestitures of our marine business and cargo container and systems businesses in 2011, we became exclusively a medical device company.
We expect to continue to increase the size of our business through a combination of acquisitions and organic growth initiatives.

Acquisition of Vascular Solutions
On February 17, 2017, we acquired Vascular Solutions, Inc., a medical device company focused on developing clinical solutions for minimally invasive coronary and peripheral vascular procedures (“Vascular Solutions”). See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Distributor-to-Direct Sales Conversions and Restructuring Programs
We have completed conversions from distributor sales to direct sales in several countries, including Australia, Korea, Japan and certain countries within our EMEA segment. We recently determined to undertake a distributor to direct sales conversion in China as a result of our decision to eliminate a key distributor within that sales channel. See Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Segment Results - Comparison of 2016 and 2015 - Asia" for further information regarding this initiative. These distributor to direct sales conversions generally involve eliminating a distributor from the sales channel, either by acquiring the distributor or terminating the distribution relationship. In some instances, particularly in Asia, the conversions relate to our acquisition or termination of a master distributor and the continued sale of our products through third party sub-distributors or through new distributors. The distributor to direct sales conversions enable us to obtain improved product pricing and more direct access to the end users of our products within the sales channel. Additionally, we continue to execute restructuring programs to improve efficiencies in our sales and marketing and research and development organizations and in our manufacturing and distribution facilities.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
We are subject to comprehensive government regulation both within and outside the United States relating to the development, manufacture, sale and distribution of our products.
Regulation of Medical Devices in the United States
All of our medical devices manufactured or sold in the United States are subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDC Act”), and its implementing regulations, which are enforced by the FDA. The FDA and, in some cases, other government agencies administer requirements for the design, testing, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record keeping, clearance, approval, advertising and promotion, distribution, post-market surveillance, import and export of our medical devices.
Unless an exemption or pre-amendment grandfather status applies, each medical device that we market must first receive either clearance as a Class I or Class II device (by submitting a premarket notification (“510(k)”) or approval as a Class III device (by filing a premarket approval application (“PMA”)) from the FDA pursuant to the FDC Act. To obtain 510(k) clearance, a manufacturer must demonstrate that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed 510(k)-cleared device (or pre-amendment device for which FDA has not called for PMAs), referred to as the "predicate device." Substantial equivalence is established by the applicant showing that the proposed device has the same intended use as the predicate device, and it either has the same technological characteristics or has been shown to be equally safe and effective and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the predicate device.  The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from four to twelve months, but it can last longer. A device that is not eligible for the 510(k) process because there is no predicate device may be reviewed through the de novo process (the process for approval when no substantially equivalent device exists) if the FDA agrees it is a low to moderate risk device. A device not eligible for 510(k) clearance or de novo clearance is categorized as Class III and must follow the PMA approval pathway, which requires proof of the safety and effectiveness of the device to the FDA’s satisfaction.  The process of obtaining PMA approval is much more costly, lengthy and uncertain than the 510(k) process. It generally takes from one to three years or even longer. Our portfolio of existing products and pipeline of potential new products consist primarily of Class I and Class II devices that require 510(k) clearance, although a few are 510(k) exempt.  In addition, modifications made to devices after they receive clearance or approval may require a new 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA or PMA supplement. We cannot be sure that 510(k) clearance or PMA approval will be obtained in a timely matter if at all for any device that we propose to market.
A clinical trial is almost always required to support a PMA application and is sometimes required for a 510(k) clearance.  The sponsor of a clinical study must comply with and conduct the study in accordance with the applicable federal regulations, including FDA’s investigational device exemption (“IDE”) requirements, and good clinical practice (“GCP”).  Clinical trials must also be approved by an institutional review board ("IRB"), which is an appropriately constituted group that has been formally designated to review biomedical research involving human subjects and which 
10

has the authority to approve, require modifications in, or disapprove research to protect the rights, safety, and welfare of the human research subject.  The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients.  An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions.
A device placed on the market must comply with numerous regulatory requirements. Those regulatory requirements include the following:

• | device listing and establishment registration;


• | adherence to the Quality System Regulation (“QSR”) which requires stringent design, testing, control, documentation, complaint handling and other quality assurance procedures;


• | labeling requirements;


• | FDA prohibitions against the promotion of off-label uses or indications;


• | adverse event and malfunction reporting;


• | post-approval restrictions or conditions, potentially including post-approval clinical trials or other required testing;


• | post-market surveillance requirements;


• | the FDA’s recall authority, whereby it can require or ask for the recall of products from the market; and


• | voluntary corrections or removals reporting and documentation.

In September 2013, the FDA issued final regulations and draft guidance documents regarding the Unique Device Identification (“UDI”) System, which requires manufacturers to mark certain medical devices with unique identifiers. While the FDA expects that the UDI System will help track products during recalls and improve patient safety, it will require us to make changes to our manufacturing and labeling, which could increase our costs.  The UDI System is being implemented in stages based on device risk, with the first requirements having taken effect in September 2014 and the last taking effect in September 2018.
Certain of our medical devices are sold in convenience kits that include a drug component, such as lidocaine. These types of kits are generally regulated as combination products within the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (or "CDRH") under the device regulations because the device provides the primary mode of action of the kit. Although the kit as a whole is regulated as a medical device, it may be subject to certain drug requirements such as current good manufacturing practices (“cGMPs”) to the extent applicable to the drug-component repackaging activities and subject to inspection to verify compliance with cGMPs as well as other regulatory requirements.
Our manufacturing facilities, as well as those of certain of our suppliers, are subject to periodic and for-cause inspections to verify compliance with the QSR as well as other regulatory requirements. If the FDA were to find that we or certain of our suppliers have failed to comply with applicable regulations, it could institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from issuance of a warning or untitled letter to more severe sanctions, such as product recalls or seizures, civil penalties, consent decrees, injunctions, criminal prosecution, operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production, refusal to permit importation or exportation, refusal to grant, or delays in granting, clearances or approvals or withdrawal or suspension of existing clearances or approvals. The FDA also has the authority to request repair, replacement or refund of the cost of any medical device manufactured or distributed by us.  Any of these actions could have an adverse effect on our business.
Regulation of Medical Devices Outside of the United States
Medical device laws also are in effect in many of the markets outside of the United States in which we do business. These laws range from comprehensive device approval requirements for some or all of our products to requests for product data or certifications. Inspection of and controls over manufacturing, as well as monitoring of device-related adverse events, are components of most of these regulatory systems.
Healthcare Laws
We are subject to various federal, state and local laws in the United States targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry.  These laws prohibit us from, among other things, soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any 
11

remuneration to induce the referral or use of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally or state financed healthcare programs.  Violations of these laws are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.  In addition, we are subject to federal and state false claims laws in the United States that prohibit the submission of false payment claims under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally or state funded programs.  Certain marketing practices, such as off-label promotion, and violations of federal anti-kickback laws may also constitute violations of these laws.
We are also subject to various federal and state reporting and disclosure requirements related to the healthcare industry.  Recent rules issued by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ("CMS") require us to collect and report information on payments or transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. The reported data is available to the public on the CMS website. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties.  In addition, several states now require medical device companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of device products and to report gifts and payments to individual physicians in these states.  Other states prohibit various other marketing-related activities.  The federal government and certain other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with the different compliance and/or reporting requirements among a number of jurisdictions increases the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements, resulting in increased compliance costs that could adversely impact our results of operations.
Other Regulatory Requirements
We are also subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws applicable in jurisdictions outside the United State that generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from improperly offering or paying anything of value to non-United States government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Because of the predominance of government-sponsored healthcare systems around the world, most of our customer relationships outside of the United States are with government entities and are therefore subject to such anti-bribery laws. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced government corruption to some degree, and in certain circumstances strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. In the sale, delivery and servicing of our medical devices and software outside of the United States, we must also comply with various export control and trade embargo laws and regulations, including those administered by the Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) and the Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”) which may require licenses or other authorizations for transactions relating to certain countries and/or with certain individuals identified by the United States government. Despite our global trade and compliance program, our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees, distributors or other agents. Violations of these requirements are punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including substantial fines and imprisonment.
COMPETITION
The medical device industry is highly competitive. We compete with many companies, ranging from small start-up enterprises to companies that are larger and more established than us and have access to significantly greater financial resources. Furthermore, extensive product research and development and rapid technological advances characterize the market in which we compete. We must continue to develop and acquire new products and technologies for our businesses to remain competitive. We believe that we compete primarily on the basis of clinical superiority and innovative features that enhance patient benefit, product reliability, performance, customer and sales support, and cost-effectiveness. Our major competitors include C. R. Bard, Inc., Medtronic plc and Becton, Dickinson and Company.
SALES AND MARKETING
Our product sales are made directly to hospitals, healthcare providers, distributors and to original equipment manufacturers of medical devices through our own sales forces, independent representatives and independent distributor networks.
BACKLOG
Most of our products are sold to hospitals or healthcare providers on orders calling for delivery within a few days or weeks, with longer order times for products sold to medical device manufacturers. Therefore, our backlog of orders is not indicative of revenues to be anticipated in any future 12-month period.
12

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS
We own a portfolio of patents, patents pending and trademarks. We also license various patents and trademarks. Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. Trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the marks. All product names throughout this document are trademarks owned by, or licensed to, us or our subsidiaries. Although these have been of value and are expected to continue to be of value in the future, we do not consider any single patent or trademark, except for the Teleflex and Arrow brands, to be essential to the operation of our business.
SUPPLIERS AND MATERIALS
Materials used in the manufacture of our products are purchased from a large number of suppliers in diverse geographic locations. We are not dependent on any single supplier for a substantial amount of the materials used or components supplied for our overall operations. Most of the materials and components we use are available from multiple sources, and where practical, we attempt to identify alternative suppliers. Volatility in commodity markets, particularly aluminum, steel and plastic resins, can have a significant impact on the cost of producing certain of our products. We may not be able to successfully pass cost increases through to all of our customers, particularly original equipment manufacturers.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
We are engaged in both internal and external research and development. Our research and development costs principally relate to our efforts to bring innovative new products to the markets we serve, and our efforts to enhance the clinical value, ease of use, safety and reliability of our existing product lines. Our research and development efforts support our strategic objectives to provide safe and effective products that reduce infections, improve patient and clinician safety, enhance patient outcomes and enable less invasive procedures. Our research and development expenditures were $58.6 million, $52.1 million and $61.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
We also acquire or license products and technologies that are consistent with our strategic objectives and enhance our ability to provide a full range of product and service options to our customers.
SEASONALITY
Portions of our revenues are subject to seasonal fluctuations. Incidence of flu and other disease patterns as well as the frequency of elective medical procedures affect revenues related to single-use products.  Historically, we have experienced higher sales in the fourth quarter as a result of these factors.
EMPLOYEES
We employed approximately 12,600 full-time and temporary employees at December 31, 2016. Of these employees, approximately 2,900 were employed in the United States and 9,700 in countries other than the United States. Approximately 12% of our employees in the United States and in other countries were covered by union contracts or collective-bargaining arrangements. We believe we have good relationships with our employees.
ENVIRONMENTAL
We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations both within and outside the United States. Our operations, like those of other medical device companies, involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws, primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes. While we continue to make capital and operational expenditures relating to compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations, we cannot ensure that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection, health and safety laws and regulations will not exceed our estimates or will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, we cannot ensure that we will not be subject to environmental claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past, present or future business activities.
