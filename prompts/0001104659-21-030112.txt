Item 1. Business
Overview
We are redefining the temperature-controlled supply chain for the life sciences industry by providing a unique and evolving platform of critical products and solutions including advanced packaging, informatics, specialty logistics services, biostorage services, and cryogenic life sciences equipment. With over 625 employees spread across 30 locations worldwide, we are engaged in providing global solutions to the biopharma/pharma, animal health, and human reproductive medicne markets. Our primary focus is on addressing the critical temperature-controlled supply chain needs within the biopharmaceutical space with an emphasis on serving the rapidly growing cell and gene therapy, or C&GT, market.
Our Strategy
We are focused on establishing best-in-class, comprehensive temperature-controlled supply chain solutions that support the expanding global landscape of the life sciences industry. We believe our growth strategy aligns with the growth of the markets we serve and our customers within them. In particular, we have identified the C&GT market as a high growth market, with unmet supply chain needs that we believe can benefit significantly from our solutions. The global C&GT market was valued at approximately $4.2 billion in 2019 and is projected to grow to over $33.1 billion by 2024.
Over the last several years, we have grown to become a leader in supporting C&GT clinical trials globally. As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2020, we supported 528 clinical trials and five commercial therapies, including KYMRIAH by Novartis and YESCARTA by Gilead/Kite. In addition, seven additional Cryoport supported therapies filed for commercial approval with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, or the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2020. Based on publicly disclosed information, industry data, and internal forecasts, we estimate that up to 21 additional Cryoport supported C&GTs, currently in clinical trials, may file for regulatory approval during the course of 2021. Commercial approvals of these therapies provide an opportunity to become significant revenue drivers for us in the future as each of them requires comprehensive temperature-controlled supply chain support and services at commercial scale, and we expect that many will select us as their critical supply chain solution as a result of our work in connection with their respective clinical trials.
We intend to build on our recent history of developing market-leading, temperature-controlled supply chain solutions and delivering strong growth through the following strategies:

Our Solutions
We use our competencies and capabilities to develop comprehensive and reliable, technology-centric solutions that address the specific needs of our customers. Our platform of temperature-controlled supply chain solutions, products and service includes cold-chain and cryogenic life sciences equipment, advanced packaging, informatics, specialty logistics services, biostorage services, kitting, labeling, fulfillment and consulting. These solutions, products and services are utilized for temperature-controlled supply chain services in the life sciences industry for personalized medicine, cell therapies, stem cells, cell lines, vaccines, diagnostic materials, semen, eggs, embryos, cord blood, bio-pharmaceuticals, infectious substances, and other commodities that require continuous exposure to certain and specific ranges of precision-controlled temperatures and environments.
Our Cryoport solutions are comprised primarily of a sophisticated, cloud-based, logistics management platform, which is branded as the Cryoportal Logistics Management Platform®, or the Cryoportal, Cryoport Express® Shippers and the SmartPak Condition Monitoring System®, or the SmartPak®. The Cryoportal® supports the management of shipments through a single interface, which includes order entry, document preparation, customs documentation, courier management, near real-time shipment tracking and monitoring, issue resolution, and regulatory compliance requirements. In addition, it provides unique and incisive information dashboards and validation documentation for every shipment through data collected by the SmartPak®. The Cryoportal® can record and retain a fully documented history of all Cryoport Express® Shippers, including chain-of-custody, chain-of-condition, chain-of-identity, and Chain of Compliance® information for each shipment, which is used to ensure that the stability of shipped biologic commodities are maintained throughout the shipping cycle. At the client’s option, recorded information is archived, allowing the client to meet exacting requirements necessary for scientific work and/or proof of regulatory compliance during the logistics process.
During 2018 we introduced our Chain of Compliance® solution, as a new industry standard within the C&GT market. Our Chain of Compliance® goes beyond chain of condition, chain of custody and chain of identity by providing traceability of the equipment, equipment components and processes supporting each client or patient therapy. The Chain of Compliance enables us to recall any single or every transport that an individual Cryoport Express Shipper has taken, the client(s) it supported, the commodity transported, its performance during transit, and each step that we perform before the shipper is put back into service. This includes Cryoport Express Shipper performance and requalification history, commodity history, courier handling and performance history, calibration history, and correlation competencies that can link in field events to equipment performance. Many of these standards have now been incorporated in the recently released ISO-21973 standard and we believe they are likely to become regulatory requirements in the near future.

In September of 2019, the Cryoport Express Advanced Therapy Shipper™ was launched to address specific needs of biopharma companies developing and commercializing C&GTs. The Cryoport Express Advanced Therapy Shippers provide verification processes to ensure that it has only been used for human-based therapies and materials and employ advanced validated cleaning methods to minimize the risk of cross-contamination of equipment and materials during use, delivery, and distribution of biopharmaceutical materials.
We further extended our solutions, capabilities, and global logistics network through the following recent acquisitions:
In October 2020, we further expanded our capabilities by acquiring CRYOPDP, a leading global provider of innovative temperature-controlled logistics solutions for high value, time critical and temperature-sensitive pharmaceuticals. CRYOPDP covers a significant portion of the healthcare temperature-controlled supply chain including packaging, pick-pack kit preparation, premium services and specialty biopharma/pharma courier support. This acquisition increased our global presence to a network of 27 global supply chain centers in 13 countries. This expanded network gives us a new advantage when serving global multi-national customers and also provides redundancies and backup that reduce supply chain risk for our customers. CRYOPDP has also developed a cloud-based logistics platform branded as UnITy™, which we plan to integrate with our Cryoportal Logistics Management Platform. UnITy™, provides functionalities such as a Transport Management System, Warehousing Management System, Quality Management System, a Customer Experience portal, mobile apps for track and trace during transport and storage as well as integration with transportation agents and business partners.
Also in October 2020, we made a second acquisition, acquiring MVE Biological Solutions from Chart Industries, Inc. MVE Biological Solutions, or MVE, provides cryobiological storage and transportation solutions for the life sciences industry through its advanced line of cryogenic stainless-steel freezers, aluminum dewars and related ancillary equipment used in the storage and transport of life sciences commodities, which includes the rapidly growing C&GT business. With three primary facilities, located in Ball Ground, Georgia, New Prague, Minnesota and Cheng-du, China, MVE Biological Solutions is a leader in serving the life sciences industry throughout the world. The acquisition is a vertical integration that, in addition to expanding our footprint to handle the growing demand driven by the growth in the C&GT market, helps to secure our supply of cryogenic shippers and biostorage equipment. MVE strengthens Cryoport’s presence in its Animal Health, Reproductive and Biopharma/Pharma markets. Its cryobiological storage and transport clients include cell and gene therapy, medical laboratories, biotech/pharmaceutical research facilities, blood and tissue banks, breeders, veterinary laboratories, large-scale bio-repositories, and fertility clinics. The addition of MVE Biological Solutions allows us to capture a greater share of the global spend on supply chain products and services that supports C&GT.
In May 2019, we expanded our capabilities by acquiring Cryogene Partners, a Texas general partnership doing business as Cryogene Labs, or Cryogene. Cryogene is an expanding state-of-the-art temperature-controlled biostorage solutions business strategically located in Houston, Texas. Cryogene is an industry leader in the management of pre-clinical services which include critical biological commodities to support clinical research, the advancement of C&GTs, GMP biologics, and public health research. It provides customized, end-to-end chain of custody/chain of condition solutions for its clients.
As demonstrated by our organic growth and acquisitions, we are continually focused on establishing comprehensive temperature-controlled supply chain solutions to support the rapidly expanding global landscape of the life sciences industry.
The Markets We Serve
Biopharma/Pharma. In the biopharma/pharma market we are focused on supporting the saving of lives. From clinical research and development to clinical research organizations to clinical trials for C&GTs to the storage and delivery of life-saving C&GTs to the customers of biopharmaceutical and biotechnology organizations to crucial points of care, we strive to address fundamental-to-advanced temperature-controlled storage, transport, packaging, fulfillment, and information challenges. In particular, C&GTs have become a rapidly growing area of biological drug development, with over 1,000 global clinical trials underway in 2020. This therapeutic approach has certain supply chain challenges that we believe our solutions are tailored to address.
Animal Health. In the animal health market we provide support for animal reproduction, which primarily involves the production of protein for sustaining life. We also support the health of recreational and companion animals. Animal disease prevention and control rely on the safe transport and storage of vaccines and other biological materials around the world. Our temperature-controlled supply chain solutions are designed to help avoid costly delays through nonstop monitoring and complete fleet management from and to the origin and destination points as well as provide cryobiological storage equipment.

Human Reproductive Medicine. In the human reproductive medicine market we are focused on the support of the creation of human life by supporting In Vitro Fertilization, or IVF, and related technologies along with clinical networks globally. Through our CryoStork services, we transport reproductive materials through dedicated medical transport services to help ensure that IVF materials are on the next flight out to their destination. IVF materials also receive one-on-one handling and individualized attention during the entire logistics process. In addition, we also provide cryobiological storage equipment to fertility clinics around the world.
Acquisitions
On October 1, 2020, we completed our acquisition of CRYOPDP for a cash consideration of €49 million, subject to cash, net debt, working capital and other adjustments. CRYOPDP, based in France, is a leading global provider of innovative temperature-controlled logistics solutions to the clinical research, pharmaceutical and cell and gene therapy markets. CRYOPDP conducts its business activities mainly through entities based in the United Kingdom, the United States, the Asia-Pacific region, and India.
Also, on October 1, 2020, we completed our acquisition of MVE Biological Solutions for cash consideration of $320 million, subject to customary closing working capital and other adjustments. We financed a portion of the closing cash payment of the MVE Biological Solutions acquisition with the net proceeds of the Blackstone Private Placement, as further discussed below. MVE Biological Solutions is a global leader in manufactured vacuum insulated products and cryogenic freezer systems for the life sciences industry. MVE Biological Solutions has manufacturing and distribution operations in the United States, Europe, and Asia.
As a result of the acquisitions, we have approximately 625 employees: 605 full-time, 10 part-time, and 10 temporary, of which 250 are located in the Americas, 158 in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, or EMEA, and 217 in Asia Pacific, or APAC. We believe that we have assembled a strong management/leadership team with the experience and expertise needed to execute our business strategy. We anticipate hiring additional personnel as needs dictate to implement our global growth strategy.
After the acquisitions, we lease or own various corporate, research and development, biostorage, global logistics and supply chain centers at 27 total sites across the Americas, EMEA and APAC regions.
Blackstone Private Placement
In connection with the MVE Biological Solutions acquisition, on October 1, 2020, we completed a private placement with an investment vehicle of funds affiliated with The Blackstone Group Inc., consisting of the issuance and sale of (i) 250,000 shares of a newly designated 4.0% Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share, or the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, at a price of $1,000 per share, for $250 million, and (ii) 675,536 shares of our common stock for $25.0 million, for an aggregate purchase price of $275.0 million, pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement, dated August 24, 2020, between us and Blackstone Freeze Parent L.P. (f/k/a BTO Freeze Parent L.P.). On February 5, 2021, the Company received a waiver and conversion notice from Blackstone Freeze Parent L.P. and Blackstone Tactical Opportunities Fund – FD L.P. and converted an aggregate of 50,000 shares of the Company’s 4.0% Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, resulting in the issuance of an aggregate of 1,312,860 shares of Common Stock (See Note 18 “Subsequent Events” in our accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information).
January 2021 Public Offering
On January 25, 2021, the Company completed an underwritten public offering (the “Offering”) of 4,356,059 shares of its common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Shares”). The Shares were issued and sold pursuant to an underwriting agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”), dated January 20, 2021, by and among the Company, on the one hand, and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Jefferies LLC, SVB Leerink LLC and UBS Securities LLC, as representatives of certain underwriters (collectively, the “Underwriters”) at a public offering price per share of $66.00, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions. The Shares include 568,181 shares issued and sold pursuant to the Underwriters’ exercise in full of their option to purchase additional shares of common stock pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement. The Company received net proceeds of approximately $269.7 million from the Offering after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company.

Change in Segment Reporting
The Company continually monitors and reviews its segment reporting structure in accordance with authoritative guidance to determine whether any changes have occurred that would impact its reportable operating segments. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing operating performance. The chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) is our Chief Executive Officer. Up until the fourth quarter of 2020, we managed, reported and evaluated our business in the following two reportable operating segments: Global Logistics Solutions and Global Bioservices. During the fourth quarter of 2020, our CODM changed how he makes operating decisions, assesses the performance of the business and allocates resources in a manner that caused our operating segments to change as a result of the MVE and CRYOPDP acquisitions. In consideration of Financial Accounting Standards Board's ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC"), Segment Reporting, we determined that we are not organized around specific products and services, geographic regions or regulatory environments. Accordingly, beginning with the fourth quarter of 2020 we realigned our reporting structure, resulting in a single reportable segment. The Company has adjusted its financial statements for historical periods to reflect this change in segment reporting and show its financial results without segments for all periods presented. See Part II, Item 7 – Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.
Government Regulation
Globally, we are subject to numerous domestic federal, state and local laws and regulations and the laws and regulations of global jurisdictions relating to matters regarding shipments, customs, import, export, safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. In addition, we have to ensure compliance with economic sanctions and/or restrictions on individuals, corporations or countries, and other government regulations affecting trade that may apply to our international cross border business activities. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future.
The shipping of biologic products, biologic commodities, diagnostic specimens, infectious substances and dangerous goods, whether via air or ground, falls under the jurisdiction of many state, federal and international agencies. The quality of the packaging that protects a product or biologic commodity is critical in determining whether it will arrive at its destination in a satisfactory condition. Currently the most stringent regulations we are subject to are the dangerous goods regulations. Many of the regulations for transporting dangerous goods in the United States are determined by international rules formulated under the auspices of the United Nations. Dangerous goods are usually one-time shipments and are not a part of our standard service. When we ship dangerous goods, we follow strict and stringent guidelines.
International Civic Aviation Organization ("ICAO") is the United Nations organization that develops regulations (Technical Instructions) for the safe transport of dangerous goods by air. If shipment is by air, compliance with the rules established by the International Air Transport Association ("IATA") is required. IATA is a trade association made up of airlines and air cargo couriers that publishes annual editions of the IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations. These regulations interpret and add to the ICAO Technical Instructions to reflect industry practices. Additionally, the Centers for Disease Control (“CDC”) has regulations (published in the Code of Federal Regulations) for interstate shipping of specimens.
Our Cryoport Express® Shippers meet Packing Instructions 602 and 650 and are certified for the shipment of Class 6.2 Dangerous Goods per the requirements of the ICAO Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by Air and IATA. Our present and planned future versions of the Cryoport SmartPak™ Condition Monitoring Systems will likely be subject to regulation by the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”), Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”), Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), IATA and possibly other agencies which may be difficult to determine on a global basis. Additionally, our Chain of Compliance™ processes comply fully with ISO 21973 recommendations.
Our MVE Biological Solutions cryogenic stainless-steel freezers and aluminum dewars are certified to the Medical Device Directive (MDD) in the European Union. Additionally, registrations for import are in place for various countries with these requirements.

Storage of biological materials that are classified as drug products for human therapeutic use (either for investigational use or commercially approved) or materials used in the manufacture of drug products for human therapeutic use, is regulated by the FDA under Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (“CFR”) part 210 & 211. Facilities must be compliant with current Good Manufacturing Practice (“GMP”) regulations which are enforced by the FDA through registration and audit. If the drug product is exported to other countries, then the storage needs to comply with the relevant local regulations.
For additional information, see "Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors-Risks Related to Regulatory and Legal Matters" in this Form 10-K.
Manufacturing and Raw Materials
Manufacturing. We source components for our products from multiple suppliers that manufacture to our engineering specifications using in part proprietary technology and know-how to mitigate supply chain risks. We also use “off-the-shelf” products, which we may modify to meet our requirements. Through the acquisition of MVE, we are able to vertically integrate and secure Cryoport’s supply of cryogenic shippers and storage equipment. For some components, there are relatively few alternate sources of supply and the establishment of additional or replacement suppliers may or may not be accomplished immediately. Should this occur, we endeavor to mitigate risk by an increase in our inventory level to cover our total forecasted demand giving us time to secure additional qualified suppliers. The central electronic devices currently used in our SmartPak Condition Monitoring Systems have been acquired from a single source with calibration and alterations done by an independent third party.
Our vendor/partner relationships allow us to concentrate on further advancing and expanding our platform of solutions for the life sciences to meet the growing and varied demands for validated temperature-controlled solutions in the life sciences industry. We believe our current supply structure provides us the opportunity to rapidly scale to support our client’s commercialization activities; however, we continue to work to improve our current sourcing and to continue to mitigate risks therein.
Raw Materials. Various common raw materials are used in the manufacture of our shippers and in the development of our technologies. These raw materials are generally available from several alternate distributors and manufacturers. We have not experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining these raw materials.
Patents, Copyrights, Trademarks and Proprietary Rights
In order to remain competitive, we must develop and maintain protection on the proprietary aspects of our platform of technologies. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property rights.
We file patent applications to protect innovations arising from our research, development and design. We currently own approximately 28 issued patents and are pursuing approximately 56 pending patent applications throughout the world. Our patents generally protect certain aspects of our products related technology. We also own certain copyrights relating to certain aspects of our products and services. We currently own approximately 116 registered U.S. trademarks and approximately 57 additional trademark applications are pending in the U.S. and foreign countries. Many of our trademark rights in foreign countries are filed under the Madrid Protocol and designate China, Japan, Australia, Singapore, or the European Union. Our trademarks generally protect the names of our company, products, and key service brands. 
Our success is influenced, in part, by our ability to continue to develop proprietary products and technologies. It is desirable to obtain patent coverage for these products and technologies; however, some are protected as trade secrets. We intend to file trademark and patent applications covering any newly developed products, methods and technologies. However, there can be no guarantee that any of our pending or future filed applications will be issued as patents or registered as trademarks. There can be no guarantee that the various patent and trademark governmental agencies from around the world or some third party will not initiate an interference proceeding involving any of our pending applications or issued patents. Finally, there can be no guarantee that our issued patents or future issued patents, if any, will provide adequate protection from competition.

9



Patents provide some degree of protection for our proprietary technology. However, the pursuit and assertion of patent rights involve complex legal and factual determinations and, therefore, are characterized by significant uncertainty. In addition, the laws governing patent issuance and the scope of patent coverage continue to evolve. Moreover, the patent rights we possess or are pursuing generally cover our technologies to varying degrees. As a result, we cannot ensure that patents will issue from any of our patent applications, or that any of the issued patents will offer meaningful protection. In addition, our issued patents may be successfully challenged, invalidated, circumvented or rendered unenforceable so that our patent rights may not create an effective barrier to competition. We must also pay maintenance fees at set intervals for our patents to not expire prematurely. The laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. There can be no assurance that any patents issued to us will provide a legal basis for establishing an exclusive market for our products or provide us with any competitive advantages, or that patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to do business or to continue to use our technologies freely. As with all patents, we may be subject to third parties filing claims that our technologies or products infringe on their intellectual property. We cannot predict whether third parties will assert such claims against us or whether those claims will hurt our business. If we are forced to defend against such claims, regardless of their merit, we may face costly litigation and diversion of management’s attention and resources. As a result of any such disputes, we may have to develop, at a substantial cost, non-infringing technology or enter into licensing agreements. These agreements may be unavailable on terms acceptable to such third parties, or at all, which could seriously harm our business or financial condition.
With respect to our trademarks, we file and pursue trademark registrations on words, symbols, logos, and other source identifiers that consumers use to associate our products and services with us. Although our registered trademarks carry a presumption of validity, they can be challenged and invalidated and as such, we cannot guarantee that any trademark registration is infallible.
We also rely on trade secret protection of our intellectual property. We attempt to protect trade secrets by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants and third parties, although, in the past, we have not always obtained such agreements. It is possible that these agreements may be breached, invalidated or rendered unenforceable, and if so, our trade secrets could be disclosed to our competitors. Despite the measures we have taken to protect our intellectual property, parties to such agreements may breach confidentiality provisions in our contracts or infringe or misappropriate our patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other proprietary rights. In addition, third parties may independently discover or invent competitive technologies, or reverse engineer our trade secrets or other technology. Therefore, the measures we are taking to protect our proprietary technology may not be adequate.
Customers and Distribution
As a result of growing globalization, including in such areas as biologics, biopharma, biotechnology, clinical trials, distribution of biopharmaceutical products and reproductive medicine, the requirement for effective and reliable solutions for keeping clinical samples, pharmaceutical products and other specimen at controlled temperatures takes on added significance due to more sophisticated supply chain challenges including complex shipping routes, extended shipping times, potential custom delays, general logistics challenges, distribution and storage requirements. We believe that our platform of solutions, expertise and geographic footprint enable us to take advantage of the growing demand for effective and efficient international transport and storage of temperature sensitive life sciences commodities/products. This is especially the case for the new therapies being developed in the regenerative medicine market, such as CAR-T cell therapies, that require cryogenic temperatures to maintain safety and efficacy.
No customers accounted for over 10% of our total revenues during the year ended December 21, 2020.Two customers accounted for 24.1% and 12.8% of our total revenues during the year ended December 31, 2019. No other single customers accounted for over 10% of our total revenues during the year ended December 31, 2019.

Customer types
Clinical Trials - Every pharmaceutical or biotech company developing a new drug or therapy must seek development protocol approval by regulatory bodies like the FDA. These clinical trials are designed to test the safety and efficacy of the potential new drug/therapy among other things. In connection with the clinical trials, due to globalization, companies can enroll patients from all over the world and may need to regularly submit a blood or other specimen at the local hospital, doctor’s offices or laboratories. These samples are then sent to specified testing laboratories, which may be local or in another country. In addition, the therapies used by the patients may require biostorage and time critical and/or temperature-controlled shipping to the sites of the clinical trials. Importantly, clinical trial specimens are often irreplaceable because each one represents clinical data at a prescribed point in time, in a series of specimens on a given patient, who may be participating in a trial for years. Sample integrity during the shipping process is vital to retaining the maximum number of patients in each trial and keeping the trial on schedule This can also include the return and destruction of Investigational Medicinal Products. Clinical trial support involves a full ecosystem of Clinical Research Organizations and requires very flexible and highly qualified logistics and end-to-end supply chain solutions. Our global network of temperature-controlled supply chain solutions are ideally suited for this market. Furthermore, the IATA requires that all airborne shipments of laboratory specimens be transmitted in either IATA Instruction 650 or 602 certified packaging. We have developed and obtained IATA certification of our Cryoport Express® platform.
Biotechnology and Diagnostic Companies - The biotechnology market includes basic and applied research and development in diverse areas such as stem cells, gene therapy, DNA tumor vaccines, tissue engineering, genomics, and blood products. Companies participating in the foregoing fields rely on the frozen storage and temperature-controlled transport of specimens in connection with their research and development efforts, for which our suite of supply chain solutions are ideally suited.
Cell Therapy Companies - Rapid advancements are underway in the research and development of cell-based therapies, which involve cellular material being infused into a patient. In allogeneic cell therapies, the donor is a different person than the recipient of the cells. Autologous cell therapy is a personalized therapeutic intervention that uses an individual’s cells, which are cultured and expanded outside the body, and reintroduced into the individual. Once cells are manufactured into a cellular therapy, in either case, they must be stored and shipped cryogenically for which our Cryoport Express® Shipper solutions and MVE’s stainless steel cryogenic freezers are ideally suited.
Contract Research, Development & Manufacturing Companies - Increasingly, as evidenced by our strategic partnership with Lonza, CROs and Contract Development and Manufacturing Organizations ("CDMOs) are engaging our services exclusively in conjunction with their contract services platform in order to provide a higher level of service to our mutual client base. We anticipate that these relationships, which are mutually beneficial to both parties as well as our client base will accelerate and expand to include our entire portfolio of services in the coming months and years.
Central Laboratories - With the increase and globalization of clinical studies and trials, logistics has become more complex and ensuring sample integrity has become more challenging. International courier costs are now consuming a significant portion of global protocol budgets. We believe laboratories performing the testing of samples collected during the conduct of these global multi-site studies are looking for reliable state-of-the-art supply chain solutions. CRYOPDP’s global network of logistic centers have successfully supported central labs throughout the world.
Pharmaceutical or Therapy Distribution - The current focus for our products and solutions also includes the area of bio-pharmaceutical supply chain. There are a significant number of therapeutic therapies currently or anticipated soon to be undergoing clinical trials. After the FDA or regional or national authorities in EMEA or APAC approve them for commercial marketing, it will be necessary for the manufacturers to have a reliable and economical method of bio-storage and distribution to the physician who will administer the product to the patient. It is likely that the most efficient and reliable method of distribution will be to ship a single dosage to the administering physician. These therapies are typically identified to individual patients and therefore will require a complete tracking history from the manufacturer to the patient. The most reliable method of doing this is to ship a unit dosage specifically for each patient. If such therapies require temperature-controlled logistics, we can provide the technology to meet this need. This supply chain management also includes the support of Managed Access Programs, whereby patients with serious diseases sometimes require specific therapies that are not yet available and/or approved by local regulatory authorities. We have the experience in providing these specialty therapies into over 150 countries.

Fertility Clinics and In Vitro Fertilization (“IVF”). Maintaining cryogenic temperatures during shipping and transfer of in vitro fertilization specimens like eggs, sperm, or embryos is critical for cell integrity in order to retain viability, stabilize the cells, and ensure reproducible results and successful IVF treatment. We believe that Cryoport Systems solutions for this market, branded as CryoStork® services, are very compelling and well received. Additionally, MVE supplies stainless steel cryogenic freezers to fertility clinics that wish to store reproductive materials on site. The global IVF services revenue market generated $12.5 billion in 2018 and is projected to reach $26.4 billion by 2026, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.8% from 2019 to 2026. The Assisted Reproductive Technology (“ART”) industry is also starting to undergo a significant change due to the consolidation of clinic networks into large corporations or venture backed organizations, which we believe will allow us to further build out our leadership position and set industry standards.
Animal Health Companies. The global animal health market size is expected to reach $73.6 billion by 2027, representing a CAGR of 5.8% from 2016 through 2027. The market is largely driven by a significant rise in the zoonotic and food-borne diseases globally. This unprecedented disease prevalence has encouraged companies to produce advanced vaccines and pharmaceuticals. The high demand has also resulted in the subsequent rise in the number of companies making consistent efforts to control risks of pathogen contamination and food-borne diseases, which is contributing to market growth. In addition to food animal production, companion animal support is another emerging area in which companies are investing heavily. This can be attributed to the fact that in the U.S. alone, 68 percent of households now include a pet, up from 58 percent in 1988, with total U.S. pet industry expenditures projected to rise. Globally, 62% of animal health revenue is driven by food animals and 38% companion animals. Cryoport’s temperature-controlled supply chain solutions are well positioned to support storage and distribution needs of veterinary laboratories, large-scale repositories, and artificial insemination, particularly in the beef and dairy industry on a global basis.

Industry and Competition
Our products and services are sold into a rapidly growing segment of the temperature-controlled supply chain industry focused on the temperature sensitive packaging, shipping and storing of cell therapies, biopharmaceuticals and other life sciences commodities. This growth is fueled in part by the advancements in biology and its continued commercial globalization. The pace of growth is expected to increase even more in the future as domestic and international biotechnology firms expand their clinical trials and introduce new products into the market that require continuous transportation and storage at rigorously controlled temperatures. This principle also applies to the animal health and human reproductive medicine markets. We believe these advances will require a greater dependence on passively controlled temperature transport systems (i.e., systems having no external power source). In addition, we expect that industry standards and regulations will be introduced globally, requiring more comprehensive tracking and validation of shipping temperatures.

With a strong foundation in ISO 9001:2015, we leverage our industry-specific experience, along with applicable regulatory requirements, to create processes and procedures that incorporate instructions with strong operational practices of checks with verification. This Quality Management System ensures proper controls from customer education, through the initial contract, processing, shipping and storage, accumulation and communication of proper monitoring and data collection, culminating in the successful completion of each transaction or shipment. 

14



The Cryoport Quality Management System incorporates notable good practice quality guidelines and regulations (GxP) elements, beyond those stipulated in ISO 9001:2015, to ensure the customer base is supported in the manner necessary to maintain standards and to secure a positive compliance profile as a supplier. Notable elements include, but are not limited to, Good Documentation Practices, Archival processes and procedures, Supplier Controls (and approval), and Corrective Action and Preventive Action (CAPA) procedures, to highlight a few examples.
Via procedural requirements, Cryoport provides substantial risk-mitigation strategies throughout the full product line of services provided, routinely supporting and maintaining customer confidence. Metrics are accumulated and on a routine basis are reported to the senior management ensuring appropriate decisions are made regarding resource allocation, corrective actions are taken, and that quality-driven initiatives are supported throughout the organization.
Our manufacturing operations are ISO 13485 qualified medical manufacturing facilities and are audited on a regular basis by authorized authorities for compliance.
Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) Program
The launch of our ESG program marks our first disclosure of ESG information based on the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which are leading global sustainability frameworks. As a company focused on delivering lifesaving therapies by providing reliable and comprehensive temperature-controlled supply chain solutions for the life sciences industry, sustainability has always been integral to our work; however, in 2020 we began a formal evaluation of our ESG initiative and we have elevated sustainability to be one of our key priorities for guiding our operating philosophy and corporate governance as we move forward. The following information provides a snapshot of our commitment to and practice of good corporate and global citizenship and overall Sustainability and Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) performance. As we move forward, we are committed to continuing to grow our Sustainability and ESG programs through increased focus on substantive issues and transparency in our reporting.
Environmental
As Cryoport continues to grow its business in a way that is considerate of our global community, we are committed to protecting our planet by using our world’s resources sensibly and minimizing our emissions and waste on a global basis. From an environmental standpoint, one example of our sustainability efforts is our cryogenic Cryoport Express® Shipper, which uses the non-hazardous dry vapor form of liquid nitrogen and proprietary informatics to drive efficiencies in the use of resources throughout our company. This service offering also employs multi-use and recyclable packaging. Knowing that there is much more to do to aid in our environmental efforts, we have recently developed a system to collect data on a global scale for the purpose of quantifying the impact of all our environmental initiatives so that we may demonstrate our performance on this important matter to our shareholders, customers and other interested stakeholders.
Material Efficiency
Cryoport strives to operate in an efficient manner to ensure the optimization of raw materials, equipment, energy and labor. As an example of this in our manufacturing operations, Cryoport measures the effectiveness and efficiency of our production practices by tracking the amount of scrap material disposed of or sold on an annual basis. Comparing 2019 and 2020, Cryoport saw an improvement in scrap volumes of approximately 50%, with 414 scrap units generated in 2019 vs. 215 generated in 2020. Cryoport’s targeted goal for 2021 is to reduce this number by an additional 20%. 

15



Energy Efficiency of Products
Cryoport understands the importance of energy conservation as it relates to the reduction of its operational carbon footprint, efficient use of resource and cost management. The area that has the largest impact on energy efficiency associated with our products is thermal efficiency. One example is our Global Logistics Center Network which utilizes the International Safe Transit Association (ISTA) standard 7E to test and evaluate thermal performance against stated requirements of 10+ days of maintaining internal temperatures at or below negative 150oC. Our products comply with this standard, and in turn, the products insulative properties require less energy to maintain prescribed temperature levels. Another example is from our manufacturing operations: our dewars do not consume any electricity, and our freezer units utilize liquid nitrogen as a cooling agent, which is the by-product of other processes, creating a closed-loop resource that reduces additional energy associated with sourcing, procuring, and delivery of resources purchased from third parties. Our efforts in these areas have a positive environmental outcome for Cryoport and its customers. 
Materials of Concern
At Cryoport, we currently utilize minimal materials of concern in our operations, primarily in the form of isopropanol, epoxies, butyl cellosolve, lacquer thinner, paint, hyamine and isopropyl alcohol. We manage the minimal hazardous wastes generated in our production facilities in compliance with all state and federal regulations, and review opportunities to eliminate materials of concern and other managed waste streams on a regular cadence. As part of our strategy to reduce or eliminate materials of concern from our operations, in 2020 we began an initiative to discontinue the use of lacquer thinner as part of a larger paint line upgrade, which will significantly reduce the generation of hazardous waste throughout certain of our plants. Any hazardous waste that is generated is tracked and managed with an overall goal of eliminating hazardous materials where possible. 
Environmental Footprint
Cryoport makes efforts where possible to minimize the environmental impact of our operations. We strive for a product base with long use phases to minimize impact associated with production of new product. At our MVE Biological Solutions production facility, we manufacture fusion freezer units that utilize 1/587 of the energy used by conventional mechanical freezers used for similar applications. Our biostorage plant in Houston is powered exclusively by carbonless energy sources, translating to a significant reduction in carbon emissions compared to energy provided by coal-fired power plants. In 2020, the plant consumed 3,564,102 kWh of energy, which would have generated 3,487,702 pounds of greenhouse gas emissions if the plant was powered by traditional coal-fired power plants. This emissions savings is the equivalent of removing 544 passenger vehicles driven in one year. Recently, our Paris, France operations moved into a new facility, which is designed with the highest French environmental standards and equipped with solar panels to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.
Social 
Cryoport’s social efforts are focused on our global team of employees and communities. Our employees are our most valuable resource, from our teams on the front line in our global supply chain and logistics centers, to our manufacturing operations, to our business development personnel, to the engineers who design our products and services, to our quality assurance and regulatory teams that assure the safety, quality, compliance, and integrity of our products. Across our Company, we are committed to inclusion, equity and diverse representation in our employees. Cryoport’s Employee Health & Safety (EHS) programs have resulted in strong safety performance, as demonstrated by our total injury rate (TIR) and lost time injury rate (LTIR) being significantly lower than the global industry averages. Facilitated by our culture of continuous improvement, we are committed to continue to work toward reducing our TIR and LTIR numbers even further. Constructive supplier relationships are essential to our ability to meet customer requirements for quality solutions. We expect also our business partners to share our commitment to ethics, integrity, compliance, safety, human rights and environmental protection. By the same token, as a provider accountable to thousands of companies worldwide, we pledge, through our ESG performance, to meet or exceed our clients’ requirements for the same.

Diversity
Cryoport is an Equal Employment Opportunity employer and currently tracks gender distribution across its operations and management. We maintain clear policies related to anti-harassment, discrimination and retaliation, and provide and anonymous, third party-managed reporting hotline for employees to report incidents of harassment, discrimination, and policy violations. In 2021, Cryoport will enhance and roll out new online corporate training programs related to diversity, harassment and discrimination, so that all employees will receive, at minimum, annual training on the topics of harassment, diversity and inclusion, business ethics and code of conduct. In addition, Cryoport’s recruiting programs include targeted outreach to a variety of under-represented constituents, including minorities, women, veterans, and disabled populations to help improve recruiting efforts while gaining valuable insights from a diverse set of recruits. Cryoport has partnered with or targeted organizations like Hire Heroes, Career OneStop, recruiting at Historical Black Colleges, Accounting and Financial Women’s Alliance, and Women in Technology. 
Suppliers
Temperature controlled supply chain support to the life sciences industry is critical to all that Cryoport does; therefore, we currently take steps to conduct reviews and audit our existing and potential suppliers to ensure that appropriate compliance, health, safety, and labor practices are in place. Cryoport currently maintains a supplier questionnaire delivered prior to vendor approval and as part of a vendor auditing process to help verify that programs exist to manage specific risk areas. For example, we ask our transportation suppliers if they employ or work with a Dangerous Goods Safety Advisor, a credentialed role responsible for overseeing activities associated with dangerous goods, including but not limited to, employee training and coaching, reporting, and monitoring of activities associated with the transportation of dangerous goods. The purpose of this inquiry is to gauge the degree of oversight over dangerous goods management by our suppliers to help ensure product and employee welfare. 
Research and Development
We do not conduct clinical trials, animal testing or use human tissue of any kind in the manufacture or design of our products, and our Code of Conduct governs the ethical behavior of our employees across Cryoport operations. 
Data Security 
Cryoport uses an outside Center for Internet Security (CIS) assessment firm to evaluate its data security controls in an effort protect our business and secure the information of our employees and customers. The evaluation process utilizes the CIS Critical Security Controls Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) methodology, and is an ongoing initiative used to continuously improve the CMMI rating for the company.
Governance
Integrity is one of our four Core Values as an organization, and we commit to operating with honesty, truthfulness and transparency in accordance to the highest ethical and corporate governance standards – mutual respect, integrity and trust are our foundation. As an ethical operator, we have developed a strong Code of Conduct and hold ourselves accountable to it in all we do. All of our employees across our operations are provided with training and reference materials to reinforce this commitment to integrity and ethics in our business. Our policies are clearly defined and include guidance on topics including, but not limited to: Corruption; Anti-Trust and Anti-Competitive Behavior; Insider Dealings; Gifts; Conflicts of Interest; Intellectual Property; Truthful and accurate reporting; Interactions with Healthcare professionals and Whistleblower protections.
In addition to our Code of Conduct, our senior leadership team actively oversees the governance of our ethics programs to help ensure that commitment is driven from the top down, and that program owners are accountable for successful program compliance.

Cryoport Impact Statements
Examples of some of our positive environmental impacts include the following:

● | Our 2020 freezer production displaced annual energy consumption by 115,508,192 kWh from what would otherwise be consumed from alternative products. This amount of energy saved would power 10,847 homes (sized at 2,500 square feet) annually. This reduction in energy consumption from our freezer lines alone equates to 109,547,623 pounds of GHG emissions avoided or the emissions equivalent to 17,644 passenger vehicles driven for one year.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In another case, one of our facilities uses carbonless energy consumption, which prevented the emission of 3,487,702 pounds of GHGs in 2020. This use of carbonless energy prevented emissions equal to 544 passenger vehicles driven for one year. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Recently, our Paris, France operations moved into a new facility, which is designed with the highest French environmental standards and equipped with solar panels to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our temperature-controlled supply chain solutions focused on cell and gene therapies include logistics, which can boast a 99.8% delivery success rate and due to this performance 9,586 additional patients were able to receive therapies over the past 24 months and 690 intended parents are potentially able to have successful cycles resulting in the birth of a child on an annual basis because of our CryoStork® solution.

Impact of COVID-19
In late 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China, which has since spread globally. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. Further, the COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in government authorities around the world implementing numerous measures to try to reduce the impact of COVID-19, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place or total lock-down orders. Many countries around the world have also implemented the temporary closure of non-essential businesses and other material limitations on the conduct of business. As a provider of life saving therapies, Cryoport is deemed to be an essential business and has remained fully open and operational. However, the full extent and duration of this pandemic is still unknown at this point and the related governmental, business and travel restrictions in order to contain this virus are continuing to evolve globally. Accordingly, there is significant uncertainty related to the ultimate impact that this global pandemic will have on the results of our operations. 
For example, several life sciences companies, including some of our clients, announced earlier in 2020 the temporary suspension of clinical studies and trials as well as other COVID-19 related risks that may impact their preclinical and clinical trials, including delays in patient enrollment or difficulties in initiating or expanding clinical trials, interruption of clinical trial activity, and diversion of healthcare resources to focus on COVID-19 activities. While these temporary suspensions and restrictions have been lifted, these may be reinstated, and other measures may be implemented. In addition, with respect to the impact of the pandemic on the human reproductive medicine market, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) and European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) both issued recommendations in March of 2020 to temporarily defer fertility treatments and related activities. Both organizations have since updated and recently reaffirmed their recommendation to gradually and judiciously resume activities. While these actions have negatively impacted our revenue in the markets we serve temporarily during 2020, we cannot determine the longer-term impact at this point. A number of public announcements by government and clients indicate a regional or partially reinstating of COVID-19 related restrictions and while we have experienced revenue ramping back up gradually over time, this may be curtailed by new restrictions. Further, virus containment efforts as a result of governmental actions or policies or other initiatives could lead to further disruption in the supply chain and as a result, we may have difficulties sourcing raw materials and equipment or may incur additional direct costs to provide our solutions. 
While longer-term client demand for our services overall remains strong, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the measures above taken by some of our clients have adversely impacted our revenue growth. See Risk Factors, “The recent global pandemic caused by COVID-19 has and could adversely affect our business operations, financial performance and results of operations, the extent of which is uncertain and difficult to predict.”
