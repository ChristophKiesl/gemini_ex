Item 1.    Business
Overview 
We are a provider of secure, integrated, intelligent communication and clinical workflow solutions, focused on empowering mobile workers in healthcare, hospitality, retail, energy, education and other mission-critical mobile work environments in the United States and internationally. The significant majority of our business is generated from sales of our solutions in the healthcare market to help our customers enhance quality of care, safety, patient and staff experience, and improve operational efficiency. Care teams at over 2,300 healthcare facilities worldwide have selected our solutions to communicate with others, reduce alarm fatigue, improve staff safety, enhance workflow, and help improve patient experience. Our solutions can also be found in hotels, nuclear power facilities, schools, libraries, retail stores and other environments where mobile workers need to communicate and access resources instantly.
Our communication and collaboration solution enables users to connect instantly with other staff simply by saying the name, function or group name of the desired recipient. Our solution includes an intelligent enterprise software platform; lightweight, wearable, voice-controlled communication devices; as well as smartphone applications. It also delivers HIPAA-compliant secure text messages, alerts and alarms directly to the Vocera Badge, Vocera Smartbadge, smartphones and other mobile communication devices both inside and outside the hospital in order of priority, replacing legacy processes and technologies including pagers and in-building wireless and landline phones. 
At the core of this solution is a patent-protected, enterprise-class server software platform. Our software platform is built on a scalable architecture and recognizes more than 100 spoken commands. Users can instantly communicate with others using the Vocera Smartbadge or Vocera Badge, or through smartphone applications developed for iOS and Android mobile devices. Our platform lets users communicate and collaborate with each other using real time voice or HIPAA-compliant secure texting, and unlike other solutions, allows users to reach people by their role, room assignment, functional group or department, without needing to know a person’s name or phone number. The system can also broadcast emergency messages to a single department or to an entire organization. Our solution can be integrated with other clinical systems, including Electronic Health Records (EHR), nurse call, patient monitoring and even some medical devices, to provide critical data, alerts, alarms and clinical context that enables better workflow. Our enterprise-class software platform also features an advanced clinical rules engine that unifies data from multiple sources simultaneously, enables prioritization of notifications, adds patient context, and sends messages to the right care team members on their mobile devices. Our platform allows clinicians to be away from the bedside while staying informed about their patients. Our portfolio of over 150 unique integrations enhances clinical workflow by enabling the interoperability of our solution with a significant number of clinical and operational systems used in hospitals today.
Beyond healthcare, our solutions are used to quickly and contextually connect staff in other mission-critical mobile-worker environments. In the hospitality industry, it is used to enhance guest experience, as well as staff safety, productivity, and responsiveness. In the nuclear power industry, our solutions are used to instantly connect people and resources. In education,

schools use our solutions to increase security, safety and staff communication and libraries use our solutions to enable their staff to be more mobile and attentive to patrons. And, in retail, our solutions are used to enhance the customer experience by enabling store personnel to quickly connect in and across various locations. 
Over our 22-year history, we have significantly enhanced and added features and functionality to these solutions through ongoing development based on frequent interactions with our customers. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic our solution has been used to simplify communication, preserve surgical gloves, face masks and other valuable personal protective equipment (PPE), has allowed for care teams to do remote rounding and even allowed for a patient’s family to be included in three-way calls. We believe that these uses of our solution will become industry standard.
Vocera Ease is our cloud-based communication platform and mobile application built to improve the patient experience by enabling friends and family members to receive timely updates about the progress of their loved one in the hospital. The Vocera Ease app enables nurses and other care team members to send HIPAA-compliant texts, photos, and video updates to patients’ loved ones, putting them at ease and saving valuable time.
In May 2021, we acquired PatientSafe Solutions, Inc. (now marketed and sold under the Vocera Edge brand). Vocera Edge provides a clinical communication and collaboration (CC&C) solution for smartphones that is engineered to run either on-premises or in the cloud. The solution is designed for hospitals and health systems that have invested in their electronic health record (EHR) mobile workflow software, are smartphone centric, and prefer a cloud-based CC&C solution. The solution enhances care team mobility and efficiency at the point of care through effective, reliable communication and clinical workflows. Nurses can document to the EHR while receiving filtered, prioritized alarm and task notifications. Physicians can communicate with the nurses and team members supporting their patients. Two-way communication with a hospital’s EHR system enables clinicians to complete certain documentation and manage patient-centric communication from their smartphones. With this acquisition, Vocera further strengthened its ability to improve the lives of patients, families and care teams.
As of December 31, 2021, our solutions were selected by over 2,300 healthcare facilities, including large hospital systems, small and medium-sized local hospitals, clinics, surgery centers and aged-care facilities. We sell our solutions to healthcare customers primarily through our direct sales force in the United States, with resellers for certain vertical markets as well as our U.S. Government business, and through both direct sales and select distribution channels in international markets.
We were incorporated in Delaware on February 16, 2000. Our corporate headquarters are located at 3030 Orchard Parkway, San Jose, California, 95134, and our main telephone number is (408) 882‑5100. We maintain a website at www.vocera.com. The contents of our website are not incorporated into, or otherwise to be regarded as part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Industry overview
Vocera provides communication and workflow solutions for mobile workers in healthcare, hospitality, retail, energy, education and other industries. Healthcare is our largest vertical market.
Hospital communication is still predominantly conducted through multiple disparate, non-integrated systems, including pagers, overhead paging, portable in-building wireless phones and individuals’ personal mobile phones. These non-integrated communication methods are inefficient and often unreliable; lacking “closed loop” communication, workflow standardization, or the scale required by health systems. Further, they often contribute to noisy environments for patients and negatively impact healing, safety, quality of care and operational efficiency.
Broadly, we believe the healthcare industry is placing greater emphasis on the need for better communication and workflow to meet increasing requirements for care quality, efficiency, patient satisfaction and staff safety and resiliency. Hospitals are struggling to attract and retain the needed nurses and other frontline caregivers to meet their demands. The pandemic has resulted in many nurses leaving the profession and hospital administrators are looking for tools and technologies that can help connect and protect frontline caregivers. The need for clinical communication and workflow solutions is being identified as a key technology to improve staff and patient safety, throughput, and retention. A number of non-government organizations, such as The Joint Commission, are also requiring improvements in patient safety and quality of care. These forces are driving hospitals to invest in technology and process improvements to manage their operations more efficiently, improve quality of care, and increase patient satisfaction and staff resiliency. Our solutions help hospitals increase productivity and reduce costs by enhancing workflow and improving patient and staff satisfaction through secure, integrated and intelligent communication.

Our strategy
Our goal is to extend our leadership position as a provider of communication and workflow solutions in the healthcare market and add new customers in non-healthcare markets.
Key elements of our strategy include:

•Expand our business to new U.S. healthcare customers.    We believe our solutions can provide significant value to health systems, hospitals and smaller healthcare facilities. We plan to continue to add new customers among hospitals of all sizes, and expand to outpatient clinics, aged-care and skilled nursing facilities. We are increasingly selling enterprise level deployments across entire health systems which is resulting in higher average selling prices.
•Further expand our footprint within our existing installed customer base.    Many of our customers initially deploy our solutions in several departments of a hospital and gradually expand to additional departments as they come to fully appreciate the value of the solutions. We have a significant opportunity to up-sell and cross-sell to our existing customers, including into new hospitals that are part of an existing healthcare system customer. Key sales strategies include expanding our footprint at existing customer facilities and capturing additional revenue by cross selling some of our newer solutions like Engage, Ease, Edge, and the Smartbadge. We plan to continue expanding within our existing customers in order to grow our revenue and maintain and improve the customer experience. 
•Extend our technology advantage and create new product solutions.    We intend to continue our investment in research and development to enhance the functionality of our solutions and further differentiate them from other competing solutions. As we did with the COVID-19 related enhancements and features, introduction of the Smartbadge in January 2019, and the introduction of the new Vina Smartphone Application in September 2019, we plan to continue to invest in product upgrades, product line extensions and new solutions to enhance our portfolio, including further development of applications for iOS and Android devices.
•Increase our health system selling efforts. Our increasingly comprehensive product suite is enabling us to sell to more large health systems. These sales efforts typically involve conversations with senior decision makers and result in larger deals with complex and elongated sales cycles. We have invested and will continue to invest in our sales force and marketing to enhance our ability to pursue more of these opportunities in the future.
•Invest in partnerships. To create a more efficient communication and workflow system for the entire care team our solution needs to access clinical data and patient context. To enhance that access, we plan to continue to broaden our ecosystem of technology partners, including vendors that provide nurse call systems, patient monitoring systems, analytics and EHRs. We added new partnerships in 2021 and will continue to explore new relationships that broaden our overall market presence and accelerate the sales of our offerings.
•Pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses, technologies and assets.    Over the last several years we have completed a number of acquisitions to help us achieve our strategic vision by enhancing our products and enabling us to enter new markets. Our acquisitions have expanded our solutions, demonstrating that we can successfully source, acquire and integrate complementary businesses, technologies and assets. With the acquisition of PatientSafe Solutions, Inc. in May 2021, we further strengthened our ability to improve the lives of patients, families and care teams. We intend to continue to pursue acquisition opportunities that we believe can accelerate the growth of our business.
•Grow our international healthcare presence.    Today, in addition to our core U.S. market, we sell into other English-speaking markets, including Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and Middle Eastern countries including the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Oman and Qatar. We believe that the rapid pace of investment in new healthcare facilities in these developing international markets provides a significant opportunity for growth. As of December 31, 2021, our solutions were selected by nearly 400 healthcare facilities outside the United States. We plan to utilize both our direct sales force and leverage channel partners to expand our presence into other markets over time.
•Expand our solutions in non-healthcare markets.    While our primary focus is on the healthcare market, our solutions also provide great value in non-healthcare markets. Our solutions have been selected by facilities in hospitality, retail, energy, education, and other mission critical mobile worker environments. Currently, this is not a material portion of our revenue, but in the long term, we believe these markets could represent potential opportunities for growth.

Sales and marketing
Sales
Our sales employees call on hospitals and healthcare systems in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and several countries in the Middle East. As of December 31, 2021, we had 179 sales and account support employees. The sales team is organized to allow us to better serve our customers and to support the different elements of our sales strategy. We supplement our sales organization by utilizing U.S. government-authorized resellers to facilitate our sales to Veterans Administration and Department of Defense healthcare facilities. We also use resellers in certain vertical markets in the United States, as well as in international markets to supplement our sales efforts. A specialized group of our sales team focuses on the development of new customer relationships with large integrated health systems and government healthcare facilities. We enhance our sales efforts by including individuals with nursing backgrounds in our sales staff to address clinical uses with, and provide utilization advice to, customers and potential customers. We have also staffed our sales team with system engineers who focus on the technical elements of system optimization, particularly wireless, and overall product configuration. We have a small direct sales team to focus on developing our non-healthcare business, including hospitality, energy, education and other mission-critical mobile work environments.
Marketing
Our marketing efforts focus on building awareness and generating demand. We believe that continuing to increase our brand recognition is important for the growth of our business as well as generating demand for our solutions. As of December 31, 2021, we had 40 employees in marketing, product management and business development.
Our customer-centric marketing strategy is important in generating new sales leads as word of mouth promotion and testimonials are some of our most valuable marketing tools. A number of our customers have agreed to participate in video testimonials, white papers and case studies that validate the efficacy and the financial benefits of our solutions. We have been featured in numerous articles and on network television demonstrating increased patient satisfaction, streamlined hospital operations and enhanced employee satisfaction and safety. Additionally, we sponsor numerous customer-led webinars to demonstrate customer success and to let prospective customers hear from their peer group about the positive impact that our solutions have made on their hospitals. Many of our sales leads come from referrals of existing customers or users who have moved from a hospital already using Vocera to a new facility or health system. We also invest in digital outreach to better influence buyers early on in their decision-making. 
We have an integrated product management organization that manages the full lifecycle of our products and services; from strategy through execution to end-of-life. Our product roadmaps are driven by current and prospective customers and continually validated using primary and secondary research. We collect customer feedback through surveys and focus groups, customer visits, a customer advisory board, user forums and participation in industry standards organizations. Integral to this team are product managers and user experience designers skilled in clinical and operating workflows, and business development resources that create and manage the ecosystems of clinical and technology system partners. 
Customers
Our solutions have been selected by nearly 2,800 facilities worldwide. Of these, over 2,300 are hospitals and other healthcare facilities, and over 400 are outside of the United States. Our healthcare customers include national and international health and hospital systems, large and medium-sized independent and academic hospitals, small hospitals and healthcare facilities, and U.S. governmental hospitals and care facilities.
Competition
We do not believe any single competitor offers a similar intelligent communication system to the healthcare market that allows instant, hands-free communication through voice-activated, role-based and activity-based calling, secure texting, and clinical integrations and workflows, and that features an advanced clinical rules engine that unifies data from multiple sources simultaneously on a combination of dedicated, proprietary devices, as well as third-party smartphones and other devices.
At this time, the primary alternative to our system consists of a combination of traditional communication methods utilizing wired phones, wireless in-building phones, smartphones, pagers and overhead paging systems. 
Table of Contents

The most significant alternative with which we compete for new sales in hospitals is smartphone applications. These smartphone applications do not have the system intelligence, integrated workflow and convenience of our communication and workflow solutions and are primarily focused on basic text messaging and simple communications.
Additionally, we compete against EHR companies, which have their own smartphone application for secure texting that they continue to enhance. We differentiate our solutions from these vendors by enabling hands-free communication via our Smartbadge and Badge and offering a sophisticated rules engine to support more advanced clinical workflows with more than 150 system integrations.
We believe that the use of mobile smartphone apps for healthcare will continue to expand in our target market and may represent a source of competition, but this trend also represents an opportunity to expand our communication solutions with our smartphone applications, which enable all members of the patient's care team to connect to our software platform and participate as users on our Communication system. 
We believe that the primary competitive factors at work in our market include:

•comprehensiveness of the solution, the features provided and the ability to purchase the complete solution from a single vendor
•product performance and reliability
•the initial cost and ongoing cost of ownership
•customer service and support capabilities
•clinical expertise and our deep understanding of clinical workflows and communications challenges
We may face increased competition in the future, including from large, multinational companies or private equity backed organizations with significant resources. Potential competitors may have existing relationships with purchasers of other products and services within the hospital, which may enhance their ability to gain a foothold in our market. In addition, the continuing expansion of our communication and workflow collaboration capabilities may introduce us to a broader set of competitors. These competitors may include companies that provide clinical workflow solutions, enterprise software, cloud-based solutions and electronic health records.
Research and development
Our continued investment in research and development is critical to our business. We have teams of engineers with expertise in various fields, including software, firmware, database design, applications, speech recognition, wireless communication and hardware design. We employ research and development personnel in San Jose, California; San Diego, California; Fort Wayne, Indiana; Orlando, Florida; Toronto, Canada; Reading, United Kingdom, and Bangalore, India. There were 211 full-time research and development employees as of December 31, 2021. Finally, we have periodically engaged outsourced development firms and contractors to help us with the development and quality assurance testing of certain elements of our software offerings. 
Intellectual property 
Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks, as well as customary contractual protections.
We held 33 U.S. patents as of December 31, 2021, including patents on many capabilities of our software platform and wearable devices. The expiration dates of these patents range from 2022 through 2036. One or more utility patents have also been issued in Australia, Canada, India, Japan and the European Patent Office (with validation in Germany, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands). A European Community design patent has been issued that protects the design in multiple European jurisdictions. 
In addition to the foregoing protections, we generally control access to and use of our proprietary software and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including non-disclosure agreements and other statutory and contractual protections applicable to employees, contractors, customers and partners. These protections include U.S. and international copyright laws.
Our solutions include software developed and owned by us as well as software components we have licensed. These non-exclusive licenses are terminable by the licensor for cause. Certain of these licenses are for a contractually specified term and cannot be renewed without the assent of the licensor. In the event one or more of these licenses is terminated or is not renewed, we could be required to redesign substantial portions of our software in order to incorporate software components from alternative sources. An unplanned redesign of our software could materially and adversely affect our business.

Manufacturing operations and suppliers
We outsource the manufacturing of our wearable device products to original design manufacturers and contract manufacturers, including Sercomm and SMTC Corporation (SMTC). Our Vocera Smartbadge is built in Taiwan and our Vocera Badge is made in Mexico using custom tools and test equipment owned by us. Most of our accessories, including batteries, chargers and attachments, are built by original design manufacturers (ODMs) in Asia.
These manufacturers are responsible for procuring all the components included in our products, as specified and approved by us. Some of these components are sole-sourced off-the-shelf and some are custom components built exclusively for our products. In the event we are unable to procure certain components, we could be required to redesign some of our products in order to incorporate technology from alternative sources. An unplanned redesign of our products could materially and adversely affect our business.
We require our suppliers to perform both incoming and outgoing product inspections. In addition, we perform in-house quality control and ongoing reliability testing.
We also resell the Spectralink Versity Smartphone and Zebra Technologies TC52 Android mobile computer. These devices are offered as a bundled solution with our smartphone applications to provide a complete, turnkey solution for our customers’ clinical communication needs.
Employees and Workforce Management
As of December 31, 2021, we had 745 employees dedicated to our mission of improving the lives of healthcare professionals and patients. These consist of 20 in manufacturing and quality operations, 211 in research and development, 219 in sales and marketing, 224 in services and support and 71 in general and administrative. Our workforce is distributed globally across 6 countries with 586 employees located in the U.S. and 159 located outside the U.S. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement or are represented by a labor union. We consider our company culture to be a unique asset, and we believe we have maintained excellent relations with our employees.
Vocera’s workforce is governed by various federal, state, and local regulations. We monitor all key employment activities such as hiring, termination, and pay practices for compliance with established regulations globally. The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors is responsible for monitoring our workforce management, including, among other aspects, management depth and strength assessment, leadership development, talent assessment, diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging, and our employee experience survey results. While workforce management is overseen at the highest level of our company, it is woven into the everyday fabric of Vocera’s culture.
At Vocera, our people are our greatest asset, a competitive advantage, and are the core component behind our every success. The cultural values we put into action are: build with respect, embrace innovation, think customer first, drive for results and lead with passion. These values are the framework we align with to hire, train, manage and assess the performance of our global employees. We believe these values differentiate us and, in part, allowed us to consistently retain our employees throughout fiscal year 2021, as our attrition rate continues to be lower than benchmark data. Our employee average tenure globally is 4.8 years.
We foster a culture where our employees can thrive both at work and at home. We apply a systemic approach to culture and people and align performance with pay and rewards. As part of Vocera’s dedication to and investment in its employees, we conduct organizational health surveys designed to assess employee engagement, leadership, work environment, and culture. 
Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging: We embrace diversity and inclusion and strive to provide a rich environment with diverse skills, backgrounds, and perspectives. As of December 31, 2021, 34% of global employees, 28% of leadership positions, and 33% of our board of directors identified as female. In terms of racial and ethnic diversity, 34% of our employees in the United States self-identified as part of a minority group. At Vocera we are committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion. In 2021, we measured our employees' perceptions on this topic and scored at or above industry benchmark. 2021 was a year of program development and growth around this topic including: a comprehensive internal assessment, internal communications campaign, global listening tour, multiple diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging virtual events, employee resource group development, required management training, and the publishing of our diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging statement and commitment.
Employee Well-being and Resilience: We provide comprehensive benefits related to health, wellness, mental health and family resources designed to meet the needs of our diverse global workforce. Employee resilience, physical and psychological safety is of paramount importance to us in any year and was of particular focus in 2021 in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We enhanced and promoted programs, events, and resources to support our employees' physical, financial, social, emotional, and family’s well-being through our Vocera on Wellness and Employee Assistance Programs. As part of our ongoing response to the pandemic, we provide PPE to our frontline employees, continue to implement new safety protocols, enhance utilization of existing productivity and collaboration tools, and establish structures for timely communication and decision making

throughout the changing environment. As a partner to healthcare providers, we connect our purpose and align our safety requirements to stand shoulder to shoulder with our customers. We facilitate frequent town halls to clearly articulate expectations and engage in meaningful dialogue with all employees. As a result of these efforts, we maintain high employee satisfaction results.
People Development: We believe in investing in our employees, and their professional growth and development is a priority for our company. We engage in detailed discussions around succession planning and talent development to achieve business results at all levels. We have robust employee development review discussions where high-performing and high potential employees are identified for future growth opportunities, as well as succession planning for future critical leadership positions. Actions and development plans as a result of this work are ongoing throughout the year. With an emphasis on supporting women in navigating and accelerating their careers, a cohort of employees participated in a career advancement program. With an added focus on developing our leaders, our people managers attended management essentials sessions, and we hosted a customized year-long leadership development program focused on our top talent and future leaders. Due to the prolonged nature of the pandemic, we offered leaders additional training to maintain high employee engagement in a largely remote working environment.
Community and Social Impact: Vocera strongly believes in giving back to local communities by volunteering and making direct donations where our employees live and work. While the global pandemic continued to limit our ability to volunteer in-person in certain regions, our employee-run community involvement council held some in-person and virtual charitable events and was able to make multiple donations to food banks and other regional and national non-profit agencies.
Backlog
Our backlog of undelivered orders, which includes non-cancellable and cancellable amounts, was $162.1 million and $109.2 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Of the current backlog, all but $84.2 million is expected to be delivered in 2022.
Government regulations and standards
A majority of our revenue is derived from the healthcare industry. The healthcare industry is highly regulated and is subject to changing political, legislative, regulatory and other influences. These factors affect the purchasing practices and operations of healthcare organizations, as well as the behavior and attitudes of our users. Representatives of the U.S. federal legislature and agencies have announced plans to reform or revise aspects of the U.S. healthcare system and we expect these efforts to continue over the next several years. We also expect federal and state legislatures and agencies to continue to consider new programs to reform or revise aspects of the U.S. healthcare system. These programs may contain proposals to increase governmental involvement in healthcare or otherwise change the environment in which healthcare industry participants operate.
HIPAA privacy and security standards
In connection with our healthcare communications business, we access personal health information on behalf of our customers. Accordingly, in the United States, we are subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), and its implementing regulations, which established uniform standards for certain “covered entities” (healthcare providers engaged in electronic transactions, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses) governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 included sweeping expansion of HIPAA’s privacy and security standards as reflected in the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, (HITECH). Among other things, the law makes certain HIPAA privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates” - independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. Most of our customers are covered entities under HIPAA and, to the extent that we access personal health information on their behalf, we are their “business associates” and are subject to HIPAA and associated contractual obligations, as well as comparable state privacy and security laws.
In addition, we are subject to privacy and security regulations in other jurisdictions. For example, in May 2016, the EU formally adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which became effective in May 2018. The regulation introduced new data protection requirements in the EU and substantial fines for breaches of the data protection rules. It increased our responsibility and liability in relation to personal information that we process and we put in place additional mechanisms to enhance our compliance with the new EU data protection rules. Additionally, Canada’s Personal Information and Protection of Electronic Documents Act provides Canadian residents with privacy protections in regard to transactions with businesses and organizations in the private sector and sets out ground rules for how private sector organizations may collect, use and disclose

personal information in the course of commercial activities. While the United States does not yet have an overarching federal privacy law, several states have enacted or are in the process of enacting state privacy laws. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or the CCPA, came into effect on January 1, 2020, and became enforceable by the California Attorney General on July 1, 2020, along with related regulations which came into force on August 14, 2020. Additionally, although not effective until January 1, 2023, the California Privacy Rights Act, or the CPRA, which expands upon the CCPA, was passed in the recent election on November 3, 2020. The CCPA requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices and provide such consumers new data protection and privacy rights. The CCPA does have an exemption for HIPAA-covered protected health information, however, the CCPA may still apply to other personal information that we collect and process.
These statutes, regulations and contractual obligations impose numerous requirements regarding the use and disclosure of personal health information with which we must comply, and subject us to material liability and other adverse impacts to our business in the event we fail to do so. These include, without limitation, civil fines, criminal sanctions in certain circumstances, contractual liability to our customers, and damage to our brand and reputation. We endeavor to mitigate these risks through measures we believe to be appropriate for the specific circumstances, including storing personal information under our control on password-protected systems in secure facilities, counseling our customers as to best practices in using our solutions, encrypting such information, and training our personnel. We are committed to protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of personal health information we may encounter in the course of our business activities. Accordingly, we have adopted specific policies and procedures addressing the conduct of the company, employees and specific other third parties regarding how to appropriately safeguard such information in the course of daily activities, and our mandatory annual training includes courses on data security and our code of conduct and policies. All employees are required to sign a certification of completion with respect to such training on an annual basis. 
Medical device regulation
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates certain products, including software-based products, as “medical devices” based, in part, on the intended use of the product and the risk the device poses to the patient should the device fail to perform properly. We have concluded that our communication products are general-purpose communication solutions and are not subject to FDA regulation. However, either the FDA could disagree with our conclusion or changes in our product or the FDA’s evolving regulations could lead to the imposition of medical device regulation on more of our products. In this event, we would be subject to additional regulatory requirements, including the expense of compliance with Medical Device Reporting and Quality System regulation and the potential of liability for failure to comply, and we could be required to obtain 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of those products from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. Some of the products acquired as a result of the Extension Healthcare and mVisum acquisitions are regulated by the FDA as Class II medical devices under applicable law and FDA regulations. Class II devices are devices classified by the FDA as posing a moderate to high risk and therefore subject to both “general controls” and “special controls,” as such terms are defined in the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act. 
Electrical standards and FCC regulations
Our products emit radio frequency energy in the 2.4 and 5.0 GHz spectrum bands for which licensing by U.S. and other regulatory authorities is not required, provided that the products conform to certain requirements, e.g., maximum power output and tolerance of interference from other devices sharing that spectrum band. We subject our products to testing by independent testing laboratories for compliance with the relevant standards issued by various U.S. and international bodies, including the EU (with respect to the “CE” mark), the International Electrotechnical Commission, the Australian Communications and Media Authority, Underwriters Laboratories and CSA International.
