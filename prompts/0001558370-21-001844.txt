Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

As used herein, “Leaf Group,” the “Company,” “our,” “we,” “us” and similar terms include Leaf Group Ltd. and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.
“Leaf Group” and other trademarks of ours appearing in this report, such as “Society6”, “The Other Art Fair”, and “Well+Good”, are our property. This report contains additional trade names and trademarks of other companies. We do not intend our use or display of other companies’ trade names or trademarks to imply an endorsement or sponsorship of us or our business by such companies, or any relationship with any of these companies. 
Overview
Leaf Group is a diversified consumer internet company that builds enduring, creator-driven brands that reach passionate audiences in large and growing lifestyle categories, including fitness and wellness and home, art and design. 
Our business is comprised of three segments: Society6 Group, Saatchi Art Group, and Media Group. Financial information by segment is set forth in Note 17 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15, “Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we had two reportable segments, Marketplaces and Media. Marketplaces included our Society6 and Saatchi Art e-commerce marketplaces and Media referred to our sites, monetized primarily through advertising. During the third quarter of fiscal 2020, to further increase visibility into our business, we divided our Marketplaces segment into two separate segments, referred to as Society6 Group and Saatchi Art Group. Society6 Group includes both our direct-to-consumer line and our business-to-business line. Saatchi Art Group likewise includes both our consumer and business-to-business lines, as well as The Other Art Fair’s live fairs. Our Media segment remains intact and renamed Media Group. We have recast all prior period amounts and segment information to reflect the new segmentation.
Society6 Group​
Society6 Group is our made-to-order marketplace business and includes Society6.com (“Society6”) and our wholesale channel (together with Society6, the “Society6 Group”). Society6 provides artists with an online commerce platform to feature and sell their original art and designs on consumer products in the Wall Art, Home Décor, Tech and Apparel Accessories categories. Artists post their designs and enable products within the Society6 product portfolio on which their art and designs can be sold. After a product is purchased, dependent on the product purchased, third-party vendors or our manufacturing facility produce, package and ship the product directly to the buyer. Society6 Group’s wholesale channel sells products to trade and hospitality clients, as well as retail distribution partners. We serve a diverse community of customers and feature artists from all origins, including underrepresented communities, with designs and artistic styles as diverse as the countries they represent and our campaigns throughout the year highlight artwork by BIPOC (Black, Indigenous and People of Color) artists. As of December 31, 2020, Society6 Group had approximately 405,000 active artists, an increase of approximately 7% from the prior year. There are now more than 8.0 million unique designs and approximately 75 consumer products available across the Society6 Group product portfolio. During 2020, Society6 Group facilitated sales to customers located in approximately 160 countries. 
​
Saatchi Art Group
​
Saatchi Art Group, which includes SaatchiArt.com (“Saatchi Art”) and its complementary art fair event brand, The Other Art Fair (together with Saatchi Art, the “Saatchi Art Group”), is one of the world’s largest online art galleries with a focus on emerging artists. The online gallery’s mission is to democratize the art world and create a platform that celebrates diversity, providing an opportunity for all artists worldwide to exhibit and sell their artwork. The site pairs discovery tools with curation, making it easy for buyers to browse art with confidence. Saatchi Art also offers an art advisory service which provides individual collectors and trade professionals with access to an art curator who will help select artwork tailored to the customer’s needs, space and style. Through Saatchi Art Group, approximately 115,000

artists exhibit and sell their original artwork directly to consumers through a curated online gallery or in-person at art fairs hosted in the United Kingdom, Australia and the United States. Saatchi Art’s online art gallery features a wide selection of original paintings, drawings, sculptures and photography and has sold works to buyers located in over 95 countries in 2020. There are currently more than 2.3 million original, unique works available on the Saatchi Art platform. In 2020, Saatchi Art’s The Other Art Fair hosted no art fairs, due to the Pandemic.
Media Group
Leaf Group’s Media Group segment consists of a diverse portfolio of media properties that educate and inform consumers on a broad range of topics. Our media properties enable a large community of subject matter experts to share their knowledge and passion with consumers across the internet. We generate the majority of our media revenue from the sale of advertising. 
Brands. Our portfolio of owned and operated media properties includes Well+Good, Livestrong.com, Hunker, and OnlyInYourState, as well as approximately 43 other media properties that are focused on specific topics or interests. Collectively, our owned and operated media properties reached more than 51 million average monthly unique visitors in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2020 according to comScore.

Content Creation. We create high-quality, informative and entertaining digital content in a wide variety of formats, including videos, articles and slideshows. We use a combination of internal editorial staff, freelance contributors and social influencers to produce this content. Our platform uses advanced algorithms to identify the questions or underserved topics that are on consumers’ minds. Our platform also manages the development, refinement and eventually the publishing of this content to the web, email and social channels. Our mission is to connect the knowledge and the passion of an expert with interested and curious consumers while highlighting and creating more inclusive content and programs that provide greater opportunities for BIPOC creators to share their stories, experiences and perspectives.
​
Traffic Sources. Consumers can find our content through a variety of modern digital distribution channels including search, social networks, email campaigns and direct navigation. Once a consumer discovers us, we make it easier for them to follow us on social networks, share our content with friends and sign-up for our newsletters. We have a large and growing following across social networks, including Facebook, TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram and Pinterest.
Mobile Applications.  Our media portfolio also includes mobile applications. MyPlate, our most successful app, is integrated into our Livestrong.com brand. During December 2020, MyPlate was used by over 427,000 consumers to track their calories and improve their diet. MyPlate is monetized via ads, sponsorships and a premium subscription offering that unlocks advanced features.
Monetization.  Each of our owned and operated properties is designed to optimize revenues from a diverse set of buyers. We carefully maximize yield across the monetization ad stack between direct brand, programmatic and third parties, each representing a different value bracket. We engage directly with brands on unique content and sponsorship opportunities to connect with our diverse consumers. We also leverage programmatic tools and proprietary data to connect advertisers with valuable audiences across our media properties.

Partner Sites. Some of our websites were developed in coordination with other media companies and publishers. In these cases, we create, maintain and host content that exists on the partner’s sub-domain and is seamlessly integrated into our partner’s website. Revenues from this content are shared with the partner. We currently have approximately nine such hosted properties in our portfolio of media properties.
Technology
Our technologies include software applications built to run on independent clusters of standard and commercially available servers located at a co-location facility and with a third-party cloud provider. We make substantial use of off-the-shelf available open-source technologies such as Linux, PHP, MySQL, Redis, mongoDB, Memcache, Elasticsearch and Couchbase. These systems are connected to the internet via load balancers, firewalls, and routers installed in multiple redundant pairs. We also utilize third-party services to geographically deliver data using major content delivery network (“CDN”) providers, such as Akamai. Virtualization is heavily deployed throughout our technology architecture, which affords scaling numerous properties in an efficient and cost effective manner. Enterprise class storage systems provide redundancy in order to maintain continued and seamless system availability in the event of most component failures.
Our business intelligence platform and financial systems are hosted in a Tier IV data center alongside most of our public facing media websites and applications. Our marketplaces websites are hosted with a third-party cloud hosting provider. Each of our significant websites is designed to be fault-tolerant, with collections of application servers, typically configured in a load balanced state, in order to provide additional resiliency. Our environment is equipped with a full-scale monitoring solution. Our systems and applications are monitored by our continuously staffed technology operations and engineering teams.
International Operations
We provide our products and services to consumers around the world. Our marketplaces are available to artists and buyers globally and, while it is a small part of our outsourced production process, we work with international vendors in the Asia-Pacific and European regions to more efficiently ship products to customers and we continue to look for opportunities to work with additional international vendors. In addition, Saatchi Art’s The Other Art Fair hosts art fairs in the United Kingdom, Australia and the United States. 
Information regarding financial data by geographic areas is set forth in Note 17 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15, “Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and additional information regarding certain risks associated with our international operations is provided under the heading “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
​
Customers
The products and artwork sold through our Society6 Group and Saatchi Art Group segments are primarily sold directly to consumers. We also distribute products through third-party retailers and sell products and artwork to trade professionals and commercial customers.
Our Media Group segment customers currently include advertisers and advertising providers that purchase advertising space on our owned and operated media properties, as well as third-party brands, publishers and advertisers for whom we create and, in some cases, host content. Our advertising strategy is currently focused on both direct sales channels with brands and advertising agencies, particularly with respect to native and sponsored ad campaigns, and programmatic offerings that utilize various advertising network exchanges to manage our ad stack. A significant portion of the advertising revenue generated by our Media Group is derived from our agreements with Google. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—We depend upon certain arrangements with Google for a significant portion of our advertising revenue. A termination of, or a loss of revenue generated from, our arrangements with Google would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.”

Competition
We operate in highly competitive and developing industries that are characterized by rapid technological change, a variety of business models and frequent disruption of incumbents by innovative entrants.
Society6 Group and Saatchi Art Group. Our art and design marketplaces compete with a wide variety of online and brick-and-mortar companies selling comparable products. Our made-to-order marketplace business, Society6 Group, primarily competes with companies that also utilize a made-to-order business model whereby consumer products featuring artist designs are produced by third-party fulfillment partners and shipped directly to customers, such as RedBubble, Threadless, and Minted, as well as companies that offer broader home décor and apparel products for creative, design conscious consumers, such as Etsy, Wayfair, Urban Outfitters, and West Elm. Our online art gallery and in-person art fair business, Saatchi Art Group, competes with traditional offline art galleries, art consultants, and online platforms selling original artwork, such as Artfinder, Artspace, Rise Art, eBay and Amazon Art, as well as various art fairs that feature reasonably priced artwork from emerging artists, such as The Affordable Art Fair. Our marketplaces must successfully attract, retain and engage both buyers and sellers to use our platforms and attend our fairs. We believe that the principal competitive factors for such marketplaces include the quality, price and uniqueness of the products, artwork or services being offered; the selection of goods and artists featured; the ability to source numerous products efficiently and cost-effectively with respect to our made-to-order products; customer service; the convenience and ease of the shopping experience we provide; and our reputation and brand strength. We expect competition to continue to intensify as online and offline businesses increasingly compete with each other and the barriers to enter online channels are reduced.
Media Group. We face intense competition for the properties within our Media Group segment from a wide range of competitors. These markets are rapidly evolving, highly fragmented and competition could increase in the future as more companies enter the space. We compete for advertisers on the basis of a number of factors, including return on marketing expenditures, price of our offerings, and the ability to deliver large audiences or precise types of segmented audiences. Our principal competitors in this space currently include various online media companies ranging from large internet media companies to specialized and enthusiast properties that focus on particular areas of consumer interest, as well as social media outlets such as Facebook, TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram and Pinterest, where brands and advertisers are focusing a significant portion of their online advertising spend in order to connect with their customers. Some of our competitors have larger audiences and more financial resources than we have and many of our competitors are making significant investments in order to compete with various aspects of our business. 
Many of our current competitors have, and potential competitors may have, substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have; greater technical capabilities; greater brand recognition; longer operating histories; differentiated products and services; and larger customer bases. These resources may help some of our competitors and potential competitors respond more quickly as the industry and technology evolves, focus more on product innovation, adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote substantially more resources to website and system development than we do. Additional information regarding competition is included under the heading “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property consists of brands, trademarks, service marks, patents, copyrights and trade secrets, and is, in the aggregate, important to our business. To protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of intellectual property right laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions, including trademark, patent, copyright, and trade secret laws, together with contractual provisions and technical measures that we have implemented. We rely more heavily on trade secret protection than patent protection. To protect our trade secrets, we maintain strict control access to our proprietary systems and technology, including our platforms, infrastructure and production environments. We also enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants, as well as confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with third parties that provide products and services to us. We also license certain trademarks, tradenames and/or copyrights through long-term license arrangements.
We have trademarks registered in the United States and in various countries (some of which are registered in multiple classes) for some of our core properties, including “Society6”, “The Other Art Fair”, “eHow”, “Well+Good” 

​4



and “Hunker”, and we have additional trademark applications pending in the United States and other jurisdictions. We also have patents granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office and other jurisdictions with respect to certain methods, processes and technologies related to our Media Group segment that expire between 2027 and 2034, and we have patent applications pending in the United States and other jurisdictions specific to our Media Group segment. We believe that the duration of our patents is adequate for the current needs of our business. We generally do not register the copyrights associated with our media content with the United States Copyright Office due to the relatively high costs we would incur to register all of our copyrights. 
In addition to the intellectual property we own, we also have perpetual licenses to use the “Saatchi” name in connection with our Saatchi Art marketplace and the “Livestrong.com” name in connection with our Livestrong.com media property, in each case, as permitted by the terms of intellectual property or licensing agreements with the third parties who retain the perpetual ownership rights to such names. Additional information regarding certain risks related to our intellectual property is included under the heading “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Corporate Information
We were incorporated in 2006 as Demand Media, Inc., a Delaware corporation. Later in 2016, we changed our name to Leaf Group Ltd. Our principal executive offices are located at 1655 26th Street, Santa Monica, CA 90404, and our telephone number is (310) 656-6253. Our website address is . Information contained on or that can be accessed through our website does not constitute part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the inclusion of our website address in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is an inactive textual reference only.
Regulation
We are subject to numerous laws and regulations in the United States and abroad, including laws and regulations relating to freedom of expression; information security; data privacy and data collection; pricing and fees; employment related matters; online content and the distribution of content; intellectual property rights, including secondary liability for infringement by others; product liability claims; taxation, including sales and value-added taxes (“VAT”); online advertising and marketing, including email marketing, unsolicited commercial email, native advertising and sponsored content; and the use of social media influencers. 
In the United States, Congress has adopted legislation that regulates certain aspects of the internet, including the Communications Decency Act, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the Lanham Act, the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, the CAN-SPAM Act, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) and the Federal Trade Commission Act. Advertising and promotional information presented to visitors on our online properties, our related social media channels and through our other marketing activities are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations that govern unfair and deceptive practices. Because we operate large consumer-facing media properties and marketplace platforms, we are also subject to state, federal and foreign laws and regulations governing privacy of users’ search and purchasing habits and other information, including requirements related to the collection and protection of consumers’ non-public personal information, user preferences and similar personal data. We are subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which became effective in May 2018 and relates to data protection and privacy in the European Union (the “EU”). If enacted, we will be subject to the EU ePrivacy Regulation, which is a proposed regulation of privacy and electronic communications. We are self-certified with the U.S. Department of Commerce for the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks, which relate to the transfer of personal data from the EU and Switzerland to the U.S. Additionally, an increasing number of states are enacting their own privacy and data protection laws, which may be preempted by proposed U.S. federal privacy laws. 
We are also subject to the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (the “TCPA”), which restricts telemarketing and the use of automated telephone equipment. The TCPA limits the use of automatic dialing systems, artificial or prerecorded voice messages, SMS text messages and fax machines. It also applies to unsolicited text messages advertising the commercial availability of goods or services. Additionally, a number of states have enacted statutes that address telemarketing. For example, some states, such as California, Illinois and New York, have created do-not-call lists. Other states, such as Oregon and Washington, have enacted “no rebuttal statutes” that require the telemarketer to end the call when the consumer indicates that he or she is not interested in the product being sold. 

​5



Restrictions on telephone marketing, including calls and text messages, are enforced by the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”), states and through the availability of statutory damages and class action lawsuits for violations of the TCPA.
We must also comply with certain foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”), the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 (the “U.K. Bribery Act”) and regulations issued by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), the U.S. Commerce Department and various foreign governmental agencies. The FCPA, the UK Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and require companies to maintain accurate books and records. OFAC regulations prohibit U.S.-based entities from entering into or facilitating transactions with, for the benefit of, or involving the property of, persons, governments or countries designated by the U.S. government under one or more sanctions regimes, which could include transactions that provide a benefit that is received in an OFAC designated country. Additionally, some of the products and services we provide to customers globally may require approval under applicable U.S. export and customs laws. 
Federal, state, local and foreign governments are also considering other legislative and regulatory proposals that would regulate the internet in more and different ways than exist today, including with respect to taxes. New laws and regulations, or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, may significantly impact our business. We are subject to the Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market, including Articles 15 and 17, dubbed the “link tax” and “upload filter”, which became effective in June 2019. The costs of compliance with the various laws and regulations applicable to us are high and may increase in the future and any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may subject us to additional liabilities and penalties. See “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

Employees and Human Capital Management
As of December 31, 2020, we had 360 employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or is subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that relations with our employees are good. We have long believed that the core to success lies in having a diverse and engaged workforce. In terms of diversity, we have focused both on gender and racial diversity. We recognized that change starts at the top and in 2020 we substantially changed the racial and gender profile of our Board of Directors (“Board”). Our Board chair is a woman and the majority of the Board consists of women and two of our seven Board members are black. With respect to our workforce, our Company consists of 59% women, including women in critical leadership positions. Our Chief People Officer is a woman of Asian descent and women run our Society6, Saatchi Art, and Well+Good business units. 
While racial diversity has always been a priority, shortly following the start of the anti-racism movement and protests in 2020, we recognized that we needed to do more to address the pervasive issues of racial injustice. In that regard, to further support our diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives (“DEI”), we hired our first Vice President of DEI and Talent Management to help ensure the DEI considerations were driven into every aspect of our business. We published our official DEI statement on our intranet and rolled out various resources to further educate our people and assist them in our efforts to accelerate our efforts to build a diverse workforce. 
While a small company, we work hard to implement a compensation system that both enables us to attract the type of talent we feel is necessary to help the Company succeed and that incentivizes the performance that we are seeking. We operate on a premise both of shared rewards and shared sacrifice. In terms of rewards, we provide competitive base salaries, bonuses, health and welfare benefits and a defined contribution plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (“401(k) Plan”) covering all full-time employees who meet certain eligibility requirements.  In addition, we give eligible employees equity awards so that they can share in the success of our Company as our stock price improves and we also want them to think of themselves as owners of the business with the motivation that brings. In terms of shared sacrifice, in spring of 2020, when the Pandemic first hit, the management team with the full support of the Board was committed to avoiding layoffs and proceeded with a shared sacrifice model. The Board declined all compensation for the first half of 2020, our CEO took a 50% pay cut, our senior executives took a 25% cut and the rest of the employees took a 15% pay cut, which cuts in base pay were later restored. We believe that this approach to shared sacrifice is consistent with our view that we treat our employees as partners in the growth of our business.

We believe that our approach to inclusion, compensation and shared rewards is a critical driver for us in attracting and retaining the people that we need to continue to drive the performance of our business. 
Seasonality
Our Society6 Group and Saatchi Art Group segments are affected by traditional retail seasonality and there is generally increased sales activity on our marketplaces platforms during the third and fourth quarter back-to-school and holiday seasons. All of our segments are affected by seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, which generally slows in the first quarter of the calendar year as well as during the summer months. These seasonal trends have caused, and will likely continue to cause, fluctuations in our quarterly results.
