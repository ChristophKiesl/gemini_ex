NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of PHI Group, Inc., its wholly owned subsidiaries PHI Capital Holdings, Inc., Abundant Farms, Inc., American Pacific Resources, Inc., and PHI Group Regional Center, LLC as well as its discontinued operations Providential Securities, Inc., PHI Energy Corporation, PHI Gold Corp, Providential Vietnam Ltd. and Philand Ranch Limited (including its 100% owned subsidiary Philand Corporation and Philand Vietnam Ltd), Omni Resources, Inc., and Cornerstone Biomass Corp., collectively referred to as the “Company.” All significant inter-company transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
USE OF ESTIMATES
 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
 
The Company considers all liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase that are readily convertible into cash to be cash equivalents.
MARKETABLE SECURITIES
 
The Company’s securities are classified as available-for-sale and, as such, are carried at fair value. Securities classified as available-for-sale may be sold in response to changes in interest rates, liquidity needs, and for other purposes.
 
Each investment in marketable securities typically represents less than twenty percent (20%) of the outstanding common stock and stock equivalents of the investee, and each security is quoted on a national exchange or on the OTC Markets. As such, each investment is accounted for in accordance with the provisions of ASC 320 (previously SFAS No. 115). 
 
Unrealized holding gains and losses for available-for-sale securities are excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of stockholder’s equity. Realized gains and losses for securities classified as available-for-sale are reported in earnings based upon the adjusted cost of the specific security sold. On June 30, 2017 and 2016 the marketable securities have been recorded at $502,696 and $481,120, respectively based upon the fair value of the marketable securities at that time.
 
ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE
 
Management reviews the composition of accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts. As of June 30, 2017, the Company had no accounts receivable.
 
IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
 
Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted ASC 350 (Previously SFAS 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”), which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets and supersedes SFAS No. 121, “Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of,” and the accounting and reporting provisions of APB Opinion No. 30, “Reporting the Results of Operations for a Disposal of a Segment of a Business.” The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used in accordance with ASC 350. ASC 350 requires impairment losses to be recorded on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets’ carrying amounts. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair market value of the long-lived assets. Loss on long-lived assets to be disposed of is determined in a similar manner, except that fair market values are reduced for the cost of disposal.

F-7
---

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
 
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Maintenance and repair costs are charged to expense as incurred; costs of major additions and betterments are capitalized. When property and equipment are sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in income. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, ranging from three to ten years.
DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION
 
The cost of property and equipment is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Depreciation and amortization of fixed assets are computed on a straight-line basis.
NET EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE
 
The Company adopted the provisions of ASC 260 (previously SFAS 128). ASC 260 eliminates the presentation of primary and fully diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) and requires presentation of basic and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is computed by dividing income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period and common stock equivalents outstanding at the end of the period.
 
The net earnings (loss) per share is computed as follows:
 

 | 2017 | | | 2016 | 
---------------------------------------------------------------+------+------------+---+------+--
Basic and diluted net loss per share: | | | | | | | 
Numerator: | | | | | | | 
Net income (loss) | $ | (1,560,718 | ) | | $ | (7,998 | )
Denominator: | | | | | | | 
Basic weighted average number of common shares outstanding | | 15,553,354 | | | | 5,324,120 | 
Basic net income (loss) per share | $ | (0.10 | ) | | $ | (0.00 | )
Diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding | | 15,553,354 | | | | 5,324,120 | 
Diluted net income (loss) per share | $ | (0.10 | ) | | $ | (0.00 | )

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
 
Effective July 1, 2006, the Company adopted ASC 718-10-25 (previously SFAS 123R) and accordingly has adopted the modified prospective application method. Under this method, ASC 718-10-25 is applied to new awards and to awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled after the effective date. Additionally, compensation cost for the portion of awards that are outstanding as of the date of adoption for which the requisite service has not been rendered (such as unvested options) is recognized over a period of time as the remaining requisite services are rendered.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
 
Fair Value - Definition and Hierarchy
 
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are categorized based on whether or not the inputs are observable in the market and the degree that the inputs are observable. The categorization of financial assets and liabilities within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
 
A fair value hierarchy for inputs is used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs are to be used when available.
 
Valuation techniques that are consistent with the market or income approach are used to measure fair value. The fair value hierarchy is categorized into three levels based on the inputs as follows:
 
Level 1 - Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Fund has the ability to access.
 
Level 2 - Valuations based on inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly.
 
Level 3 - Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.
 
Fair value is a market-based measure, based on assumptions of prices and inputs considered from the perspective of a market participant that are current as of the measurement date, rather than an entity-specific measure. Therefore, even when market assumptions are not readily available, the Company’s own assumptions are set to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. The availability of valuation techniques and observable inputs can vary from investment to investment and are affected by a wide variety of factors, including; type of investment, whether the investment is new and not yet established in the marketplace, the liquidity of markets, and other characteristics particular to the transaction.
 
To the extent that valuation is based upon models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, those estimated values may be materially higher or lower than the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Fund in determining fair value is greatest for investments categorized in Level 3. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurement falls in its entirety is determined based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
 
Fair Value - Valuation Techniques and Inputs
 
The Company holds and may invest public securities traded on public exchanges or over-the-counter (OTC), private securities, real estate, convertible securities, interest bearing securities and other types of securities and has adopted specific techniques for their respective valuations.
Equity Securities in Public Companies
 
Unrestricted
 
The Company values investments in securities that are freely tradable and listed on major securities exchanges at their last reported sales price as of the valuation date. To the extent these securities are actively traded and valuation adjustments are not applied, they are categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.

F-9
---


Securities traded on inactive markets or valued by reference to similar instruments are generally categorized in Level 2 or 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
 
Restricted
 
Securities traded on public exchanges or over-the-counter (OTC) where there are formal restrictions that limit (i.e. Rule 144 holding periods and underwriter’s lock-ups) their sale shall be valued at the closing price on the date of valuation less applicable discounts. The Company may apply a discount to securities with Rule 144 restrictions. Additional discounts may be assessed if the Company believes there are other mitigating factors which warrant the additional discounting. When determining potential additional discounts, factors that will be taken into consideration include, but are not limited to; securities’ trading characteristics, volume, length and overall impact of the restriction as well as other macro-economic factors. Valuations should be discounted appropriately until the securities may be freely traded.
 
If it has been determined that the exchange or OTC listed price does not accurately reflect fair market value, the Company may elect to treat the security as a private company and apply an alternative valuation method.
 
Investments in restricted securities of public companies may be included in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. However, to the extent that significant inputs used to determine liquidity discounts are not observable, investments in restricted securities in public companies may be categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
 
The Company's financial instruments primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, marketable securities, short-term notes payable, convertible notes, derivative liabilities and accounts payable.


As of the balance sheet dates, the estimated fair values of the financial instruments were not materially different from their carrying values as presented on the balance sheet. This is primarily attributed to the short maturities of these instruments.
 
Effective July 1, 2008, the Company adopted ASC 820 (previously SFAS 157), Fair Value Measurements and adopted this Statement for the assets and liabilities shown in the table below. ASC 820 clarifies the definition of fair value, prescribes methods for measuring fair value, establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used to measure fair value, and expands disclosures about the use of fair value measurements. The adoption of ASC 820 did not have a material impact on our fair value measurements. ASC 820 permits the Company to defer the recognition and measurement of the nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities until January 1, 2010. At June 30, 2017, the Company did not have any nonfinancial assets or nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value. ASC 820 requires that financial assets and liabilities that are reported at fair value be categorized as one of the types of investments based upon the methodology mentioned in Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 above for determining fair value.
 
Assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below. The Company also has convertible notes and derivative liabilities as disclosed in this report that are measured at fair value on a regular basis until paid off or converted into common stock of the Company.
 
Available-for-sale securities
 

Securities available for sale | Level 1 | | Level 2 | | | Level 3 | | Total 
----------------------------------+-------------+---+-------------+---+---------+-------------+---+--------
June 30, 2017 | $ | - | | $ | 210,646 | | $ | 292,050 | $ | 502,696
June 30, 2016 | $ | - | | $ | 60,054 | | $ | 323,717 | $ | 383,770

 
The Company uses various approaches to measure fair value of available-for-sale securities, while applying the three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures, specified in ASC 820. Our Level 1 securities were measured using the quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
 
The company’s policy regarding the transfers in and/or out of Level 3 depends on the trading activity of the security, the volatility of the security, and other observable units which clearly represents the fair value of the security. If a level 3 security can be measured using a more fairly represented fair value, we will transfer these securities either into Level 1 or Level 2, depending on the type of inputs.

REVENUE RECOGNITION
 
The Company’s revenue recognition policies are in compliance with ASC 13 (previously Staff accounting bulletin (SAB) 104). The Company recognizes consulting and advisory fee revenues when the transaction is completed and the service fees are earned. Expenses are recognized in the period in which the corresponding liability is incurred. Payments received before all of the relevant criteria for revenue recognition are recorded as unearned revenue.
ADVERTISING
 
The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising costs for the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 were $31,413 and $79,072, respectively. The decrease in advertising expenses in the current year is primarily due to a reduction of $35,500 in investor relations expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, as compared to the previous fiscal year.
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)
 
ASC 220-10-45 (previously SFAS 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income) establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income, its components and accumulated balances. Comprehensive income is defined to include all changes in equity, except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. Among other disclosures, SFAS No. 130 requires that all items that are required to be recognized under current accounting standards as components of comprehensive income be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements. As of June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, accumulated other comprehensive incomes of $153,474 and $30,263 are presented on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
INCOME TAXES
 
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740 (previously SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes”). Deferred taxes are provided on the liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences, and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.
REPORTING OF SEGMENTS
 
ASC 280 (previously Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information), which supersedes Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 14, Financial Reporting for Segments of a Business Enterprise, establishes standards for the way that public enterprises report information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires reporting of selected information about operating segments in interim financial statements regarding products and services, geographic areas and major customers. ASC 280 defines operating segments as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company operated in one segment that generated revenues during the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016.
RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
 
In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to certain risks and uncertainties. The Company provides its service and receives marketable securities upon execution of transactions. Consequently, the value of the securities received from customers can be affected by economic fluctuations and each customer’s business growth. The actual realized value of these securities could be significantly different than recorded value.
