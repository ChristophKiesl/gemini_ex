ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Company Description and Development of the Business
The discussion below describes the business conducted by The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company, an Ohio corporation (“Scotts Miracle-Gro” and, together with its subsidiaries, the “Company,” “we” or “us”), including general developments in the Company’s business during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 (“fiscal 2021”). For additional information on recent business developments, see “ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Form 10-K”).
Through our U.S. Consumer and Other segments, we are the leading manufacturer and marketer of branded consumer lawn and garden products in North America. Our products are marketed under some of the most recognized brand names in the industry. Our key consumer lawn and garden brands include Scotts® and Turf Builder® lawn fertilizer and grass seed products; Miracle-Gro® soil, plant food and insecticide, LiquaFeed® plant food and Osmocote®1 gardening and landscape products; and Ortho®, Home Defense® and Tomcat® branded insect control, weed control and rodent control products. We are the exclusive agent of the Monsanto Company, a subsidiary of Bayer AG (“Monsanto”), for the marketing and distribution of certain of Monsanto’s consumer Roundup®2 branded products within the United States and certain other specified countries. We also have a presence in similar branded consumer products in China. In addition, we own a 50% equity interest in Bonnie Plants, LLC, a joint venture with Alabama Farmers Cooperative, Inc. (“AFC”), focused on planting, growing, developing, manufacturing, distributing, marketing, and selling live plants, plant food, fertilizer and potting soil. 
Through our Hawthorne segment, we are the leading manufacturer, marketer and distributor of lighting, nutrients, growing media, growing environments and hardware products for indoor and hydroponic gardening in North America. Our key brands include General Hydroponics®, Gavita®, Botanicare®, Agrolux®, Can-Filters®, Sun System®, Gro Pro®, Mother Earth®, Hurricane®, Grower’s Edge® and Hydro-Logic®. 
Scotts Miracle-Gro traces its heritage to a company founded by O.M. Scott in Marysville, Ohio in 1868. In the mid-1900s, we became widely known for the development of quality lawn fertilizers and grass seeds that led to the creation of a new industry – consumer lawn care. In the 1990s, we significantly expanded our product offering with three leading brands in the U.S. home lawn and garden industry. In fiscal 1995, through a merger with Stern’s Miracle-Gro Products, Inc., which was founded by Horace Hagedorn and Otto Stern in Long Island, New York in 1951, we acquired the Miracle-Gro® brand, the industry leader in water-soluble garden plant foods. In fiscal 1999, we acquired the Ortho® brand in the United States and obtained exclusive rights to market Monsanto’s consumer Roundup® brand within the United States and other contractually specified countries, thereby adding industry-leading weed, pest and disease control products to our portfolio. Today, the Scotts®, Turf Builder®, Miracle-Gro®, Ortho® and Roundup® brands make us the most widely recognized company in the consumer lawn and garden industry in the United States. Our Hawthorne segment is the leading manufacturer, marketer and distributor of indoor and hydroponic gardening products in North America. 
Business Segments
We divide our business into the following reportable segments:
•U.S. Consumer
•Hawthorne
•Other
U.S. Consumer consists of our consumer lawn and garden business located in the United States. Hawthorne consists of our indoor and hydroponic gardening business. Other primarily consists of our consumer lawn and garden business outside the United States. This division of reportable segments is consistent with how the segments report to and are managed by our Chief Executive Officer (the chief operating decision maker of the Company). In addition, Corporate consists of general and administrative expenses and certain other income and expense items not allocated to the business segments. Financial information about these segments for each of the three fiscal years ended September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is presented in “NOTE 21. SEGMENT INFORMATION” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.

Marketing Agreement: We are Monsanto’s exclusive agent for the marketing and distribution of certain of Monsanto’s consumer Roundup® branded products in the United States and certain other specified countries. On May 15, 2015, we entered into an amendment (the “Marketing Agreement Amendment”) to the Amended and Restated Exclusive Agency and Marketing Agreement (as amended, the “Original Marketing Agreement”) with Monsanto and also entered into a lawn and garden brand extension agreement (the “Brand Extension Agreement”) and a commercialization and technology agreement (the “Commercialization and Technology Agreement”) with Monsanto. On August 31, 2017, in connection with the sale of our consumer lawn and garden businesses located in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Poland and the United Kingdom (the “International Business”), we entered into the Second Amended and Restated Agency and Marketing Agreement (the “Restated Marketing Agreement”) and the Amended and Restated Lawn and Garden Brand Extension Agreement – Americas (the “Restated Brand Extension Agreement”) to reflect the Company’s transfer and assignment to Exponent Private Equity LLP (“Exponent”) of the Company’s rights and responsibilities under the Original Marketing Agreement, as amended, and the Brand Extension Agreement relating to those countries and territories subject to the sale. 
Effective August 1, 2019, we entered into (i) the Third Amended and Restated Exclusive Agency and Marketing Agreement (the “Third Restated Agreement”) which amends and restates the Restated Marketing Agreement, (ii) a Brand Extension Agreement Asset Purchase Agreement (the “BEA Purchase Agreement”) under which we sold certain assets to Monsanto related to the development, manufacture, production, advertising, marketing, promotion, distribution, importation, exportation, offer for sale and sale of specified Roundup® branded products sold outside the non-selective weedkiller category within the residential lawn and garden market and (iii) agreements terminating both the Restated Brand Extension Agreement and the Commercialization and Technology Agreement.
Under the terms of the Third Restated Agreement, we provide certain consumer and trade marketing program services, sales, merchandising, warehousing and other selling and marketing support for certain of Monsanto’s consumer Roundup® branded products. Among other things, the Third Restated Agreement amends the provisions of the Restated Marketing Agreement relating to commissions, contributions, noncompetition, and termination. The Company also performs other services on behalf of Monsanto, including manufacturing conversion services, pursuant to ancillary agreements. For additional details regarding the Third Restated Agreement, see “ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS — Risks Related to Our Business — In the event the Third Restated Agreement for Monsanto’s consumer Roundup® products terminates or Monsanto’s consumer Roundup® business materially declines, we would lose a substantial source of future earnings and overhead expense absorption” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and “NOTE 7. MARKETING AGREEMENT” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.
COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, an impact on financial markets, economic conditions, and portions of our business and industry. We have actively addressed the pandemic’s ongoing impact on our employees, operations, customers, consumers, and communities, by, among other things, implementing contingency plans, making operational adjustments where necessary, and providing assistance to organizations that support front-line workers. The first priority of our pandemic response has been and remains the health, safety and well-being of our employees. Many of our employees continue to work from home. In those instances where our employees cannot perform their work at home, we have implemented additional health and safety measures and social distancing protocols, consistent with government recommendations and/or requirements, to help to ensure their safety. In addition, we implemented an interim premium pay allowance for certain associates in our field sales force and our manufacturing or distribution centers, which has paid out nearly $50.0 million since the inception of the COVID-19 pandemic.
During fiscal 2021, we continued to experience increased demand for many of our products compared to periods before the pandemic. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in the future will depend on future developments, including the duration, spread and intensity of the pandemic, our continued ability to manufacture and distribute our products, as well as any future government actions affecting consumers and the economy generally, all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict considering the rapidly evolving landscape. We are not able to predict the impact, if any, that the COVID-19 pandemic may have on the seasonality of our business. 
Although we currently expect to be able to continue operating our business as described above and we intend to continue to work with government authorities and to follow the necessary protocols to maintain the health and safety of our employees, uncertainty resulting from COVID-19 could result in an unforeseen additional disruption to our business, including our global supply chain and retailer network, and/or require us to incur additional operational costs. 
Acquisitions and Divestitures
On August 13, 2021, our Hawthorne segment completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Rhizoflora, Inc., manufacturer of terpene enhancing nutrient products Terpinator® and Purpinator®, for $33.7 million. 
During fiscal 2021, we announced the creation of a newly formed subsidiary, The Hawthorne Collective, Inc., which will focus on strategic minority non-equity investments in areas of the cannabis industry not currently pursued by our Hawthorne segment. This initiative is designed to allow us, in the future, to participate directly in a larger marketplace as the legal environment changes over time. On August 24, 2021, we made our initial investment under this initiative in the form of a $150.0 million six-year convertible note issued to us by Toronto-based RIV Capital Inc. (“RIV Capital”) (CSE: RIV) (OTC: CNPOF), a cannabis investment and acquisition firm listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange. The note accrues interest at 2 percent annually for the first two years and provides additional follow-on investment rights. The conversion feature, which is based upon the RIV Capital closing stock price on August 9, 2021, would provide us with approximately 42 percent ownership of RIV Capital if we exercise the conversion feature. In connection with our investment, RIV Capital increased the size of its Board of Directors from four to seven members, and added three nominees of the Company to the Board of Directors. We do not have control of or an active day-to-day role in RIV Capital nor any of the companies in which RIV Capital invests. RIV Capital has agreed to use the funds for general corporate and other lawful purposes, which could include acquisitions, and has agreed that the funds will not be used in connection with or for any cannabis or cannabis-related operations in the U.S. unless and until such operations comply with all applicable U.S. federal laws. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, The Hawthorne Collective, Inc. made additional minority non-equity investments of $43.1 million in other entities focused on branded cannabis and high quality genetics. These additional investments also include conversion features that would provide us with minority ownership interests in these entities if we exercise the conversion features. The additional investments include restrictions that the funds will not be used in connection with or for any cannabis or cannabis-related operations in the U.S. unless and until such operations comply with all applicable U.S. federal laws. 
On August 27, 2021, our Hawthorne segment completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Hydro-Logic Purification Systems, Inc., a leading provider of products, accessories and systems for water filtration and purification, for $66.7 million.
On February 26, 2021, we acquired all of the remaining outstanding shares of AeroGrow International, Inc. (“AeroGrow”) for cash consideration of $3.00 per share, or approximately $20.1 million. Prior to closing, SMG Growing Media, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Scotts Miracle-Gro, was the holder of 80.5% of the outstanding shares of AeroGrow.
During the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we entered into a Marketing, R&D and Ancillary Services Agreement (the “Services Agreement”) and a Term Loan Agreement (the “Term Loan Agreement”) with Bonnie Plants, Inc. and AFC, pursuant to which we provided financing and certain services to Bonnie’s business of planting, growing, developing, manufacturing, distributing, marketing, and selling to retail stores throughout the United States live plants, plant food, fertilizer and potting soil (the “Bonnie Business”), and that included options beginning in fiscal 2020 that provided for either (i) the Company to increase its economic interest in the Bonnie Business or (ii) AFC and Bonnie to repurchase the Company’s economic interest in the Bonnie Business (collectively, the “Bonnie Option”). On December 31, 2020, pursuant to the terms of the Contribution and Unit Purchase Agreement between us and AFC, we acquired a 50% equity interest in a newly formed joint venture with AFC (“Bonnie Plants, LLC”) in exchange for cash payments of $102.3 million, as well as non-cash investing activities that included forgiveness of our outstanding loan receivable with AFC and surrender of the Bonnie Option. 
Refer to “NOTE 8. ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K for more information regarding these acquisitions and investments.
Principal Markets and Methods of Distribution
We sell our products through a direct sales force, online selling and our network of brokers and distributors primarily to home centers, mass merchandisers, warehouse clubs, large hardware chains, independent hardware stores, nurseries, garden centers, e-commerce platforms, food and drug stores, indoor gardening and hydroponic product distributors, retailers and growers. 
The majority of our shipments to customers are made via common carriers, our own private fleet or through distributors in the United States. We primarily utilize third parties to manage the key distribution centers for our consumer lawn and garden business, which are strategically located across the United States and Canada. For our Hawthorne business, we primarily self-manage distribution centers across the United States and Canada. Growing media products are generally shipped direct-to-store without passing through a distribution center. 
Raw Materials
We purchase raw materials for our products from various sources. We are subject to market risk as a result of the fluctuating prices of raw materials, including urea and other fertilizer inputs, resins, diesel, gasoline, natural gas, sphagnum peat, bark and grass seed. Our objectives surrounding the procurement of these materials are to ensure continuous supply, minimize costs and improve predictability. We seek to achieve these objectives through negotiation of contracts with favorable terms directly with vendors. When appropriate, we commit to purchase a certain percentage of our needs in advance of the lawn and garden season to secure pre-determined prices. We also hedge certain commodities, particularly diesel, resin and urea, to improve cost predictability and control. Sufficient raw materials were available during fiscal 2021.
Trademarks, Patents, Trade Secrets and Licenses
We believe that our trademarks, patents, trade secrets and licenses provide us with significant competitive advantages. We pursue a vigorous trademark protection strategy consisting of registration, renewal and maintenance of key trademarks and proactive monitoring and enforcement activities to protect against infringement. The Scotts®, Miracle-Gro®, Ortho®, Tomcat®, Hyponex®, Earthgro®, General Hydroponics®, Gavita®, Botanicare®, Agrolux®, Sun System®, Mother Earth® and Can-Filters® brand names and logos, as well as a number of product trademarks, including Turf Builder®, EZ Seed®, Organic Choice®, Home Defense Max®, Nature Scapes®, and Weed B Gon® are registered in the United States and/or internationally and are considered material to our business. 
In addition, we actively develop and maintain an extensive portfolio of utility and design patents covering a variety of subject matters and technologies relevant to the business such as fertilizer, weed killer, chemical and growing media compositions and processes; grass seed varieties; mechanical dispensing devices such as applicators, spreaders and sprayers; lighting applications; and hydroponic growing systems. Our utility patents provide protection generally extending to 20 years from the date of filing, and many of our patents will continue well into the next decade. We also hold exclusive and non-exclusive patent licenses and supply arrangements, permitting the use and sale of additional patented fertilizers, pesticides, electrical and mechanical devices. Although our portfolio of trade secrets, patents and patent licenses is important to our success, no single trade secret, patent or group of related patents, alone, is considered critical to the operation of any of our business segments or the business as a whole.
Seasonality and Backlog
Our North America consumer lawn and garden business is highly seasonal, with more than 75% of our annual net sales occurring in our second and third fiscal quarters combined. Our annual sales for this business are further concentrated in our second and third fiscal quarters by retailers who rely on our ability to deliver products closer to when consumers buy our products, thereby reducing retailers’ pre-season inventories. 
We anticipate significant orders for the upcoming spring season will start to be received late in the winter and continue through the spring season. Historically, substantially all orders have been received and shipped within the same fiscal year with minimal carryover of open orders at the end of the fiscal year.
Significant Customers
Home Depot and Lowe’s are our two largest customers and are the only customers that individually represent more than 10% of reported consolidated net sales during any of the three most recent fiscal years. For additional details regarding significant customers, see “ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS — Risks Related to Our Business — Because of the concentration of our sales to a small number of retail customers, the loss of one or more of, or a significant reduction in orders from, our top customers could adversely affect our financial results” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and “NOTE 21. SEGMENT INFORMATION” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Competitive Marketplace
The markets in which we sell our products are highly competitive. We compete primarily on the basis of brand strength, product innovation, product quality, product performance, advertising, value, supply chain competency, field sales support, in-store sales support and the strength of our relationships with major retailers and distributors. 
In the lawn and garden, pest control and indoor gardening and hydroponic markets, our products compete against private-label as well as branded products. Primary competitors include Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc., Central Garden & Pet Company, Enforcer Products, Inc., Kellogg Garden Products, Oldcastle Retail, Inc., Lebanon Seaboard Corporation, Reckitt Benckiser Group plc, FoxFarm Soil & Fertilizer Company, Nanolux Technology, Inc., Sun Gro Horticulture, Inc., Advanced Nutrients, Ltd. and Hydrofarm Holdings Group, Inc. In addition, we face competition from smaller regional competitors that operate in many of the areas where we compete.
In Canada, we face competition in the lawn and garden market from Premier Tech Ltd. and a variety of local companies including private label brands.
Research and Development
We continually invest in research and development, both in the laboratory and at the consumer level, to improve our products, manufacturing processes, packaging and delivery systems. Spending on research and development was $45.4 million, $39.7 million and $39.6 million in fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, respectively, including product registration costs of $12.3 million, $11.0 million and $11.0 million, respectively. In addition to the benefits of our own research and development, we actively seek ways to leverage the research and development activities of our suppliers and other business partners.
Regulatory Considerations
National, state and local laws and regulations affect the manufacture, sale, distribution, use and/or application of our products in several ways. For example, in the United States, all pesticide products must comply with the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (“FIFRA”), and most pesticide products require registration with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “U.S. EPA”) and similar state agencies before they can be sold or distributed. In addition, the use of certain pesticide products is regulated by various local, state and federal environmental and/or public health agencies. These regulations may include requirements that only certified or professional users apply the product, that certain products be used only on certain types of locations (such as “not for use on sod farms or golf courses”), may require users to post notices on properties to which products have been or will be applied, may require notification to individuals in the vicinity that products will be applied in the future, or may ban the use of certain ingredients or categories of products altogether. Analogous regulatory regimes apply to certain pesticides that we sell or distribute in other countries.
Fertilizer and growing media products are also subject to state and foreign regulations, as well, some of which require registration, mandate labeling requirements, and/or govern the sale and distribution of the products. Our grass seed products are regulated in the U.S. by the Federal Seed Act and various state regulations. In addition, federal, state and foreign agencies regulate the disposal, transport, handling and storage of waste, the remediation of contaminated sites, air and water discharges from our facilities, and workplace health and safety.
State, federal and foreign authorities generally require growing media facilities to obtain permits (sometimes on an annual basis) relating to site-specific conditions and/or activities. For example, permits must be obtained in order to harvest peat and 
to discharge storm water run-off or water pumped from peat deposits. The permits typically specify the condition in which the property must be left after the peat is fully harvested, with the residual use typically being natural wetland habitats combined with open water areas. We are generally required by these permits to limit our harvesting and to restore the property consistent with the intended residual use. In some locations, these facilities have been required to create water retention ponds to control the sediment content of discharged water.
In addition, on October 18, 2021, the Biden Administration announced a multi-agency plan to address per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (“PFAS”) contamination nationwide. Agencies, including the U.S. EPA, the Department of Defense, the Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Health and Human Services, will take actions to prevent the release of PFAS into the air, drinking systems, and food supply and to expand cleanup efforts to remediate the impacts of PFAS pollution. As part of this announcement, the U.S. EPA released its PFAS Strategic Roadmap: EPA’s Commitments to Action 2021-2024, which sets timelines by which the U.S. EPA plans to take specific actions during the first term of the Biden Administration. It is possible that some of these actions may have an impact – direct or indirect – on our business.
The growth and expansion of our business has expanded the regulatory oversight to which we are subject. As we enters new product categories and/or new jurisdictions, we expect there will be additional applicable federal, state and foreign regulatory considerations. 
For more information regarding how compliance with local, state, federal and foreign laws and regulations may affect us, see “ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS — Risks Related to Regulation of Our Company — Compliance with environmental and other public health regulations or changes in such regulations or regulatory enforcement priorities could increase our costs of doing business or limit our ability to market all of our products” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Regulatory Matters
We are subject to various environmental proceedings, the majority of which are for site remediation. At September 30, 2021, $3.6 million was accrued for such environmental matters. During fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, we expensed $0.5 million, $0.5 million and $1.4 million, respectively, for such environmental matters. We had no material capital expenditures during the last three fiscal years related to environmental or regulatory matters.
Human Capital
We believe our culture and commitment to our associates provides unique value to us and our shareholders. Every associate, and every job, is important to our success and helping us achieve our purpose. We seek to create an environment that values the health, safety and wellness of our teams, and we work to equip them with the knowledge and skills to serve our business and develop in their careers.
This discussion includes information regarding human capital matters that we believe may be of interest to shareholders generally. We recognize that certain other stakeholders (such as customers, employees and non-governmental organizations), as well as certain of our shareholders, may be interested in more detailed information on these topics. We encourage you to review the “People” section of our 2021 Corporate Responsibility Report, located in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.scottsmiraclegro.com, for more detailed information regarding our human capital programs and initiatives.
Associates
As of September 30, 2021, we employed approximately 7,300 employees worldwide. During peak sales and production periods in fiscal 2021, our personnel (all approximate) numbered 8,800, comprised of 7,400 associates including seasonal associates, with the remaining 1,400 consisting of temporary labor. During fiscal 2021, we employed a total of 2,400 full-time and seasonal in-store associates within the United States to help our retail partners merchandise their lawn and garden departments directly to consumers of our products.
Engagement
We utilize engagement surveys to develop action plans, invite external thought leaders to speak on topics of importance and provide forums for associates to dialogue with leadership and develop together. In addition, our leadership team also holds regular town hall meetings to share and receive information with our associates.
Employee Resource Groups
Our Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”) are voluntary, associate-led groups usually formed by people with a common affinity such as gender, race, national origin, sexual orientation, military status or other attributes. Each ERG establishes a mission to positively impact the business. ERGs are open to any associate regardless of race, national origin or other demographics. Our ERGs consist of the Scotts Women’s Network, the Scotts Black Employees Network, the Scotts Veterans Network, the Scotts Young Professionals, Scotts GroPride, Scotts Associates for a Greener Earth and Scotts Family Tree.
Diversity 
We foster a safe, healthy and inclusive workplace culture that permits all associates to thrive. This means cultivating a diverse and inclusive workplace that reflects the communities where we operate. We value our associates’ diversity from gender, race, national origin and sexual orientation to thoughts, interests, languages and beliefs. We encourage associates to leverage their varied life experiences to build a strong organization.
Training and Professional Development
Training is an integral part of developing and retaining our associates and creating a culture of leadership within the Company. As part of our standard onboarding program, associates take more than 10 hours of training covering our commitment to leadership, ethics and our values. We also train all of our associates on important environmental health and safety topics to help ensure we protect our people and our environment as we operate our business. Associates are encouraged to participate in a variety of Company provided learning resources including: online business skills courses; onsite classroom events; professional development events; external training programs based on individual needs; business-led enterprise leader learning events; and a tuition assistance program.
Compensation and Benefits
Our commitment to our associates starts with benefit and compensation programs that value the contributions our associates make and offers physical, financial and personal health programs to associates and their families. We recognize financial stability is a critical component to our associates’ well-being. In addition to competitive pay, we offer a generous 401(k) match and other performance-based financial programs for our associates who are not incentive-eligible. Our physical health programs, like our medical and dental coverage, help our associates to feel their best on the job and at home. Associates and their families at our Marysville, Ohio location can utilize our wellness center and we reimburse fitness club memberships for associates at other locations. A newly launched cancer support program provides associates and their families access to resources to help them through the cancer experience as a patient or caregiver.
Specific examples of our commitment to our associates include:
•Our decision to allocate a percentage of the savings from the 2019 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to associates by increasing our 401(k) company match. Our 401(k) participation rate at the end of fiscal 2021 was 91% for our full-time non-seasonal associates. 
•We established an annual 401(k) profit-sharing matching program whereby if we reach or exceed profitability targets in a given year, certain U.S. associates not eligible for annual bonuses may receive a 401(k) profit-sharing matching contribution early the following year.
•We make ownership of Company stock a reality for as many of our associates as possible through our Discounted Stock Purchase Program (“DSPP”). The DSPP provides a unique opportunity for our associates to buy our Common Shares at a 15% discount.
Health and Safety
We have several health and safety programs in place to help protect our associates. Our Environmental Health and Safety (“EHS”) management system is one tool that we use to promote the health and safety of our employees. We have a behavioral based safety program where our associates can submit concerns over unsafe conditions or share feedback when they observe unsafe work behaviors. We are focused on tracking and improving the industrial hygiene at our plants. This includes identifying opportunities to reduce workplace hazards and potential exposures in the work environment per Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) standards. 
For example, our Centennial plant in Vancouver, Washington, which opened in 2018, provides a cool, well-ventilated working environment filled with natural light that associates report contributes positively to their well-being. We are embarking on a multi-year capital improvement project at our largest manufacturing facility in Marysville, Ohio, where the upgrades will support our growth while also enhancing the health and safety of our frontline associates.
Information Systems
We understand the critical nature of measurable data and insights from a human capital perspective. We leverage a cloud-based human capital management software solution that unifies our wide range of human relations functionality onto one single platform. This allows support for the entire enterprise with qualitative and quantitative analytics specific to associate transactions, processes and programs, thereby creating a culture where data and analytics are the norm.
Environmental, Social and Governance
All of our stakeholders are essential to our business – shareholders, customers, suppliers, employees, communities as well as the environment and society. We are working to make our workforce more inclusive, our business more sustainable, and our communities more engaged by maintaining strong environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) practices.
In fiscal 2021, we demonstrated our ongoing ESG commitment by publishing our 10th Corporate Responsibility Report, prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards: Core option. This report provides detailed information regarding our ESG strategy, focus areas and governance structure. The Company’s ESG focus areas are Product Stewardship and Safety, Operations and Supply Chain, Associate Engagement and Wellness, Community Engagement and Governance and Transparency. The Company is developing a regime for benchmarking, goal setting and continuous improvement around these focus areas.
In addition, we published several ESG-related policies and statements on our corporate website, which can be found at https://scottsmiraclegro.com/environmental-social-and-governance. These policies and statements address environmental, health and safety and human rights concerns. Further ESG initiatives in fiscal 2021 included responding to the Carbon Disclosure Project’s climate questionnaire, completing the S&P Corporate Sustainability Assessment and participation in the Human Rights Campaign’s Corporate Equality Index annual benchmarking survey.
