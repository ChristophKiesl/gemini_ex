DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Assure is focused on providing surgeons, with a comprehensive suite of Intraoperative Neurophysiological monitoring or “IONM” services. IONM has been well established as a standard of care for over 20 years as a risk mitigation tool during invasive surgeries such as neurosurgeries, spinal procedures, ear, nose and throat surgeries, and vascular surgeries and other surgical procures that place the nervous system at risk.
We train and employ an intraoperative neurophysiologic (“INP”) staff that are on site in the operating room during each procedure and monitors the surgical procedure using state of the art, commercially available, diagnostic medical equipment. Our Interoperative Neurophysiologists are certified by ABRET, an internationally recognized third-party credentialing agency. We provide two types of services during each procedure, neurophysiological and professional IONM. Our in-house Interoperative Neurophysiologist staff provide Technical Services. The Professional IONM component of our business is operated through Managed Service Agreements with PEs. These PEs are contracted with neurologists/readers to provide IONM coverage in a telehealth capacity as a level of redundancy and risk mitigation in addition to the onsite Technical Services. All IONM procedures include both Professional services (neurologist) and Technical services (intraoperative monitoring). The success of our service depends upon the timely and successful interpretation of the data signals by our Interoperative Neurophysiologist and the reader, and the ability of the professional team to quickly determine if there is a deficit and the surgical intervention required to positively impact the patient and surgery. Collectively, the Technical and Professional IONM services provide a turnkey platform to help make surgeries safer. Our goal is to establish Assure as the premier provider of IONM services by offering a value-added platform that handles every component from scheduling, case coverage, patient advocacy, education, research and billing and collections. Our strategy focuses on utilizing best of class personnel and partners to deliver outcomes that are beneficial to all stakeholders including patients, surgeons, hospitals, insurers, and shareholders.
We primarily engage in the neuromonitoring of neurosurgeries, spinal procedures and vascular surgeries. The expansion into additional surgical verticals is part of our growth strategy. By applying our neuromonitoring platform to additional 

9



surgical verticals such as ear nose and throat, orthopedic and others, the addressable market for our service can be greatly expanded. We currently have operations in Louisiana, Michigan, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Texas, Colorado, and South Carolina. Our continued geographic expansion initiatives coupled with the surgical vertical expansion efforts and selective acquisitions are expected to generate substantial growth opportunities going forward. Our intention is to grow our operations by developing additional Managed Services Agreement relationships and directly contracting with hospitals and surgery centers for services. In the future, it may be necessary for us to raise additional funds for the continuing development of our business plan.
Our Services
Assure offers a turnkey full suite of IONM services from scheduling of the INP and supervising practitioner, real time monitoring and subsequent billing for the services. Assure strives to pair a Surgeon with a team of INPs in order to promote a level of familiarity, comfort and efficiency between the Surgeon and the INP. Assure core business provides IONM services for approximately 131 surgeons in 66 hospitals and surgery centers (which we refer to as “Procedure Facilities”) located in: Colorado, Texas, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, Michigan, South Carolina and Arizona.
Prior to the IONM procedure, Assure Neuromonitoring will coordinate with the Surgeon’s office to obtain the necessary information and documentation to provide IONM services, such as the patients’ insurance information, patients’ demographic information and office/clinic notes. Assure Neuromonitoring provides educational materials to the Surgeons office for inclusion in each surgical patient’s pre-operative packets, in order to educate and provide comfort to the patient about IONM services. Prior to the surgery, an Assure Patient Advocate Professional connects with the patient to explain our role during the surgery, the benefits of IONM and billing issues that may affect the patient. Assure’s INP will arrive at the hospital with an IONM unit and disposable supplies and electrodes. The INP will meet with the patient to explain their role during the surgery, discuss the patients pertinent past medical history, explain the risks and benefits associated with IONM and have the patient sign consenting forms for IONM to be utilized on their procedure.
During the surgery, the INP will continuously monitor the functional integrity of the peripheral or central nervous system by recording, troubleshooting, documenting and communicating activity arising from the brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerves, somatosensory or motor nerve systems using the IONM Unit provided by us and communicating results in real-time to the surgeon. Following the procedure, assuming the patient has health care insurance under a commercial health care policy, we will invoice the insurance company directly for Interoperative Neurophysiologist services. The invoice provided to the insurance company will detail each modality monitored by the INP for the neural protection of the patient during the procedure. After we have submitted the claim to the private insurance company, our Patient Advocate Professional will contact the patient to further explain the details on the explanation of benefits insurance form and to ensure the patient was satisfied with the level of service provided by us. In the event a patient is uninsured, or has insurance coverage under a government health care policy (Medicare, Medicaid, Tricare or Veterans Administration) the facility where the procedure took place will be billed for the IONM services for the patient, as agreed to in each facility service contract. 
Our current suite of services includes supporting predominately neurosurgeries, spinal surgeries nationally, as well as vascular surgeries and ENT surgeries in a more regional basis. Through organic growth and anticipated business acquisitions, we plan to expand our suite of services to include orthopedic, genitourinary, ENT and vascular surgeries nationally. We plan to expand in additional procedural verticals to further diversify the suite of services it provides to our surgeon and hospital partners. We will also be participating in clinical research opportunities, furthering the field of IONM and standing out as an industry leader.
Assure Interoperative Neurophysiologists
Assure currently employs 62 specialized IONM INPs that are board certified CNIM or board eligible CNIM by ABRET. ABRET seeks to encourage, establish and maintain standards of clinical EEG, Evoked Potential Technology, and Neurophysiologic Intraoperative and long-term monitoring, by offering credentialing exams to evaluate the skills and knowledge of technologists, and by supporting lab accreditation. 

10



Assure has developed an Intraoperative Neurophysiologist Fellowship program. This Fellowship program will train new INPs from start to board certification, allowing for consistently high caliber well trained professional INPs for placement into emerging and growing markets. Training and developing our own talent pool allow for more flexible scalability.
Hospital Agreements
Assure Neuromonitoring must enter into a contracted services agreement with each Procedure Facility it provides IONM services prior to initiating IONM services. The purpose of these agreements is to ensure that Assure Neuromonitoring provide all of its services in accordance with all regulatory and accreditation standards, including those requirements imposed by the Joint Commission, the CMS and all applicable federal, state and local laws. 
Pursuant to these agreements, Assure Neuromonitoring has agreed to provide IONM services and shall ensure the real-time interpretation of such monitoring to patients. 
Each INP is required to be approved and decreed privileges to practice IONM by each of the contracted facilities. All INP who are performing onsite monitoring must be certified or board eligible from one of the following organizations (i) American Board of Neurophysiologic Monitoring; (ii) American Board of Electrodiagnostic Technologists; or (iii) ABRET.
Our Patients
We service patients across multiple verticals (spine, neurosurgery, orthopedic, vascular, ear, nose, and throat) and geographic areas (primarily Texas, Colorado and Louisiana). Over half our patients commonly have commercial health insurance coverage (“Commercial Payor”) and we are compensated via their health insurance plan. The remainder of our patients, who do not have insurance coverage, compensate us via hospital agreements. Regardless of type of payment and whether the patient has insurance coverage, Assure provides the same high level of service and quality of care. The majority of our Commercial Payors are billed out of network and we negotiate payment for each claim. The remainder of Commercial Payors utilize a contracted rate. The majority of contracted rates are via indirect agreements with third-party organizations or related entities of the Commercial Payor with a smaller portion in direct agreements with contracted rates.
Privacy
Assure is committed to protecting the privacy of its patients by safeguarding all medical information in compliance with the HIPAA. Assure’s processes are also fully compliant with the Health Information Technology for Economics and Clinical Health Act (Hitech).

IONM MARKET IN THE UNITED STATES
Overview
Allied Market Research reported that the overall intraoperative neuromonitoring market in the US is expected to post a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR’’) of 6.6% by 2022 and generate $1.94 billion of revenue. The outsourced component of the IONM market in the US is expected to post a CAGR of 10.6% and reach $1.07 billion of revenue by 2022.
A key factor driving the growth of the market is the increasing number of surgeries for which IONM is required. IONM has been well established as a standard of care for over 20 years as a risk mitigation tool during invasive surgeries such as 

11



neurosurgery, spine, ear, nose, and throat, cardiovascular, and other surgical procures that place the nervous system at risk. Advances in technology and the growth of the geriatric population in the US are other factors increasing the number of spinal, musculoskeletal, and cardiovascular surgeries, which in turn is expected to drive market growth. Renowned medical institutions such as the Mayo Clinic are advocating greater adoption of IONM including requiring medical professionals to complete comprehensive neurophysiology training courses and hosting international IONM conferences.
Market Landscape
The IONM market is bifurcated into insourced and outsourced monitoring. The end user segment is categorized into hospital and ambulatory surgical centers. IONM finds its application in spinal surgery, neurosurgery, vascular surgery, ENT surgery, orthopedic surgery, and other surgeries related to the central or peripheral nervous system. IONM modalities include motor evoked potential, somatosensory evoked potential, electroencephalography, electromyography, brainstem auditory evoked potential, and visual evoked potential.
There has been a substantial increase in the use of IONM devices by hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers during complex surgeries. Moreover, the market is moving toward outsourced monitoring to provide advanced treatment options for patients suffering from chronic diseases.
With no dominant players in the industry, the intraoperative neuromonitoring market in the US is highly fragmented. Providers can generally be categorized into three groups: 1) Intraoperative neuromonitoring composed of hundreds of local and regional providers, including Assure, Medsurant, and National Neuro 2) In-sourced providers such as hospitals and 3) Bundled product companies offering neuromonitoring as part of a broader suite of services including Specialty Care and NuVasive. These bundled product companies are believed to be the largest IONM providers in the US, although each is estimated to individually comprise less than 10% of the overall US IONM market.
Market Size and Forecast
The combined US outsourced and insourced IONM market generated $1.24 billion in 2015 and is projected to reach $1.94 billion by 2022, growing at a CAGR of 6.6% from 2016 to 2022.
Market Segmentation by Application
Current market breakdown as relating to the current IONM utilization by procedure classification is approximately:

● | 73% Spinal Surgery
--+-------------------


● | 12% Neurosurgery
--+-----------------


● | 10% Vascular Surgery
--+---------------------


● | 5% ENT, Orthopedic and Other
--+-----------------------------

Surgical neurophysiology keeps on progressing, with the improvement of new applications such as brainstem mapping, spinal cord mapping, and proving the utilization of IONM in surgeries where the nervous system is not at primary risk but a secondary risk of the surgery (such as reducing post-operative deficits caused by malposition).
IONM utilization is also highly regional, with the eastern portions of the United States having higher utilization of IONM as compared to the central and western portions of the country, especially for orthopedic and vascular Surgery verticals. This regional nature is partly to do with the regional medico-legal issues but also the training of the surgeons. If surgeons train with effective IONM they are more likely to continue to use it in their practice in comparison to surgeons who either were not exposed to IONM or who were exposed to ineffective IONM. Assure currently capitalizes on a key relationship in supporting and working with a neurosurgery residency program.

12



There are large opportunities that Assure is working to capitalize on with respect to growing the use of IONM monitoring in the underutilized verticals. Assure aims to capture this market by investing in research, correlating improved outcomes in procedures that are not traditionally monitored or where IONM is underutilized. There are also many surgical disciplines that have not been explored with respect to if IONM could be function saving to the patient.
Drivers of the IONM Market
The US IONM market is expected to expand, driven by growth in procedures related to an aging population, increase in prevalence of chronic disorders, adoption of IONM in new surgeries, and increased interest in risk mitigation.
High volume of surgeries
Physicians use IONM during many surgeries. IONM is vital in obtaining real-time status of the nervous system. An increase in the volume of neurosurgeries, spinal surgeries, and orthopedic surgeries has fueled the demand for IONM services.
Advances in technology
With the improvement in healthcare facilities and advances in technology, vendors are developing innovative and efficient IONM devices. Companies such as Medtronic, Cadwell and Natus Medical extensively invest in R&D to develop advanced IONM devices.
Service providers such as SpecialtyCare, Neuro Alert, and Sentient Medical Systems offer advanced IONM services for various surgeries including neurosurgeries and ENT, cardiovascular, orthopedic, and spinal surgeries. These companies provide IONM devices such as EEG systems for real time monitoring of the nervous system. Advanced IONM devices help physicians to monitor and record complex patterns of neural activities.
Focus on patient safety
Surgeons use IONM as an additional line of safety during surgeries. IONM systems are used to monitor the nervous system and alert the surgeons prior to the threshold for injury. The IONM systems play a vital role during critical surgeries such as spinal surgeries that involve the insertion of instruments near the nerves or the spinal area and may cause damage to the nervous system. IONM also helps surgeons avoid or minimize common complications such as paraparesis, quadriplegia, and paraplegia that occur during surgeries.
Some of the reasons for the rising popularity of IONM are:

● | Safety: IONM helps decrease the risk of surgeries by about 90%. IONM systems are also widely accepted, as they are devices approved by the FDA.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Medico-legal obligations: End-users and hospitals use IONM systems to reduce medico- legal lawsuits from people that have undergone surgeries.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Growth in surgeries: Rising volume of technically demanding surgeries increases the need for advanced IONM tools.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Market Challenges
Cost of surgery with IONM
The cost of surgeries with IONM is more than those without IONM. Surgeries with IONM involve the expenses on IONM devices, intraoperative neurophysiologists, supervising practitioners, and disposable materials. The cost of surgeries 

13



restricts the adoption of IONM. Though IONM systems play a crucial role in invasive surgeries such as spinal, neurological and cardiovascular surgeries, it has not been proven to be a cost effective therapy in all procedures.
Limited interoperative neurophysiologists
Though the number of surgeries that need IONM is increasing rapidly in the US, only a limited number of interoperative neurophysiologists with expertise in IONM are available. Industry studies estimate that approximately 5,000 board certified interoperative neurophysiologists are currently working in the United States. Interoperative neurophysiologists with high levels of expertise are required to effectively use IONM devices to record data and diagnose patient alerts. There is also the risk of false recordings due to physiological artifacts arising from other sites. Only highly skilled interoperative neurophysiologists can perform IONM in hospitals, surgical centers, and neurophysiological laboratories and provide the greatest levels of service to the surgeons they support.
Competitive Environment
The market in the United States is highly fragmented, with the presence of national and local players. Large companies such as Specialty Care and NuVasive occupy the market along with medium- and small-sized vendors such as Accurate Neuromonitoring, Sentry Neuromonitoring and Neuromonitoring Associates.
Service providers including Assure collaborate with doctors and medical facilities to offer IONM service support and solutions.
Complications of IONM
Though the popularity of IONM is growing rapidly, there still risks and complications associated with IONM, as there is for any medical procedure.

● | Types of injuries induced by electrical current: Burns may occur at the contact of stimulating electrodes with tissue, when the current density is high. The leakage of high-frequency current through alternate pathways can also cause burns. As well as, high current flow can cause macro shock.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Use of needle electrodes: risk of infection at the electrode site.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Electrical cortical stimulation: Transcranial electrical cortical stimulation during MEP monitoring can cause tongue lacerations, oral injuries, and even mandibular fractures. These adverse effects occur due to forceful contraction of the biting muscles as a result of the stimulation. This risk is largely mitigated by appropriate use of bite blocks.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SEASONALITY
The surgical segment of the healthcare industry tends to be impacted by seasonality due to the nature of most benefit plans resetting on a calendar year basis. As patients utilize and reduce their remaining deductible throughout the year, we typically see an increase in volume throughout the year with the biggest impact coming in the fourth quarter. Historically, our annual revenues are overweighted in the fourth quarter.
COMPETITION
The industry in which we operate is highly competitive. We face significant competition from other healthcare providers for patients, physicians, nurses and technical staff. Some of our competitors are larger and have longstanding and well-established relationships with physicians and third-party payors in the community. We also compete with other healthcare providers in our efforts to hire and retain experienced professionals. As a result, we may have difficulty attracting or retaining key personnel or securing technical resources.

14



We compete with other IONM service providers for patients, surgeons, neurologist, and INPs. Some of our competitors have longstanding and well-established relationships with physicians and third-party payors in the community. Some of our competitors are hospitals that provide IONM services for surgeries occurring within their hospital facilities. Some of our competitors are also significantly larger than us, may have access to greater marketing, financial and other resources and may be better known in the general community. As a result of these factors, the Company may not be able to compete effectively against current and future competitors. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
We are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations. Government regulation affects our business by controlling our growth, requiring licensure and certification for our facilities and the physicians and other healthcare personnel who provide services in our facilities and regulating the use of our properties.
Licensure and Accreditation
The healthcare facilities and our partner professionals are subject to professional and private licensing, certification and accreditation requirements. These include, but are not limited to, requirements imposed by Medicare, Medicaid, state licensing authorities, voluntary accrediting organizations and third-party private payors. Receipt and renewal of such licenses, certifications and accreditations are often based on inspections, surveys, audits, investigations or other reviews, some of which may require affirmative compliance actions by us that could be burdensome and expensive. The applicable standards may change in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain all necessary licenses or certifications in good standing or that they will not be required to incur substantial costs in doing so. The failure to maintain all necessary licenses, certifications and accreditations in good standing, or the expenditure of substantial funds to maintain them, could have an adverse effect on our business.
Anti-Kickback Statutes
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration to induce the referral of a patient or the purchase, lease or order (or the arranging for or recommending of the purchase, lease or order) of healthcare items or services paid for by federal healthcare programs, including Medicare or Medicaid. A violation does not require proof that a person had actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate the statute, and court decisions under the Anti- Kickback Statute have consistently held that the law is violated where one purpose of a payment is to induce or reward referrals. Violation of the federal anti-kickback statute could result in felony conviction, administrative penalties, liability (including penalties) under the False Claims Act and/or exclusion from federal healthcare programs.
A number of states have enacted anti-kickback laws (including so-called “fee splitting” laws) that sometimes apply not only to state-sponsored healthcare programs but also to items or services that are paid for by private insurance and self-pay patients. State anti-kickback laws can vary considerably in their applicability and scope and sometimes have fewer statutory and regulatory exceptions than does the federal law.
Our management carefully considers the importance of anti-kickback laws when structuring company operations. That said, we cannot assure that the applicable regulatory authorities will not determine that some of our arrangements with physicians violate the Anti-Kickback Statute or other applicable laws. An adverse determination could subject us to different liabilities, including criminal penalties, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid or other health care programs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Physician Self-Referral (“Stark”) Laws
The federal Stark Law, 42 U.S.C. 1395nn, also known as the physician self-referral law, generally prohibits a physician from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to an entity (including hospitals) providing “designated health services,” if the physician has a “financial relationship” with the entity, unless an exception applies. Designated health services include, among other services, inpatient hospital services, outpatient prescription drug services, clinical laboratory 

15



services, certain diagnostic imaging services, and other services that our affiliated physicians may order for their patients. The prohibition applies regardless of the reasons for the financial relationship, unless an exception applies. The exceptions to the federal Stark Law are numerous and often complex. The penalties for violating the Stark Law include civil penalties of up to $15 thousand for each violation and potential liability (including penalties) under the False Claims Act.
Some states have enacted statutes and regulations concerning physician self-referrals (i.e., referrals by physicians to health care entities with whom the physician has a financial relationship). Such physician self- referrals laws may apply to the referral of patients regardless of payor source and/or type of health care service. These state laws may contain statutory and regulatory exceptions that are different from those of the federal law and that may vary from state to state.
Our management carefully considers the importance of physician self-referral laws when structuring company operations. That said, we cannot assure that the applicable regulatory authorities will not determine that some of our arrangements with physicians violate the Federal Stark Law or other applicable laws. An adverse determination could subject us to different liabilities, including criminal penalties, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid or other health care programs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
False Claims Act
The federal False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. § 3729, imposes civil penalties for knowingly submitting or causing the submission of a false or fraudulent claim for payment from a government-sponsored program, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Violations of the False Claims Act present civil liability of treble damages plus a penalty of at least $11,181 per false claim. The False Claims Act has “whistleblower” or “qui tam” provisions that allow individuals to commence a civil action in the name of the government, and the whistleblower is entitled to share in any subsequent recovery (plus attorney’s fees). Many states also have enacted civil statutes that largely mirror the federal False Claims Act, but allow states to impose penalties in a state court.
The False Claims Act has been used by the federal government and private whistleblowers to bring enforcement actions under so-called “fraud and abuse” laws like the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the Stark Law. Such actions are not based on a contention that claims for payment were factually false or inaccurate. Instead, such actions are based on the theory that accurate claims are deemed to be false/fraudulent if there has been noncompliance with some other material law or regulation. The existence of the False Claims Act, under which so-called qui tam plaintiffs can allege liability for a wide range of regulatory noncompliance, increases the potential for such actions to be brought and has increased the potential financial exposure for such actions. These actions are costly and time-consuming to defend.
Our management carefully considers the importance of compliance with all applicable laws and when structuring company operations. Our management is aware of and actively works to minimize risk related to potential qui tam plaintiffs. That said, we cannot assure that the applicable enforcement authorities or qui tam plaintiffs will not allege violations of the False Claims Act or analogous state false claims laws. A finding of liability under the False Claims Act could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Health Information Privacy and Data Security
The privacy and data security regulations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), as amended, contain detailed requirements concerning (1) the use and disclosure of individually identifiable patient health information (“PHI”); (2) computer and data security standards regarding the protection of electronic PHI including storage, utilization, access to and transmission; and (3) notification to individuals and the federal government in the event of a breach of unsecured PHI. HIPAA covered entities and business associates must implement certain administrative, physical, and technical security standards to protect the integrity, confidentiality and availability of certain electronic health information received, maintained, or transmitted. Violations of the HIPAA privacy and security rules may result in civil and criminal penalties, including a tiered system of civil money penalties that range from $100 to $50 thousand per violation, with a cap of $1.5 million per year for identical violations. In the event of a breach, a HIPAA covered entity must promptly notify affected individuals of a breach. All breaches must also be reported to the federal government. Where a breach affects more than 500 individuals, additional reporting obligations apply. In addition 

16



to federal enforcement, State attorneys general may bring civil actions on behalf of state residents for violations of the HIPAA privacy and security rules, obtain damages on behalf of state residents, and enjoin further violations. Many states also have laws that protect the privacy and security of confidential, personal information, which may be similar to or even more stringent than HIPAA. Some of these state laws may impose fines and penalties on violators and may afford private rights of action to individuals who believe their personal information has been misused. We expect increased federal and state privacy and security enforcement efforts.
Our management carefully considers the importance of compliance will patient privacy and data security regulations when structuring company operations. Our management is aware of and actively works to minimize risk related to patient privacy and data security. That said, we cannot assure that a breach will not occur or that the applicable enforcement authorities will not allege violations of HIPAA’s patient privacy and data security regulations. A breach or an allegation of noncompliance with HIPAA’s patient privacy and data security regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Administration Regulations
We are subject to federal, state and local regulations governing the storage, use and disposal of waste materials and products. Although we believe that our safety procedures for storing, handling and disposing of these materials and products comply with the standards prescribed by law and regulation, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from those hazardous materials. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any liability could exceed the limits or fall outside the coverage of our insurance coverage, which we may not be able to maintain on acceptable terms, or at all. We could incur significant costs and attention of our management could be diverted to comply with current or future environmental laws and regulations. Federal regulations promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration impose additional requirements on us, including those protecting employees from exposure to elements such as blood-borne pathogens. We cannot predict the frequency of compliance, monitoring, or enforcement actions to which we may be subject as those regulations are being implemented, which could adversely affect our operations.
Other Federal and State Healthcare Laws
We are also subject to other federal and state healthcare laws that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. The Health Care Fraud Statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1347, prohibits any person from knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, which can be either a government or private payor plan. Violation of this statute, even in the absence of actual knowledge of or specific intent to violate the statute, may be charged as a felony offense and may result in fines, imprisonment, or both. The Health Care False Statement Statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1035, prohibits, in any matter involving a federal health care program, anyone from knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up, by any trick, scheme or device, a material fact, or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any materially false writing or document knowing that it contains a materially false or fraudulent statement. A violation of this statute may be charged as a felony offense and may result in fines, imprisonment or both. Under the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, a person (including an organization) is prohibited from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented to any United States officer, employee, agent, or department, or any state agency, a claim for payment for medical or other items or services where the person knows or should know (a) the items or services were not provided as described in the coding of the claim, (b) the claim is a false or fraudulent claim, (c) the claim is for a service furnished by an unlicensed physician, (d) the claim is for medical or other items or service furnished by a person or an entity that is in a period of exclusion from the program, or (e) the items or services are medically unnecessary items or services. Violations of the law may result in penalties of up to $10 thousand per claim, treble damages, and exclusion from federal healthcare programs. The Civil Monetary Penalties Law also prohibits a person from transferring any remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services.
States have a wide variety of health care laws and regulations that potentially affect our operations and the operations of our partners. Many states have implemented laws and regulations related to so-called “tele- health,” which govern the use of technology to provide health care services, including allowing patients and providers to be in different geographic 

17



locations. Tele-health laws may apply to our operations, and the obligations they impose, vary wildly and are in a state of flux. Some states have so-called corporate practice of medicine prohibitions, which govern how physicians are organized to practice medicine (including corporate structure, employment and management). Such prohibitions are used to indirectly regulate ownership of heath care companies and/or management companies and the obligations they impose vary. Some states have “surprise billing” or out-of-network billing laws that impose a variety of obligations on health care providers and health plans. The failure to comply with all state regulatory obligations could be used by health plans to deny payment or to recoup funds, and any noncompliance could subject us to penalties or limitations that could have an adverse effect on our business. The obligations under “surprise billing” laws vary wildly, and many states are actively considering additional legislation and/or regulation in this area creating a state of flux in the law.
Many states have adopted a form of anti-kickback law, self-referral prohibition, and false claims and insurance fraud prohibition. The scope of these laws and the interpretations of them vary from state to state and are enforced by state courts and regulatory authorities, each with broad discretion. Generally, state laws reach to all healthcare services and not just those covered under a governmental healthcare program. From time to time, private health plans attempt to use such laws as a basis to deny claims or recoup payments previously made to health care providers.
A determination of liability under any of the laws above could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to operate in these states. We cannot assure that our arrangements or business practices will not be subject to government scrutiny or be found to violate applicable laws.
Other Regulations
In addition to the regulatory initiatives described above, healthcare facilities, including our partner facilities, are subject to a wide variety of federal, state, and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations that may affect their operations, facilities, and properties. Violations of these laws could subject us to civil penalties and fines for not investigating and remedying any contamination by hazardous substances, as well as other liability from third parties.

RECENT CORPORATE DEVELOPMENTS
2020 Capital Raising Transactions
We have financed our cash requirements primarily from revenues generated from its services, by utilizing a bank promissory note and line of credit, a loan under the Paycheck Protection Program, from the issuances of convertible debentures, and from the sale of common stock. 
Convertible Debt Financings
On November 22, 2019, we launched a non-brokered private placement of convertible debenture units. Each convertible debenture unit was offered at a price of $1,000 and consisted of one convertible debenture with a face value of $1,000, convertible into common stock at a conversion price of $1.40 per share for a period of four years, and 357 common share purchase warrants, each warrant exercisable by the holder to acquire one share of common stock at a price of $1.90 per share for a period of three years. The convertible debenture units carry a 9% annual coupon rate. 
On December 13, 2019, we closed on the first tranche for gross proceeds of $965 thousand. In connection with the closing, we issued convertible debentures with a face value of $965 thousand and 344,505 share purchase warrants. We paid finders a fee of $67 thousand and 48,250 warrants to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock at a price of $1.40 per share for three years. 
From January 2020 to April 2020, we closed on three separate tranches for total proceeds of $1.7 million. In connection with the closings, we issued convertible debentures with a face value of $1.7 million and 590,835 share purchase warrants. We paid finders a fee of $79 thousand and 56,299 warrants to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock at a price of $1.40 per share for three years. 
At the end of April 2020, we launched a separate non-brokered private placement of convertible debenture units. Each convertible debenture unit consisted of one convertible debenture with a face value of $1,000, convertible into shares of common stock at a conversion price of $0.67 for a period of four years and 1,000 common share purchase warrants exercisable by the holder to purchase shares of common stock at a price of $1.00 per share for a period of three years. The convertible debenture carries a 9% annual coupon rate. On May 21, 2020, we closed the offering for proceeds of $830 thousand and issued convertible debentures with a face value of $830 thousand and 830,000 share purchase warrants. We paid finders a fee of $23 thousand and 34,476 warrants exercisable to purchase shares of common stock at a price of $1.00 per share for four years. 
The net proceeds from these tranches of the Offering are being utilized for working capital purposes. 
Bank Loan Facility
Commencing in 2018, the Company utilized a line of credit provided by its bank to fund its operations. The line of credit provided up to $1.0 million of borrowings and bore interest at the one-month London Inter-bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) rate plus 3.5% and was originally expected to mature on March 25, 2019. 
During January 2019, the Company cancelled its existing line of credit and entered into a $2.0 million promissory note and a $1.0 million line of credit with its existing bank. The promissory note bore interest at 6% and required monthly principal and interest payment of $61 thousand through maturity in January 2022. During March 2020, the Company amended the line of credit to extend the maturity date from March 2020 to September 2020. The Company made monthly payments of $167 thousand from April 2020 through September 2020. The line of credit bore interest at an index rate that fluctuates with the one-month LIBOR rate plus 3.5%. The line of credit was secured by all the Company’s assets. 
In August 12, 2020, the Company entered into a new $4.0 million term loan and a $2.5 million operating line of credit (together, the “Loan Facility”) with Central Bank & Trust, a part of Farmers & Stockmens Bank (“Central Bank”). Under the conditions of the agreement governing the Loan Facility, the Term Loan bears interest at the Wall Street Journal prime rate (“WSJ”) plus 2.0% and matures on August 12, 2024. Commencing on August 1, 2021, principal payments in the amount of $308 thousand, together with interest, shall be made quarterly on the Term Loan until maturity. In addition, the 

19



operating line bears interest at a rate of WSJ plus 2.0% and matures on August 12, 2022. Commencing on September 1, 2020 and continuing on the first calendar day of each month until maturity, interest on the Operating Line is due. Assure did not issue any shares, warrants, or options in connection with this transaction. The Loan Facility is secured by a first-ranking security interest in all of the present and future undertakings, property and assets of Assure Holdings Corp. and its subsidiaries. 
A portion of the proceeds of the loan facility were used to pay off the existing outstanding bank indebtedness and the remaining indebtedness related to an acquisition and to fund working capital. 
On September 10, 2020, Central Bank advised the Company additional reserves recorded by us against its accounts receivable constituted a material adverse change in our assets, which thereby triggered an event of default under the loan agreement. We and Central Bank have entered a forbearance agreement and have renegotiated the terms of the Loan Agreement. Under the terms of our renegotiation, we received a commitment letter to increase our operating line to $4.5 million and to repay approximately $2 million under our term loan. 
SBA Paycheck Protection Program – April 2020
During April 2020, the Company received an unsecured loan under the United States Small Business Administration (“SBA”) Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) pursuant to the recently adopted Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “PPP Loan”) in the amount of $1.2 million. The two-year, SBA-administered PPP loan has an interest rate of 1.0% per annum, with principal and interest payments due on the first day of each month, with payments commencing on December 1, 2020. All or a portion of the PPP Loan may be forgiven if the Company maintains its employment and compensation within certain parameters following the loan origination date and the proceeds of the PPP Loan are spent on payroll costs, rent or lease agreements dated before February 15, 2020 and utility payments arising under service agreements dated before February 15, 2020. On November 20, 2020, the PPP Loan was fully discharged and forgiven. 
July 2020 Private Placement
On July 13, 2020, we issued 125,924 shares of common stock to two investors at $0.81 per share for gross proceeds of $120 thousand. The proceeds were used for general and administrative expense. The private placement was to two accredited investors and included the issuance of 62,962 warrants to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock at a price of $0.81 per share.
December 2020 Private Placement
On December 1, 2020, we entered into securities purchase agreements with the selling stockholders (the “Securities Purchase Agreements”) pursuant to which we sold and issued to the investors an aggregate of 16,357,703 units of the Company at an issue price of $0.64 per Unit, for gross proceeds of $10.5 million (the “December Private Placement”). Each unit consisted of one share of common stock and one common stock warrant, each exercisable to acquire one share of common stock at $0.78 per share for a period of five years from the date of issuance. Accordingly, we issued the Investors 16,357,703 shares of common stock and 16,357,703 common stock warrants in the December Private Placement. 
Pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreements, we entered into a registration rights agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”), requiring us to register the shares of common stock issued under the units and the shares of common stock acquirable upon exercise of the warrants for resale under the Securities Act. Under the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, we agreed (a) to file a registration statement on Form S-1 with the Commission within 30 days of the Closing Date to register the Common Shares and the Common Shares acquirable upon exercise of the Warrants (collectively, the “Registrable Securities”) for resale by the Investors; (b) to cause the Registration Statement to be declared effective by the Commission on or prior to the 90th day after the Closing Date or, if the Registration Statement is reviewed by the Commission, the 120th day after the Closing Date (or if the Registration Statement is not declared effective by the Commission on or before February 11, 2021, at the end of a sixty (60) day period thereafter); (c) to maintain the effectiveness of the Registration Statement; and (d) to satisfy the current public information requirement required by Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933 or any other rule or regulation of the Commission to permit the Investors to sell the Registrable Securities to the public without registration. We agreed to pay the Investors liquidated damages of 1% of the purchase price for each 30 day period in which we are in default of these obligations. On December 30, 2020, the 

20



Company filed a registration statement on Form S-1, in accordance with the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement. The registration statement was declared effective on February 12, 2021.
If the Common Shares acquirable upon exercise of the Warrants are not registered under the Registration Rights Agreement, the terms of the Warrants provide for a cashless exercise feature, under which the number of Common Shares to be issued will be based on the number of Common Shares for which Warrants are exercised multiplied by the difference between the five day VWAP of the Common Shares and the exercise price divided by the current market price at the time of the exercise. 
In addition, officers and directors and holders of 5% or more of our outstanding shares of common stock to entered into Lock-Up Agreements pursuant to which they agreed that they will not, without the prior written consent, during the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the date that is sixty (60) days after the date of our final Annual Report is first filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3) under the Securities Act with respect to the Registrable Securities, offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, grant any option to purchase or otherwise dispose of any of our securities; except in certain circumstances. 
Under the Securities Purchase Agreement, we agreed that (a) for a period of ninety (90) days after the closing date, without the consent of a majority of the Investors, neither we nor any of our subsidiaries would issue shares of common stock or common stock equivalents and (b) until the earlier of (i) two years after the closing date or (ii) such time as the Investors, collectively, beneficially own less than five percent (5%) of our common stock, we would not enter into an agreement to effect any “Variable Rate Transaction”. The term “Variable Rate Transaction” shall mean a transaction in which we issue or sell (i) any debt or equity securities that are convertible into, exchangeable or exercisable for, or include the right to receive additional shares of our common stock either (A) at a conversion, exercise or exchange rate or other price that is based upon and/or varies with the trading prices of or quotations for the shares of our common stock at any time after the initial issuance of such debt or equity securities, or (B) with a conversion, exercise or exchange price that is subject to being reset at some future date after the initial issuance of such debt or equity security or upon the occurrence of specified or contingent events directly or indirectly related to our business or the market for our common stock or (ii) enters into any agreement, including, but not limited to, an equity line of credit, whereby we may sell securities at a future determined price. In addition, we agreed to certain buy-in rights in favor of the Investors for failure to comply with timely delivery of share certificates within three business days if an Investor is required to cover settlement in connection with our failure.
In connection with the December Private Placement, we paid the Agent a cash commission representing approximately 8% (4% for the proceeds received from Investors who are directors, officers and employees of Assure) of the gross proceeds of the December Private Placement.
On December 30, 2020, we filed a resale registration statement on Form S-1 with the Securities Exchange Commission as required under the Registration Rights Agreement. On February 12, 2021, the registration statement was declared effective by the Securities Exchange Commission.
SBA Paycheck Protection Program – March 2021
During March 2021, the Company received an unsecured loan under the United States Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program in the amount of $1,664,770. Assure executed a PPP promissory note, which matures on February 25, 2026. The PPP Loan carries an interest rate of 1.0% per annum, with principal and interest payments due on the first day of each month, with payments commencing on the earlier of: (i) the day the amount of loan forgiveness granted to Assure is remitted by the SBA to the Bank of Oklahoma; and (ii) ten (10) months after the end of the twenty-four (24) week period following the grant of the Loan.
