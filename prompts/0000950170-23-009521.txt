Item 1. Business.
Overview
Eargo, Inc. (“Eargo,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is a medical device company dedicated to improving the quality of life of people with hearing loss. Our innovative products and go-to-market approach address the major challenges of traditional hearing aid adoption, including social stigma, accessibility and cost.
We believe Eargo hearing aids are the first ever virtually invisible, rechargeable, completely in-the-canal, FDA-regulated devices indicated to compensate for mild to moderate hearing loss.
We market and sell our hearing aids primarily in a direct-to-consumer format, with a personalized, consumer-centric approach. Our commercial organization consists of a marketing team with deep experience in consumer-focused brand and performance marketing, a team of inside sales consultants, and a dedicated customer support team. Our differentiated, consumer-first approach empowers consumers to take control of their hearing by improving accessibility, with personalized, high-quality remote customer support from our hearing professionals (with remote customer support continuing for as long as a customer owns their Eargo hearing aid).
In an industry that has, in our opinion, historically been associated with limited brand awareness, we have developed a sophisticated brand-building strategy focused on consumer empowerment. We have also developed a robust technology and data-driven marketing platform that utilizes business intelligence, key performance metrics, machine learning and other marketing data to reinforce our growing brand recognition and to identify demographics, behaviors and marketing channels most relevant to our target audience. Eargo’s sales consultants leverage our digital marketing platform, which utilizes data-driven insights to iterate our sales tactics and create promotional offers, each with the goal of driving lead generation and increasing inbound lead conversions. We also see opportunity in nurturing long-term relationships with our customers to drive repeat purchases and increase their lifetime value, an objective facilitated by our provision of unlimited remote access to Eargo’s hearing professionals for the life of a customer’s Eargo hearing aid.
We have also established a highly capable research and development organization with what we believe is a rare combination of expertise in mechanical engineering, product design, audio processing, clinical and hearing science, consumer electronics and embedded software design. In addition, we employ strategic intellectual property protection in certain key areas. Our technical capabilities and commitment to innovation have allowed us to deliver significant product enhancements on a rapid development timeline, exemplified by our launch of seven iterations of the Eargo hearing aid system since 2017.
We believe that our differentiated hearing aids and consumer-centric approach have driven our sales of over 109,000 Eargo hearing aid systems, net of returns, as of December 31, 2022. We believe there is a large, growing and underserved market of people suffering from hearing loss, which we estimate included approximately 45 million adults (or approximately one in six adults) in the United States in 2022, of whom only approximately 25% actually owned a hearing aid.
The Eargo Difference
We are passionate about helping people hear better and are on a mission to change the way the world thinks about hearing loss.
Since our inception, our founding principle has been to dramatically improve the consumer experience at every step of the hearing care journey. Our products, customer support and marketing messaging are a direct result of that passion. We believe our primarily direct-to-consumer and omni-channel models can shift the paradigm in the treatment of hearing loss for the ultimate benefit of consumers.
 Eargo hearing aids
Eargo hearing aids combine proprietary technology, engineering know-how and scientific and design expertise to offer high-quality performance in an in-the-canal form factor that makes them virtually invisible. We market a variety of models of hearing aids to provide customers with a range of cost and functionality options. Each generation of Eargo hearing aids has been improved with additional features, such as audio performance, enhanced physical fit and/or comfort and greater ease of use.
Our in-the-canal devices feature high-quality audio, are designed to provide up to 16 hours of battery life and feature Eargo’s proprietary soft and flexible medical-grade silicon tips. These silicon tips are removable, allowing for simple cleaning, and can be purchased separately in several sizes to accommodate individuals with different size ear canals. Eargo’s rechargeable hearing aids are designed for ease of use and maintenance while providing a comfortable fit for a majority of our target market. Additionally, several of our model devices are self-fitting as defined by the FDA. Eargo self-fitting hearing aids are adjusted by the user to meet the user’s hearing needs, without the need for pre-programming or a hearing test from a hearing care professional.

We expect to continue refining and improving Eargo hearing aids, and we have the intention of an approximate annual cadence of new product launches. To this end, we are working on the development of a cost-conscious offering as well as the next Eargo hearing aid model with improved functionality.
Our business model and customer journey
We sell our hearing aids primarily on a direct-to-consumer basis, engaging consumers through a mix of digital and traditional marketing as well as select commercial partnership, omni-channel (including retail) and other opportunities that are designed to appeal to prospective customers on a personal level and build our brand.
Eargo provides free educational resources as well as support from our team of sales consultants and hearing professionals, who help educate and guide prospective customers through addressing their hearing loss in a personalized and consultative experience.
While a hearing test is not necessary to purchase Eargo hearing aids, we offer an online, do-it-yourself hearing screening for prospective customers who are interested in learning more about their hearing. This screening is not intended to prevent, diagnose or treat hearing loss or any other disease or condition, but can assist customers in evaluating whether Eargo hearing aids may be right for them. Prospective customers can also utilize Eargo’s remote support system to receive guidance regarding matters such as use, charging and cleaning of Eargo hearing aids, and real-time audio setting modification for individualized hearing loss.
Customers are able to complete purchases over the phone with an Eargo sales consultant or directly on our website. The Eargo purchasing experience is designed to be simple and to improve the accessibility of hearing aids. In addition, we offer a general 45-day trial period.
Following the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) final rule regarding the creation of a new category of over-the-counter (“OTC”) hearing aids (the “OTC Final Rule”), we have focused efforts on transitioning to the new OTC framework and expanding our omni-channel approach, including exploring select additional commercial partnerships, retail, and other distribution opportunities. For example, we have a commercial arrangement with Victra, one of America’s largest wireless retailers, to facilitate access to our hearing screeners and demonstrate our devices at approximately 1,500 Victra store locations across the country; customers are also able to purchase or order Eargo hearing aids at such store locations. We believe that the OTC Final Rule may facilitate the opportunity to execute additional commercial partnerships, expanding our customers’ ability to learn about our hearing aids, obtain general information about their hearing through our current hearing screeners, and experience our devices in person prior to purchasing or ordering directly at retail locations.
 Moreover, following the effective date of the OTC Final Rule, we have partnered with certain resellers and other distributors, including benefits managers, to offer Eargo hearing aids for sale through their online storefronts or portals. Under these partnerships, we sell Eargo hearing aids to resellers at wholesale prices, who in turn offer our products to end-customers through their respective online storefronts or portals. Generally, we fulfill and ship orders placed through these online storefronts or portals directly to end-customers, and we generally do not submit insurance claims on behalf of customers who purchase from one of these authorized resellers, including Victra. We believe these partnerships will help expand consumer access to our hearing aids and allow us to target high-intent customers more efficiently. We continue to look for additional partners to help expand our customer base.
Between December 8, 2021 and September 15, 2022, we did not accept insurance as a direct method of payment to the Company (referred to as “direct plan access” and discussed below under “—Insurance-Related Business—Insurance-Related Business following DOJ settlement”) and instead focused sales of our products to customers we refer to as “cash-pay” or “self-pay” customers, which includes upfront payment, credit card, and third-party financing, as well as third-party distributor, authorized reseller, or partner payments. We partner with third-party financing providers to make our products more accessible, and payment types may also be combined. When purchased directly through us, the Eargo hearing aid system typically arrives on average approximately three business days after shipping.
Once a customer purchases Eargo hearing aids, whether directly through us or through one of our partners, distributors, or authorized resellers, they are assigned to one of our hearing professionals, who provides complimentary, convenient support by phone, chat or e-mail.
Once a customer receives their Eargo hearing aids, their assigned hearing professional will schedule a welcome call to assist with proper use, fit and setting modification of the Eargo device. Our hearing professionals and customer care team are also available to provide unlimited support for as long as the customer owns an Eargo device. Additionally, we provide short, online training videos and other resources that customers can access online. The combination of these services allows us to deliver remote customer support in an efficient and streamlined manner.
We believe our business model and consumer-centric focus offer certain advantages relative to traditional sales channels (which are characterized by a business-to-business model in which hearing aid manufacturers rely on a fragmented network of independent audiology clinics to sell their devices to consumers), including in particular the convenience and accessibility of our remote customer

support as well as our consumer-centric focus. We offer free online education, convenient consultation and remote customer support, the ability to easily purchase the Eargo system, and fast delivery.
Insurance-Related Business
 DOJ investigation and settlement and claims audits
As previously disclosed, on September 21, 2021, we were informed that we were the target of a criminal investigation by the DOJ related to insurance claims we submitted for reimbursement on behalf of our customers covered by various federal employee health plans under the FEHB program, which is administered by the Office of Personnel Management (the “OPM”). The investigation also pertained to our role in claim submissions to federal employee health plans (collectively, the “DOJ investigation”). Total payments the Company received from the government in relation to claims submitted under the FEHB program, as subject to the DOJ investigation, net of any product returns and associated refunds, were approximately $44.0 million. Also, as previously disclosed, the third-party payor with whom historically we had the largest volume, which is one of the carriers contracted with the OPM under the FEHB program (“largest third-party payor”), conducted an audit of insurance claims for reimbursement (“claims”) submitted by us (the “Primary Audit”), which included a review of medical records. We were informed by the third-party payor conducting the Primary Audit that the DOJ was the principal contact related to the subject matter of the Primary Audit. In addition to the Primary Audit, we have been subject to a number of other audits of claims submitted to additional third-party payors (collectively with the Primary Audit, the “claims audits”). One of these claims audits did not relate to claims submitted under the FEHB program. On January 4, 2022, the DOJ confirmed to us that the investigation had been referred to the Civil Division of the DOJ and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Texas and the criminal investigation was no longer active.
On April 29, 2022, we entered into a civil settlement agreement with the U.S. government that resolved the previously disclosed DOJ investigation related to our role in claim submissions to various federal employee health plans under the FEHB program. We cooperated fully with the DOJ investigation. We deny the allegations in the settlement agreement, and the settlement is not an admission of liability by us. The allegations did not pertain to the quality or performance of our product. The settlement agreement provided for our payment of approximately $34.4 million to the U.S. government and resolved allegations that we submitted or caused the submission of claims for payment to the FEHB program using unsupported hearing loss-related diagnostic codes. As discussed further in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, based on the settlement agreement with the U.S. government, we recorded a settlement liability of $34.4 million in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2021. The settlement amount was recorded as a reduction of revenue in the third quarter of 2021. On May 2, 2022, we paid the settlement amount.
The settlement with the U.S. government may not resolve all of the audits initiated by various third-party payors, and additionally we remain subject to a prepayment review of claims by the payor who conducted the Primary Audit.
From the time we learned of the DOJ investigation and until December 8, 2021, we continued to process orders for customers with potential insurance benefits (including FEHB program members) but suspended all claims submission activities and offered affected customers (i.e., customers using insurance benefits as a method of direct payment for transactions prior to December 8, 2021) the option to return their hearing aids or purchase their hearing aids without the use of their insurance benefits in case their claim was denied or ultimately not submitted by us to their insurance plan for payment (the “extended right of return”).
From December 8, 2021 until September 15, 2022, we did not accept insurance benefits as a method of direct payment. We determined that customer transactions using insurance benefits as a method of direct payment occurring between September 21, 2021 (when we learned of the DOJ investigation) and December 8, 2021 (when we temporarily stopped accepting insurance benefits as a method of direct payment) did not meet the criteria for revenue recognition. As a result, we did not recognize revenue for shipments within that timeframe to customers with potential insurance benefits, substantially all of whom were covered under the FEHB program.
 We previously estimated that a majority of customers with unsubmitted claims would choose to return the hearing aid system if their insurance provider denied their claim or the claim was ultimately not submitted by us for payment, resulting in an increase in expected product returns from sales transactions that occurred prior to September 21, 2021 and recorded during the year ended December 31, 2021. Returns associated with unsubmitted claims reduce the sales returns reserve, with a corresponding reduction in the related accounts receivable at the time the product is returned.
We estimated that, in addition to the customers who chose to return their hearing aid systems, a significant number of customers whose claims were denied by payors or not submitted by us for payment would not pay for or return the hearing aid system, resulting in bad debt expense that was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2021.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, we made the determination not to seek payment for approximately $16.1 million from customers with unsubmitted and unpaid claims. We accounted for this decision as a pricing concession and, during the year ended December 31, 2022 recorded a $16.1 million reduction to our insurance-related accounts receivable balance, along with related

reduction to net revenue of $11.6 million and an allowance for credit losses balance of $4.5 million for such unsubmitted and unpaid claims. Further, we simultaneously recorded a decrease in our insurance-related sales return reserve of $11.3 million, with a corresponding increase of $11.3 million to net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 related to unsubmitted and unpaid claims. These changes resulted in a decrease in net revenue of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Insurance-related business following DOJ settlement
Between December 8, 2021 and September 15, 2022, we did not accept insurance benefits as a direct method of payment to the Company, a practice we refer to as “direct plan access.” In “direct plan access,” we submit an insurance claim on behalf of an Eargo customer to their insurance plan, or support an Eargo customer in their own claim submission, and the customer’s insurance benefits are utilized for the purchase, in whole or in part. Common forms of utilization can include, but are not limited to, co-pay, payment by a third-party payor to either Eargo or the customer, reimbursement by a third-party payor to the customer, or application toward a customer’s deductible.
 Because we do not currently have contracts with any FEHB carriers, third-party payors, or other insurance providers, our products are considered out-of-network with such payors and insurance providers. We do not believe that the reimbursement amounts, patient co-payment amounts, or the claims submission process, including medical necessity and other documentation requirements, depend on whether we are in-network or out-of-network with that FEHB carrier or other FEHB plans. To illustrate, the hearing aid benefit in an FEHB plan is a set amount that covers the hearing aid itself and related fees and supplies, regardless of the plan option and regardless of whether the hearing aid is provided by a preferred, participating, or non-participating provider (i.e., regardless of whether it is in-network or out-of-network), which is not always the case for other benefit categories. However, depending on the FEHB carrier or third-party payor, payment may be made directly to the patient rather than to us if Eargo is out-of-network.
 Beginning on September 15, 2022, we resumed our direct plan access insurance-based business, accepting insurance benefits as a method of direct payment in certain limited circumstances, when the customer has undergone additional testing by an independent, licensed healthcare provider to establish medical necessity, with supporting clinical documentation. We are evaluating additional alternatives for testing or establishing medical necessity, including, but not limited to, contracting with third parties or existing networks of licensed healthcare providers, and/or establishing a management services organization, separate from our existing corporate structure, that manages professional entities that employ licensed healthcare providers. These alternatives involve significant time and related activities, including, but not limited to, development of additional internal processes, training, and compliance and quality control programs, coordination with external healthcare providers and professional services organizations, and evaluation of and compliance with state-by-state regulatory requirements. We cannot provide any assurance as to the efficacy of the processes that we have established or the extent to which such processes will need to be changed, or additional processes established, or the associated timing or costs, whether we will be successful in implementing any of them, or the impact that such processes and changes may have on our business and operations. If we are unable to successfully implement at least one of these alternatives for testing, or to otherwise establish additional acceptable processes to support claims that we may submit for reimbursement, we expect that we may not be able to submit future claims in sufficient volume to meaningfully restore or expand the amount of our insurance-based business related to direct plan access. Further, the OTC Final Rule, described in greater detail below, which became effective on October 17, 2022, may lead payors to take additional actions, such as excluding OTC hearing aids from coverage, further limiting our ability to access insurance coverage, or there may be a delay in accessing insurance coverage as payors seek to address the OTC Final Rule in their offered benefits, if at all, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
 We are also seeking to establish relationships with benefits managers or managed care providers. Employer self-funded plans or other health plans may at times offer supplemental benefits, which may include hearing aid benefits or general “over-the-counter” benefits; they may in those cases contract with benefits managers or managed care providers in the administration of such supplemental benefits. In this role, among other things, benefits managers are responsible for selecting benefits vendors, i.e., vendors whose products or services are eligible to be covered by the supplemental benefit. The vendors themselves, or Eargo in this role, are not responsible for claims submissions but instead fulfill the product order from the customer through the benefits manager.
 We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to maintain or increase our participation in arrangements with third-party payors, insurance carriers, benefits managers, or managed care providers or that we will be adequately reimbursed or otherwise paid by such parties for the products we sell, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
 Patient Square Capital Investment
 On June 24, 2022, after reviewing all available alternatives to secure the funding needed to support our ongoing operations and pursuit of our business strategies, and a potential sale of the Company, we entered into an agreement (the “Note Purchase Agreement”) with PSC Echo, LP (the “PSC Stockholder”), an affiliate of Patient Square Capital (“Patient Square”), and Drivetrain Agency Services, LLC, as administrative agent and collateral agent. Pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, we issued approximately $105.5 million in two tranches of senior secured convertible notes (the “Notes”) and agreed to conduct a rights offering for an aggregate of 18.75

million shares of common stock to stockholders as of a record date determined by our Board, at an offering price of $10.00 per share of common stock (the “Rights Offering”). Pursuant to the Rights Offering, which closed on November 23, 2022, we sold an aggregate of approximately 2.9 million shares to our existing stockholders, from which we received net proceeds of $27.6 million, and, in accordance with the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement, the Notes converted into 15,821,299 shares of our common stock, in each case, on a post-reverse stock split basis, representing approximately 76.3% of our outstanding common stock as of the date of conversion.
In connection with the Note Purchase Agreement, we had also entered into an Investors’ Rights Agreement with the PSC Stockholder, pursuant to which, among other things, the PSC Stockholder has the right to nominate a number of directors to our Board that is proportionate to the PSC Stockholder’s ownership of the Company, rounded up to the nearest whole number (and which shall in no event be less than one). As a result, following the closing of the Rights Offering and the conversion of the Notes, the PSC Stockholder has the right to nominate six directors to our Board. The PSC Stockholder exercised its right to nominate three directors to the Board, Trit Garg, M.D., Karr Narula and Justin Sabet-Peyman, in December 2022.
 As of March 20, 2023, the PSC Stockholder held 15,821,299 shares, representing approximately 76.3% of our outstanding common stock. As a result of Patient Square’s ownership position, we are considered a “controlled company” within the meaning of the marketplace rules (the “Listing Rules”) of the Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) and Patient Square may be able to determine all matters requiring stockholder approval.
 Seasonality
In the past we have experienced, and we may continue to experience, seasonality in our business, with higher sales volumes in quarters when we commercially launch new products and in the fourth calendar quarter as a result of holiday promotional activity. However, since our public disclosure of the DOJ investigation and our related decision to temporarily stop accepting insurance benefits as a method of direct payment between December 8, 2021 and September 15, 2022, we have experienced and may continue to experience a material decline in gross systems shipped (as further discussed in “—DOJ investigation and settlement and claims audits”). As a result, seasonal factors did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the three months and year ended December 31, 2022. Negative publicity, including in relation to the DOJ investigation, the claims audits, and other legal proceedings has and could continue to harm our reputation and brand and diminish consumer confidence in our products, which may further impact any seasonal trends in our business.
Research and development
We are committed to ongoing research and development. Since 2017, we have launched seven generations of our hearing aids, each adding performance and technical enhancements at different price points.
We are focused on continuing to launch new versions of the Eargo hearing aid with increased functionality and improved sound quality, amplification, noise reduction, fit, comfort, water resistance and ease-of-use, as well as reduced cost of goods and better connectivity. Our development priorities also include expanding and refining our refurbishment capabilities. We believe that the continued introduction of new products is critical to maintaining existing customers, attracting new customers, achieving market acceptance of our products and maintaining or increasing our competitive position in the market.
Manufacturing
We rely on a limited number of manufacturers for our products: Hana Microelectronics Group (“Hana”), a contract manufacturer based in Thailand, as well as our primary manufacturer, Pegatron Corporation (“Pegatron”), headquartered in Taiwan and with manufacturing facilities throughout Asia. Pegatron manufactures the Eargo 5, Eargo 6, and Eargo 7 hearing aid systems out of its facilities in Suzhou, China. We rely on several third-party suppliers for the components used in our hearing aids, including semiconductor components, such as integrated circuits, as well as batteries, microphones and receivers.
We believe that these third-party facilities and suppliers will be adequate to meet our current and anticipated manufacturing needs. We do not currently plan to manufacture our hearing aids or any related components ourselves.
Manufacturing facilities that produce medical devices and/or their component parts intended for distribution world-wide are subject to regulation and periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA and other domestic and international regulatory agencies. In the United States, any products we sell are required to be manufactured in compliance with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, which covers the methods used in, and the facilities used for, the design, testing, control, manufacturing, labeling, quality assurance, packaging, storage and shipping of our products.
The distribution of our hearing aids is handled directly through a third-party logistics provider. Our finished hearing aids are shipped from our contract manufacturer to the third-party logistics provider’s facility and are distributed from there to customers or retailers or other partners, as applicable.

While we have not been directly impacted by any major disruption to our supply chain or access to necessary raw materials and component parts for the manufacture of our products to date that have impacted our ability to service customers, disruptions have occurred across a number of industries and we cannot provide any assurance that future disruptions will not emerge as a result of the ongoing supply chain issues, inflation, the COVID-19 pandemic or other external factors. To date, increases in our product component pricing have occurred but have not had a material impact on supply continuity or gross margin. We have taken steps to monitor our supply chain and actions to address limited supply and increasing lead times, including outreach to critical suppliers and spot market purchases. For more information, please see the risks described under the caption “We rely on the timely supply of high-quality components, parts and finished products, and our business could suffer if suppliers or manufacturers are unable to procure raw materials or other components of an acceptable quality (or at all) or otherwise fail to meet their delivery obligations, raise prices or cease to supply us with components, parts or products of acceptable quality” in the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report on 10-K.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and confidentiality and invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. As of December 31, 2022, we had 26 issued U.S. patents, 26 patents outside the United States, 9 pending U.S. patent applications and 12 pending foreign patent applications. Our patents include utility patents covering technology ranging from remote control of our hearing aids to design patents covering the housing and securing mechanisms for our hearing aids. We have foreign patents in the EU, Australia, Canada, China, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Japan, Singapore and South Korea. We own all of our patents and do not rely on any licenses to utilize the technology covered by these patents. The earliest of our patents is expected to expire in 2025. An issued U.S. patent with claims generally directed to an open ear canal hearing aid comprised of certain electronics and securing portions and an issued U.S. patent with claims generally directed to an adjustable securing mechanism for a space access device are each expected to expire in 2030.
Our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents, and we cannot assure you that any current or subsequently issued patents will protect our intellectual property rights. Third parties may challenge certain patents issued to us as invalid, may independently develop similar or competing technologies or may design around any of our patents. We cannot be certain that any of the steps we have taken will prevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights in these countries as fully as in the United States.
There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry. Any litigation claims against us, independent of their validity, may result in substantial costs and the diversion of resources with no assurance of success. As of December 31, 2022, there is no active patent litigation involving us.
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 35 trademark registrations and 6 pending trademark applications worldwide.
Competition
We compete in the hearing aid market against manufacturers, clinics and retailers of hearing aids, other direct-to-consumer providers of hearing aids and, to a lesser extent, providers of personal sound amplification products (“PSAPs”). We believe that the primary competitive factors in the market are:
•product quality and performance, including but not limited to, the size, sound quality, comfort, whether the batteries are rechargeable, reliability and connectivity of the hearing aid; 
 •customer purchasing experience; 
 •visibility of hearing aid; 
 •pricing, including access to insurance benefits if coverage is available; 
 •product support and service; 
 •effective marketing and education; 
 •technological innovation, product enhancements and speed of innovation; and 
 •sales and distribution capabilities, including access to retail markets. 
 After a period of industry consolidation, five manufacturers control a vast majority of the global hearing aid industry today. These manufacturers are GN Store Nord, Sonova, Starkey, William Demant and WS Audiology, all of which have established products and substantially greater financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing and development resources than we possess. In addition to these manufacturers, we also compete against hearing clinics and retailers, such as Costco. Costco sells behind-the-ear, in-the-ear and in-the-canal hearing aids from traditional manufacturers, as well as its Kirkland Signature label behind-the-ear hearing aids, each at

various price points. We also compete against other direct-to-consumer hearing aid providers such as Audicus and Lively (which was acquired by GN Store Nord and rebranded as Jabra Enhance), which, similar to our business model, allow consumers to purchase hearing aids without visiting a clinic and provide remote support for their products.
Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements, including with respect to changes to the industry landscape potentially arising as a result of the FDA’s adoption and implementation of the OTC Final Rule (see “Government Regulation—Regulation by the FDA” for more information).
Prior to the effective date of the OTC Final Rule, no OTC category of hearing aids existed. The creation of the new category of OTC hearing aids by the FDA could materially alter the competitive environment for hearing loss treatment. The FDA and the Biden administration have stated that the intention of the OTC Final Rule is to reduce barriers to access, foster innovation in hearing aid technology, and promote the wide availability of low-cost hearing aids. We expect the removal of regulatory barriers to entry will facilitate the introduction of new and varied product designs by incumbent and new competitors. For instance, a number of competitors have begun marketing OTC hearing aids since the adoption of the OTC Final Rule, including existing competitors in the hearing aid industry, such as WS Audiology (in partnership with Sony Electronics) and GN Store Nord (through its Jabra brand), as well as new entrants into the hearing aid industry such Nuheara (through a licensing partnership with HP, Inc.).
In connection with the OTC Final Rule, we have expended, and will continue to expend, significant time and resources evaluating the OTC Final Rule and ensuring that our devices and processes comply with the new requirements in order to market our products in line with our primary direct-to-consumer business and omni-channel models. It is possible that the OTC Final Rule may lead to additional commercial partnership, omni-channel, including retail, or other opportunities, although there are no assurances that it will do so.
 Considering the resources and advantages that our competitors maintain, even if our technology and consumer-first business model and distribution strategy are more effective than the technology and distribution strategy of our competitors, current or potential customers might accept competitor products in lieu of purchasing our products. We anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future, and may also experience intensifying pricing pressures, as existing companies and competitors develop new or improved products and distribution strategies and as new companies enter the market with new technologies and distribution strategies (possibly with increased frequency due to the implementation of the OTC Final Rule, discussed above). We may not be able to compete effectively against these organizations. Our ability to compete successfully and to increase our market share is dependent upon our approach to addressing unmet needs in the hearing aid industry. Increased competition in the future could adversely affect our revenue, revenue growth rate, if any, margins and market share.
Government regulation
We operate in a complex regulatory environment with an extensive and evolving set of federal, state and local governmental laws, regulations, and other requirements. These laws, regulations and other requirements are promulgated and overseen by a number of different legislative, regulatory, administrative and quasi-regulatory bodies, each of which may have varying interpretations, judgments or related guidance. For example, our products and operations are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), which regulates, among other things, the research, development, testing, design, manufacturing, approval, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, advertising, promotion, marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of medical devices in the United States to assure the safety and effectiveness of medical products for their intended use. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) also regulates the advertising of our products in the United States. Further, we are subject to laws directed at preventing fraud and abuse, which subject our sales and marketing, training, and other practices to government scrutiny.
As such, we utilize considerable resources on an ongoing basis to monitor, assess and respond to applicable legislative, regulatory, and administrative requirements, but there is no guarantee that we will be successful in our efforts to adhere to all of these requirements. Additional discussion on certain of these laws, regulations and other requirements is set forth below in this section.
If any of our personnel, representatives or operations are alleged to have violated these or other laws, regulations or requirements, we could suffer severe consequences, including material harm to our reputation, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, among other things.
We expect that our industry will continue to be subject to extensive and complex regulation, the scope and effect of which are difficult to predict. For additional detail on risks related to each of the foregoing, see the Risk Factors titled, “Changes in the regulatory landscape for hearing aid devices could materially impact our direct-to-consumer and omni-channel business models and lead to increased regulatory requirements, and we may be required to seek additional clearance or approval for our products,” “Our hearing aids are subject to extensive government regulation at the federal and state level, and our failure to comply with applicable requirements could harm our business,” and “If we fail to comply with U.S. or foreign federal and state healthcare regulatory laws, we could be subject to penalties, including, but not limited to, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement,

exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely impact our reputation and business operations.”
Regulation by the FDA
The FDA classifies hearing aids, including in-the-canal hearing aids such as our products, as medical devices. In the United States, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”), as well as FDA regulations and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, device safety, premarket clearance and approval, establishment registration and device listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, recalls and field safety corrective actions, and post-market surveillance, including complaint handling and medical device reporting of adverse events. Failure to comply with applicable requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution. The FDA can also refuse to approve or clear pending product applications.
The FDA classifies medical devices into three classes (Class I, II or III) based on the degree of risk associated with a device and the level of regulatory control deemed necessary to ensure its safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA’s general controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the FDA’s current good manufacturing practices (“cGMPs”) for devices, as reflected in the Quality System Regulation (“QSR”), establishment registration and device listing, reporting of adverse events, and truthful, non-misleading labeling, advertising and promotional materials. Some Class I devices also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the premarket notification process set forth in Section 510(k) of the FDCA. Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s general controls and any other special controls deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, such as performance standards, product-specific guidance documents, special labeling requirements, patient registries and/or post-market surveillance. Most Class II devices must also comply with the FDA’s Section 510(k) premarket notification requirements. Class III devices are those that support or sustain human life, are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury. Due to the level of risk associated with Class III devices, general and special controls alone are insufficient to assure their safety and effectiveness. Devices placed in Class III generally require the submission of a premarket approval (“PMA”) application demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of the device, which must be approved by the FDA prior to marketing, or the receipt of a de novo classification, which provides for the reclassification of the device into Class I or II. The PMA approval process is more stringent, time-consuming and expensive than the 510(k) clearance process; however, the 510(k) clearance process has also become increasingly stringent and expensive.
On August 17, 2022, the FDA published a final rule to establish new regulatory categories for OTC and prescription hearing aids (the “OTC Final Rule”). The OTC Final Rule implements relevant provisions of the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 (“FDARA”), which set forth requirements for the FDA to create a new category of OTC hearing aids that are intended to be available without supervision, prescription, or other order, involvement or intervention of a licensed practitioner. Prior to the effective date of the OTC Final Rule, no OTC category of hearing aids existed. Following publication of a proposed rule in October 2021, the FDA issued its OTC Final Rule with requirements for labelling, conditions of sale, performance standards, design requirements and other provisions under which manufacturers may elect to market hearing aids as either OTC or prescription devices, or both. In addition, under FDARA, the OTC hearing aid controls promulgated in the OTC Final Rule preempt any state or local requirement specifically related to hearing products that would restrict or interfere with commercial activity involving OTC hearing aids. The OTC Final Rule became effective on October 17, 2022, although certain previously marketed devices have until April 14, 2023 to come into compliance with the OTC Final Rule.
 We have marketed in the past, and continue to market, certain Eargo system devices as Class I air-conduction or Class II wireless air-conduction hearing aids under existing regulations at 21 CFR 874.330 and 874.3305, respectively, both of which are exempt from 510(k) premarket review. In June 2022, we submitted a 510(k) premarket notification seeking FDA clearance of expanded labelling for our Eargo 5 and Eargo 6 hearing aids under the “self-fitting” regulation at 21 CFR 874.3323. In December 2022, we received FDA 510(k) clearance for Eargo 5 and Eargo 6 as Class II self-fitting air-conduction hearing aids. Additionally, in January 2023, we launched the Eargo 7 as our third over-the-counter, 510(k) cleared self-fitting device. We plan to market our devices as OTC hearing aids and intend to comply with all applicable OTC regulatory requirements as of the compliance date for currently marketed devices on April 14, 2023, or sooner. We may also seek to market certain devices as prescription hearing aids, which would require compliance with separate physical and electronic labeling requirements under the OTC Final Rule.

In connection with the OTC Final Rule, we have expended, and will continue to expend, significant time and resources evaluating the OTC Final Rule and ensuring that our devices and processes are in compliance with the new requirements in order to market our products in line with our primary direct-to-consumer business and omni-channel models. It is possible that the OTC Final Rule may lead to additional commercial partnership, omni-channel, including retail, or other opportunities, although there are no assurances that it will do so. The OTC Final Rule and the responses thereto by leading insurance providers could also materially impact our efforts to resume submitting claims for customers with potential insurance benefits or have other unforeseen impacts on our business and results of operations.
 Please see the Risk Factor titled, “Changes in the regulatory landscape for hearing aid devices could materially impact our direct-to-consumer business model and lead to increased regulatory requirements, and we may be required to seek additional clearance or approval for our products” for more information.
 510(k) clearance
If not exempted from the FDA’s 510(k) notification requirement, to obtain 510(k) clearance for a medical device, an applicant must submit a premarket notification to the FDA demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a legally marketed device, commonly known as the “predicate device.” A legally marketed predicate device may include a device that was legally marketed in the United States prior to May 28, 1976 for which a PMA is not required (commonly known as a “pre-amendments device” based on the date the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 were enacted), a device which the FDA has reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, or a device which has been found substantially equivalent to such a device through the 510(k) process. A device is considered to be substantially equivalent if, with respect to the predicate device, it has the same intended use and has either (i) the same technological characteristics, or (ii) different technological characteristics, but the information provided in the 510(k) submission demonstrates that the device does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness and is at least as safe and effective as the predicate device. A showing of substantial equivalence may sometimes, but not always, require clinical data. Before the FDA will accept a 510(k) submission for substantive review, the FDA will first assess whether the submission satisfies a minimum threshold of acceptability. If the FDA determines that the 510(k) submission is incomplete, the FDA will issue a “Refuse to Accept” letter which generally outlines the information the FDA believes is necessary to permit a substantive review and to reach a determination regarding substantial equivalence. An applicant must submit the requested information before the FDA will proceed with additional review of the submission. Once a 510(k) submission is accepted for review, the FDA has 90 days to review and issue a determination. As a practical matter, clearance often takes longer. The FDA may request additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence, which may significantly prolong the review process. The review period is suspended during the time the additional information request is pending. Unless a specific exemption applies, 510(k) premarket notification submissions are subject to user fees.
Medical devices can be marketed only for the indications for which they are cleared or approved. After a device has received 510(k) clearance for a specific intended use, any change or modification that significantly affects its safety or effectiveness, such as a significant change in the design, materials or method of manufacture, or that would constitute a new or major change in intended use, may require a new 510(k) clearance or PMA approval and payment of an additional FDA user fee. The determination as to whether or not a modification constitutes such a change is initially left to the manufacturer using available FDA guidance; however, the FDA may review this determination to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until new 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained. The manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.
Clinical trials
Clinical trials are sometimes required for 510(k) clearance. Such trials generally require submission of an investigational device exemption (“IDE”) application to the FDA for a specified number of patients and study sites, unless the product is deemed to be a non-significant risk device which may be subject to more abbreviated IDE requirements. The appropriate institutional review boards (“IRBs”) at the clinical sites must also approve the study before clinical trials may begin. Clinical trials are subject to extensive monitoring, record keeping and reporting requirements. Clinical trials must be conducted under the oversight of IRBs for the relevant clinical trial sites and must comply with FDA regulations, including but not limited to those relating to good clinical practices (“GCPs”), which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for participation in each clinical study. The clinical trial sponsor, the FDA or the IRB could suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not adequately demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain FDA clearance to market the product.

Labeling and sale
All hearing aids commercially distributed in the United States must comply with specific FDA labeling requirements. These requirements address the labeling of the device itself and any accompanying software, as well as the User Instructional Brochure that must be provided to all potential hearing aid recipients.
Prior to the OTC Final Rule, FDA regulations required that the marketing of hearing aids comply with certain “conditions for sale,” including, among other things, the requirement that prospective hearing aid users must undergo a medical evaluation (or provide a signed waiver) before a hearing aid may be dispensed, along with certain recordkeeping requirements. In 2016, the FDA issued a guidance document stating that it did not intend to enforce the medical evaluation, waiver, or recordkeeping requirements prior to the dispensing of Class I air-conduction and Class II wireless air-conduction hearing aids to individuals 18 years of age and older. We previously marketed our devices pursuant to this exercise of enforcement discretion until the requirement was eliminated with the OTC Final Rule. Under the OTC Final Rule, we must comply with new requirements for labelling, conditions of sale, performance standards, design requirements and other provisions applicable to our hearing aids as either OTC or prescription devices, or both.
Quality System Regulation
The hearing aids that we commercially distribute in the United States are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA and certain state agencies. This includes product listing and establishment registration requirements, which facilitate FDA inspections and other regulatory actions. We are required to adhere to applicable cGMP requirements, as set forth in the QSR, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all phases of the design and manufacturing process. We are also required to verify that our suppliers maintain facilities, procedures and operations that comply with applicable quality and regulatory requirements. The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic announced or unannounced inspections of medical device manufacturing facilities, which may include the facilities of contractors. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from the QSR and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Noncompliance with these regulations can result in, among other things, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls or seizures of products, total or partial suspension of production, FDA refusal to grant 510(k) clearance or PMA approval to new devices, withdrawal of existing clearances or approvals, and criminal prosecution.
Post-market surveillance
We must also comply with post-market surveillance regulations, including medical device reporting (“MDR”) requirements which require that we review and report to the FDA any incident in which our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, and any incident in which our product has malfunctioned if that malfunction would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur. We must also comply with medical device correction and removal reporting regulations, which require manufacturers to report to the FDA corrections and removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health. Although we may undertake recall actions voluntarily, we must submit detailed information on any recall action to the FDA, and the FDA can order a medical device recall in certain circumstances.
In addition to post-market quality and safety actions, labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in certain circumstances, by the FTC. Medical devices approved or cleared by the FDA may not be promoted for unapproved or uncleared uses, otherwise known as “off-label” promotion. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including substantial monetary penalties and criminal prosecution.
Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, including delays in or failures to report incidents to the FDA as required under the MDR regulations, can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which can include any of the following sanctions:
•warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; 
 •customer notifications or repair, replacement, refund, recall, administrative detention or seizure of our products; 
 •operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production; 
 •FDA refusals or delays on requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new or modified products; 
 •withdrawal of 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted; 
 •refusal to grant export approval for products; or 
 •civil penalties or criminal prosecution. 


Other healthcare laws and regulations
The healthcare industry is also subject to federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including anti-kickback, self-referral, false claims and physician payment transparency laws, as well as patient data privacy and security and consumer protection and unfair competition laws and regulations. Our operations are also subject to certain state and local hearing care laws, including those applicable to the licensure and registration of audiologists and other individuals that dispense hearing aids, sales and marketing practices, interactions with consumers, consumer incentive and other promotional programs, and state corporate practice and fee-splitting prohibitions.
Fraud and abuse laws
In addition to the FDA, other broadly applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations apply to our operations and business practices. These laws may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we conduct our operations, including our direct-to-consumer activities and sales and marketing practices as well as other business practices. Additionally, we are subject to numerous federal healthcare anti-fraud laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Physician Self-Referral Law and the False Claims Act, that are intended to reduce fraud, waste and abuse in the healthcare industry, and analogous state laws that may apply to healthcare items and services paid by all payors, including self-pay patients and private insurers. These laws are broad and subject to evolving interpretations. They prohibit many arrangements and practices that are lawful in industries other than healthcare, including pricing, sales and marketing activities, sales commissions, customer incentive and other promotional programs, and the provision of gifts and business courtesies. We must operate our business within the requirements of these laws. Violations of any of these health regulatory laws may result in potentially significant penalties, including criminal and civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
In addition, the U.S. Physician Payments Sunshine Act (as amended by the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act) requires manufacturers to report to the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) detailed information about financial arrangements with physicians (as defined by statute), certain non-physician practitioners, including physician assistants and nurse practitioners, and teaching hospitals. These reporting provisions preempt state laws that require reporting of the same information, but not those that require reports of different or additional information. Failure to comply subjects manufacturers to significant civil monetary penalties.
State licensing, corporate practice and fee-splitting prohibitions
Regulation of the hearing aid industry exists in every state. These laws and regulations are primarily concerned with the licensure and registration of audiologists and other individuals and companies that dispense hearing aids, including procedures involving the fitting and dispensing of hearing aids. In addition, most states require warranty and return policies for consumers allowing for the return of product, and restrict hearing aid advertising and marketing practices. These state laws are subject to change, and states may impose more stringent requirements for dispensers of hearing aids, complicating our compliance efforts. In August 2022, the FDA adopted the OTC Final Rule, providing that, among other things, any state or local requirement specifically related to hearing products that would restrict or interfere with commercial activity involving OTC hearing aids would be preempted. A determination that we are in violation of applicable laws and regulations in any jurisdiction in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on us, particularly if we are unable to restructure our operations and arrangements to comply with the requirements of that jurisdiction, if we are required to restructure our operations and arrangements at a significant cost, or if we are subject to penalties or other adverse action. Additionally, applicable federal laws and regulations continue to evolve.
Our arrangements with hearing professionals may implicate certain state laws, commonly referred to as the corporate practice of learned professions, including audiology, and fee-splitting laws, which are intended to prevent unlicensed persons from interfering with or influencing the audiologist’s or other hearing care specialist’s professional judgment. These laws vary from state to state, including those where we do business, and are subject to broad interpretation and enforcement by state regulators. In the event that regulatory authorities or other third parties were to challenge these arrangements, we could be subject to adverse judicial or administrative interpretations, to civil or criminal penalties, our contracts could be found legally invalid and unenforceable or we could be required to restructure our arrangements with our audiologists and other licensed professionals. Audiologists and certain other hearing care specialists are required to maintain valid state licenses to practice and must comply with numerous state and local licensing laws and regulations, and each state defines the scope of practice for audiologists and other hearing care specialists through legislation and their respective state regulatory agencies and boards. Activities that qualify as professional misconduct under state law may subject our personnel to sanctions or may even result in loss of their licensure and could, possibly, subject us to sanctions as well.
Privacy and security
Numerous state, federal and foreign laws, regulations and standards govern the collection, use, access to, confidentiality and security of health-related and other personal information and could apply now or in the future to our operations or the operations of our partners. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health

information privacy and security laws and consumer protection laws and regulations govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. In addition, certain foreign laws govern the privacy and security of personal data, including health-related data. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the “FCPA”), prohibits U.S. businesses and their representatives from offering to pay, paying, promising to pay or authorizing the payment of money or anything of value to a foreign official in order to influence any act or decision of the foreign official in his or her official capacity or to secure any other improper advantage in order to obtain or retain business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States, like us, to comply with accounting provisions that require us to maintain books and records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, if any, and to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries.
 International laws
Globally, other countries have enacted anti-bribery laws and/or regulations similar to the FCPA. Violations of any of these anti-bribery laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation.
Additionally, as described above, there are also international privacy laws that impose restrictions on the access, use, and disclosure of health information and, as in the United States, there are significant and complex laws and regulations pertaining to our products and business model. To the extent we expand internationally, we will need to expend time and resources evaluating and complying with any such laws and regulations. For more information, see the Risk Factors titled, “Any future international expansion will subject us to additional costs and risks that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations” and “We operate in a regulated industry and changes in the regulations or the implementation of existing regulations could affect our operations and prospects for future growth.”
Environmental matters
Our operations, properties and products are subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, management and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous materials and waste and remediation of releases of hazardous materials. We believe that we are in material compliance with environmental laws and regulations applicable to us. However, our failure to comply with present and future requirements under these laws and regulations, or environmental contamination or releases of hazardous materials on our leased premises, as well as through disposal of our products, could cause us to incur substantial costs, including clean-up costs, personal injury and property damage claims, fines and penalties, costs to redesign our products or upgrade our facilities and legal costs, or require us to curtail our operations, any of which could seriously harm our business.
Human capital management
Employees
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 243 full-time employees worldwide, of which approximately 236 were employed in the United States. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our employee relations to be good.
Talent attraction, development and retention
Our success depends in part on our continued ability to recruit, retain, develop and motivate a diverse population of talented employees at all levels of our organization. To succeed in a competitive industry, our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees.
In addition to acquiring new talent, we focus on growing and developing our existing talent. We conduct regular individual performance reviews in which managers provide regular feedback and coaching to assist with employee development. We make investments to enhance employees’ skill levels and provide professional opportunities for career development and advancement. Our learning and development experiences focus on onboarding new hires as well as offering workshops focused on skills development, including leadership development programs and people manager coaching, and compliance training.

Our leadership team focuses on identifying the next generation of leaders to ensure that the organization is prepared to fill critical roles with employees who are prepared to support the strategy of the business and respond to the needs of key stakeholders. Furthermore, although we had reductions-in-force in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the second quarter of 2022, we offered affected employees severance packages.
 Diversity and inclusion
We view diversity as integral to our future success. Diversity in our workforce fosters innovation, while inclusion helps ensure that we have the right culture, processes, policies, and practices to make employees feel valued and included. Developing teams where team members feel heard, respected, and included is one of our core values. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 46% of our total US workforce was female and approximately 34% of our employees in domestic managerial roles were female. Minorities (non-White) constituted approximately 37% of our total US workforce and approximately 31% of our employees in domestic managerial roles were minorities as of the same date.
Compensation and benefits
We focus on paying employees fairly and competitively. As a medical device company in the healthcare industry, we recognize the importance of compensation and benefits that are designed to support the financial, mental, and physical well-being of our team members and their families. Our compensation packages typically include incentive plans comprised of discretionary stock-based compensation awards and cash-based performance bonus awards, health benefits, including options for medical plans, pharmacy, dental and vision coverage, a 401(k) plan, life and disability insurance, discretionary paid time off, family leave, a technology stipend for remote work, commuter benefit program, and a program for partial education reimbursement. Eligibility for, and the level of, benefits vary depending on team members’ full-time or part-time status, work location, compensation level, and tenure.
Health, safety and wellness
The physical health, financial wellbeing, life balance, and mental health of our employees are vital to our success. We remain focused on promoting the total wellness of our employees, including resources, programs and services to support their physical, mental and financial wellness. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have promoted the health, safety, and wellbeing of our employees and their families. We have established safety policies and protocols based on guidance from healthcare experts and public health leaders, and we regularly review and update them to reflect the best, most current information available.
