Item 1. Business
The Company
We operate 252 senior living communities, including one active adult community, located in 31 states and provide services to approximately 21,000 residents. We also operate 244 rehabilitation and wellness services clinics located in 28 states and provide services to approximately 16,500 clients. We conduct our operations in two reportable segments: (i) senior living and (ii) rehabilitation and wellness services.
With our mission, “To honor and enrich the journey of life, one experience at a time,” our leadership team is committed to prioritizing the needs of our residents, clients and team members. We employ approximately 19,500 team members experienced in supporting older adults and we are focused on establishing ourselves as a premier provider of services to older adults. 
As of December 31, 2020, our senior living segment was comprised of older adults residing in (i) 243 primarily independent and assisted living communities and (ii) 9 skilled nursing facilities, or SNFs. Our independent and assisted living communities, which includes our Bridge to Rediscovery memory care units, consist of 28,316 living units. These units include 37 continuing care retirement communities, or CCRCs, with 8,574 living units. Our 9 SNFs consist of 955 living units. As of December 31, 2020, we managed 228 senior living communities (26,969 living units), including one active adult community (167 living units), owned and operated 20 senior living communities (2,098 living units), and leased and operated 4 senior living communities (204 living units). 
With the goal of offering a comprehensive suite of services, we provide our residents and others with rehabilitation and wellness services at our senior living communities as well as at outpatient clinics located separately from our senior living communities through Ageility Physical Therapy Solutions, or Ageility, a division of our rehabilitation and wellness services segment. As of December 31, 2020, we operated 37 inpatient clinics providing rehabilitation and wellness services in 32 of our CCRCs and 5 of our SNFs. As of December 31, 2020, we operated 207 outpatient clinics, of which 149 were clinics within our senior living communities and 58 were clinics within senior living communities operated by other providers. We provided Ageility services to approximately 16,500 clients in 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we have continued to expand our Ageility service line by starting to introduce innovative fitness and personal training offerings to complement outpatient therapy in 185 senior living and active adult communities.
According to "The Longevity Economy Outlook", from AARP and The Economist, as of December 31, 2019, the over-50 age population in the United States was comprised of 117.4 million people, or 35% of the population. The fastest growing age population in the United States is the over 85, and the second fastest is the over 100. We believe our business has the platform and service offerings to position us to support a higher quality of life for these adults as they age.
We are focused on (i) creating experiences for older adults that meet and often exceed their expectations and (ii) offering residences and services that meet the needs and demands of older adults. To that end, we collaborate and actively engage with innovative organizations. We also sponsor and pilot programs to continually evolve our service capabilities to meet the needs of our residents, clients and team members and we adapt our offerings to meet the evolving consumer demands of a growing population of older adults. In 2020, we served approximately 24,000 older adults on a daily basis by providing a variety of living experiences and services including altered services offered to adhere to rigorous infectious disease protocols as a result of the Pandemic in addition to rehabilitation and wellness services through Ageility. For residents in our assisted living and SNF communities, we offer assistance with their daily living activities, including bathing and dressing, eating, toileting and mobility assistance. In certain senior living communities, we also provide licensed skilled nursing services. In addition, we offer additional services including, but not limited to, on-site entertainment, cultural and educational activities, social opportunities and camaraderie, virtual communication, wellness programs and activities to support a healthy lifestyle, personal grooming services, telehealth visits and home health and dining services. Our focus on offering a broad array of services helps promote a greater sense of community and enable older adults to age-in-place independently. In addition, through our rehabilitation and wellness services clinics, we offer a wide range of therapeutic services, including physical, speech and occupational therapy within many of our senior living communities as well as at outpatient clinics. 
Restructuring Transactions with DHC
On April 1, 2019, we entered into a transaction agreement, or the Transaction Agreement, with DHC to restructure our business arrangements with DHC, or the Restructuring Transactions, pursuant to which, effective as of January 1, 2020, or the Conversion Time:
•our five then existing master leases with DHC for 166 of DHC's senior living communities (18,636 living units) that we then leased, as well as our then existing management and pooling agreements with DHC for 78 senior living communities (10,337 living units), were terminated and replaced, or the Conversion, with new management agreements for all of these senior living communities and a related omnibus agreement, or collectively, the New Management Agreements;
•we issued 10,268,158 of our common shares to DHC and an aggregate of 16,118,849 of our common shares to DHC’s shareholders of record as of December 13, 2019, or, together, the Share Issuances; and
•as consideration for the Share Issuances, DHC provided to us $75.0 million of additional consideration by assuming certain of our working capital liabilities and through cash payments (with DHC's provision of such consideration to us, collectively with the Conversion and the Share Issuances, being included in the definition of Restructuring Transactions in this Annual Report on Form 10-K).
For more information regarding the Restructuring Transactions, see "Properties" included in Part I, Item 2, and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included in Part II, Item 7, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Notes 1 and 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our History
We are a corporation formed under the laws of the State of Maryland in 2001. Effective March 3, 2017, we changed our name from Five Star Quality Care, Inc. to Five Star Senior Living Inc. We have grown primarily by leasing or managing senior living communities owned by DHC. We also offer rehabilitation and wellness services both at our senior living communities as well as in senior living communities of other senior living companies. Our principal executive offices are located at 400 Centre Street, Newton, Massachusetts 02458, and our telephone number is (617) 796-8387.
Our Communities and Our Services
Our present business plan contemplates the operation of owned, leased and managed primarily independent and assisted senior living communities as well as CCRC's. Our senior living communities can be classified into different primary service categories; while some provide a single service, a majority provide multiple service levels in a single building or in a campus setting. 
Independent Living Communities. Independent living communities provide residents with high levels of privacy in various types of apartments and require residents to be relatively independent. An independent living apartment usually bundles several non-healthcare services as part of a regular monthly charge. For example, the base charge may include one or two meals per day in a central dining room, weekly housekeeping service or access to a variety of activities. Additional non-healthcare services are generally available from staff employees on a fee for service basis. Independent living communities can provide both assisted living and skilled nursing services in separate parts of the community or campus. As of December 31, 2020, our operations included 10,982 independent living units in 95 senior living communities. Included in this total is an active adult community, which we classify as an independent living community, that has 167 living units.
Assisted Living Communities. Assisted living communities are typically comprised of one-bedroom units, which include private bathrooms and efficiency kitchens. Services bundled within one charge usually include three meals per day in a central dining room, daily housekeeping, laundry, medical reminders and 24-hour availability of assistance with the activities of daily living such as bathing, dressing and eating. Professional nursing and healthcare services are usually available at the community, as requested, or at regularly scheduled times. In addition, residents have access to a variety of entertainment and wellness activities. We also provide Alzheimer’s or memory care services at certain of our assisted living communities through our award-winning Bridge to Rediscovery program. As of December 31, 2020, our operations included 15,332 assisted living suites in 219 senior living communities, of which 3,220 in 111 senior living communities are dedicated to memory care services. 
Skilled Nursing Facilities. SNFs generally provide extensive nursing and healthcare services that are similar to services available in hospitals, without the high costs associated with operating theaters, emergency rooms or intensive care units. A typical purpose-built SNF includes one or two beds per room with a separate bathroom in each room and shared dining facilities. SNFs are staffed by licensed nursing professionals 24 hours per day. As of December 31, 2020, our operations included 2,957 SNF units in 45 senior living communities.
In addition to our senior living communities, we provide a comprehensive suite of rehabilitation and wellness services at our senior living communities, as well as outpatient clinics located separately from our senior living communities through our rehabilitation and wellness services segment.
Rehabilitation and Wellness Services. Through Ageility, we offer rehabilitation and wellness services, primarily in a clinical setting. Staffed with licensed therapists or other trained personnel, our clinics provide rehabilitation services, including physical therapy, speech therapy and occupational therapy. In addition, we offer other rehabilitation and wellness services with a hospitality approach, including strength training, orthopedic rehabilitation, fall prevention, cognitive or memory enhancement, aquatic therapy, continence management programs, pain management programs, neurological rehabilitation, post-surgical or post-hospitalization services and general personal fitness and wellness programs. As of December 31, 2020, our operations included 37 inpatient clinics and 207 outpatient clinics providing rehabilitation and wellness services.
Current Industry Trends
While construction of new senior living communities has slowed during 2020, the industry has experienced several years of significant construction of new communities and other buildings to service older adults. We believe this has resulted in an oversupply and put downward pressures on occupancy and the rates that operators can charge for their services to their residents. In addition, pressures on governmental budgets have resulted in reductions or limitations on government funding growth for senior living and healthcare services, despite the increasing regulatory requirements imposed on the industry. These revenue pressures have been buffeted by increased costs for labor, insurance and regulatory compliance. At the same time, older adults are delaying the age at which they move to senior living communities, or forgoing such a move entirely. 
In the last ten years, the industry evolved to serve the growing number of older adults, and we expect the demand for senior living services to increase in future years. We have searched for innovative ways to overcome the industry's challenges, including workforce shortages and low employee retention, occupancy pressures, challenges related to new technology and higher service level expectations.
The Pandemic has added to these challenges, altering the public perception of senior living negatively while increasing regulatory focus on the industry. The vulnerability of the demographic we serve has caused the health care aspect of the senior living industry to be pushed to the forefront, rather than its growing focus on hospitality and lifestyle. Our roots in clinical excellence have served us well through this time, and allowed us to focus on the safety and well-being of our residents, continuously maintain compliance with changing regulations and support our front-line team members. We remain confident that the pent-up demand in the marketplace will serve those operators who have been able to maintain operational stability and focus on the customer through this challenging time and are able to evolve to meet the needs of the post-pandemic customer who will have higher expectations around safety measures, technological offerings, clinical capabilities and transparent communication.
Even before the Pandemic, demographic trends regarding aging adults had captured the attention of a number of entrepreneurs, start-ups and other companies in the technology arena, resulting in a steady stream of innovations entering the senior living space. Many of these innovations enable older adults to age in their own existing homes longer. Technology is causing the industry to look at new ways of delivering care to older adults. Regardless of the influx of technology solutions that change how senior living companies deliver adult care, we believe that the senior living industry remains a person-to-person, relationship-centered business. Technology can augment, but we believe, will never replace the human touch, friendship and compassion of individuals of all ages who feel called to care for and honor the generations who came before them. We are committed to continue thoughtful and impactful investment in technology to enhance the resident experience.
To address workforce and retention challenges, senior living companies like us have looked to data-driven recruitment processes that use benchmarking and analytics to find quality candidates who stay in their roles longer. Personnel retention plans also include increasing wages, especially in geographic areas where competition for healthcare and senior living professionals is intense. Other inventive efforts to attract talent to the senior living industry include connecting to the future workforce through school partnerships and recruitment presentations.
To address occupancy challenges, we are investing in business intelligence, website enhancements, targeted content, search engine optimization strategy and targeted marketing campaigns tailored to each micro-market, to attract families and individuals searching for the services they need for their aging loved ones or themselves. In addition, we are focused on higher quality prospect engagement, beginning with high touch digital interactions and supported by extensive sales training that focuses on research-based sales tactics to more effectively “close” the prospects generated by our digital marketing efforts.
Recent trends suggest older adults are focused on evaluating senior living communities that offer service platforms that enable individuals to live a more independent lifestyle. With a broader scope of senior living communities operating in the United States, combined with technology enablement, consumers have more options in choosing where to live as they age. This wider range of options for consumers is causing further pressure on the industry to implement innovative methods and services that provide for an exceptional customer experience and our continued focus on customer needs and ongoing investment in marketing intelligence is a direct result of our commitment to that experience.
Competition
The active adult and senior living services markets continue to be highly competitive despite the challenges experienced in the industry this year due to the Pandemic. We compete with numerous local, regional and national senior living community operators. Increasingly, we are also competing with other companies that provide senior living services, such as home healthcare companies and other real estate based service providers. Some of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than we do and some of our competitors are not-for-profit entities that have endowment income and may not face the same financial pressures that we do. In recent years, a significant number of new senior living communities have been developed, and we expect this increased development activity to continue in the future as new operators attempt to seize market share in a highly fragmented market. This activity has increased competitive pressures on us, particularly in the geographic markets where we have high senior living community concentrations. While smaller senior living operators may have struggled to deal with the impact of the Pandemic and higher operating costs, other competitors may have lower operating expenses or other cost advantages compared to us. Therefore, they may be able to provide services at a lower price than we can offer to our residents and clients. 
We continue to address competition (i) by focusing on operations to ensure an exceptional resident experience, high customer satisfaction and team member retention through, among other things, training and development, (ii) by differentiating ourselves with the innovative programs and services we offer, (iii) with enhanced marketing efforts and (iv) by evaluating the current position of our senior living communities relative to their competition. In addition, we may enter into additional arrangements with DHC for us to operate new or additional senior living communities, including active adult communities that DHC owns, and our relationships with DHC and RMR LLC may provide us with competitive advantages; however, DHC is not obligated to provide us with opportunities to operate additional properties it owns. We cannot be sure that we will be able to compete successfully or operate profitably. For more information on the competitive pressures we face and associated risks, see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our Growth Strategy 
We are one of the largest senior living management companies in the United States, based on unit count. We have been in operation for over 19 years, currently servicing approximately 21,000 older adults in our senior living communities as well as approximately 16,500 clients in our Ageility clinics. As our prospective customers' demographics and psychographics change, we are focused on establishing ourselves as a premier provider of services to older adults and their caregivers.
We seek to improve revenues from our existing senior living operations by focusing on providing an exceptional resident experience and seeking residents who pay for our services with private resources. We also seek to improve profitability through continued strategic capital investments at our senior living communities and investments in the development of our staff, as well as by working with service providers to increase the desirability and competitiveness of our senior living communities. In addition to routine renovations and upgrades at our existing senior living communities, since January 1, 2019, we have invested $8.3 million in capital improvements in our currently owned and leased senior living communities.
We also seek to grow our business by entering into additional long-term management agreements for senior living communities and active adult communities where residents’ private resources account for all or a large majority of revenues. Since January 1, 2019, we began managing an additional senior living community and an active adult community for the account of DHC. For more information about our management and prior leasing arrangements with DHC, see "Restructuring Transactions with DHC" above and “Properties — Our DHC Leases and Management Agreements with DHC” included in Part I, Item 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Through our ancillary services, including our rehabilitation and wellness services segment, we provide diversified offerings to older adults both within our senior living communities and outside of them, including skilled rehabilitation services for short-term inpatient stays, such as after joint replacement surgery, home healthcare in certain of our independent living and assisted living communities, outpatient rehabilitation focused on older adults, and concierge services in certain communities. The therapy services we offer include physical, occupational, speech and other specialized therapy services. The home health services we provide include nursing, physical, occupational, speech and other specialized therapy services, home health aide services, and social services, as needed. In addition, we offer personalized concierge services to accommodate our residents’ specific lifestyle and needs in certain communities. Concierge services include personal shopping, companion services, enhanced transportation, bedtime assistance, and personalized dining and nutrition planning, delivery and consultation. By providing residents with a range of service options as their needs change, we provide greater continuity of care, which we believe may encourage our customers to reside with us for an extended period. 
Since January 1, 2019, we have opened 78 net new rehabilitation and wellness services outpatient clinics. We also continued to expand our rehabilitation and wellness services to senior living communities outside of our current senior living operations. In addition, we continue to seek ways to grow our other ancillary services that complement our existing senior living operations to residents of the senior living communities we operate as well as older adults living outside of our communities. 
We also continue to develop public awareness of the Five Star Senior Living brand through various marketing initiatives that we believe differentiate us from other senior living operators. For example, we offer “Lifestyle360”, a wellness program focused on five dimensions of wellness (social, intellectual, spiritual, emotional and physical). We believe that programs like “Lifestyle360” will enhance the appeal of our senior living communities among current and prospective residents and their families and provide us with an opportunity to improve our operating performance. 
Our expansion efforts are currently focused on internal growth through effective management of our existing portfolio, by increasing occupancy, as well as by increasing revenues from our ancillary services, such as outpatient therapy services, health and wellness, fitness and concierge services, to residents of the senior living communities we operate as well as older adults living outside of our communities. We may also agree to operate additional senior living communities and active adult communities for the account of DHC or other third parties pursuant to management arrangements and, from time to time, we may acquire and operate additional senior living communities.
Recent Developments
Portfolio Optimization Through Dispositions. We continually monitor our portfolio of senior living communities that we own or lease. We seek to dispose of, or change our method of operating, certain of our senior living communities if and when we determine it is in our best interest to do so and we are able to reach an agreement regarding the sale or change of our method of operating of such communities with our pre-existing contracting parties, including DHC. In April 2019, DHC announced a plan to sell certain properties to reduce its leverage, with a focus on the sale of certain senior living communities. Since January 1, 2019, we have participated in the sale or closure of 34 senior living communities that DHC owned and we operated or managed. 
Portfolio Optimization Through Expansion Activities. We currently expect that our expansion activities will be focused on internal growth from our senior living communities plus ancillary services, and entering into additional long-term management agreements for senior living communities. 
Since January 1, 2019, we began managing a senior living community and active adult community for the account of DHC, pursuant to a management agreement and/or our then existing pooling agreements. We began managing the senior living community, which is located in Oregon (318 living units), in April 2019, and the active adult community, located in Texas (167 living units), in December 2019.
Effective January 1, 2020, our then existing management and pooling agreements with DHC for these communities were terminated and replaced with New Management Agreements in connection with the Restructuring Transactions.
Expansion of Rehabilitation and Wellness Services. We currently expect to continue to grow our ancillary service offerings, including rehabilitation and wellness services, by opening new clinics and expanding our fitness and other home-based service offerings. Since January 1, 2019, we have opened 78 net new rehabilitation and wellness services outpatient clinics, 17 of which were opened in 2020. 
For more information about our former leases and our management arrangements with DHC, see “Properties—Our Leases and Management Agreements with DHC” in Part I, Item 2 and Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Financing Sources
Our principal sources of funds to meet operating and capital expenses and debt service obligations are cash flows from operating activities, unrestricted cash balances of $84.4 million and borrowings under our $65.0 million secured revolving credit facility, which is available for general business purposes. Our credit facility matures in June 2021, and, subject to our payment of an extension fee and meeting other conditions, we have the option to extend the stated maturity date of our credit facility for a one-year period. We are required to pay interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a premium of 250 basis points per annum, or at a base rate, as defined in the agreement governing our credit facility, or our credit agreement, plus 150 basis points per annum on borrowings under our credit facility. As of December 31, 2020, the annual interest rate options were 2.64% and 4.75%, respectively. We are also required to pay a quarterly commitment fee of 0.35% per annum on the unused portion of the available borrowings under our credit facility. No principal repayment is due until maturity. 
On January 1, 2020, as part of the Restructuring Transactions, we issued 10,268,158 of our common shares to DHC and an aggregate of 16,118,849 of our common shares to DHC’s shareholders of record as of December 13, 2019. As consideration for the Share Issuances, DHC provided to us $75.0 million of additional consideration by assuming $51.5 million of our working capital liabilities and through cash payments. We received cash of $23.5 million from DHC during the year ended December 31, 2020 as consideration for the Share Issuances.
For more information about our credit facility, see Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
In the future, we may also assume mortgage debt on properties we may acquire, or place mortgages on properties we own or seek to obtain other additional sources of financing, including term debt or issuing equity or debt securities. We currently have mortgage debt that we assumed in connection with a previous acquisition of one of our properties.
Operating Structure
We have four operating divisions. Three of these divisions are headed by an executive vice president at our corporate office and are responsible for senior living communities located in specified geographic regions. These three divisions constitute one of our reporting segments as of January 1, 2020. Each region’s management is responsible for independent living, assisted living and skilled nursing units within its specified region. With extensive experience in the senior living industry, a divisional vice president manages one of our divisions from one of our regional offices. Our regional offices are responsible for the senior living communities we operate within a designated geographic region and are led by regional directors of operations that have extensive experience in the senior living industry. Each of our regional offices is typically supported by a clinical or wellness director, a regional accounts manager, a human resources specialist, a food services specialist and a sales and marketing specialist.

As described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K, we have a business management agreement with RMR LLC, pursuant to which RMR LLC provides to us certain business management services, including services related to compliance with various laws and rules applicable to our status as a publicly-traded company, including our internal audit function, capital markets and financing activities and investor relations.
Human Capital Resources
We are a service organization and our employees, which we call team members, are the foundation of our success and, in many ways, our most important asset. We are led by an experienced management team with a proven ability to manage and grow a resilient business. We focus significant attention on attracting and retaining talented and skilled team members to manage and support our operations. Our management team routinely reviews team member turnover rates at various levels of the organization. 
We aim to attract team members who are uniquely suited to be successful in our business and will uphold our values. Our management teams and all of our team members are expected to exhibit and promote honest, ethical and respectful conduct in the workplace. All of our team members must adhere to a code of conduct that sets standards for appropriate behavior and includes required annual training on preventing, identifying, reporting and stopping any type of unlawful discrimination. 
Employees and Equal Opportunity. As a service provider to a diverse group of residents and clients, much of our success is rooted in our team members’ diversity and our commitment to inclusion. We value diversity at all levels and continue to focus on extending our diversity and inclusion initiatives across our entire workforce, from working with managers to develop strategies for building diverse teams to promoting leaders from different backgrounds. We are an equal opportunity employer, with all qualified applicants receiving consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, disability or protected veteran status. Throughout our organization, including our Board, we are committed to racial equality and fostering diversity and inclusion culture. We have made diversity and inclusion an important part of our hiring process and continue to evolve programs that focus on retention and development. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 77% and 42% of our approximately 19,500 team members were female and non-white, respectively. We are committed to hiring, developing and supporting a diverse and inclusive workplace. As of February 20, 2021, we had approximately 19,000 team members, including approximately 12,000 full time and 7,000 part-time. Approximately 89% of our team members work in our senior living communities, 9% in our rehabilitation and wellness services clinics, and 2% in our corporate office. The average tenure of a team member is approximately 2.1 years. 
Board Diversity. As of December 31, 2020, our Board composition was 43% female.
Team Member Safety. During the year ended December 31, 2020, in response to the Pandemic, we implemented safety protocols and new procedures to protect our team members, our subcontractors and our residents and clients as well as visitors. These protocols include complying with social distancing and other health and safety standards as required by federal, state and local government agencies, taking into consideration guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, and other public health authorities. In addition, we modified the way we conduct many aspects of our business to reduce the number of in-person interactions. For example, we significantly expanded the use of virtual interactions in all aspects of our business, and ensured our team members and subcontractors had adequate personal protective equipment, or PPE, available. During this time, many of our administrative and operational functions have required modification as well, including some of our workforce working remotely. In addition, since the summer of 2020, we have been testing our community and clinic based team members at regular intervals to curb the spread of COVID-19 and, in December 2020 we started making COVID-19 vaccinations available to our team members in our communities and clinics as well as residents. For a detailed discussion of the impact of the Pandemic on our human capital resources, see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Pandemic has had, and may continue to have, a materially adverse effect on our business, operations, financial results and liquidity and its duration is unknown.
Team Member Compensation. We ensure team members receive competitive salaries and we offer a broad range of company-paid benefits, which we believe are competitive with others in our industry. 
Team Member Engagement, Education and Training. Our team member engagement initiatives align with our goal of being an employer of choice with a thriving workforce that encourages career enrichment and positions us for growth. Our recruiting programs, on-boarding and retention programs and our development and ongoing training programs currently include the following:
Team Member Engagement: Management reviews team member engagement and satisfaction surveys to monitor employee morale and receive feedback on a variety of issues.
Rewards: We reward team members for innovation and productivity. We have several recognition programs for team members at various levels of the organization. 
Tuition Reimbursement Program: We offer tuition assistance for work-related education from accredited colleges and universities in order to deepen team members’ skill sets and support personal enrichment. 
We also prioritize ongoing education and training for all team members across our organization as follows:
Training and Development: We offer a robust learning management platform to provide training and development opportunities to all team members. In 2020, team members took an average of approximately 17 hours of training assignments per year. In addition, new hires are assigned 16 hours of general orientation training.
Industry Associations & Credentials: In order to further their professional development, many of our team members seek out credentials or hold professional licenses and association memberships. Examples of credentials, professional licenses and association memberships include: Medical License, Licensed Practical Nurse, Registered Nurse, Certified Medical Assistants, Certified Physical and Occupational Therapists, Speech-Language Pathologist, Certified Fitness Trainers, Cardiopulmonary resuscitation certifications (CPR), First Aid Certification, Law License and Certified Public Accountant accreditations.
Communities and Clinics staffing: Our team members predominately work collaboratively in our communities and clinics that have different staffing requirements further described below: 
Independent and Assisted Living Community Staffing. Each of our independent and assisted living communities has an executive director that is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the applicable community, including quality of care, resident services, sales and marketing, financial performance and staff supervision, as applicable. The executive director is supported by department managers who oversee the care and service of our residents, a wellness director who is responsible for coordinating the services necessary to meet the care needs of our residents and a sales director who is responsible for sales and promoting our services and brand. These communities also typically have a dining services coordinator, an activities coordinator and a property maintenance coordinator.
Skilled Nursing Facility Staffing. Each of our SNFs is managed by a state-licensed administrator who is supported by other professional personnel, including a director of nursing, an activities director, a marketing director, a social services 
director, a business office manager and physical, occupational and speech therapists. Our directors of nursing are state-licensed nurses who supervise our registered nurses, licensed practical nurses and nursing assistants. Staff size and composition vary among our SNFs depending on the size and occupancy of, and the type of care provided at, the applicable SNF. Our SNFs also contract with physicians to serve as Medical Directors who provide certain administrative, clinical and oversight services. These communities also typically have a dining services coordinator and a property maintenance coordinator.
Rehabilitation and Wellness Services Staffing. Each Ageility outpatient clinic is located within an independent living, assisted living or memory care neighborhood within a senior living community. Ageility outpatient clinics are located in select Five Star senior living communities as well as in senior living communities owned, operated or leased by other senior living companies. Each outpatient clinic has a licensed therapist functioning as a rehabilitation director or therapist assistant operating as a team leader who is responsible for operations of a clinic, including quality of care, clinical services, sales and marketing, financial performance and staff supervision. Each outpatient clinic has services available from licensed therapists or certified therapist assistants in the disciplines of physical therapy, occupational therapy and speech pathology. Therapy services are provided under a physician’s order with verified insurance coverage in place prior to beginning services.
Ageility inpatient clinics provide rehabilitation services to Five Star SNF’s under the direction of a licensed therapist acting as a rehabilitation director who is responsible for the therapy operations of the SNF. Licensed therapists or certified therapist assistants in the disciplines of physical therapy, occupational therapy and speech pathology provide therapy as ordered by a physician for residents admitted to a SNF for short-term rehabilitation as well as for those residents requiring rehabilitation services and residing under a long-term care arrangement.
Government Regulation and Reimbursement
The senior living and healthcare industries are subject to extensive, frequently changing federal, state and local laws and regulations. These laws and regulations vary by jurisdiction but may address, among other things, licensure, personnel training, staffing ratios, types and quality of medical care, physical facility requirements, government healthcare program participation, fraud and abuse, payments for patient services and patient records. In addition, the spread of COVID-19, which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, or WHO, on March 11, 2020, brought increased government regulation, as well as compliance burdens, in 2020.
We are subject to, and our operations must comply with, these laws and regulations. From time to time, our senior living communities receive notices from federal, state and local agencies regarding non-compliance with such requirements. Upon receipt of these notices, we review them for accuracy and, based on our review, we either take corrective action or contest the allegation of noncompliance. When corrective action is required, we work with the relevant agency to address and remediate any violations. Challenging and appealing any notices or allegations of noncompliance require the expenditure of significant legal fees and management attention. Any adverse determination concerning any of our licenses or eligibility for Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement, any penalties, repayments or sanctions, and the increasing costs of required compliance with applicable laws may adversely affect our ability to meet our financial obligations and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. Also, adverse findings with regard to any one of our senior living communities may have an adverse impact on our licensing and ability to operate and attract residents to other senior living communities.

The healthcare industry depends significantly upon federal and state programs for revenues and, as a result, is affected by the budgetary policies of both the federal and state governments. Reimbursements under the Medicare and Medicaid programs for skilled nursing, physical therapy and rehabilitation and wellness services provided operating revenues at our outpatient clinics and some of our senior living communities (principally our SNFs). Out of our total senior living and rehabilitation and wellness services revenues, we derived approximately 26.4% and 21.3% from Medicare and Medicaid programs for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Specific to our senior living revenues, we derived approximately 1.8% and 19.7% from Medicare and Medicaid programs for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Specific to our rehabilitation and wellness services revenues, we derived approximately 49.4% and 55.9%, from Medicare and Medicaid programs for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Out of the total revenues earned at senior living communities we manage on behalf of DHC, they derived approximately 14.4% and 6.8% from Medicare and Medicaid programs for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
In addition to existing government regulation, we are aware of numerous healthcare regulatory initiatives and fair housing laws on the federal, state and local levels, which may affect our business operations if implemented.
COVID Pandemic. On March 13, 2020, the Pandemic was declared a National Emergency by the President of the United States effective as of March 1, 2020, and it has significantly disrupted, and likely will continue to significantly disrupt, 
the United States economy, our business and the senior living industry as a whole. Federal and state governments have taken a number of actions in response. For example:
•On March 13, 2020, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, issued a memorandum that required nursing homes to follow the CDC guidelines to, among other things, limit access to nursing homes by visitors and non-essential personnel, increase the availability of certain supplies and cancel all communal activities. On March 23, 2020, CMS issued guidance that temporarily amended the state survey inspection process for nursing homes to target and assess compliance with CDC-recommended infection control measures. On April 2, 2020, CMS issued further guidance instructing nursing homes to immediately implement symptom screening for all staff, residents and visitors, and ensure staff is using appropriate PPE when interacting with residents. The guidance also suggests that nursing homes use separate staffing teams for residents who have tested positive for COVID-19 and those who have tested negative for COVID-19.
•In 2020, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, and CMS issued several waivers applicable to long-term care facilities, including SNFs, retroactive to March 1, 2020, and in effect through the end of the National Emergency. Under the waivers, for example: (1) the requirement that covered SNF care be preceded by an inpatient hospital stay of at least three days’ duration is waived for those Medicare beneficiaries who need to be transferred as a result of the Pandemic; (2) SNF coverage is renewed for certain Medicare beneficiaries with recently exhausted SNF benefits; (3) certain requirements related to the submission of staffing data, preadmission screenings, in-person resident groups, certain nurse aide training, and long term care facility transfer and discharge protocols is waived; (4) certain physical environment requirements are waived to allow non-SNF buildings to be temporarily certified and non-resident rooms to be used for patients; (5) the requirement for physicians and non-physician practitioners to perform in-person visits for residents is waived to allow telehealth visits, as appropriate; and (6) hospitals are permitted to establish SNF beds, allowing patients that would otherwise be transferred to a post-acute care facility to remain in hospitals.
•On May 8, 2020, CMS published an interim final rule that set forth new COVID-19 reporting requirements for SNFs, among other requirements. SNFs are required to electronically submit weekly reports to the CDC, which must include data on a number of measures, including suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infections among residents and staff, total deaths and COVID-19 deaths among residents and staff, ventilator capacity and supplies, resident beds and census, access to COVID-19 testing and staffing shortages. SNFs are also required to promptly notify residents, family members and representatives of confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases in the facility. Facilities may face enforcement action, including civil monetary penalties, for failure to comply with these new reporting requirements. 
•On May 18, 2020, CMS issued recommendations to state and local officials for the reopening of SNFs, relying on a number of factors, including whether COVID-19 cases are increasing or declining in the geographic area and at SNFs, the adequacy of staffing, supplies and access to COVID-19 testing, as well as local hospital capacity. These guidelines are not binding for states, and some states may be more aggressive in permitting the reopening of SNFs, while others may take a more conservative approach. CMS continued to issue guidance on facilitating outdoor and indoor visitation in June 2020 and September 2020.
•In May 2020, the HHS Office of Inspector General, or OIG, announced its updated work plan featuring several SNF-focused items, including, for example, reviews of on-site surveys during the Pandemic and audits of nursing home infection prevention and control programs, and OIG announced a COVID-19 Response Strategic Plan focused on potential fraud, waste and abuse that may arise out of COVID-19 response and recovery programs. OIG has further updated its work plan to include, among other items, a review of compliance with facility-initiated discharge requirements and audits of nursing home reporting of COVID-19 information and Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, Provider Relief Fund payments.
•On June 1, 2020, CMS announced enhanced enforcement for SNFs with violations of infection control practices. Specifically, CMS has increased enforcement, including civil monetary penalties, for facilities with persistent infection control violations and will be imposing enforcement actions on lower-level deficiencies to ensure they are addressed. Additional on-site surveys of SNFs with previous COVID-19 outbreaks or new COVID-19 suspected and confirmed cases would be performed.
•On August 25, 2020, CMS published an interim final rule that set forth new COVID-19 testing requirements for long-term care facility residents and staff. CMS offered guidance on testing residents and staff in cases where a symptomatic individual is identified, where there is an outbreak and where community COVID-19 activity 
dictates routine testing, as well as guidance on documentation to demonstrate compliance with testing requirements. The interim rule also enhanced CMS’s ability to enforce previously issued long-term care facility COVID-19 reporting requirements by imposing civil monetary penalties for failure to report required data to the CDC.
•On October 28, 2020, CMS published an interim final rule that, among other items, clarified its interpretation that the CARES Act provided Medicare Part B coverage and the payment for COVID-19 vaccine and administration. 
•In response to a rising number of complaints and lawsuits against senior living communities, certain state Attorneys General have continued efforts to increase scrutiny of long-term care facilities. While these investigations and initiatives have been related to the Pandemic, they have focused on a broad range of alleged misconduct that extends beyond facility responses to the Pandemic, including both civil and criminal theories of liability related to patient abuse and neglect, consumer fraud and false advertising and Medicaid fraud.
In addition, the CARES Act was signed into law on March 27, 2020. The CARES Act, among other things, provides billions of dollars of relief to certain individuals and businesses suffering from the Pandemic, including as follows:
•It temporarily suspended the 2% Medicare sequestration payment reductions from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020. This suspension was extended to March 31, 2021 as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, which was signed into law on December 27, 2020.
•It established a Provider Relief Fund for allocation by HHS. On April 10, 2020, HHS began to distribute these funds, or the General Distribution, to healthcare providers who received Medicare fee-for-service reimbursement in 2018 and 2019. On May 22, 2020, HHS announced that Provider Relief Funds would be available to SNFs with six or more certified beds that have been impacted by the Pandemic, or the Targeted SNF Distribution. On June 9, 2020, HHS announced Phase 2 General Distributions, including the Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program, or the Medicaid and CHIP Targeted Distribution. On September 3, 2020, HHS announced details of a $2 billion incentive-payment distribution to nursing homes, of which approximately $333 million was distributed in the first round and $523 million in the second round. On October 1, 2020, HHS announced Phase 3 General Distributions, intended to balance payments of 2% of annual revenue from patient care for all applicants plus a possible add-on payment to account for revenue losses and expenses attributable to COVID-19. 
•It established an option for companies to elect to defer payment of the employer portion of social security payroll taxes incurred from March 27, 2020 to December 31, 2020. The first half of the deferred payments will become due on December 31, 2021, with the remainder due December 31, 2022.
In addition, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 was signed into law on December 27, 2020. Among other things, this Act further supplemented the Provider Relief Fund with an additional $3 billion. Information on future allocations of the Provider Relief Fund are not yet known, though the statute requires that no less than 85% of unobligated balances of the fund and funds recovered from providers after the enactment date be allocated based on financial losses and changes in operating expenses occurring in the third or fourth quarter of calendar year 2020.
We elected to defer payment of the employer portion of social security payroll taxes incurred from March 27, 2020 to December 31, 2020 as provided for under the CARES Act. In addition, we have received funds as part of certain relief programs provided under the CARES Act. The terms and conditions of the Provider Relief Fund require that the funds are utilized to compensate for lost revenues that are attributable to the Pandemic and for eligible costs to prevent, prepare for and respond to the Pandemic that are not covered by other sources. In addition, Provider Relief Fund recipients are subject to other terms and conditions, including certain reporting requirements. Any funds not used in accordance with the terms and conditions must be returned to HHS. Receipt of additional government funds and other benefits from the CARES Act is subject to, in certain circumstances, a detailed application and approval process and it is too soon to accurately predict whether we will meet any eligibility requirements.
 We received $1.7 million in Phase 1 General Distribution funds for rehabilitation and wellness services clinics and home health operations that participate in Medicare for the year ended December 31, 2020. We recognized $1.7 million as other operating income for Phase 1 General Distribution funds for which we have met the required terms and conditions for the year ended December 31, 2020. We received $1.6 million in Phase 2 General Distribution funds primarily for our senior living communities for the year ended December 31, 2020. We recognized $1.6 million as other operating income for Phase 2 General Distribution funds for which we have met the required terms and conditions for the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, we recognized $0.1 million as other operating income from funding we received from various state programs for which we 
believe we have met the required terms and conditions, and also recognized $0.1 million as other operating income for the fair market value of rapid point-of-care diagnostic testing devices and COVID-19 test kits that we received and used for testing from the federal government.
For more information about COVID-19 relief funds, see Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
In addition to federal measures, many states have taken actions to waive or modify healthcare laws or regulations and Medicaid reimbursement rules. Both state and federal waivers and other temporary actions in response to the Pandemic are expected to last throughout the National Emergency, the duration of which is currently unknown. Additional measures may be taken prior to and after the conclusion of the National Emergency to alleviate the economic impact of the Pandemic. Governmental responses to COVID-19 are rapidly evolving, and it is not yet known what the duration or impact of such responses will be.
On December 11 and December 18, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, issued the emergency use authorizations, or the EUAs, to Pfizer Inc. / BioNTech SE and Moderna, Inc., respectively, for vaccines for the prevention of COVID-19. The CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has placed long-term care facility residents and healthcare personnel in “Phase 1a,” the highest priority group to receive COVID-19 vaccines, which included residents and team members at our SNFs, memory care units and assisted living communities. States have subsequently prioritized all categories of older adults, which include our independent living facilities. In order to protect the health and safety of our residents, team members and clients, we scheduled multiple vaccination clinics as soon as possible after the EUAs for our SNF, memory care and assisted living residents and team members at no cost to those individuals. As of February 20, 2021, 87.2% of our residents and 42.5% of our team members at our senior living communities had received their initial dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, and 52.7% of our residents and 26.9% of our team members had received their second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. As of February 20, 2021, 249 senior living communities have held a vaccination clinic for the initial dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, and 183 senior living communities have also held a vaccination clinic for the second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Despite these efforts and the issuances of these EUAs, and potentially others for additional vaccines in the future, it is expected that throughout the first quarter of 2021 substantially all residents and team members in our senior living communities will have been offered the opportunity to be vaccinated. In addition, we may be subject to claims by residents and team members related to vaccine administration by us or the care provided by us following administration of the vaccine. However, such liability is currently limited by the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act, which provides immunity protections under federal and state law for individuals and entities, or Covered Persons, against claims of loss relating to certain COVID-19 countermeasures, or Covered Countermeasures, although such protections are currently subject to challenges in certain courts. We and our team members who administer Covered Countermeasures such as the COVID-19 vaccine are classified as Covered Persons immune to claims arising from COVID-19 vaccine administration with the exception of death or serious physical injury caused by willful misconduct.
Independent Living Communities - Regulation and Reimbursement. Government benefits are not generally available for services at independent living communities, and residents in those communities use private resources to pay for their living units and the services they receive. The rates in these communities are determined by local market conditions and operating costs. However, a number of federal Supplemental Security Income program benefits pay housing costs for elderly or disabled recipients to live in these types of residential communities. The Social Security Act requires states to certify that they will establish and enforce standards for any category of group living arrangement in which a significant number of Supplemental Security Income recipients reside or are likely to reside. Categories of living arrangements that may be subject to these state standards include independent living communities and assisted living communities. Because independent living communities usually offer common dining facilities, they are required to obtain licenses applicable to food service establishments in many jurisdictions in addition to complying with land use and life safety requirements. In addition, in some states, state or county health departments, social service agencies and/or offices on aging have jurisdiction over group residential communities for older adults and license independent living communities. To the extent that independent living communities include units to which assisted living or nursing services are provided, these units are subject to applicable state licensing regulations. If the communities receive Medicaid or Medicare funds, they are subject to certification standards and requirements that they must meet, or the Conditions of Participation. In some states, insurance or consumer protection agencies regulate independent living communities in which residents pay entrance fees or prepay for services.
Assisted Living Communities - Regulation and Reimbursement. A majority of states provide or are approved to provide Medicaid payments for personal care and medical services to some residents in licensed assisted living communities under waivers granted by or under Medicaid state plans approved by CMS. State Medicaid programs control costs for assisted living and other home and community-based services by various means. Because rates paid to assisted living community operators are generally lower than rates paid to SNF operators, some states use Medicaid funding of assisted living as a means 
of lowering the cost of services for residents who may not need the higher level of services provided in SNFs. States that administer Medicaid programs for services in assisted living communities are responsible for monitoring the services at, and physical conditions of, the participating communities.
As a result of a large number of states using Medicaid funds to purchase services at assisted living communities and the growth of assisted living in recent years, states have adopted licensing standards applicable to assisted living communities. According to the National Center for Assisted Living and the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, all states regulate assisted living and residential care communities, although states do not use a uniform approach. Most state licensing standards apply to assisted living communities regardless of whether they accept Medicaid funding. Also, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a few states require certificates of need, or CONs, from state health planning authorities before new assisted living communities may be developed. Based on our analysis of recent economic and regulatory trends, we believe that assisted living communities that become dependent upon Medicaid or other government payments for a majority of their revenues may decline in value because Medicaid and other public rates may fail to keep up with increasing costs. We also believe that assisted living communities located in states that adopt CON requirements or other limitations on the development of new assisted living communities may increase in value because those limitations may help ensure higher nongovernment rates and reduced competition.
HHS, the Senate Special Committee on Aging and the Government Accountability Office, or the GAO, have studied and reported on the development of assisted living and its role in the continuum of long-term care and as an alternative to SNFs. In addition, CMS has oversight of state quality assurance programs for assisted living communities and provides guidance and technical assistance to states to improve their ability to monitor and improve the quality of services paid for through Medicaid waiver programs.
CMS is encouraging state Medicaid programs to expand their use of home and community-based services as alternatives to institutional services, pursuant to provisions of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, or the DRA, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the ACA, and other authorities, through the use of several programs. One such program, the Community First Choice Option, or the CFC Option, grants states that choose to participate in the program a 6% increase in federal matching payments for related medical assistance expenditures. According to CMS, as of January 2019, eight states had approved CFC Option programs. We are unable to predict the effect of the implementation of the CFC Option and other similar programs, but their impact may be adverse and material to our operations and our future financial results of operations.
Skilled Nursing Facilities - Medicare Reimbursement. Currently, we only manage SNFs and we are not the licensed operators of such SNFs. As of December 31, 2020, we managed nine SNFs. A majority of all SNF revenues in the United States comes from publicly funded programs. According to CMS, Medicaid is the largest source of public funding for SNFs, followed by Medicare. For example, nationally in 2019 approximately 29% of SNF and continuing care retirement community revenues came from Medicaid and approximately 22% from Medicare. 
SNFs are highly regulated businesses. The federal and state governments regularly monitor the quality of care provided at SNFs. State health departments conduct surveys of resident care and inspect the physical condition of SNF properties. These periodic inspections and occasional changes in life safety and physical plant requirements sometimes require SNF operators to make significant capital improvements. These mandated capital improvements have usually resulted in Medicare and Medicaid rate adjustments, albeit on the basis of amortization of expenditures over the expected useful lives of the improvements. 
Under the Medicare SNF prospective payment system, or SNF PPS, capital costs are part of the prospective rate and are not community-specific. The SNF PPS and other recent legislative and regulatory actions with respect to state Medicaid rates limit the reimbursement levels for some SNF services. At the same time, federal and state enforcement agencies have increased oversight of SNFs, making licensing and certification of these communities more rigorous.
Under the SNF PPS, SNFs receive a fixed payment for each day of care provided to residents who are Medicare beneficiaries. Medicare SNF PPS payments cover substantially all services provided to Medicare residents in SNFs, including ancillary services such as rehabilitation services. The SNF PPS historically required SNFs to assign each resident to a care group depending on that resident’s medical characteristics and service needs. These care groups were known as Resource Utilization Groups, or RUGs, and CMS establishes a per diem payment rate for each RUG.
On October 1, 2019, CMS replaced the RUG model, with a revised case-mix methodology called the Patient-Driven Payment Model, or PDPM. The PDPM focuses on clinically relevant factors, rather than volume-based payment. Therapy 
reimbursement under the PDPM is linked to patient diagnoses with higher reimbursements being provided to higher-acuity patients. As a result, initial patient assessments, including obtaining full clinical documentation from hospitals and accurately applying the International Classification of Diseases, or ICD-10, diagnosis codes to reflect a patient’s full clinical status, have become increasingly important factors in reimbursement. CMS estimates that paperwork simplification related to patient assessments will reduce reporting burdens for SNFs by approximately $2.0 billion over ten years. 

On July 31, 2020, CMS issued the latest SNF prospective payment system final rule for federal fiscal year 2020, which CMS estimates will increase Medicare payments to SNFs by approximately $750 million for federal fiscal year 2021, or 2.2%, compared to federal fiscal year 2020. It is unclear whether these adjustments in Medicare rates will compensate for the increased costs we may incur for services to our residents whose services are paid for by Medicare. The final rule also made changes to certain clinical diagnosis codes included in patient case-mix groups that determine the rate paid under the PDPM, formalized deadlines related to quarterly quality reporting under Medicare’s SNF Value-Based Payment Program, and established performance periods and performance standards for upcoming program years. 
The Budget Control Act of 2011 and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 allow for automatic reductions in federal spending by means of a process called sequestration, which reduces Medicare payment rates by 2.0% through 2023. In subsequent years, Congress approved additional extensions of Medicare sequestration, through 2029. Medicaid is exempt from the automatic reductions, as are certain Medicare benefits. The automatic 2.0% payment cuts took effect in April 2013. Any future reductions in Medicare payment rates could be adverse and material to our operations and financial results. 
We are unable to predict the impact on us of these or other recent legislative or regulatory actions or proposed actions with respect to Medicare rates received by our facilities.

Skilled Nursing Facilities - Medicaid Reimbursement. Although Medicaid is exempt from the sequestration process described above, some of the states in which we operate either have not raised Medicaid rates by amounts sufficient to offset increasing costs or have frozen or reduced, or are expected to freeze or reduce, Medicaid rates. Some states are expanding their use of managed care, partly to control Medicaid program costs. According to a report by the CMS Office of the Actuary in February 2018, Medicaid enrollment is estimated to have increased 11.9% in 2014, 4.9% in 2015, 3.0% in 2016, and 2.0% in 2017, due primarily to the expansion in Medicaid eligibility under the ACA, which began in 2014. According to a Kaiser Family Foundation report published in October 2020, in 2018 and 2019, Medicaid enrollment declined 2.1% and 1.7%, respectively, and was relatively flat in 2020, increasing 0.04%. As reported, enrollment is projected to increase significantly to 8.2% in 2021, which increase in growth we believe is due to the economic downturn associated with the Pandemic and temporary maintenance of eligibility requirements that incentivize states to allow more residents to remain enrolled in Medicaid.
In January 2018, CMS issued a letter to State Medicaid Directors announcing that CMS would support state efforts to test incentives that make participation in work or other community engagement a requirement for continued Medicaid eligibility for non-elderly, non-pregnant adults. States would be required to have exemptions for individuals who are classified as “disabled” for Medicaid eligibility purposes, as well as those with acute medical conditions or medical frailty that would prevent them from complying with the work requirement. As of December 2020, work requirements in Arkansas, Kentucky, Michigan and New Hampshire had been set aside by courts. Arizona, Georgia, Indiana, Nebraska, Ohio, South Carolina, Utah and Wisconsin have received CMS approval but have not yet implemented or have suspended implementation of work requirements. In addition, Alabama, Idaho, Mississippi, Montana, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Tennessee have submitted requests to modify their respective state Medicaid plans to include work requirements. The implementation of work requirements, if it were to occur, may reduce the availability of Medicaid coverage within our patient population. Additionally, the Biden administration has indicated that it will seek to reverse the January 2018 guidance and prohibit states from implementing work requirements. In February 2021, CMS, in response to guidance from the Biden administration, began notifying states that it is determining whether to withdraw the approvals that permitted states to implement work requirements. 
We expect state budgetary pressures to result in continued challenging state fiscal conditions, particularly in those states that are not participating in Medicaid expansion. As a result, some state budget deficits may increase, and certain states may continue to reduce Medicaid payments to healthcare providers like us as part of an effort to balance their budgets. These state level cuts have the potential to negatively impact our revenue from Medicaid sources.
We are unable to predict the impact on us of these or other recent legislative and regulatory actions or proposed actions with respect to state Medicaid rates, the federal payments to states for Medicaid programs, Medicaid program design and Medicaid eligibility standards.
Skilled Nursing Facilities - Quality Improvement, Pay-for-Performance and Value-Based Purchasing Initiatives. In addition to the reimbursement and rate changes discussed above, payments to SNFs will be increasingly determined by the quality of care provided. The federal government has enhanced its focus on developing and imposing quality-related regulations, standards and programs to improve the quality of care provided at SNFs and to better align payment to quality outcomes. As mandated by the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, or MACRA, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, or PAMA, and the Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation Act of 2014, or the IMPACT Act, CMS established the SNF Value-Based Purchasing Program and the SNF Quality Reporting Program to achieve these goals. 
The IMPACT Act established the SNF Quality Reporting Program under which SNFs are required to report certain quality measures and resource use measures in a standardized and interoperable format and to report certain patient assessment data in such a format. SNFs that fail to comply with the reporting requirements by the established times are subject to a 2% reduction in their Medicare payment rates for that fiscal year. SNF Quality Reporting Program data is publicly available on CMS’ Nursing Home Compare website.
PAMA established the SNF Value-Based Purchasing Program, under which HHS will assess SNFs based on hospital readmissions and make these assessments available to the public. CMS has adopted an all-condition, risk-adjusted potentially preventable hospital readmission rate measure for SNFs. Beginning in federal fiscal year 2019, Medicare payment rates are partially based on SNFs’ performance scores on this measure. The 2020 federal fiscal year update adopted two new quality measures to assess whether certain health information is provided by the SNF at the time of transfer or discharge. The update also adopted several standardized patient assessment data elements. To fund the program, CMS reduces Medicare payments to all SNFs by 2% through a withhold mechanism and then redistributes between 50% to 70% of the withheld payments as incentive payments to those SNFs with the highest rankings on this measure. CMS estimates that the federal fiscal year 2021 changes to the SNF Value-Based Purchasing program will decrease payments to SNFs by an aggregate of approximately $200 million, compared to federal fiscal year 2020. 

As these quality improvement initiatives increase in size and scope, the federal government will likely monitor the impact of these programs more closely. We are unable to predict the impact of these quality improvement initiatives on our Medicare reimbursement rates or the cost of our SNFs’ operations. 
Other legislative proposals introduced in Congress, proposed by federal or state agencies or under consideration by some state governments include the option of block grants for states rather than federal matching money for certain state Medicaid services, laws authorizing or directing Medicare to negotiate rate reductions for prescription drugs, additional Medicare and Medicaid enforcement procedures and federal and state cost-containment measures, such as freezing Medicare or Medicaid SNF payment rates at their current levels and reducing or eliminating annual Medicare or Medicaid inflation allowances or gradually reducing rates for SNFs. We cannot estimate the type or magnitude of the potential Medicare and Medicaid policy changes, rate reductions or other changes and the impact on us of the possible failure of these programs to increase rates to match our increasing expenses, but they may be material to and adversely affect our future results of operations. 
Skilled Nursing Facilities – Conditions of Participation. CMS maintains and enforces Conditions of Participation that healthcare organizations must meet in order to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. These standards are designed to improve the quality of care and protect the health and safety of beneficiaries. Through the Conditions of Participation, CMS is able to require certain quality standards protocols, including most recently, requiring SNFs to implement a quality assurance and performance improvement program.
In November 2016, CMS instituted a comprehensive update to the Conditions of Participation for long-term care facilities that participate in Medicare and Medicaid, such as our SNFs, which included a broad range of new requirements, some of which stem from statutory modifications under the ACA and the IMPACT Act.
In July 2019, CMS announced two rules - one final and one proposed - to further update requirements that long-term care facilities that participate in Medicare and Medicaid must meet. Specifically, the final rule repeals the prohibition on the use of pre-dispute, binding arbitration agreements by long-term care facilities. The final rule also imposes certain safeguards intended to increase the transparency of arbitration agreements used by long-term care facilities, as well as the related arbitration process, including mandating that a facility not require any resident or his or her representative to sign an arbitration agreement as a condition of admission to the facility. Under the proposed rule, CMS proposes to further reform the requirements for long-term care facilities by eliminating or reducing certain requirements deemed unnecessary, obsolete, or excessively burdensome. Notably, CMS put forward proposals to modify certain requirements related to grievance policies, infection control staffing, and compliance program requirements, among other changes. As of February 20, 2021, this proposed 
rule has not been finalized. We cannot estimate the type or magnitude of the potential Medicare and Medicaid policy changes, but they may be material to and adversely affect our future results of operations.
Skilled Nursing Facilities - Survey and Enforcement. The OIG has issued several reports concerning quality of care and billing practices in SNFs, and the GAO has issued several reports recommending that CMS and states strengthen their compliance and enforcement practices, including federal oversight of state actions and to ensure that SNFs provide adequate care and states act more consistently. Moreover, the OIG has publicly stated that it will review compliance with various aspects of the SNF PPS, including the documentation requirement in support of claims paid by Medicare, and assess the incidence of serious quality of care issues, such as abuse and neglect. In recent years, the OIG and the GAO have also repeatedly called for increased oversight and payment system reform for SNFs.
In addition to scrutiny from the GAO and the OIG, the Senate Special Committee on Aging and other congressional committees have also held hearings on related SNF issues. As a result, CMS has undertaken several initiatives to increase the effectiveness of Medicare and Medicaid SNF survey and enforcement activities. CMS has been taking steps to identify and focus enforcement efforts on SNFs and chains of SNF operators with findings of substandard care or repeat violations of Medicare and Medicaid standards. CMS has also increased its oversight of state survey agencies and has improved the process by which data is captured from these surveys. As an added measure of improving patient care, the ACA provides for the funding of a state background check system for job applicants to long-term care providers who will have direct access to patients. CMS has begun the administration of this program, and, as of October 2020, had awarded funding to approximately half of the states.
In addition, CMS adopted regulations expanding federal and state authority to impose civil monetary penalties in instances of noncompliance. When CMS or state agencies identify deficiencies under state licensing and Medicare and Medicaid standards, they may impose sanctions and remedies such as denials of payment for new Medicare and Medicaid admissions, civil monetary penalties, state oversight, temporary management or receivership and loss of Medicare and Medicaid participation or licensure on SNF operators. Our senior living communities may incur sanctions and penalties from time to time. If we are unable to cure deficiencies that have been identified or that are identified in the future, or if appeals of proposed sanctions or penalties are not successful, decertification or additional sanctions or penalties may be imposed. These consequences may adversely affect our ability to meet our financial obligations and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Therapy Services – Provider Reimbursement. Our rehabilitation and wellness segment, including Ageility, provides various therapy services, including physical therapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy. The outpatient therapy revenue received by our providers is tied to the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule, or MPFS, which has historically been subject to limitations on the amount of therapy services that can be provided, as well as limitations on annual cost growth. For example, in 2006, Medicare payments for outpatient therapies became subject to payment limits. The DRA created an exception process under which beneficiaries could request an exception from the cap and be granted the amount of services deemed medically necessary by Medicare, while the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 permanently repealed the caps, effective January 1, 2018.
CMS has implemented a Merit-Based Incentive Payment System, or MIPS, and Advanced Alternative Payment Models, or APMs, which together CMS calls the Quality Payment Program. These reforms were mandated under MACRA and replace the Sustainable Growth Rate, or SGR, methodology for calculating updates to the MPFS. Starting in 2019, providers may be subject to either MIPS payment adjustments or APM incentive payments. MIPS consolidates the various CMS incentive and quality programs into a single reporting mechanism. Providers will receive either incentive payments or reimbursement cuts based on their compliance with MIPS requirements and their performance against a mean and median threshold of all MIPS eligible providers. CMS expanded the definition of MIPS-eligible clinicians to include physical and occupational therapists. APMs are innovative models approved by CMS for paying healthcare providers for services provided to Medicare beneficiaries that draw on existing programs, such as the bundled payment and shared savings models. 
In addition, under MACRA, there have been and will be MPFS conversion factor updates. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 reduced the conversion factor for 2019 from 0.5% to 0.25%. For 2020 through 2025, the conversion factor will be further reduced to 0.0%. 
In November 2019, CMS published a final rule that updates the MPFS for the calendar year 2020 and changed other Medicare Part B policies. In particular, the rule continued to implement a statutory requirement that claim modifiers be used to identify certain therapy services that are furnished in whole or in part by physical therapy assistants, or PTAs, and occupational therapy assistants, or OTAs, beginning January 1, 2020. CMS has adopted a standard that, when more than 10% of the service is furnished by a PTA or OTA, then the service is considered to be furnished “in whole or in part” by a PTA or OTA. CMS proposes to base the 10% calculation on the therapeutic minutes of time spent by the therapist versus a PTA or OTA. Beginning 
January 1, 2022, claims that contain a therapy assistant modifier will be paid at 85% of the otherwise applicable payment amount.
In December 2020, CMS published a final rule that updates the MPFS for the calendar year 2021. Amongst other changes, the rule adds certain services to the Medicare Telehealth Services list, either permanently or for the duration of the National Emergency, and reduces the frequency limitations for nursing facility care services delivered through telehealth. The final rule also includes increases to certain visit codes, including evaluation and management services. However, in order to maintain mandatory budget neutrality, these increases are offset by a decrease in the PFS conversion factor. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, signed into law on December 27, 2020 further revised the PFS conversion factor to have a less substantial decrease, with such revision expected to result in a 3% decrease in reimbursement for therapy services. 
Our Medicare Part B outpatient therapy provider revenue rates are tied to the MPFS and may be affected by these modifications; however, we are unable to predict the impact of these modifications on the Medicare rates received by our providers.

Furthermore, physical therapy, occupational therapy and speech, hearing and language disorder services are optional benefits under Medicaid and thus states may choose whether or not to provide coverage of such benefits. We expect states will continue to experience budgetary pressures, and certain states may choose these services to be cut to reduce Medicaid spending; however, we are unable to predict whether such cuts will occur and the impact of such cuts on us.
Certificates of Need. As a mechanism to prevent overbuilding and subsequent healthcare price inflation, many states limit the number of SNFs by requiring developers to obtain certificates of need, or CONs, before new facilities may be built or additional beds may be added to existing facilities. As noted above, a few states also limit the number of assisted living facilities by requiring CONs. In addition, some states (such as California and Texas) that have eliminated CON laws have retained other means of limiting new development, including moratoria, licensing laws or limitations upon participation in the state Medicaid program. These government requirements limit expansion, which we believe may make existing SNFs more valuable by limiting competition.
Healthcare Reform. The ACA has resulted in changes to insurance, payment systems and healthcare delivery systems. The ACA was intended to expand access to health insurance coverage, including the expansion of access to Medicaid coverage, and reduce the growth of healthcare expenditures while simultaneously maintaining or improving the quality of healthcare. The ACA also encouraged the development and testing of bundled payment for services models, the development of Medicare value-based purchasing plans as well as several initiatives to encourage states to develop and expand home and community-based services under Medicaid. Some of the provisions of the ACA took effect immediately, whereas others took effect or will take effect at later dates. Recently, the ACA has been subject to significant reform, repeal and revision efforts by the executive and legislative branches of the federal government and subject to changes resulting from lawsuits filed with the judicial branch of the federal government. It is unclear what the result of any of these legislative, executive and regulatory reform efforts may be or the effect they may have on us, if any. For example:
•In 2018, the ACA was also subject to lawsuits that sought to invalidate some or all of its provisions. In February 2018, a lawsuit brought in federal district court in Texas by 18 attorneys general and two governors argued that, following the legislative repeal of the ACA mandate’s tax penalties by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (which set the penalty to $0), the entire ACA should be enjoined as invalid. On December 14, 2018, the district court found that the ACA, following the mandate repeal, was unconstitutional. Following the ruling, additional state attorneys general intervened as defendants in the case and on December 30, 2018, the court granted the intervenor defendants’ request for a stay pending appeal.
•In January 2019, the Department of Justice, or the DOJ, and the intervenor defendants appealed the district court’s 2018 decision to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. On December 18, 2019, a three-judge panel of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held in a 2-1 opinion that the ACA’s individual mandate was unconstitutional, but, rather than determining whether the remainder of the ACA is valid, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals remanded the case for additional analysis on severability. In March 2020, the Supreme Court agreed to review the case and oral arguments were held on November 10, 2020.
The effect of the transition from the Trump administration to the Biden administration in January 2021 on the ACA is unknown at this time. If the ACA is repealed, replaced or modified, additional regulatory risks may arise and our future financial results could be adversely and materially affected. We are unable to predict the impact of these or other recent legislative and regulatory actions or proposed actions with respect to state Medicaid rates and federal Medicare rates and federal payments to states for Medicaid programs discussed above on us. The changes implemented or to be implemented as a result of 
such actions could result in the failure of Medicare, Medicaid or private payment reimbursement rates to cover increasing costs, in a reduction in payments or other circumstances.
Regulatory Reform. In the fall of 2020, the Trump administration, including HHS, updated its “Unified Agenda of Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions,” which lists the scope and anticipated timing of pending and future regulations. In releasing the agenda, the Administration highlighted its “ongoing progress toward the goals of more effective and less burdensome regulation." It is unclear how these regulatory reform efforts will impact our operations or whether the Biden administration will continue these efforts. Some of the regulatory updates described above may in the future, be repealed, replaced or modified as a result of these regulatory reform efforts, if such efforts continue. For instance, in the latest update, HHS notes CMS's efforts to assist healthcare providers and suppliers in responding to the National Emergency through its issuance of regulatory waivers and other flexibilities. CMS has identified some of these waivers as opportunities to eliminate the burden permanently.
We are unable to predict the impact on us of these or other regulatory reform efforts. While these efforts could ultimately decrease the regulatory burden for our operations in the long-term, they may increase regulatory uncertainty in the near term.
Enforcement. Federal and state efforts to target false claims, fraud and abuse and violations of anti‑kickback, physician referral (including the Ethics in Patient Referrals Act of 1989), privacy and consumer protection laws by providers under Medicare, Medicaid and other public and private programs have increased in recent years, as have civil monetary penalties, treble damages, repayment requirements and criminal sanctions for noncompliance. The FCA, as amended and expanded by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, and the ACA, provides significant civil monetary penalties and treble damages for false claims and authorizes individuals to bring claims on behalf of the federal government for false claims and earn a percentage of the government's recovery should the government intervene. These incentives have led to a steady increase in whistleblower actions. The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law authorizes the Secretary of HHS to impose substantial civil penalties, treble damages and program exclusions administratively for false claims or violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. In addition, the ACA increased penalties under federal sentencing guidelines by between 20% and 50% for healthcare fraud offenses involving more than $1.0 million. State Attorneys General typically enforce consumer protection laws relating to senior living services, clinics and other healthcare facilities.
Government authorities are devoting increasing attention and resources to the prevention, detection and prosecution of healthcare fraud and abuse. The OIG has guidelines for SNFs intended to assist them in developing voluntary compliance programs to prevent fraud and abuse. CMS contractors are also expanding the retroactive audits of Medicare claims submitted by SNFs and other providers, and recouping alleged overpayments for services determined by auditors not to have been medically necessary or not to meet Medicare coverage criteria as billed. State Medicaid programs and other third-party payers are conducting similar medical necessity and compliance audits. 
In addition, federal agencies have announced intentions to enhance enforcement efforts to improve the quality and safety of care in nursing homes, which will impact our operations and increase our operating costs. For example, in accordance with the previously announced attention by CMS regarding the overuse of antipsychotics in nursing homes, CMS stated its intention to use civil monetary penalties and denial of Medicare reimbursement to penalize nursing homes that fail to adopt strategies to lower medically-unnecessary use of antipsychotic medications. Further, the DOJ announced a National Nursing Home Initiative to pursue civil and criminal penalties against “nursing homes that provide grossly substandard care to their residents.” The DOJ stated that it would consider a number of factors in identifying problematic nursing homes, including:
(1) consistent failure to provide adequate nursing staff; (2) failure to adhere to basic protocols for hygiene and infection control; (3) failure to provide sufficient food to residents; (4) withholding of pain medication; and (5) use of physical or chemical restraints to restrain or sedate residents.
The ACA facilitates the DOJ’s ability to investigate allegations of wrongdoing or fraud at SNFs, in part because of increased cooperation and data sharing among CMS, the OIG, the DOJ and the states. On October 20, 2020, the DOJ issued its Annual Report to Congress on its Work to Combat Elder Fraud and Abuse, highlighting among its nursing home cases a $15.0 million settlement and Corporate Integrity Agreement resolving False Claims Act allegations regarding medically unnecessary rehabilitation services. The significant nature of the settlement indicates that the federal government is increasingly focused on the appropriateness of billing practices of, and medical necessity of services provided at, SNFs. The DOJ has also established 10 regional intergovernmental Elder Justice Task Forces across the country to identify and take enforcement action against SNFs that provide substandard care to residents. In September 2019, the DOJ announced that it intends to identify criminal charges, such as wire fraud or healthcare fraud, that can be brought alongside civil actions against SNFs and employees accused of abusing or defrauding elderly patients.
In addition, the ACA requires all states to terminate the Medicaid participation of any provider that has been terminated under Medicare or any other state Medicaid plan. Moreover, state Medicaid fraud control agencies may investigate and prosecute assisted living communities and SNFs, clinics and other healthcare facilities under fraud and patient abuse and neglect laws. We expect that increased enforcement and monitoring by government agencies will cause us to expend considerable amounts on regulatory compliance and likely reduce the profits available from providing healthcare services.
Current state laws and regulations allow enforcement officials to make determinations as to whether the care provided at our senior living communities exceeds the level of care for which a particular community is licensed, which could result in the closure of the community and the immediate discharge and transfer of residents. Citations or revocation of a license or certification at one community could impact our ability to obtain new licenses or certifications or to maintain or renew existing licenses and certifications at other communities, and trigger defaults under our management agreements with DHC, our leases and our credit agreement or adversely affect our ability to operate or obtain financing in the future. In addition, an adverse finding by state officials could serve as the basis for lawsuits by private plaintiffs and lead to investigations under federal and state laws, which could result in civil and/or criminal penalties against the community as well as a related entity.
Other Matters. We must comply with laws designed to protect the confidentiality and security of individually identifiable information. Under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or the HITECH Act, we must comply with rules adopted by HHS governing the privacy, security, use and disclosure of individually identifiable information, including financial information and protected health information, or PHI, and also with security rules for electronic PHI. There may be both civil monetary penalties and criminal sanctions for non-compliance with these laws. Under the HITECH Act, penalties for violation of certain provisions may be as high as $50,000 per violation for a maximum civil penalty of $1.5 million per calendar year. In January 2013, HHS released the HIPAA Omnibus Rule, or the Omnibus Rule, which modified various requirements, including the standard for providing breach notices, which previously required an analysis of the harm of any disclosure, to a more objective analysis relating to whether any PHI was actually acquired or viewed as a result of the breach. On December 10, 2020, HHS issued a proposed rule that would modify certain standards, definitions, and patient rights under the HIPAA Privacy Rule to address barriers to coordinated care and case management. The effect of this proposed rule, if finalized, upon our operations is unknown at this time. In addition to HIPAA, many states have enacted their own security and privacy laws relating to individually identifiable information, including financial information and health information. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act became effective in 2020, and we expect additional federal and state legislative and regulatory efforts to regulate consumer privacy in the future. In some states, these laws are more burdensome than HIPAA. In instances in which the state provisions are more stringent than or differ from HIPAA, our communities must comply with both the applicable federal and state standards. If we fail to comply with applicable federal or state standards, we could be subject to civil sanctions and criminal penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. HIPAA enforcement efforts have increased considerably over the past few years, with HHS, through its Office for Civil Rights, entering into several multi-million dollar HIPAA settlements in 2020 alone. Finally, the Office for Civil Rights and other regulatory bodies have become increasingly focused on cybersecurity risks, including the emerging threat of ransomware and similar cyber-attacks. The increasing sophistication of cybersecurity threats presents challenges to the entire healthcare industry.
We must also comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, or the ADA, and similar state and local laws to the extent that such communities are “public accommodations” as defined in those laws. The obligation to comply with the ADA and other similar laws is an ongoing obligation, and we continue to assess our communities and make appropriate modifications. 
Insurance
Litigation against senior living and healthcare companies continues to increase, and liability insurance costs continue to increase as a result. In addition, our employee benefit costs, including health insurance and workers’ compensation insurance, generally continue to increase and increased during the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the Pandemic and we expect that these increased costs due to the Pandemic may continue in the future. To partially offset these insurance cost increases, among other things, we have:
•a fully self-insured program for all health-related claims of covered team members;
•increased the deductible or retention amounts for which we are liable under our liability insurance;
•operated an offshore captive insurance company which participates in our workers’ compensation, professional and general liability and certain of our automobile liability insurance programs, which may allow us to reduce our 
net insurance costs by retaining the earnings on our reserves, provided our claims experience does not exceed that projected by various statutory and actuarial formulas;
•increased the amounts that some of our team members are required to pay for health insurance coverage and co-payments for health services and pharmaceutical prescriptions and decreasing the amount of certain healthcare benefits as well as adding a high deductible health insurance plan as an option for our team members;
•utilized insurance and other professional advisors to help us establish programs to reduce our workers’ compensation and professional and general liabilities, including programs to prevent liability claims and to reduce workplace injuries; and
•utilized insurance and other professional advisors to help us establish appropriate reserves for our retained liabilities and captive insurance programs.
We partially self-insure up to certain limits for workers’ compensation, professional and general liability, automobile and property coverage. Claims that exceed these limits are insured up to contractual limits, over which we are self-insured. Our current insurance arrangements are generally renewable annually. We cannot be sure that our insurance charges and self-insurance reserve requirements will not increase, and we cannot predict the amount of any such increase, or to what extent, if at all, we may be able to offset any such increase through higher deductibles, retention amounts, self-insurance or other means in the future. 
For more information on our self-insurance see Note 2 and 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Environmental and Climate Change Matters

Ownership of real estate is subject to risks associated with environmental hazards. Under various laws, owners as well as tenants and operators of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up or remove hazardous substances present at or migrating from properties they own, lease or operate and may be held liable for property damage or personal injuries that result from hazardous substances. These laws also expose us to the possibility that we may become liable to government agencies or third parties for costs and damages we incur in connection with hazardous substances. In addition, these laws also impose various requirements regarding the operation and maintenance of properties, and recordkeeping and reporting requirements relating to environmental matters that may require us to incur costs to comply.
Under our previously existing leases with DHC, we agreed to indemnify DHC for any environmental liabilities it may
incur related to the senior living communities subject to those leases and the properties on which they are located. We reviewed environmental surveys of certain of our owned and previously leased, but now managed, properties prior to their purchase or the commencement of our leasing of those senior living communities. Based upon environmental surveys, we obtained and reviewed for certain of our senior living communities, as well as the results of operations at our senior living communities; we do not believe that there are environmental conditions at any of the senior living communities we currently operate that have had or will have a material adverse effect on us. However, we cannot be sure that environmental conditions are not present at our owned or previously leased properties, that DHC will fund potential costs we incur in the future related to any such conditions if they relate to a senior living community we manage for DHC, or that such potential costs will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition or results of operations.
When major weather or climate-related events, such as hurricanes, floods and wildfires, occur near our senior living communities, we may relocate the residents at our senior living communities to alternative locations for their safety and close or limit the operations of the impacted senior living community until the event has ended and the senior living community is then ready for operation. We may incur significant costs and losses as a result of these activities, both in terms of operating, preparing and repairing our senior living communities in anticipation of, during and after severe weather or climate-related event, and suffer potential lost business due to the interruption in operating our senior living communities. Our insurance may not adequately compensate us for these costs and losses.
Concerns about climate change have resulted in various treaties, laws and regulations that are intended to limit carbon emissions and address other environmental concerns. These and other laws may cause energy or other costs at our senior living communities to increase. In the long-term, we believe any such increased costs will be passed through and paid by our residents and other customers in the form of higher charges for our services. However, in the short-term, these increased costs, if material in amount, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. For more information regarding climate change and other environmental matters and their possible adverse impact on us, see “Risk Factors—Risks 
Related to Our Business—Our operations are subject to environmental risks and liabilities,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our operations are subject to risks from adverse weather and climate events” and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Impact of Climate Change".

We are aware of the impact of our communities on the environment. When we renovate our senior living communities, we generally use energy-efficient products, including lighting, windows and heating ventilation and air conditioning equipment.
