Item 1. Business.



We are a blank check company incorporated on October 28, 2020 as a Cayman Islands exempted company and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this Report as our initial business combination. We have selected Cognos as the business combination target.



Initial Public Offering



On April 5, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering of 10,000,000 public units. On April 14, 2021, the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option in full and purchased 1,500,000 additional public units. Each public unit consists of one ordinary share and one right to receive one-tenth of an ordinary share upon consummation of our initial business combination. The public units were sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $115,000,000.



Simultaneously with the closing of the initial public offering, we completed the private sale of an aggregate of 450,000 private placement units to our sponsor at a purchase price of $10.00 per private placement unit, generating gross proceeds of $4,500,000. On April 14, 2021, simultaneously with the exercise of the over-allotment option, we consummated a private sale of an additional 15,000 private placement units, generating gross proceeds of $150,000.



A total of $116,150,000, comprised of the proceeds from the initial public offering and the sale of the private placement units was placed in the trust account maintained by Continental, acting as trustee.



It is the job of our sponsor and management team to complete our initial business combination. Our management team is led by Henry Monzon, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Ka Seng (Thomas) Ao, our Chief Financial Officer, who have extensive international experience in disruptive technologies, business operations, investments and merger and acquisition transactions. We must complete our initial business combination by the De-SPAC Deadline or else we will be required to liquidate and distribute all amounts in the trust account. The De-SPAC Deadline is currently October 5, 2023.



Our Search for a Business Combination



The company was incorporated for the purpose of effecting an initial business combination with one or more businesses. We sought to do this by utilizing the networks and industry experience of both our sponsor and our board to identify, acquire and operate a suitable target business. Following an extensive search and due diligence process, in which we explored the possibility of entering into a business combination agreement with a number of potential target companies, we identified Cognos as the preferred partner company for our business combination transaction.



On December 30, 2022, following a review and consideration of the final terms of the Merger Agreement and the other transaction documents, our board adopted unanimous written resolutions which authorized and approved the company’s entry into the Merger Agreement. Following the board’s approval, our company, Cognos and Nocturne Merger Sub, Inc. executed the Merger Agreement.

Business Strategy



In identifying, evaluating and selecting Cognos as a suitable target for our initial business combination, the board considered a number of factors, including but not limited to, the following material factors and viewpoints:

● | Cognos is developing innovative and potentially groundbreaking technology that has the potential to radically advance the diagnosis and treatment of neuropathic diseases. Our management team carefully assessed the advantages and disadvantages of entering into a business combination transaction with Cognos, ultimately reaching the conclusion that such transaction was in the best interest of the company and its shareholders and consistent with the general criteria and guidelines we set out in the prospectus for the initial public offering with respect to potential acquisition opportunities; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Through our legal and business diligence, we determined that Cognos has fundamentally sound operational and governance practices and that it has the potential for improved performance under our ownership and with the benefits that come from access to the public markets; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Cognos’ operations are currently limited to the U.S. In addition to strong organic growth potential, this presents significant growth opportunities to meaningfully accelerate growth through geographic expansion, business combinations, disruptive products and engineering expertise; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Cognos’ SINNAIS™ Implantable Smart Pump technology has the potential of becoming a leading product for the diagnosis and treatment of neuropathic diseases, which would allow Cognos to develop a leading presence across the industry; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Based on our legal and business diligence, including numerous discussions with key Cognos personnel, we believe that the strength of the Cognos team will be an asset to our combined company that will facilitate our combined company’s ability to obtain regulatory approvals for its product candidates and to successfully commercialize its products in the future; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Upon diligence and review of market conditions, the board believes that the terms of the business combination are attractive relative to market comparables that provide significant upside potential. After completing a comprehensive review and analysis of potential alternatives and business combination targets, the board is of the view that no alternatives were reasonably likely to create greater value for our shareholders; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A fairness opinion issued by Newbridge Securities Corporation, effective as of October 26, 2022, stating that the consideration to be received by the company’s shareholders in connection with the proposed business combination transaction was fair, from a financial point of view.

Initial business combination



Nasdaq rules require that our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. Based on the financial analysis of Cognos that was performed at the time the transaction was approved, our board determined that this requirement was met.



We have filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of the business combination. We will have until the De-SPAC Deadline to consummate our initial business combination.



Status as a public company



We believe our structure makes us an attractive business combination partner to Cognos. As an existing public company, we offer Cognos an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination. In this situation, the owners of Cognos will exchange their equity interests, shares and/or shares of stock in Cognos for our shares or for a combination of our shares and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. Although there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company, this method offers a more certain and cost-effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In a typical initial public offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, road show and public reporting efforts that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us.



Furthermore, once the proposed business combination is completed, Cognos will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe Cognos will then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with shareholders’ interests. Going public can offer further benefits by augmenting Cognos’ profile among potential new customers and vendors and aiding in attracting talented employees.



We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) (a) December 31, 2026, (b) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) the last day of the fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.

Financial position



With funds available for a business combination in the amount of $21,100,382 as of December 31, 2022, which amount includes $4,025,000 of deferred underwriting fees, before fees and expenses associated with our initial business combination, we offer Cognos a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we will be able to complete our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to Cognos to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not obtained third party financing and there can be no assurance such financing will be available to us.



Effecting our initial business combination



We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations until we consummate our initial business combination. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement of the private placement units, our shares, debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination.



If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemptions of our ordinary shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the combined company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, the purchase of other companies or for working capital.



We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our initial business combination, and we may effectuate our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account.



In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law, we would seek shareholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise, but the Merger Agreement contemplates the possibility that we may enter into such arrangements in connection with the consummation of the merger with Cognos.



Selection of a target business and structuring of our initial business combination



Nasdaq rules require that the business or assets acquired in our initial business combination have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance of the funds in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination. Based on the financial analysis of Cognos that was performed at the time the transaction was approved, our board determined that this requirement was met. The board determined that the consideration being paid in the business combination, which amount was negotiated at arms-length, was fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders and appropriately reflected the value of Cognos. Our board believes that the financial skills and background of its members qualify it to conclude that the proposed acquisition of Cognos met this requirement and make the other required determinations regarding the transaction.





4







In any case, we will only complete an initial business combination in which we own or acquire 50% or more of the issued and outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquire a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If we own or acquire less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business, the portion of the target business that is owned or acquired by the combined company is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test.



In evaluating Cognos as our proposed target business, we conducted a thorough due diligence review which encompassed, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which was made available to us.



The time required to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty, and it cannot be assured that we will be able to successfully consummate our initial business combination.



Lack of business diversification



For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of Cognos. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:




● | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited ability to evaluate the target’s management team



Although we closely scrutinized the management of Cognos when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with Cognos, our assessment of Cognos’ management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in Cognos following the merger cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is anticipated that one or more of our directors may remain associated in some capacity with the combined company following our initial business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our initial business combination.



Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of Cognos. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that such additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.



Shareholders will have the ability to approve our initial business combination



Under our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, we must provide all holders of public shares with the opportunity to have their public shares redeemed upon the consummation of our initial business combination either in conjunction with a tender offer or in conjunction with a shareholder vote. For business and other reasons, we have elected to provide our shareholders with the opportunity to have their public shares redeemed in connection with a shareholder vote rather than a tender offer. Therefore, we are seeking to obtain the approval of our shareholders of the business combination in order to allow our public shareholders to effectuate redemptions of their public shares in connection with the consummation of the business combination. The approval of the business combination is required under the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. In addition, such approval is also a condition to the consummation of the business combination under the Merger Agreement.



Permitted purchases of our securities



Our sponsor, directors, officers, or their respective affiliates may purchase shares or rights in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. There is no limit on the number of shares such persons may purchase. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. In the event our sponsor, directors, officers, or their respective affiliates decide to make any such purchases at the time of a shareholder vote relating to our initial business combination, such purchases could have the effect of influencing the vote necessary to approve such transaction. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase shares or rights in such transactions. Our sponsor, directors, officers, or their respective affiliates are prohibited from making any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgement that such shareholder, although still the record holder of our shares, is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. We cannot currently determine whether our insiders will make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan, as it will be dependent upon several factors, including but not limited to the timing and size of such purchases. Depending on such circumstances, our insiders may either make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or determine that such a plan is not necessary.





6







In the event that our sponsor, directors, officers, or their respective affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers must comply with such rules.



The purpose of such purchases would be to (i) vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination or (ii) satisfy a closing condition in the Merger Agreement that requires us to have a certain amount of cash on hand at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of rights could also be to reduce the number of rights, or underlying securities, outstanding. This may result in the completion of our initial business combination when it may not otherwise have been possible.



In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our ordinary shares may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.



Our sponsor, directors, officers, or their respective affiliates anticipate that they may identify the shareholders with whom our sponsor, directors, officers, or their respective affiliates may pursue privately negotiated purchases, by either the shareholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by shareholders following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our sponsor, directors, officers, or their respective affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would only identify and contact potential selling shareholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against the business combination. Such persons would select the shareholders from whom to acquire shares based on the number of shares available, the negotiated price per share and such other factors as any such person may deem relevant at the time of purchase. The price per share paid in any such transaction may be different than the amount per share a public shareholder would receive if it elected to redeem its shares in connection with our initial business combination. Our sponsor, directors, officers, or their respective affiliates will only purchase shares if such purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws.



Any purchases by our sponsor, directors, officers, or their respective affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act will only be made to the extent such purchases are able to be made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 has certain technical requirements that must be complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Our sponsor, directors, officers, or their respective affiliates are prohibited from making purchases of ordinary shares if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act.



Redemption rights for public shareholders upon completion of our initial business combination



We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account was initially approximately $10.10 per public share and, based on the Company’s current estimates (as further described in the March Proxy Statement), as of the extraordinary general meeting of our shareholders held on April 3, 2023, the per share price at which the public shares may be redeemed was approximately $10.87 . The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. The redemption rights will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares, private placement shares and any public shares they may hold in connection with the completion of our initial business combination.



On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 became law, which, among other things, imposes a new U.S. federal 1% excise tax on certain repurchases (including redemptions) of stock by publicly traded U.S. corporations and certain domestic subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign corporations. Because we will domesticate as a Delaware corporation prior to the redemptions, and because our securities are trading on Nasdaq, the combined company may be subject to the excise tax with respect to any redemptions of the combined company common stock in connection with the business combination that are treated as repurchases for this purpose. The Company has determined that it will not use the proceeds placed in the trust account and the interest earned thereon to pay any excise taxes or any other fees or taxes similar in nature that may be imposed on the Company pursuant to any current, pending or future rules or laws, including without limitation any excise tax due imposed under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 on any redemptions or stock buybacks by the Company.





7







Manner of conducting redemptions



Pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, a public shareholder may request that the company redeem all or a portion of such public shareholder’s public shares for cash upon the consummation of an initial business combination either in conjunction with a tender offer or in conjunction with a shareholder vote. For business and other reasons, we have elected to provide our shareholders with the opportunity to have their public shares redeemed in connection with a shareholder vote rather than a tender offer. So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on the Nasdaq, we will be required to comply with Nasdaq rules.



We will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association:




● | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file proxy materials with the SEC. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------




We expect that a final proxy statement would be mailed to public shareholders at least 5 days prior to the shareholder vote. However, we expect that a draft proxy statement would be made available to such shareholders well in advance of such time, providing additional notice of redemption if we conduct redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation. Although we are not required to do so, we currently intend to comply with the substantive and procedural requirements of Regulation 14A in connection with any shareholder vote even if we are not able to maintain our Nasdaq listing or Exchange Act registration.



We will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination. It is expected that the mechanics of exercising redemption rights in connection with any future redemption opportunity will be substantially similar to the mechanics that the Company described in the Definitive Proxy Statement with respect to the extraordinary general meeting in lieu of the 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders held by the Company on October 4, 2022 and the mechanics that the Company described in the March Proxy Statement.



We will complete our initial business combination only if we obtain the approval of an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, being the affirmative vote of a majority of the ordinary shares represented in person or by proxy and entitled to vote thereon and who vote at an extraordinary general meeting in favor of the business combination. In such case, pursuant to the terms of a letter agreement entered into with us, our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed (and their permitted transferees will agree) to vote any founder shares and private placement shares held by them and any public shares purchased during or after our initial public offering in favor of our initial business combination. We expect that at the time of any shareholder vote relating to our initial business combination, our initial shareholders and their respective permitted transferees will own a substantial percentage of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares entitled to vote thereon. Each public shareholder may elect to redeem its public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares, private placement shares and public shares in connection with the completion of a business combination.



By approving the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Company’s shareholders have authorized the Company to (i) remove from the trust account an amount equal to the number of public shares properly redeemed multiplied by the per share price, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to such approval, including any interest earned on the trust account deposits (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares and (ii) deliver to the holders of such redeemed public shares their portion of the amount removed from the trust account. The remainder of such funds shall remain in the trust account and be available for use by the Company to complete the business combination on or before the extended De-SPAC Deadline of October 5, 2023. Public shareholders who do not redeem their public shares will retain their redemption rights and their ability to vote on the business combination through October 5, 2023.



Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and the terms of the Merger Agreement provide that we will only redeem our public shares so long as (after such redemption) our net tangible assets are at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of underwriters’ fees and commissions (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all ordinary shares that are validly submitted for redemption exceeds the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all ordinary shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof.





8







Limitation on redemption upon completion of our initial business combination



Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to Excess Shares. We believe this restriction will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our sponsor or its affiliates to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering (1,725,000 shares) could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us or our sponsor or its affiliates at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, given the closing condition in the Merger Agreement that we have a minimum amount of cash on hand. We may waive this restriction in our sole discretion. However, we would not be restricting our shareholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination. Our sponsor, officers and directors have, pursuant to a letter agreement entered into with us, waived their right to have any founder shares, private placement shares or public shares held by them redeemed in connection with our initial business combination. Unless any of our other affiliates acquires founder shares through a permitted transfer from an initial shareholder, and thereby becomes subject to the letter agreement, no such affiliate is subject to this waiver. However, to the extent any such affiliate acquires public shares, it would be a public shareholder and restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to any Excess Shares.



Tendering share certificates in connection with redemption rights



To exercise their redemption rights, our public shareholders must deliver or tender their shares (and share certificate(s) (if any) and other redemption forms) to the company’s transfer agent at least two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination. Public shareholders may tender their shares by either delivering or tendering their shares (and share certificate(s) (if any) and other redemption forms) to the transfer agent or by delivering or tendering their shares electronically using the Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) system. Shareholders holding their shares in street name will need to instruct their bank, broker or other nominee to withdraw the shares from their account in order to exercise their redemption rights. A final proxy statement will be mailed to public shareholders at least 5 days prior to the shareholder vote. However, we expect that a draft proxy statement will be made available to such shareholders well in advance of such time, providing additional notice of redemption. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for shareholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.



There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $100.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.

The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the shareholders’ vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such shareholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the shareholder would then have an “option window” after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company’s shares in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which shareholders were aware they needed to commit before the general meeting, would become “option” rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. In the case of our Company, the requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the general meeting ensures that a redeeming holder’s election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved.



Any request of a public shareholder of the Company to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date of the extraordinary general meeting set forth in our proxy materials. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides, prior to the applicable deadline, not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return its certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination.



If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares.



If our initial proposed business combination with Cognos is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a business combination with a different target company until the De-SPAC Deadline.



Redemption of public shares and liquidation if no initial business combination



Our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed that we will have only until the De-SPAC Deadline to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination by such De-SPAC Deadline, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible, but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (including interest), less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our rights, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination by the De-SPAC Deadline.



Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares and private placement shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination by the De-SPAC Deadline. However, if our sponsor, officers or directors acquire public shares after our initial public offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination by the De-SPAC Deadline.

Our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written letter agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that would (i) modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by the De-SPAC Deadline or (ii) modify certain other provisions relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity, unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their ordinary shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares. However, we will only redeem our public shares so long as (after such redemption) our net tangible assets will be at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of underwriters’ fees and commissions (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement (described above), we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares.



If we do not consummate our initial business combination by the De-SPAC Deadline, we expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the $47,373 held outside the trust account as of December 31, 2022, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the trust account not required to pay taxes, we may request that the trustee release to us an additional amount of up to $100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses.



If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement units, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders upon our dissolution would be at least $10.10 and, based on the Company’s current estimates (as further described in the March Proxy Statement), as of the extraordinary general meeting of our shareholders held on April 3, 2023, the per share price at which the public shares may be redeemed was approximately $10.87. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public shareholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by shareholders will not be substantially less than $10.87 or even substantially less than $10.10. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims.



Although we have sought and will continue to seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent auditors), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements, or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. Cognos has agreed to such a waiver pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. Upon redemption of our public shares, if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame, or upon the exercise of a redemption right in connection with our initial business combination, we will be required to provide for payment of claims of creditors that were not waived that may be brought against us within the 10 years following redemption. Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party (other than our independent auditors) for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below (i) $10.10 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes. This liability will not apply with respect to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations are limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only third parties we have engaged or expect to engage in the future are vendors such as lawyers, investment bankers, computer or information and technical services providers or prospective target businesses. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, then our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. We have not independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy their indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. None of our other officers will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses, including Cognos.

In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below (i) $10.10 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors, in exercising their business judgment, may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be substantially less than $10.10 per share.



We will seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent auditors), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Cognos has agreed to such a waiver pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We have access to up to the amounts held outside the trust account ($47,373 as of December 31, 2022), with which to pay any such potential claims. In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, shareholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors.



If we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy or insolvency laws, and may be included in our bankruptcy or insolvency estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy or insolvency claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.10 per share to our public shareholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy or insolvency laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy or insolvency court could seek to recover all amounts received by our shareholders. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or having acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public shareholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.



Our public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earliest of (i) the completion of our initial business combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to (A) modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity and (iii) the redemption of all of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial business combination by the De-SPAC Deadline, subject to applicable law. In no other circumstances will a shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. We have decided to seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, and a shareholder’s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a shareholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such shareholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above.

Amended and restated memorandum and articles of association



Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association contains certain requirements and restrictions that will apply to us until the consummation of our initial business combination. If we seek to amend any provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity, we will provide dissenting public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares in connection with any such vote, as we did in connection with the extraordinary general meeting in lieu of the 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders held by the Company on October 4, 2022 and as we did in connection with the extraordinary general meeting as described in the March Proxy Statement. Our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to waive any redemption rights with respect to their founder shares, private placement shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. Specifically, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides, among other things, that:




● | prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we shall either (1) seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination at an extraordinary general meeting called for such purpose at which shareholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) or (2) provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to tender their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a shareholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) in each case subject to the limitations described therein;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon such consummation and, solely if we seek shareholder approval, obtain an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, being the affirmative vote of a majority of the ordinary shares represented in person or by proxy and entitled to vote thereon and who vote at an extraordinary general meeting in favor of the business combination;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | if our initial business combination is not consummated by the De-SPAC Deadline, then our existence will terminate and we will distribute all amounts in the trust account; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional ordinary shares that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the trust account or (ii) vote on any initial business combination. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




These provisions cannot be amended without the approval of holders of at least two-thirds of our ordinary shares. In the event we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, which we have decided to do for business and other reasons, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that we may consummate our initial business combination only if approved by an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, being the affirmative vote of a majority of the ordinary shares represented in person or by proxy and entitled to vote thereon and who vote at an extraordinary general meeting in favor of the business combination.

Conflicts of interest



Each of our directors and officers presently has, and in the future any of our directors and our officers may have, additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present acquisition opportunities to such entity. Accordingly, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of an acquisition opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will need to honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such acquisition opportunity to such entity, and only present it to us if such entity rejects the opportunity. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, no director or officer shall be disqualified or prevented from contracting with the company nor shall any contract or transaction entered into by or on behalf of the company in which any director shall have an interest be liable to be voided. A director shall be at liberty to vote in respect of any contract or transaction in which he or she is interested, provided that the nature of such interest shall be disclosed at or prior to its consideration or any vote thereon by the board of directors. We do not believe, however, that any fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our directors or officers would materially undermine our ability to complete our business combination.



In addition to our sponsor, members of our management team may directly or indirectly own our ordinary shares and/or private placement units following our initial public offering, and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business, including Cognos, is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination. Section 2.4(c)(vi) of the Merger Agreement will require certain directors and officers of the Company to resign or be removed from office upon the consummation of the business combination.



Indemnity



Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party (other than our independent auditors) for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below (i) $10.10 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes. This liability will not apply with respect to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations have been limited to searching for a prospective target business to acquire, and will remain so limited if the initial business combination with Cognos is not consummated and we decide to pursue an alternative initial business combination, the only third parties we have engaged or will engage are vendors such as lawyers, investment bankers, computer or information and technical services providers or prospective target businesses. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third-party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. We have not independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy their indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such obligations.
Employees



We currently have two (2) officers. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters, but they devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs to complete our initial business combination. The amount of time that our officers or any other members of our management team have devoted in any time period to our matters has varied based on whether a target business was selected for our initial business combination and the current stage of the business combination process, and such amount of time will continue to vary based on such factors in the future.

Periodic reporting and financial information



Our public units, ordinary shares and rights are registered under the Exchange Act and, as a result, we have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public auditors.



We will provide our shareholders with audited financial statements of Cognos as part of the proxy solicitation materials sent to shareholders to assist them in assessing Cognos’ business. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, U.S. GAAP, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the PCAOB.



We are required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. Cognos may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding the adequacy of its internal controls. The development of the internal controls of Cognos to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, if necessary, may increase the time and costs necessary to complete our initial business combination.



We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act, and references herein to such term shall have the meaning associated with such term in the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.



In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.



We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the earliest of (a) December 31, 2026, (b) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) the last day of the fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.
