Item 1. Business
Overview
 
On October 25, 2019, Resonate Blends, Inc. (formerly Textmunication Holdings Inc.) announced its entry into the cannabis industry by acquiring Resonate Blends LLC (“Resonate” or the “Company”), a California-based cannabis wellness lifestyle product company built on a proprietary system of experiential targets. Resonate is building a value-added, brand-focused cannabis organization offering premium brands of consistent quality. The Company also acquired Entourage Labs LLC (“Entourage Labs”), a sister company of Resonate. Entourage Labs is the Intellectual Property (IP) subsidiary of Resonate.
 
Based in Calabasas, California, Resonate Blends, Inc. is a cannabis holding company centered on valued-added holistic Wellness and Lifestyle brands. The Company’s strategy is to ignite future growth by building a purpose-driven portfolio of innovative, trusted national brands, emerging brands, research organizations, and a variety of retail channels. The Company’s focus is finding mutual value between product and consumer by optimizing quality, supply chain resources and financial performance. The Company offers a family of premium cannabis-based products of consistent quality based on unique formations calibrated to Resonate Blends effects system in what we believe is the industry gold standard in user experience.
 
The Company believes the greatest long-term value creation in the cannabis industry will be in the establishment of high quality and consistent consumer brands. Resonate hopes to become a national leader through its vision in creating a family of brands designed specifically to deliver reliable, effective, beneficial experiences.
 
Resonate is committed to helping you live the life you love. We do not make the medicinal vs. recreational distinction. This is a temporary legal separation in some states that we expect will soon cease to exist. We believe in wellness for the whole person. We know that people with pain or anxiety also want to enjoy friends, concerts and have satisfying intimate experiences. We are designing experiences which will improve all areas of our lives.
 
To accomplish this, Resonate is Mastering the Art of Experience. This is our mission. By integrating science, technology, education, branding, marketing, sales and delivery - with every customer interaction we aim to provide exceptional experiences. Cannabis has a broad range of unique characteristics and we are dedicated to harnessing and amplifying those characteristics to support healthy empowered and engaged lifestyles. From product development through customer communication, we prefect and demystify cannabis bringing innovative products to an increasingly sophisticated market. Resonate Blends has a strong social mission and the Resonate team is building a successful business by focusing our knowledge, skill and energy on creating wellness-lifestyle products which will improve community by helping individuals live more satisfying, meaningful and connected lives. The need for these products at this time is crucial.

To communicate the breadth of wellness products that Resonate is developing, our team created The Resonate System. The Resonate System graphically represents a spectrum of wellness products based on cannabis scaffolding. This system helps users easily select which product they want. Products based on The Resonate System deliver relaxation, freedom from pain and anxiety, boosts in focus and creativity, sensuality, human connection and joy. Our products are formulated around a system of interconnected experience targets that will allow you to know exactly what to expect when using them.
 
While respecting and honoring the natural power of plant medicine, Resonate also employs advanced science, leading technology and a deep understanding of how various cannabis compounds, when working in the body, simultaneously can create unique effects and benefits (referred to as the “Entourage Effect”). Our product developers blend cannabinoids and terpenes to formulate products with specific, controllable and repeatable, beneficial effects. Through innovation, experimentation, testing and an iterative product development strategy, our team has unlocked new plant constituent combinations resulting in unique, enjoyable and extremely effective wellness products unlike anything else in the marketplace. Resonate plans to explore obtaining patent protection for these formulations and products in the future.
 
Koan, the Resonate Blends product family, is based around a comprehensive system of interconnected experience targets that allow people to select the products that best fit their lifestyle and health objectives. Koan products are dedicated to the efficacy and precision of functional experience targets across a broad range of product categories.
 
Resonate’s initial products are a completely unique class of products called Cordials. These blends offer a wide range of experiences not currently available in the cannabis market. Our Cordials are water-soluble and use emulsification technology to allow for quick onset and a sustained and nuanced experience. Single dose, healthful, subtle in taste, cordials are an ideal way for people to gently intentionally improve their well-being. They can be sipped directly or substituted for alcohol as a cocktail mixer.
 
Resonate’s Cordials have been developed in partnership with an award-winning advanced infusion technology partner and are targeted for commercial release in late Q1 of 2021. The company plans to offer six unique blends at its initial release.
 
In preparation for the upcoming release, we have formalized contracts with our logistical, manufacturing and marketing partners and are building a digital native strategy supporting direct to consumer sales. This release will be followed with our second product line that is already in full development and is expected for targeted commercial release before the end of 2021.
 
Our principal executive office is located at 26565 Agoura Road, Suite 200, Calabasas, CA 91302. Our executive telephone number is (571) 888-0009.
 
Partnerships
 
Product Development:
 
The Company signed a custom development contract with Vertosa in March of 2020, the leading provider of safe, reliable emulsion bases for infused product developers. This contract was a major milestone for the Company as it selected its strategic partners to develop innovative products and solutions.
 
Vertosa is an award-winning strategic partner who will assist the Company in the launch of its first unique category of six water soluble products. These multi-use products deliver specific, predictable, reliable, effects in a format that is completely unique in the industry. The first product developed collaboratively is the Cordial product line, but both companies expect several other products to be developed over time utilizing Vertosa’s emulsification technology in support of Resonate’s experience targeting expertise.

The Vertosa and Resonate teams share a mission of maximizing the benefits of cannabinoids and plant medicine. Resonate selected Vertosa as a development partner because the Vertosa systems’ industry leading emulsification technology makes them highly stable, bioavailable, and water compatible. All of Vertosa’s inactive base materials are FDA approved and are lab tested for quality. Vertosa’s Hemp-derived CBD Emulsion System is now certified organic by CCOF, a United States Department of Agriculture-accredited certifier and non-profit advocacy group, and the company has also received its Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certification, confirming that its offerings follow regulations promulgated by the US Food and Drug Administration and are safe, pure, and effective.
 
Manufacturing:
 
The Company plans to partner with The Galley, a California licensed Type N – Infused Products Manufacturer based in Santa Rosa, California. The Galley produces and packages premium award-winning products and has worked with some of the most popular brands in the industry. The Galley is built to FDA and CDPH standards and is focused on high demand areas of production – Edibles, Topicals, Tinctures, Chocolate, Hard Candies, Gummies, Pre-Rolls, Flower, Vapes and Beverages.
 
Resonate and The Galley entered into a Master Services Agreement in which The Galley will manufacture and package Resonate’s first family of products to precise specifications. The Galley also has a Bureau of Cannabis Control (BCC) issued distribution license in California and, along with other select distribution partners, will distribute Resonate’s products to retail establishments throughout the state.
 
The Galley and Resonate have been in frequent contact throughout Resonate’s development period and they are prepared to support production of the Company’s unique family of wellness lifestyle products. Resonate’s upcoming first of its kind offerings are emulsified through the advanced infusion technology provided by award-winning Vertosa and collaboratively developed to push the state of the art in its cannabis products.
 
Distribution:
 
Because of the unique nature of Resonate’s Koan products and the recent expansion of home delivery services in the cannabis industry, Resonate has prioritized a direct-to-consumer method as their primary sales strategy. Resonate is identifying a technology partner who will add an e-commerce feature to the Koan web site that will allow the Company to sell products directly to consumers using a licensed California state-wide delivery network for fulfilment.
 
In addition to direct sales, the company plans to offer products to select premium dispensaries throughout California. These products will be delivered to retail establishments by a leading cannabis full service distributor.
 
Resonate is also developing relationships with a variety of complementary distribution channels such as subscription box companies and other non-storefront reseller organizations.
 
Marketing and Sales Plan
 
The cannabis industry is changing daily in response to updated regulations, customer product education, new interest from various demographics and now the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we are constantly attentive to these changes as they affect the marketing of our products. Our initial marketing strategy was to launch in select dispensaries in Los Angeles and to support the launch with dispensary promotional material and location-based marketing. However, in the current market the Company has decided to modify this strategy. Paradoxically, retail restrictions and safety regulations were actually beneficial for us, as these allowed us to reprioritize our sales approach and to build a marketing plan around on-line dispensaries with wide delivery networks. Although retail restrictions will eventually be relaxed, we do not expect that storefront dispensaries will return to the dominant role they played in the cannabis industry before COVID-19 for several reasons.
 
Dispensaries are generally small, making social distancing difficult. Limitations on a customers’ ability to touch and smell products reduces the value of in-person shopping. Restrictions on the number of people allowed in these small spaces will create waiting lines outside stores, which will be inconvenient and even embarrassing for some. Finally, we have learned that a significant number of customers, particularly in our targeted demographic, really prefer the privacy and convenience of having products delivered to their homes. For all these reasons, we have decided to focus our marketing budget for at least the next six to nine months on supporting online and delivery outlets.

In response to the sudden change in customer buying preferences, Resonate has accelerated our plan to sell directly to consumers. We are in the process of partnering with an on-line platform which will allow us to communicate the value of our products directly to consumers. This platform will connect consumers to a licensed retail and California-wide home delivery network. This direct-to-consumer approach has significant benefits for us. First, it allows us to control our brand messaging and to assure that we are able to provide the information and education customers need to make confident and informed product choices. Through this method, we also have access to customer information which is not available from dispensaries, which allows us to employ successful marketing techniques used by leading on-line retailers such as customer loyalty programs, memberships, ambassadors, etc., to build brand awareness and increase sales. It is also better for us financially as it increases our profit margin. And, most exciting of all, upon launch, Koan products will immediately be available throughout California.
 
Therefore, our marketing budget and energy is now being channeled into appropriate programmatic advertising, developing informational materials for customers on our website, and developing professional and effective social media, search engine optimization and direct to consumer marketing campaigns. We will also offer training and market support to select premium California dispensaries. We expect that building our brand online will complement retail sales by increasing customer awareness and creating “pull-through” at brick-and-mortar facilities.
 
Future Koan Product - Resonate Growth Plans
 
For the first 12 months, Resonate will concentrate on releasing product and brand building in our home state of California. Resonate plans to follow the launch of its first six Koan products with others based on The Resonate System at regular intervals. Our formulas, combined with the proprietary Vertosa technology, will allow the Company to quickly deliver controlled, predictable, enjoyable effects in beverages, teas, and other innovative and unique products. Vertosa is the leading provider of emulsification technology for cannabis manufacturers. Emulsification allows cannabinoids to become water-soluble so that they can be added to Cordials, beverages, gummies, etc. Vertosa and Resonate are engaged in joint research focusing on effects of various emulsification methods on cannabinoids. We are working on methods that improve user experience by refining effects and managing bioavailability. Vertosa will also be providing the emulsification required for formulas in Resonate’s product line.
 
The cannabis industry is in its infancy. Resonate’s growth strategy is to create an innovative ecosystem of companies, investments and research that all support The Resonate System and our mission of empowering the wellness market. In addition to creating our “house” brands, the Company is also looking for other quality brands which could be incubated or targeted as either strategic partners or as acquisitions. Integrating these companies, we believe will provide consistent product quality that yields expected results and that also allows us to build a stable, successful company overall.
 
Resonate’s first commercial release will be a family of six precisely targeted effect blends. These products are category-breaking offerings as they are neither tinctures nor beverages but have the benefits of both. They are emulsified, water soluble, single-dose formulas that can be enjoyed privately or shared socially. Resonate plans to make these available initially in California in stylish mini bottles, each containing a single dose. They can be sipped directly from the bottle or poured into beverages. Koan products offer the very high bioavailability of tinctures not possible to deliver with edibles, take effect generally within minutes and provide benefits for approximately 3 hours. Significantly, these formulas all provide a pleasant predictable experience, a gentle onset and exit and have no unpleasant sensations or aftereffects sometimes associated with cannabis products. Our current products are as follows:
 
Calm
 
CBD rich with a hint of THC, Calm is formulated to quiet your mind and ease you into a gentle sense of wellbeing.
 
Wonder
 
Our highest THC offering, Wonder is carefully crafted to bring back that youthful sense of wonder and awe we feel when we are fully engaged with our senses and environment.

Competitive Landscape
 
The cannabis market still primarily consists of products of varying quality and poor branding. Much of the branding is heavy “stoner” or hospital medicinal, and differentiation between products is difficult. As a result, finding a product with controllable, consistent effects is difficult. Even products of high and reliable quality all look alike and have no shelf appeal. In addition, there is a mismatch between the fastest growing demographic and many current product offerings, which are designed to be inhaled. This is exactly why we have developed Koan Cordials, tasty, single dose, healthy cannabis products with timeless, exceptional branding. As the market matures, some companies are recognizing the importance of branding. Branded category leaders represent the 10 spots among best-selling products and sales data supports the desire among consumers for branded products. This is further supported by Headset, data (the leading industry provider of retail buying patterns), which shows that brands are leading every category in cannabis. Further, branded products command higher prices. Some branded products generate pricing as high as 150%, over industry average. The Resonate team excels in product branding.
 
There is no product in the marketplace exactly like our Koan products at this time. Other companies offer tinctures (which are concentrated herbal extracts made by soaking the bark, berries, leaves (dried or fresh), or roots from one or more plants in alcohol or vinegar), tea, salves, patches and cosmetics and vapes, and some of them provide effects which may be similar to those the Koan products will provide, but we believe that none are equal to ours with respect to quality, efficacy, consistency and scope. Our products are water soluble and can be enjoyed privately or poured in beverages and shared socially. We believe that the total experience offered by our products cannot be found elsewhere in the industry.
 
While there are a number of very fine products in the premium cannabis space, there is not yet a dominant brand in any category. Some are leading but no brand dominates. Data indicates that our targeted demographic seeks out trusted brands when making product selections. Resonate is bringing to market custom, reliable, experience-targeted products. which can be sipped or shared, offered under a well-crafted brand supported by an accessible information system. We provide The Resonate System so customers can understand what to expect and can make informed confident selections.
