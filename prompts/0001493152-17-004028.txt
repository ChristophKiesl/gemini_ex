ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
 
Quest Solution, Inc., a Delaware corporation, formerly Amerigo Energy, Inc., together with its two wholly owned subsidiaries, referred to herein as “we,” “us,” and “our” (“Quest” or the “Company”), was incorporated in 1973. Since its incorporation, the Company has been involved in various lines of business.
 
In January 2014, the Company had determined it was in the best interest of stockholders to focus on operating companies with a track record of positive cash flows and larger existing revenue bases. The Company’s strategy developed into leveraging management’s relationships in the business world for investments for the Company. On January 10, 2014, the Company entered into that certain Share Purchase Agreement with Quest Solution, Inc., an Oregon corporation (“Quest Solution”), in the technology, software, and mobile data collection systems business, in order to acquire Quest Solution for a purchase price of $16,000,000, payable in the form of (i) a promissory note for $4,969,000; and (ii) a promissory note for $11,031,000.

The name change became effective by the State of Delaware on May 30, 2014.

History
 
Between 2008 and 2013, the Company was in the business of developing oil and gas reserves while increasing the production rate base and cash flow. The plan was to continue acquiring oil and gas leases for drilling and to take advantage of other opportunities and strategic alliances. Due to declines in production with respect to the Company’s oil and gas leases, the Company sought to explore its position in the oil industry. As the operational leases for the Company were not providing sufficient cash flow from operations to allow management to expand its investment in this industry, other potential opportunities were evaluated.

The cancellation of a Consulting Agreement between the Company and the previous owners resulted in the return and cancellation 1,765,000 of the shares of common stock of the Company that had previously been issued.

Competitive overview
 
The mobile system integration market is characterized by a limited number of large competitors and numerous smaller niche players. Quest typically pursues larger accounts and national customers, competing most often with the larger channel partners, including Stratix, Peak Technologies, Lowry, and Barcoding Inc. For specific solutions the Company also competes with niche players that are often focused on a single industry. Hardware sales are often pressured by competition from online retailers, but Quest’s consultative, integrated solutions approach is a clear differentiator for most prospective customers.
 
Sales Strategy
 
The Company’s current direct sales teams are supported by systems engineers averaging over twenty (20) years of experience in the mobile industry. The sales organization’s growth in size and reach mirrors the Company’s addition of new products and services. Sales team members are organized by industry areas of opportunity, areas of expertise and territory. Quest’s sales teams are organized to address national accounts offering a broad array of unique solutions for key line of business applications, which allows for upsell and cross sell opportunities within each client. For the barcode label (media) business, Quest utilizes a specialty sales force and well as resellers and distributors of Quest manufactured label products to serve the market.
 
Sales persons are supported internally by sales support personnel who coordinate quotes and logistics and by members of the systems engineering group and software teams.
 
The normal sales cycle is six (6) to nine (9) months, and typically involves the development of a scope of work and preparation of a ROI analysis. Quest prepares templates for this purpose which reduces the sales cycle. The analyses and proposals include information on leasing and other financing options, which helps differentiate the Company from its competitors. The label business sales cycles are shorter with purchases made more frequently on a transactional basis.
