Item 1. Business
Unless expressly indicated or the context requires otherwise, the terms “Elevate,” “company,” “we,” “us” and “our” used below refer to Elevate Credit, Inc. and, where appropriate, our wholly owned subsidiaries and consolidated variable interest entities, as well as the direct lending and branded product business of our predecessor, Think Finance, Inc. ("TFI"), for periods prior to our 2014 spin-off from TFI. We generally refer to loans, customers and other information and data associated with each of Rise, Elastic and Today Card as Elevate’s loans, customers, information and data, irrespective of whether Elevate originates the credit to the customer or whether such credit is originated by a third party, or originated loans by FinWise Bank, Republic Bank and Capital Community Bank, where Elevate serves as a service provider. Effective June 29, 2020, we exited the United Kingdom (“UK”) and no longer offered installment loans under our “Sunny” brand name.
OUR MISSION
Our mission is to become the most trusted and preferred alternative credit provider for the New Middle Class - the more than 100 million credit constrained Americans.
OVERVIEW
Elevate, and the banks we support, provide financial solutions for everyday Americans. Our best-in-class platform enables customer-friendly online lending brands that utilize advanced AI underwriting. Elevate is reinventing non-prime credit with online products that provide financial relief today, and help people build a brighter financial future. We, along with the banks that license our technology, have originated $9.8 billion to more than 2.7 million customers.
We currently have two main business activities: 1) as a state-licensed lender ourselves and 2) as a service provider to FDIC-regulated banks. As of December 31, 2021, we had three primary lending product constructs - each with one brand. The three product constructs and brands are: Installment Loans (Rise), Lines of Credit (Elastic), and Credit Cards (Today Card).
OUR BUSINESS
Today, millions of Americans have low credit scores, often at no fault of their own. We estimate that approximately 31% of the US population has a credit score below 670.(1) As individuals' credit scores fall below the 670 FICO threshold, options for traditional credit dissipate. In fact, over one-third of Americans say they could not cover an emergency expense over $400 or would be forced to cover it by selling something or borrowing money,(2) and many Americans experience month-to-month income swings of more than 25%.(3) This enormous population of more than 100 million non-prime Americans is otherwise poorly served in the marketplace. Elevate, and the banks we support, help to fill that void with transparent products and brands that offer a pathway for customers to better credit. We call this "Good Today, Better Tomorrow."
In 2020, we, and the banks we support, offered enhanced COVID-19 related payment assistance tools to more than 80,000 customers, helping them navigate through the pandemic. Today, while we no longer offer the specific COVID-19 tools, we continue to offer payment assistance tools to customers that meet certain qualifications. This differentiates our products in the market, and moreover, we believe doing business this way is the right thing to do. We believe these tools are a win for our business and customers alike, and they will remain a key component of all Elevate brands in the future. We remain committed to transparent pricing with no prepayment penalties, as well as amortizing loan balances and flexible repayment schedules that let customers design the loan repayment terms they can afford. Our products reward successful payment history with rates on subsequent loans that can decrease over time and help customers improve their long-term financial well-being with features like credit bureau reporting, free credit monitoring and online financial literacy videos and tools.

OUR SOLUTIONS
Our innovative online credit solutions provide immediate relief to customers today and can help them build a brighter financial future. Our Blueprint™ Platform currently enables installment loan products, line of credit products, and credit cards. Rise, Elastic and the Today Card user interfaces all happen online or through a mobile device for maximum accessibility and near immediate underwriting decisions. Customers are able to apply within minutes using a mobile-optimized online application. Credit determinations are typically made in seconds and a majority of loan application decisions are fully automated with no manual review required. Funds are typically available the next-day. Customers can elect to make payments via preapproved automated clearinghouse (“ACH”) authorization or other methods such as check or debit card transfer. These products reflect the deep experience of our management team in the online non-prime lending industry and utilize leading technology and proprietary risk analytics to effectively manage profitability and optimize the customer experience.
Each of these products reflects our “Good Today, Better Tomorrow” mission and offers competitive rates and responsible lending features along with credit building and financial wellness tools. The products currently in market have rates that can decrease over time (Rise installment loans), no punitive fees (Rise and Elastic products), an industry-leading five day "Risk Free Guarantee," credit bureau reporting, free credit monitoring, and online financial literacy tools. In addition, to help customers facing financial hardships, we have eliminated punitive fees, including returned payment fees and late charges, among others, on all products excluding our Today Card credit card, which does include some modest industry-standard fees. We also integrate payment assistance tools into all three products. These tools include payment grace periods, payment deferments, interest rate reductions, and/or principal and interest forgiveness. In 2021, these tools helped more than 75,000 customers.
Rise, Elastic, and Today Card each follow distinct regulatory models, providing diversification across different regulatory frameworks. The Rise brand operates under licenses from each state it serves and is regulated by the CFPB; it also operates as a bank-originated credit product that is regulated by the FDIC. Elastic and the Today Card brands are both bank-originated and are regulated by the FDIC and other bank regulators.
Installment Loan - Rise
Our current installment loan brand, Rise, is the largest brand on the platform and operates as both a state-licensed lender in 12 states and is licensed to FDIC-regulated banks that originate in a total of 20 additional states. As the originator of the Rise loans in those states, the banks review and approve all marketing materials and campaigns and determine the underwriting strategies and score cutoffs used in processing applications. In addition, the banks define all program parameters and provide full compliance oversight over all aspects of the programs. Under the terms of our agreement with the banks, we provide the marketing services related to the Rise brand and license our technology platform and proprietary credit and fraud scoring models in order to help them originate and service the Rise customers. Our platform supports the banks' operational and compliance activities related to the Rise program. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview.”
Rise combined loans receivable(4) totaled $324.3 million, or 56% of our total combined loans receivable(4) as of December 31, 2021. Rise offers many customer-friendly features, including payment flexibility tools and rates that go down over time. As of December 31, 2021, more than 72% of established Rise installment loan customers in good standing had received a rate reduction after a refinance or on a subsequent loan. There are no origination fees, monthly fees, late fees, over-limit fees, or fees for returned payments on the product. 
Line of Credit - Elastic
Our current line of credit brand, Elastic, is licensed by an FDIC-regulated bank and operates in 34 states. Elastic is designed to be a financial safety net, offering customers peace of mind to help cover unexpected expenses through a fully-online draw feature. There are no origination fees, late fees, monthly fees, or over-limit fees. Additionally, customers must make a 10% mandatory principal reduction payment each month designed to encourage the full repayment of the original loan amount in approximately 10 months or less. As of December 31, 2021, Elastic loans receivable totaled $207.9 million, compared to $163.2 million at December 31, 2020.

(4) Combined loans receivable is defined as loans owned by us and consolidated VIEs plus loans originated and owned by third-party lenders pursuant to our CSO programs. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information and for a reconciliation of Combined loans receivable to Loans receivable, net, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with US GAAP.
Similar to our agreements with the banks that license the use of Rise installment loans, under the terms of our Elastic agreements with the bank, we provide marketing services and license our technology platform and proprietary credit and fraud scoring models to originate and service Elastic customers. As the originator of the Elastic lines of credit, the bank reviews and approves all marketing materials and campaigns and determines the underwriting strategies and score cutoffs used in processing applications. The bank defines all program parameters and provides full compliance oversight over all aspects of the program. Our platform supports the bank's operational and compliance activities related to the Elastic program. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview”.
Credit Card - Today Card
Our credit card brand, the Today Card, is the newest and fastest growing brand enabled by our platform, with 228% year-over-year growth in the number of active customers during 2021. Today Card offers credit constrained Americans many of the credit card features often reserved for prime customers. These features include higher line sizes up to $3,500, family flexibility, and credit score monitoring. Originated by an FDIC-regulated bank under the licensed Mastercard brand, Today Card is our lowest APR product, with an effective APR of 31% for the year ended December 31, 2021, and allows us to serve a broader spectrum of non-prime Americans. As of December 31, 2021, Today Card credit cards receivable totaled $50.2 million, compared to $14.5 million at December 31, 2020. In 2020, we followed a specific limited growth plan focused on customer response rates and credit quality. In 2021, we expanded our growth plan and customer response to the Today Card has been very strong, with high response rates and customer engagement, as well as positive customer satisfaction scores. We will look to continue to scale this product in 2022.
OUR ADVANTAGES
Our leadership has decades of experience and deep knowledge to offer both customers and banks innovative online credit solutions. We believe the following are our key advantages:
Blueprint™ - Our Adaptable and Nimble Platform
Over the last two years, we have reconfigured our entire tech stack and platform into one user-friendly module. We believe the Blueprint™ platform to be an industry leader in customer user experience and adaptability to bank needs. The new Blueprint™ platform allows us to move features and tools seamlessly and effectively across brands. The platform will also enable future products and brands to quickly reach market, while providing banks and others the ability to modify features, rates, and other functionalities. The Blueprint™ platform combines our user-friendly application management system, our proprietary underwriting technology, and account management functionality. We believe this offers the ability to expand to new products and brands and will prove to be an advantage for banks that license our platform. 
Industry Leading Risk Analytics and Underwriting
Traditional approaches for underwriting credit, such as FICO scores, are not adequate for non-prime customers who may have significant derogatory credit history, or no credit history at all. Unlike many lenders that may purchase wholesale data, we have invested to create our own data infrastructure to process bank data and variables from numerous sources. Our risk analytics infrastructure (all housed within Blueprint™) uses a massive (approximately 80+ terabyte) database composed of more than ten thousand potential data variables. We use machine learning to enhance our models and see continuous improvement. Our proprietary credit and fraud scoring models allow not only for the scoring of a broad range of non-prime customers, but also across a variety of products, channels, geographies, and regulatory requirements. These models continue to expand to include new variables and bank transaction data, which greatly increases our ability to model customer behaviors.
The above loss curves show our underwriting improvements by vintage, excluding the Today Card, although we note that the 2020 and 2021 vintages are not yet fully mature from a loss perspective. Furthermore, our discontinued UK operations are presented in the 2013-2017 vintages.
Marketing 
Our current three brands benefit from years of deep knowledge and customer research specifically on non-prime customers. The current brands are well known in the segment with customer satisfaction scores between 89% and 95% among new customers in 2021. 
Our advantages in marketing also include our mix of acquisition channels. Historically, we and the banks that license our technology have focused on direct mail efforts. Direct mail continues to be the largest channel and within the customer acquisition cost ("CAC") targets, or in the case of our Today Card brand, much lower than our CAC targets. Throughout 2021, we expanded our strategic partners channel substantially. We see considerably more space to grow this channel further and reach wider audiences. Digital marketing will be a stronger focus for us going forward as we facilitate the launch of new brands. 
Commitment to Transparency, Lower Rates, and Flex Programs
Our goal for non-prime customers is not only to fill their credit needs today, but to help them gain their financial footing. We call this “Good Today, Better Tomorrow.” Embedded in all of our brands are tools that we have learned, through experience and customer research, make a difference in customers’ lives. These tools include rates that go down over time, transparency in fee structure, no punitive or late fees, and most recently, payment flexibility tools. Approximately 72% of established Rise installment loan customers in good standing have seen their rate reduced. Over the course of the last year, over 75,000 customers used some form of payment flexibility. These payment flexibility tools were rolled out in the early stages of the pandemic but will continue to be a part of our brands into the future. We believe our ability to mold products to customer needs and offer pathways to lower priced products and better credit scores helps distinguish us in the industry.
Market Size and Legacy Competition
We estimate that over 100 million Americans do not have access to traditional lending products. This population is poorly served by banks and equally poorly served by legacy competitors, like payday and title loans. By continuing to innovate and reducing prices, we believe our long-term growth potential is immense. Customers continue to seek transparent, trusted, online solutions for their financial life. We strive to fill that enormous gap. 
OUR STRATEGY
Grow Existing Brands
We hope to grow all the brands in our existing product portfolios. Each product portfolio saw substantial growth in 2021 from 2020 lows, and we anticipate increased growth among all our product portfolios, particularly our Today Card portfolio, as it is our newest product. We, along with the banks we support, see opportunities in all marketing channels to expand portfolio size.
Within Targeted Financial Metrics
We base growth on two key metrics: CAC and charge-off rates. We aim to keep CAC within $250-300 and charge-off rates between 20-25%. Beyond that, we closely monitor the unit economics of each brand, and manage our business to key long-term targets such as 20% adjusted EBITDA margin(6). We aim to reach these targets as the portfolio matures over time.

(6) Adjusted EBITDA margin is a non-GAAP financial measure. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information and for reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with US GAAP.
Capital Allocation
We allocate cash flow to three key areas: growth, debt paydown, and stock buyback. We base these decisions on long-term economic value add for shareholders, while also ensuring our ability to innovate and support non-prime consumers. In 2021, we utilized all three allocations by: 1) growing the combined loans portfolio approximately 40%, 2) paying down approximately $70 million, net on our debt facilities, and 3) buying back 19% of our outstanding common shares.
New Partnerships on the Blueprint™ Platform
We anticipate the ability to add new partnerships and products onto our new platform. The new partnerships and brands, or white labeled brands, will contribute to our growth and strategy in the future. Our new brands will focus on lower price points and meeting customers at the point of need. 
Other Revenue
In 2021, we launched the new Elevate.com as a non-prime consumer hub for financial wellness tools. The new site also includes a marketplace for our brands and other resources that will benefit non-prime consumers. Although we do not anticipate substantial revenue in 2022, we plan to scale this offering in the future.
OUR HUMAN CAPITAL AND COMMITMENT TO ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, AND GOVERNANCE
Human capital
We are committed to building and nurturing a distinctive corporate culture of innovation, excellence, collaboration and integrity. Our key company values based on how we expect ourselves to serve customers, owners and each other are:
Think Big. We have always been an innovator in our industry. Ideas, both big and small, are our competitive advantage. We share a responsibility to think out of the box, challenge the status quo and embrace change.
Raise the Bar. Excellence is not a skill. It is a habit—the gradual result of always striving to do better. As a company and as individuals we push ourselves to build on success, learn from failure and get better every day.
Win Together. Our goals are too big to achieve as individuals. Collaboration is not a by-product of our work; it is the primary focus. It is also more fun.
Do the Right Thing. Doing the right thing is not optional. We hold each other to the highest standards and earn our reputation every day.
Our values are reinforced in all aspects of our employees’ relationship with our company, including during the recruiting process, quarterly check-ins, and annual performance reviews. Each quarter, employees who demonstrate these values are nominated for “Smart Awards,” and individuals and teams are selected and recognized at all-company Town Hall meetings. We are focused on attracting talented employees who embody innovation, collaboration, and commitment to our core values. An integral part of our hiring process is our intern program, which helps to ensure we continually have a pipeline of talent throughout the year.
The technology sector is rapidly evolving, so we meaningfully invest in programs like Azure certification to advance the skills of our workforce. Elevate employees have achieved over 300 Azure fundamentals and advanced-role certifications as of December 31, 2021. We retain talent by providing market-competitive compensation and benefits, including flexible work arrangements, incentives and recognition programs, leadership development opportunities, tuition assistance, community involvement programs, and by fostering a company culture that gets stronger each year. 
Elevate was named a “2021 Best Workplace in Texas” by Great Place to Work. We are focused on creating an exceptional workplace and launched a new partnership with Gallup to identify strengths and improvement opportunities to make Elevate an even better place to work. We believe this reflects our commitment to build a strong and lasting company and corporate culture. We expanded Employee Resource Groups, which are voluntary, employee-led groups that help connect communities, raise broader awareness around Diversity, Equity and Inclusion ("DEI"), and enable us to leverage our differences. 
Based on employee feedback, we have adopted a hybrid work approach that is designed to enable collaboration while offering our employees flexibility within a framework. We have two Connection Days a month where employees who live in the Dallas-Fort Worth area ("DFW") are encouraged to work from the office to strengthen relationships and improve collaboration. We empower our leaders to work with their teams and align on in-office expectations that work for each team. We implemented a remote work policy for full-time employees who wish to live outside DFW, which expanded our ability to attract and retain talent - we now have employees in 15 states and growing. 
Employee well-being has always been top of mind for us, and with the recent rise in mental health concerns, focusing on well-being is more important than ever. In 2021, we launched a well-being framework to support our employees and partnered with Headspace to provide employees with a science-backed mindfulness and meditation app. We continue to offer relief time off for COVID-19 related issues and offer occasional half days to support our employees and give them additional time to recharge. Our working parents are provided flexible schedules to assist in managing work and childcare responsibilities and Elevate was recently named for a third year in a row a “Best Place for Working Parents” in DFW. Our onboarding experience and employee development programs transitioned to hybrid delivery, and we supported staff with virtual breakrooms, health challenges, and we finished the year with a festive holiday event.
We’re committed to supporting local charitable organizations that make a difference in our community. We provide each employee with 16 hours of paid volunteer time each year, and we hosted a Feed the Community Challenge during National Volunteer Month to encourage employees to team up to help support our local food banks. Over the summer, we hosted an Elevate our Community raffle, which provided approximately 111,000 meals to local neighbors in need. We also held a Charity Swag sale with our unused company products, raising money to benefit Junior Achievement. In 2021, we gave to over 35 non-profit organizations, and we launched a new Give for Good matching gift program to help double the impact of employee donations to organizations that are important to them.
As of December 31, 2021, we had 436 full-time employees, including 211 in technology, 43 in risk management, 62 in marketing and product development, 60 in customer support and loan operations and 60 in general and support functions. We also outsource certain functions, such as collections and customer service to increase efficiencies and scalability. We use an internal quality team to review and improve third-party performance.
Environmental, Social, and Governance
Elevate continues to make advancements in Environmental, Social, and Governance initiatives. These efforts are spearheaded by our Chief Human Resources Officer and Chief Diversity Officer. Over the last year, we have created a mission for these efforts to be included and forefront in employee communications. 
Guided by our mission, we are driven by a shared responsibility to act as a positive force among our employees, customers, and communities. We accomplish this through our core belief of doing the right thing — a principle that shapes our approach to the environment, to society and to our own corporate governance. Through conscientious thought, planning and action, we are committed to being a source of good wherever and whenever we can. 
These efforts in 2022 include company-wide climate consciousness, well-being and DEI focus for employees, business ethics tracking, and a continued commitment to customer financial health. 
OUR REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT
The online consumer loan products we currently originate or support are subject to a range of laws, regulations and standards that address consumer lending, banking, credit services, consumer protections and reporting, information sharing, marketing, debt collection, data protection, state licensing and interest rate and term limitations, among other things.
All products are subject to supervision, regulation and / or enforcement by numerous regulatory bodies—from state regulators, attorneys general, and federal regulators, like the CFPB, the FTC and in some cases the FDIC. Consistent with regulatory expectations, we have an extensive compliance program and internal controls. 
For a discussion of the risks related to our regulatory environment, see “Risk Factors—Other Risks Related to Compliance and Regulation.”
State and local regulation and licensing applicable to products originated by Elevate
The Rise loans we originate directly to customers are regulated under a variety of enabling state statutes. The scope of state regulation, including permissible interest rates, fees and terms, varies from state to state. Some states require specific disclosures, mandate or prohibit certain terms and limit the maximum interest rate and fees that may be charged. Where licensing or registration is required, we are subject to extensive state rules, licensing and examination. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in, among other things, refunds of excess charges, monetary penalties, revocation of required licenses, voiding of loans and other administrative enforcement actions. These Rise loans are available in the following 12 states: Alabama, Delaware, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Mississippi, Missouri, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Carolina, Utah and Wisconsin. In these states, Rise may also be subject to additional municipal regulations and ordinances related to, for example, certain non-bank loan products and debt collection. The scope of municipal regulations and ordinances vary. Several state regulators have publicly expressed their intent to increase supervision and enforcement of consumer protection laws against supervised entities. State consumer protection and privacy laws also apply to Rise loans. In many states, legislators and attorneys general could increase their focus or enforcement of these consumer protection statutes. If this were to occur, it could result in additional regulatory oversight and enforcement on our business.
US state and federal regulation
All of our products are subject to a variety of state and federal laws, including but not limited to the following:
Truth in Lending Act.    The federal Truth in Lending Act (“TILA”) and its underlying regulations known as Regulation Z require creditors to deliver disclosures to borrowers during the life cycle of a loan—certain advertisements, at application, at account opening or at consummation and for open-end credit products, such as Elastic and Today Card, periodically, and for certain post-consummation events (e.g., refinancings, change in terms for open-end credit).
Under the appropriate disclosure rules, the originating creditor is required to provide borrowers with key information about the loan, including, for open-end credit, the annual percentage rate (if applicable), applicable finance charges, transaction and penalty fees, and, for closed-end loans, the annual percentage rate, the finance charge, the amount financed, the total of payments, the number and amount of payments and payment due dates. Consumers are provided substantive protections regarding loan products under Regulation Z and TILA with special rules for calculating annual percentage rates, advertising, and rules for resolving billing errors for open-ended credit.
Fair Credit Reporting Act.    We are also subject to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (the “FCRA”) and similar state laws, as both a user of consumer reports and a furnisher of consumer credit information to credit reporting agencies. The FCRA and similar state laws regulate the use of consumer reports and reporting of information to credit reporting agencies. Specifically, the FCRA establishes requirements that apply to the use of “consumer reports” and similar data, including certain notifications to consumers, including when an adverse action, such as a loan declination, is based on information contained in a consumer report. We only obtain and use consumer reports subject to the permissible purpose requirements under the FCRA, which also permits us to share our experience information, information obtained from credit reporting agencies, and other customer information with affiliates. We comply with notice and opt out requirements for prescreen solicitations and for certain information sharing under the FCRA. We also have implemented an identity theft prevention program to fulfill the requirements of the Red Flags Regulations and Guidelines issued under the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (the “FACT Act”).
In meeting our duties to furnish consumer credit information to consumer reporting agencies, we:
Ø    furnish consumer credit information pursuant to the METRO 2 guidelines;
Ø    establish and maintain procedures regarding the accuracy and integrity of the consumer credit information we report; and
Ø    establish and maintain procedures to conduct timely investigations of customer disputes (received directly from customers or through credit reporting agencies) regarding the consumer credit information we report to the consumer reporting agencies.
Equal Credit Opportunity Act.    The federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act (the “ECOA”) generally prohibits creditors from discriminating against applicants on the basis of race, color, sex, age (provided the individual is of legal age to enter into a contract), religion, national origin, marital status, the fact that all or part of the applicant’s income derives from any public assistance program or the fact that the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the federal Consumer Credit Protection Act. Regulation B, which implements ECOA, restricts creditors from requesting certain types of information from loan applicants and from using advertising or making statements that would discourage, on a prohibited basis, a reasonable person from making or pursuing an application.
In the underwriting of loans offered through our online platform, and with respect to all aspects of the credit transaction, including any servicing of loans and other credit, we, our lending partners and marketing affiliates must comply with applicable provisions prohibiting discouragement and discrimination.
ECOA also requires creditors to provide consumers with timely notices of adverse action taken on credit applications or counteroffers. A prospective borrower applying for a loan but denied credit or offered a counteroffer is provided with an adverse action notice.
FTC Act and Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010.    Both the FTC and CFPB regulate advertising, marketing of and practices related to financial products and services. The FTC is charged with preventing unfair or deceptive acts or practices and false or misleading advertisements, and the CFPB is charged with preventing unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts and practices. 
Unfair, Deceptive, Abusive Acts and Practices.    The Dodd-Frank Act prohibits “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts or practices (“UDAAPs”). Through enforcement actions, the CFPB has found UDAAP conduct in most phases in the life cycle of a loan, including the marketing, collecting and reporting of loans. UDAAPs could involve omissions or misrepresentations of important information to consumers or practices that take advantages of vulnerable consumers, such as elderly or low-income consumers. All products and services provided by Elevate and its vendors are subject to the UDAAP prohibition. There are also various state laws that govern unfair and deceptive acts and practices with which we must comply.
Military Lending Act.    The Military Lending Act (“MLA”) restricts, among other things, the interest rate and other terms that can be offered to active military personnel and their dependents on most types of consumer credit. The MLA caps the interest rate that may be offered to a covered borrower to a 36% military annual percentage rate (“MAPR”), which includes certain fees such as application fees, participation fees and fees for add-on products. The MLA also requires certain disclosures and prohibits certain terms, such as mandatory arbitration if a dispute arises concerning the consumer credit product. The MLA covers Elastic, Rise and the Today Card and restricts our, or our bank partners', ability to offer our products to military personnel and their dependents above a 36% MAPR. Failure to comply with the MLA may limit our ability to collect principal, interest, and fees from borrowers and may result in civil and criminal liability that could harm our business.
The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act.    The federal Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (“SCRA”) and similar state laws apply to certain loans made to certain members of the US military, reservists and members of the National Guard and certain dependents. The SCRA limits the interest rate a creditor may charge or certain collection actions a creditor may take on certain loans while a servicemember is on military duty. We maintain policies and procedures to comply with SCRA.
The Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act.    The federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (“E-SIGN”) and similar state laws, particularly the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (“UETA”) authorize the creation of legally binding and enforceable agreements utilizing electronic records and signatures. E-SIGN and UETA require businesses that use electronic records or signatures in consumer transactions and provide required disclosures to consumers electronically, to obtain the consumer’s consent to receive information electronically. When a borrower is provided electronic disclosures, we obtain his or her consent to transact business electronically, to receive electronic disclosures and maintain electronic records in compliance with E-SIGN and UETA requirements. We also follow similar state e-signature rules mandating that certain disclosures be made, and certain steps be followed, in order to obtain and authenticate e-signatures.
Electronic Fund Transfer Act.    The Electronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978 (“EFTA”) protects consumers engaging in electronic fund transfers, including preauthorized transactions and recurring transactions. The EFTA is implemented through Regulation E. Borrowers of our products often choose to repay by electronic fund transfers (“EFTs”) and, accordingly, a written authorization, signed or similarly authenticated, may be required in connection with auto-pay features. To the extent a borrower repays his or her payment obligation through EFTs, the EFTA and Regulation E apply, and contain restrictions and disclosure requirements while providing consumers certain rights relating to EFTs. Restrictions on how consumers choose to pay or how lenders comply with EFTs could impact our current business processes.
Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.    The federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (the “FDCPA”) provides guidelines and limitations on the conduct of third-party debt collectors and debt buyers when collecting consumer debt. The CFPB also recently passed Regulation F, which implements the FDCPA and inter alia, places additional restrictions on collection activities (including call frequency), gives consumers additional rights, and requires additional disclosures. While the FDCPA and Regulation F generally do not apply to first-party creditors collecting their own debts or to servicers when collecting debts that were current when servicing began, we use the FDCPA and Regulation F as a guideline for all collections. We require all vendors and third parties that provide collection services on our behalf to comply with the FDCPA and Regulation F to the extent possible. We also comply with state and local laws that apply to creditors and provide guidance and limitations similar to the FDCPA and Regulation F.
Fair Credit Billing Act. The Fair Credit Billing Act ("FCBA") protects consumers from prejudicial or unfair billing practices in open-ended lines of credit and credit cards. It lays out consumers' rights to dispute credit card issuers' charges and addresses consumer redress for common billing errors.
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.    We are also subject to various federal and state laws and regulations relating to privacy and security of consumers’ nonpublic personal information. Under these laws, including the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”) and Regulation P promulgated thereunder, we must disclose our privacy policy and practices, including those policies relating to the sharing of nonpublic personal information with third parties. We may also be required to provide an opt-out to certain sharing. The GLBA and other laws also require us to safeguard personal information. The FTC regulates the safeguarding requirements of the GLBA for non-bank lenders through its Safeguard Rules.
Anti-money laundering and economic sanctions.    We and the originating lenders that we work with are also subject to certain provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act and the Bank Secrecy Act under which we must maintain an anti-money laundering compliance program covering certain of our business activities. In addition, the Office of Foreign Assets Control prohibits us from engaging in financial transactions with specially designated nationals.
Anticorruption.    We are also subject to the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) which generally prohibits companies and their agents or intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business and/or other benefits.
Telemarketing Sales Rule.  We are also subject to the Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act, the FTC’s Telemarketing Sales Rule promulgated pursuant to such Act, and similar state laws. The Telemarketing Sales Rule prohibits deceptive and abusive telemarketing acts or practices, such as calling before 8 a.m. or after 9 p.m., and requires telemarketers and sellers to make certain disclosures to consumers in every outbound call. Telemarketers are also required to comply with a company specific do-not-call framework, as well as with state and federal do-not-call registries. We have implemented policies and procedures reasonably designed to comply with the Telemarketing Sales Rule.
Telephone Consumer Protection Act. We are also subject to the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and its implementing regulations (together, the “TCPA”) and the regulations of the FCC. The TCPA regulates the delivery of live and prerecorded telemarketing calls, non-marketing calls to cell phones through the use of an automated telephone dialing system, fax advertisements, and text messages. For example, under the TCPA, it is unlawful to make many of these types of communications without the prior consent of the recipient. The TCPA also established a federal do-not-call registry, with the Telemarketing Sales Rule, as noted above. We maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to comply with the TCPA.
CAN-SPAM Act. We are subject to the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 and the FTC’s rules promulgated pursuant to such Act (together, “CAN-SPAM Act”), which establish requirements for certain “commercial messages” and “transactional or relationship messages.” For example, the CAN-SPAM Act prohibits the sending of messages that contain false, deceptive or misleading information. It also gives recipients the right to stop receiving commercial messages. We have implemented policies and procedures reasonably designed to comply with the CAN-SPAM Act.
CARD Act. The Today Card is subject to the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure ("CARD") Act that establishes fair and transparent practices relating to credit cards. The CARD Act, among other things, provides protections for consumers such as limiting interest rate hikes, banning the issuance of credit cards to anyone less than 21 years of age without an adult co-signer, limiting over-limit, late and account-opening fees, and requiring transparent disclosures related to minimum payments.
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
The CFPB regulates consumer financial products and services, including the consumer loans that we offer. The CFPB has regulatory, supervisory and enforcement powers over certain providers of consumer financial products and services. For a discussion of the risks to our business related to CFPB regulation, see “Risk Factors— The CFPB may have examination authority over our consumer lending business that could have a significant impact on our business.”
Federal Trade Commission
The FTC enforces the safeguarding requirements of the GLBA against non-banks pursuant its authority to enforce Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices. In addition, the FTC has a history of pursuing enforcement actions against non-bank lenders and online lead generators for alleged unfair or deceptive acts or practices in connection with the marketing or servicing of consumer credit products and services. Like the CFPB, the FTC may issue fines and corrective orders that could require us to make revisions to our existing business models. The FTC has jurisdiction over Elevate and its business practices.
OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
Protecting our rights to our intellectual property is critical, as it enhances our ability to offer distinctive services and products to customers, which differentiates us from our competitors. We rely on a combination of trademark laws and trade secret protections in the US and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect the intellectual property rights related to our proprietary analytics, predictive underwriting models and software systems. We have either registered trademarks and/or pending applications in the US for the marks Elevate, Rise, Elastic, Today Card and Blueprint™. Our trademarks are materially important to us and we anticipate maintaining them and renewing them.
OUR HISTORY
We were created through the spin-off of the direct lending and branded product businesses of TFI, which was founded in 2001. Prior to the spin-off transaction, TFI had two discrete lines of business: (1) a direct lender and branded product provider to non-prime consumers and (2) a licensor of its technology platform to third-party lenders. In order to allow each of these separate lines of business to focus on its relative strategic and operational strengths and future business plans, the board of directors of TFI decided to spin off its direct lending and branded products business into a separate company.
We were incorporated in Delaware on January 31, 2014 as a subsidiary of TFI, and we had no material assets or activities as a separate corporate entity until the spin-off occurred. On May 1, 2014, TFI contributed the assets and liabilities associated with its direct lending and branded products business to us and distributed its interest in our Company to its stockholders, but retained the assets and liabilities associated with its licensed technology platform line of business. TFI’s retained business line entails providing marketing services to third-party lenders and licensing TFI’s technology platform to these lenders for marketing and licensing fees. TFI previously conducted its direct lending business through various legal entity subsidiaries, which were contributed to us in the spin-off transaction.
On April 11, 2017, we closed an initial public offering (“IPO”) of 12,400,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $6.50 per share to the public. In connection with the closing, the underwriters exercised their option to purchase in full for an additional 1,860,000 shares. On April 6, 2017, our stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “ELVT.”
