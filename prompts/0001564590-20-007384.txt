Overview
 We are a biopharmaceutical company developing and commercializing treatments for potentially life-threatening food allergies. It is estimated that over 30 million people in the United States and Europe have a food allergy, with peanut allergy being the most prevalent and most commonly associated with severe outcomes and life-threatening events. 
 Patients with food allergies are typically counseled to practice strict dietary avoidance. When accidental exposure to food allergens invokes a serious allergic reaction, rescue therapies, such as antihistamines or injectable epinephrine, are the only recourse available. 
 Our main therapeutic approach, which we refer to as Characterized Oral Desensitized Immunology Therapy, or CODITTM, is designed to desensitize patients to food allergens and thereby reduce the risk of having an allergic reaction upon accidental exposure or reduce symptom severity should an allergic reaction occur. As a result, we believe CODIT could contribute to reducing the burden and anxiety experienced by food-allergic patients and their families.  
 
PALFORZIATM (Peanut (Arachis hypogaea) Allergen Powder-dnfp) (formerly AR101) is our lead internally developed product utilizing CODIT and was approved by the FDA for marketing and sale in the United States in January 2020.  PALFORZIA is indicated for the mitigation of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, that may occur with accidental exposure to peanut. PALFORZIA is approved for use in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of peanut allergy. Initial dose escalation may be administered to patients aged 4 through 17 years. Up-dosing and maintenance may be continued in patients 4 years of age and older. PALFORZIA is to be used in conjunction with a peanut-avoidant diet. We are currently commercializing PALFORZIA in the United States through a specialty sales force of approximately 80 Practice Account Managers targeting practicing allergists.
 
In addition to the approved indication, we are evaluating PALFORZIA for use in young children aged one to less than four years old in a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled multinational Phase 3 trial called POSEIDON. We expect to complete enrolment of this trial in the second half of 2020. We also submitted a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, for PALFORZIA with the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, in June 2019 and the application is currently under review. We expect the EMA to issue a decision on the application in the fourth quarter of 2020.  
 
We are developing additional CODIT product candidates beyond peanut allergy. In August 2019, we commenced a Phase 2 clinical trial in subjects with hen egg allergy for our product candidate, AR201, which we expect to be complete in the first half of 2021. We are also exploring a product candidate designed to treat multi-nut allergy, including walnut allergy. 
 
In February 2020, we in-licensed AIMab7195 (formerly XmAb7195) from Xencor, Inc., or Xencor. Initially, AIMab7195 will be developed as an adjunctive treatment with our existing CODIT pipeline assets, including PALFORZIA, to explore treatment outcomes, including the potential path to remission, in patients with food allergies. AIMab7195 is designed to mediate the suppression of IgE and IgE-producing cells and originally was developed for the treatment of allergic asthma.  
 
We maintain worldwide commercial rights to PALFORZIA and all of our product candidates. If approved in the European Union, or EU, and the United Kingdom, we currently intend to commercialize PALFORZIA in Europe by developing a specialty sales force targeting allergy-focused clinicians in major European markets, beginning with Germany.
 Our Strategy
 Our goal is to build a biopharmaceutical company that develops and commercializes proprietary therapies to improve the lives of food-allergic patients and their families. We intend to achieve this goal by pursuing the following key strategic objectives:

• | Commercialize PALFORZIA in the United States for the treatment of peanut allergy: We recently commenced marketing activities for PALFORZIA in the United States through a specialty field force of approximately 80 Practice Account Managers targeting a subset of the approximately 5,000 practicing allergists in the United States. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Commercialize PALFORZIA in Europe through our own specialty field force: We own worldwide commercial rights to PALFORZIA and all of our product candidates. If PALFORZIA is approved by the EMA and Swissmedic for the treatment of peanut allergy, we intend to commercialize it by developing a specialty field force targeting allergy-focused clinicians in the major European markets. We anticipate that this field force could also support the commercialization of additional CODIT product candidates, if approved.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Expand the PALFORZIA label: We are conducting a Phase 3 clinical trial for young children aged one to less than four years old. We expect to complete enrolment of this trial in the second half of 2020. If the trial is successful, we intend to submit the results to the FDA under a sBLA with the goal to extend the approved label to this age group.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage the CODIT system to develop additional proprietary product candidates for the treatment of food allergies: Leveraging the expertise we have gained developing PALFORZIA, we are currently evaluating AR201 as a treatment for egg allergy in a randomized Phase 2 clinical trial in subjects with hen egg allergy and expect to complete this trial in the first half of 2021.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Develop new modalities to treat food allergies: We are motivated to advance the field of food allergy by exploring other treatment modalities beyond our CODIT system. For example, we are exploring the adjunctive use of monoclonal antibodies in combination with PALFORZIA through the development of proprietary drug candidates, such as AIMab7195, as well as through collaborations with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.

PALFORZIA Program Overview
 Peanut allergy is a life-threatening disease. Based on a 2014 study published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, 40% to 50% of the people with peanut allergy in the United States are sensitive to an exposure of 100 mg or less of peanut protein, the equivalent of less than half of a peanut kernel (one peanut kernel typically contains approximately 250 mg to 300 mg of peanut protein). In addition, people with peanut allergy are often sensitive to as little as 10 mg of peanut protein. Strict dietary avoidance is hard to achieve and accidental exposure to food allergens is common, resulting in approximately 200,000 emergency room visits per year in the United States. The burden and anxiety for patients and their families is significant and a highly motivating force in seeking out therapy. There is a particularly high unmet need in young children who spend a significant portion of their day away at school where parental control is diminished and in adolescents who face peer pressure from their friends and classmates and may begin to engage in risk-taking behaviors. 
 Allergists have long used immunotherapy approaches to successfully treat patients with environmental allergies. Published studies have shown oral immunotherapy, or OIT, to be a potentially promising approach to desensitizing patients with peanut, milk, egg, tree nut and other food allergies. This approach involves a dose escalation phase in which the food allergen is gradually introduced orally to reduce the immune response to that allergen.  After reaching a target dose, daily ingestion of the allergen at a fixed therapeutic dose continues immunomodulation. With CODIT, we are the first company to develop an OIT-based therapeutic approach to treat food allergies that has undergone the rigorous development required by the FDA for other approved pharmaceuticals. We believe that our first product developed with our CODIT approach, PALFORZIA, has the potential to fulfill the need for a consistent and scalable OIT-based approach to peanut allergy.
 Clinical Trial Results
 Clinical Trial Results Included in PALFORZIA U.S. Approved Package Insert
 The efficacy of PALFORZIA for the mitigation of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, in patients with peanut allergy was investigated in PALISADE. PALISADE was a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the efficacy and safety of PALFORZIA in patients with peanut allergy aged 4 through 55 years in the United States, Canada, and Europe. The primary analysis population consisted of 496 subjects (PALFORZIA, N = 372; placebo, N = 124) aged 4 through 17 years in the intent-to-treat, or ITT, population who received at least one dose of study treatment. After an initial dose escalation ranging from 0.5 mg to 6 mg on day 1 and confirmation of tolerability of the 3 mg dose on day 2, subjects underwent up-dosing for 20 to 40 weeks starting at 3 mg until the 300 mg dose was reached. The up-dosing period varied for each subject depending on how the dose was tolerated. Subjects then underwent 24 to 28 weeks of maintenance immunotherapy with 300 mg PALFORZIA until the end of the study. At the end of the maintenance period, subjects completed an exit double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge, or DBPCFC, to approximate an accidental exposure to peanut and to assess their ability to tolerate increasing amounts of peanut protein with no more than mild allergic symptoms. The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of subjects tolerating a single dose of 600 mg peanut protein in the exit DBPCFC with no more than mild allergic symptoms after six months of maintenance treatment. The primary efficacy endpoint was considered met if the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval, or CI, for the difference in response rates between the treatment and the placebo groups was greater than the prespecified margin of 15%. Key secondary endpoints included the comparisons of the response rates after single doses of 300 mg and 1000 mg peanut protein as well as a comparison of the maximum severity of symptoms at any challenge dose of peanut protein during the exit DBPCFC. The key secondary endpoints were to be evaluated for statistical significance (two-sided p < 0.05) only if the primary endpoint and all the preceding tests in the hierarchy were statistically significant in favor of PALFORZIA. Response rates at the exit DBPCFC for the ITT population are shown in Table 1. The maximum severity of symptoms at any challenge is shown in Table 2.

 Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with the adverse reaction rates in clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The clinical data for PALFORZIA reflect exposure in 709 peanut-allergic subjects enrolled in two Phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (PALISADE and RAMSES), and in long-term, open-label, follow-on studies. In PALISADE, subjects were up-dosed for 20 to 40 weeks followed by maintenance dosing for 24 to 28 weeks. In RAMSES, subjects were up-dosed for 20 to 40 weeks up to a 300 mg daily dose with no extended maintenance dosing. In these studies, subjects recorded adverse reactions daily in an electronic diary card throughout the study duration.  PALISADE (NCT02635776) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled efficacy and safety study conducted in the United States, Canada, and Europe evaluating PALFORZIA versus placebo in 555 subjects aged 4 through 55 years with peanut allergy. Subjects were required to have serum IgE to peanut ≥ 0.35 kUA/L within 12 months before study entry and/or a mean wheal diameter on skin-prick test to peanut ≥ 3 mm greater than the negative control. The primary analysis population was aged 4 through 17 years, 78% white and 57% male. At study entry, subjects reacted at 100 mg or less of peanut protein in a double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC). The primary analysis was conducted in 496 subjects aged 4 through 17 years (PALFORZIA, N = 372; placebo, N = 124). Of the subjects aged 4 through 17 years treated with PALFORZIA, 72% had a medical history of anaphylactic reactions to peanut, 66% reported multiple food allergies, 63% had a medical history of atopic dermatitis, and 53% had a present or previous diagnosis of asthma. Subjects with severe persistent or uncontrolled asthma were excluded.  RAMSES was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled safety study conducted in the United States and Canada evaluating PALFORZIA versus placebo in 506 subjects aged 4 through 17 years with peanut allergy. Subjects were required to have a clinical history of peanut allergy including onset of characteristic allergic signs and symptoms within 2 hours of known oral exposure to peanut, serum IgE to peanut of ≥ 14 kUA/L and a mean wheal diameter on skin prick test  ≥ 8 mm greater than the negative control at screening. Subjects were not required to complete a DBPCFC for study entry. The study duration was approximately 6 months and compared the safety and tolerability of PALFORZIA (N = 337) with placebo (N = 168). Most subjects were male (63%) and white (79%). Of the subjects treated with PALFORZIA, 60.5% had a medical history of anaphylactic reactions, 65.0% reported multiple food allergies, 57.9% had a medical history of atopic dermatitis, and 52.2% had a present or previous diagnosis of asthma. Subjects with severe persistent or uncontrolled asthma were excluded. Across these two Phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical studies, the most common adverse reactions in subjects treated with

Gastrointestinal reactions were the most common reason leading to discontinuation of study product during initial dose escalation and up-dosing combined (6.5% PALFORZIA, 1.0% placebo), followed by respiratory disorders (2.3% PALFORZIA, 1.0% placebo). 
 Additional Clinical Data Included in European MAA
 In February 2018, we completed enrollment of 175 patients in our European Phase 3 efficacy trial designed with a higher efficacy bar of tolerating 1,000 mg of peanut protein in an exit food-challenge without anything more than mild, transient symptoms, which we refer to as the ARTEMIS (AR101 Trial in Europe Measuring Oral Immunotherapy Success) trial.  In June 2019, we announced positive results from ARTEMIS.  Efficacy results for the ITT group are summarized in Table 4 below:

 Food Allergy Overview
 Food Allergies are a Significant and Growing Health Problem
 Food allergies are a significant and growing health problem in the United States, Europe and throughout the developed world. It is estimated that over 30 million people in the United States and Europe have a food allergy, and one in 13 children are affected in the United States. According to a study published in JAMA Pediatrics in 2013, the economic cost of food allergies in the United States is estimated to equal approximately $25 billion per year, of which approximately $4 billion is associated with direct medical expenses. Food allergies are a particularly urgent issue for children and adolescents because of the greater prevalence of food allergies in those age groups and because of the increased risk of accidental exposures leading to a serious allergic reaction. A large-scale study conducted in 2011 concluded that approximately 8% of children and adolescents in the United States have a food allergy and that approximately 39% of that group had a history of at least one severe allergic reaction. We estimate that over 50% of patients with peanut allergy experience a severe allergic reaction each year.
 Peanut allergy is one of the most common food allergies in the world, affecting more than 1.6 million children and teens in the United States alone. It can be a chronic and life-long condition, and reactions to peanut can range from mild to potentially life-threatening, with one in four peanut-allergic patients visiting emergency rooms each year due to accidental exposures.  Among children with food allergies in the United States, approximately 25% are allergic to peanuts, with other common food allergies being milk (21%), shellfish (17%), tree nut (13%, of which walnut represents 40%)) and egg (10%). We estimate that there are approximately three million people in the United States and three million people in Europe with peanut allergy, including over three million children. The prevalence of peanut allergy in children in the United States is estimated to have increased at a constant annual growth rate of approximately 10% between 1997 and 2008, and experts believe it has continued to rise since 2008.
Risks Associated with Allergic Reactions
 Allergic reactions to food are painful, frightening and potentially deadly. Symptoms of an allergic reaction include hives, swelling, vomiting, abdominal pain, wheezing, breathlessness, and lowered blood pressure. Severe and potentially life-threatening reactions are referred to as anaphylaxis and such reactions require urgent medical attention and often result in treatment at hospital emergency departments. Food-related allergic reactions are estimated to result in approximately 200,000 emergency room visits and over 10,000 hospital admissions each year in the United States.
 Allergic reactions, including severe allergic reactions, can be triggered by exposure to minute quantities of the relevant food allergen. For example, of the over two million people with peanut allergy in the United States, 40% to 50% are sensitive to an exposure of 100 mg or less of peanut protein, the equivalent of less than half of a peanut kernel (one peanut kernel typically contains approximately 250 mg to 300 mg of peanut protein). In addition, people with peanut allergy are often sensitive to as little as 10 mg of peanut protein, the equivalent of approximately 1/25th of a peanut kernel. As a result, accidental exposure arising from contamination of a food source or the inaccurate or confusing labeling of food products occurs regularly and can result in severe allergic reactions.

Causes of Allergic Reactions
 Food allergies occur when the immune system responds to a harmless food as if it were a threat. The human gastrointestinal tract contains immune cells whose purpose is to identify and mount a response against proteins deemed to be foreign and unsafe. These cells come into contact with a large amount and variety of food proteins. In a non-allergic person, a tolerance for food proteins develops early in life, and the immune cells do not mount a response when food proteins are detected. In contrast, in an allergic patient, the immune system is sensitized to one or more food proteins, or allergens. As a result of this sensitization, the immune system produces antibodies, known as IgE antibodies, which are directed against a particular allergen, such as a specific peanut protein. The IgE antibodies link with mast cells and basophils, which are other immune cells. When an IgE antibody linked to these immune cells encounters the allergen it is directed against, the immune cells are activated and release histamine and other inflammatory mediators into the blood. These mediators then provoke the symptoms of an allergic reaction.
 The development and progression of food allergies is highly variable. It is unknown why some people develop food allergies while others do not. For certain types of allergies, such as milk and egg, patients may outgrow their allergies, but for others, such as peanuts, tree nuts, and shellfish, most patients remain allergic for life. In addition, a person’s sensitivity appears to vary over time based on a range of factors. It is not unusual for a person’s first allergic reaction to be mild and their second allergic reaction to be severe or life-threatening.
 Challenges in the Current Treatment and Management of Food Allergies
 The most common practices to manage food allergies are strict avoidance of food allergens and emergency treatment of allergy symptoms in the event of an accidental exposure. These options have substantial limitations, and the burdens of practicing avoidance and stress caused by the limited availability of effective treatment options for accidental exposure can have a substantial negative impact on the quality of life of food-allergic patients and their families. For example, food-allergic patients and their caregivers often have difficulties managing their social and day-to-day lives and live with an ongoing fear of accidental exposure and anaphylaxis. One study found that children with peanut allergy reported a poorer quality of life than children with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. A separate study found that the parents of peanut-allergic children reported more disruption in their family’s lives than the parents of children with rheumatological disease.
 Limitations of Practicing Avoidance of Food Allergens
 Successfully practicing avoidance can be very difficult and requires careful reading of food labels, care in the storage and preparation of foods, awareness of product recalls for mislabeling and contamination, and oftentimes avoidance of cuisines where the food allergen is known to be common. In addition, activities such as attending a sporting event, traveling by airplane or visiting public spaces become difficult and stressful for food-allergic patients and their families. Practicing avoidance can be particularly difficult on food-allergic children as parents often attempt to prevent accidental exposures by limiting their child’s participation in everyday activities, including social activities, eating outside the home and sometimes even choosing to home school their child because such food-allergic children may not have the awareness or self-regulation skills to practice avoidance by themselves. As children move into adolescence and young adulthood, decreased parental supervision and increased societal pressures often complicate the practice of avoidance.
Limitations of Emergency and Symptomatic Treatments
 Food-allergic patients typically must carry rescue medication to treat severe and possibly life-threatening allergic reactions. The most widely used treatment is epinephrine (also known as adrenaline), which is administered using an auto-injector, such as an EpiPen. Epinephrine blunts certain symptoms of the allergic reaction by increasing heart rate and blood pressure and dilating airways, but it does not treat the allergic reaction itself. While epinephrine is useful as a rescue medication, it is not always administered properly or quickly enough and may not be sufficient to counteract the effects of the allergic reaction.
Limitations of Current Desensitization Treatments
 Emergency and symptomatic remedies are reactive treatments and often ineffective in the chronic management of food allergies. The most commonly practiced proactive therapy for food and other allergies is desensitization therapy. Desensitization therapy consists of repeated administrations of increasing quantities of an allergen to an allergic patient in order to decrease the immune response to that allergen. The most common form of desensitization therapy is subcutaneous injections for patients with environmental allergies. While desensitization therapy has had significant success in the treatment of environmental allergies, it has been less successful in the treatment of food allergies. Four different desensitization therapy approaches to food allergies have been researched:

• | Subcutaneous Injections: Involves the subcutaneous injection of the food allergen. This approach has been shown to induce desensitization in some patients but has had an unacceptably high incidence of adverse events and research on this approach has largely been abandoned.

• | Sublingual Immunotherapy: Involves the administration of increasing amounts of food extract under a patient’s tongue. This approach has been shown to be safe, but it appears to induce only a modest degree of desensitization.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Epicutaneous Desensitization: Involves the use of a patch that causes allergens to be absorbed by the skin. Clinical trials are ongoing to explore the potential viability of this approach and there is currently one product for the potential treatment of peanut allergy with a biologics license application, or BLA, under review by the FDA.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Oral Immunotherapy (OIT): Involves the oral consumption of increasing doses of a food-based product on a daily basis over a period of months. This approach has the potential to produce a high degree of desensitization, but adoption has been hampered by lack of standardization for products and protocols.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe the most effective form of desensitization therapy for food allergy is OIT. PALFORZIA, using OIT, is the first and only FDA-approved therapy for the mitigation of food allergy reactions.
 Immunology of Oral Desensitization
 Oral desensitization works by gradually shifting the balance of the immune system to dampen the allergic response in the case of accidental exposure.
 The initial step in an immune response is the presentation of an allergenic protein by an antigen presenting cell, such as a dendritic cell, and subsequent recognition of the allergenic protein by T-cells. A subset of T-cells, known as Th2 cells, upon binding to an antigen secrete a set of pro-inflammatory proteins called cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13, which are important in cellular activation and signaling. Secretion of this group of cytokines promotes B-cell maturation and production of IgE antibodies. These IgE antibodies cross-link at the surface of the mast cells by binding with the antigen, which results in the mast cells releasing histamines, proteases and other chemical mediators of inflammation, all of which elicit symptoms of an allergic reaction.
 In oral desensitization, the step-wise increasing of doses of an allergen, starting with very low levels of such allergen that are generally insufficient to trigger a large IgE-mediated allergic reaction, has been shown over time to induce regulatory T-cells. These regulatory T-cells dampen the Th2 immune response. At the same time, the increasing levels of allergen exposure induce B-cells to produce IgG4 antibodies, which compete with IgE antibodies to bind with the allergen, thereby decreasing allergen-induced mast cell degranulation. Ultimately, these immunomodulatory T-cell and B-cell responses result in a decreased clinical response to allergen exposure. To realize the full potential of OIT, patients may need to stay on therapy for several years.
 Our Solution
 Our CODIT approach for the treatment of food allergies leverages and improves upon the extensive independent scientific research supporting OIT. Based on our clinical development to date, including our Phase 3 PALISADE, RAMSES and ARTEMIS trials of PALFORZIA, we believe that our CODIT approach has the potential to be widely adopted by allergists and to appeal to patients and parents as a result of the following key anticipated attributes:

• | Standardized Products: Our proprietary biologic product candidates are derived from natural food products and are designed to contain precisely defined dosages of well-characterized food proteins so that each dosage is consistent for total protein and relative allergen content. In addition, we expect each of our product candidates, if approved, to be provided to patients as a convenient, orally administered, once daily therapy.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Well-Defined Treatment Regimens to Support Safety and Efficacy: We expect each CODIT product candidate to feature clearly defined clinical protocols with gradual dose escalation and practical fixed therapeutic dosing regimens designed to enhance safety, tolerability and efficacy. We intend to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of each CODIT product candidate in large scale, well-controlled clinical trials.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Clinically Meaningful Desensitization: We expect each approved CODIT product candidate to provide patients with protection from food allergens at a level that exceeds the amount typically encountered in an accidental exposure, to impart real world safety.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Compatibility with Clinical Practice: We expect our protocols for each CODIT product candidate to be similar to treatment regimens currently utilized by allergists for non-food allergies.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Tailored Support Services: We intend to provide physician education, patient guidance and other support services to facilitate the administration of each approved CODIT product candidate.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that PALFORZIA and our other CODIT product candidates, if approved, have the potential to reduce the dangers posed to food-allergic patients, such as accidental exposures resulting in anaphylactic reactions, emergency room visits or 
 9

hospitalization. We expect that this potential protection from accidental exposures will reduce the stress and anxiety of patients and their families and enable patients to live more normal lives.
 Additional Food Allergy Research and Development
 We intend to leverage the expertise we gained in the clinical development of PALFORZIA to advance additional CODIT candidates for a range of food allergy biotherapeutics to address high unmet need. We expect to leverage our expertise in the formulation and pharmaceutical development of biologic drug products from naturally available food protein to accomplish this goal. As with PALFORZIA, we expect this process to require the identification of key protein antigens and allergenic protein epitopes, the development of analytic methods, the creation of usable and stable formulations and the ability to manufacture supplies within strict pharmaceutical processes.
AR201 for Egg Allergy
 Our egg CODIT product candidate, AR201, is designed for the treatment of egg allergy in pediatric and young adult patients. Egg allergy is one of the most common food allergies in infants and young children. Published studies indicate that egg allergy is prevalent in approximately 1% of young children but resolves by age 16 in nearly 70% of patients and is therefore significantly less prevalent in the adult population. Based on our epidemiological analysis, we estimate the prevalence for egg allergy in two key markets, the United States and the EU, to be approximately 1.5 million patients in the aggregate. Worldwide, we estimate that there are more than 6 million people with egg allergy, with a significant patient base in China and Japan, where egg is the most common food allergy. Allergists have observed that patients who have egg allergy that persist beyond childhood tend to be higher risk patients with more severe reactions, a population that is especially vulnerable to severe reactions in the case of accidental exposure. The ubiquity of egg in staple foods along with a lack of strict food labeling requirements make adherence to an avoidance diet especially difficult. Despite conscientious label reading, egg allergens can be present due to errors in food packaging and formulation as well as undisclosed ingredient substitutions.  
 These practical challenges along with the lack of proactive treatment represent a significant unmet need.    
 As a result, we believe there would be strong demand for an FDA-approved egg CODIT product candidate. We enrolled the first patient in a Phase 2 clinical trial in subjects with hen egg allergy in August 2019 and expect to complete the trial in the first half of 2021.
 Other Research and Development Programs
 We are exploring additional research and development programs evaluating the potential application of CODIT in other food allergies, including walnuts and other tree nuts and cow’s milk.  
 We believe that approximately 0.4% - 0.6% of the U.S. population is allergic to walnuts. In addition, a high proportion of people who are allergic to walnuts are also allergic to pecans and other tree nuts due to preserved homology in allergenic epitopes. Tree nut allergy was estimated to be prevalent in approximately 2.3 million, or approximately 1%, of people ages 1-55 in the United States in 2017.  Similar to the dynamic of peanut allergy, tree nuts can be difficult to avoid.  Strict avoidance, supported by first line defense medication, such as epinephrine, is the standard of care. We are currently exploring the feasibility of a multi-nut formulation to desensitize against several tree nut allergies and plan to meet with the FDA to discuss this program in the first half of 2020.
 In February 2020, we completed the in-licensing of AIMab7195 (formerly XmAb7195) from Xencor. Initially, we intend to develop AIMab7195 as an adjunctive treatment with our existing CODIT pipeline assets, including PALFORZIA, to explore treatment outcomes, including the potential path to remission, in patients with food allergies. AIMab7195 is designed to mediate the suppression of IgE and IgE-producing cells and originally was developed for the treatment of allergic asthma. AIMab7195 is an anti-IgE monoclonal antibody with enhanced binding to the Fc gamma receptor IIb (FcγRIIb). IgE recognizes and interacts with allergens and, as a result, can activate immune cells, such as mast cells and basophils, that drive an allergic response in patients. AIMab7195 is designed to clear IgE rapidly from circulation, to prevent the production of IgE by preventing the activation of IgE-positive B cells, and to block IgE from interacting with its receptor on immune cells. AIMab7195 has been evaluated in two phase 1 studies that enrolled more than 100 healthy volunteers and patients with allergy and atopic disease. We will be solely responsible for costs related to the development of AIMab7195.

Collaborations
 Regeneron
 In October 2017, we entered into a clinical collaboration with Regeneron and its strategic alliance collaborator, Sanofi, to study PALFORZIA treatment with adjunctive dupilumab in peanut-allergic patients in a Phase 2 clinical trial. Regeneron initiated the Phase 2 clinical trial in October 2018.  The primary objective is to assess whether dupilumab, as adjunct to PALFORZIA, improves desensitization at the completion of up-dosing, defined as an increase in the proportion of participants who pass a DBPCFC at week 28 compared to placebo. The study also includes a proposed exploration of sustained remission after discontinuation of therapy in another DBPCFC. Sustained remission is achieved when, after a break in treatment, peanut-allergic patients are able to tolerate a defined amount of peanut protein with no more than mild allergic symptoms. Regeneron is sponsoring the clinical trial, and we will provide clinical supply of PALFORZIA and food challenge materials. 
 Nestlé Health Science 
 In November 2016, we entered into a two-year strategic collaboration with an affiliate of Nestlé Health Science US Holdings, Inc. for the advancement of food allergy therapeutics and issued and sold to Nestlé Health Science US Holdings, Inc. (together with its affiliate, Nestlé Health Science) 7,552,084 shares of common stock in a private placement at a price of $19.20 per share, which represented approximately 15.1% of our outstanding shares at the time of the transaction, for a total of $145.0 million. Subject to certain limited exceptions, Nestlé Health Science agreed to a two-year market standoff provision under which it agreed not to sell or transfer any of our common stock or other securities. Subject to certain limited exceptions, Nestlé Health Science also agreed to a two-year standstill agreement under which Nestlé Health Science agreed not to acquire us through any means. We agreed to register the resale of the shares that Nestlé Health Science purchased on a registration statement to be filed with the SEC upon the request of Nestlé Health Science, which cannot make the request prior to the 45th day preceding the end of the market standoff provision. The investment and the collaboration did not include any development milestones, product marketing rights or royalties.
 In November 2018, Nestlé Health Science made an additional equity investment of $98.0 million for 3,237,529 newly issued shares of our common stock at $30.27 per share, increasing Nestlé Health Science’s ownership of Aimmune to approximately 19%. We also entered into a two-year extension of the original two-year strategic collaboration agreement, focused on offering innovative food allergy therapies, with Nestlé Health Science. The agreement does not contain any partnership, collaboration, or negotiation restrictions on Aimmune. Aimmune retains all rights to its current and future pipeline assets, and Aimmune and Nestlé Health Science will collaborate towards successful development of such assets.
 The initial investment launched a two-year strategic collaboration, which was extended for an additional two years in November 2018, between us and Nestlé Health Science, the terms of which enable both parties to discuss our current and future oral immunotherapy development programs through a newly established pipeline forum. Nestlé Health Science will provide ongoing scientific, regulatory, and commercial expertise and advice to us through the pipeline forum. Any information disclosed in the collaboration will remain our confidential information, and any new ideas or inventions that arise that relate to our products will be our solely owned intellectual property. If we elect to seek a partner or collaborator for one of our oral immunotherapy development programs during the two-year term of the collaboration, Nestlé Health Science will have a three-month period to negotiate exclusively with us. During the term of the collaboration, and for so long as Nestlé Health Science holds not less than ten percent of our outstanding common stock, Nestlé Health Science will be entitled to designate one nominee to serve as a director on our Board of Directors. In November 2016, Greg Behar joined our Board of Directors on behalf of Nestlé Health Science. The strategic collaboration agreement contains a non-competition covenant pursuant to which Nestlé Health Science has agreed not to engage in certain activities relating to OIT for the treatment of food allergies.
 In February 2020, we announced a $200.0 million equity investment by Nestle Health Science S.A. and the extension of their existing strategic collaboration designed to enable the development and commercialization of innovative food allergy therapies, which will terminate in November 2021
License Agreement with Xencor
 
In February 2020, we entered into a license agreement, or the License Agreement, with Xencor for the exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license for the development, manufacture and commercialization of biopharmaceutical products containing or comprising the humanized monoclonal antibody AIMab7195 (formerly XmAb7195) or certain variants of AIMab7195, each of which is referred to as an AIMab7195 Product. Under the License Agreement, Xencor granted to us an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing sublicensable license under certain patent rights and a non-exclusive, royalty-bearing sublicensable license under certain know-how rights to develop, manufacture, and commercialize AIMab7195 Products for the diagnosis, treatment, or prevention of human diseases and conditions. 
 
11

In connection with the entry into the License Agreement, we will pay Xencor an upfront payment of $5.0 million, and we issued to Xencor 156,238 shares of Common Stock, pursuant to a Securities Issuance Agreement with Xencor, dated February 4, 2020. 
 
Additionally, we are obligated to pay Xencor an aggregate of up to $380.0 million in milestone payments, which includes $17.0 million in development milestones, $53.0 million in regulatory milestones and $310.0 million in sales milestones, and to issue an additional number of shares of our Common Stock having an aggregate value of $5.0 million in connection with the achievement of the first development milestone with respect to an AIMab7195 Product. We will also pay a royalty to Xencor equal to a percentage of net sales of AIMab7195 Products in the high single-digit to mid-teen range.
 
The term of the License Agreement continues on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis until the expiration of our obligation to pay royalties with respect such product and country. We may terminate the License Agreement in its entirety without cause on sixty days’ prior written notice.  Xencor may terminate the License Agreement in its entirety if the we or our affiliates or sublicensees challenge the licensed patents.  Either party may terminate the License Agreement for the other party’s material breach that is not cured within a specified time period or for the other party’s bankruptcy or insolvency-related events. We will be solely responsible for costs related to the development of AIMab7195.
 
In connection with our entry into the License Agreement, we also agreed to assume Xencor’s rights and obligations under its license of the AIMab7195 cell line from Catalent Pharma Solutions LLC, which manufactures AIMab7195 using their proprietary GPEx® technology.
 Research and Development Expenses
 A significant portion of our operating expenses relates to the development and manufacturing of PALFORZIA. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, our research and development costs were $124.0 million, $133.4 million, and $89.3 million, respectively, and are included in the research and development expense line item in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. For further detail about the research and development activities, refer to the research and development section in the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Sales and Marketing
 We intend to commercialize PALFORZIA in the United States and, subject to regulatory approval, commercialize PALFORZIA in Europe, by developing a specialty sales force targeting a subset of the approximately 5,000 practicing allergists in the United States as well as allergy-focused clinicians in major European markets. We anticipate that this sales force could also support the commercialization of additional CODIT product candidates, if approved. We intend to focus our sales efforts on patients with more moderate to severe food allergies, particularly children and adolescents. We do not anticipate that a DBPCFC will be a requirement for prescribing PALFORZIA as DBPCFCs are not widely used as a diagnostic tool in current clinical practice. Our CODIT therapeutic approach for food allergies may encompass providing a range of services, including telephone and e-mail support for patients, physician awareness and education activities, reimbursement assistance, benefit navigation and co-pay and patient assistance programs. Based on the estimated direct medical expenses associated with peanut allergy and the estimated number of people with peanut allergy in the United States, we believe the potential market opportunity for approved peanut allergy treatments in the United States could exceed one billion dollars annually.
Manufacturing
 We contract with and rely on third-party manufacturers to produce the food product and final biologic product for PALFORZIA and our product candidates and to package PALFORZIA and our product candidates. We have completed construction of a manufacturing facility for PALFORZIA in a leased building in Clearwater, Florida, at the site of one of our current contract manufacturers and installed equipment and qualified the operating systems in this new facility. This manufacturing facility became operational in November 2018. We plan to continue to rely on the contract manufacturer that is located at the same site to manage the operations of this new manufacturing facility. We plan to rely on this contract manufacturer and other contract manufacturers to produce supply for our clinical trials, for commercial supply of PALFORZIA and other product candidates.
 Our commercial product and product candidates are manufactured in accordance with stringent manufacturing processes. Our processes are designed to ensure that that the total protein content of each formulation and the relative concentrations of particular proteins are consistent. Through our contract manufacturers, we are capable of producing dosages for certain product candidates with protein content as small as 0.2 mg and have developed advanced analytical methods to help ensure each dose contains precisely defined amounts of multiple well-characterized allergenic proteins. Our formulations are also designed to help ensure that the drug product is acceptably stable and can be easily mixed with food.
 12

PALFORZIA is currently produced for us by a contract manufacturer using our proprietary process. This process involves several blending and characterization steps intended to help ensure that each dose contains a precise amount of peanut flour containing a specific concentration of peanut protein. Because peanut flour is a sensitizing agent, PALFORZIA must be produced on a manufacturing line that is physically separated from other manufacturing lines and that has its own ventilation system.  
 We also rely on separate contract manufacturers to provide packaging services for PALFORZIA. We plan on using blister packs and sachets as the final packaging configuration for our commercial launch of PALFORZIA. Stability testing of PALFORZIA in the blister pack and sachet configurations is ongoing. Any complications with the stability testing in the blister pack or sachet configuration could delay the timing of our regulatory filings for PALFORZIA and could result in a limited shelf life of the commercial product at the time of launch. In addition, foreign regulatory authorities may not find our proposed packing configuration acceptable, which would also delay the timing of our foreign regulatory filings or potential approval of PALFORZIA outside the United States.
 Supplying appropriate clinical trial materials for the commercial launch of PALFORZIA, as well as for our ongoing and planned clinical trials, on a timely basis is a complex operation. There are multiple doses in the dose escalation for PALFORZIA and for our AR201 clinical trial. In addition, each subject can proceed through the dose escalation phase at a different rate depending on how the subject responds to each new dose. For example, a subject can move up to the next dose, remain on the current dose or move down to the prior lower dose during the dose escalation phase of PALFORZIA and for our trials. We believe that this dosing flexibility improves outcomes for subjects. But this dosing flexibility also increases the complexity of supplying the appropriate doses to pharmacies and each clinical site on a timely basis. The complexity of our logistics operations for our clinical trial materials increased significantly throughout 2017 and 2018, and we expect such complexity to increase further in connection with the commercialization of PALFORZIA and as we continue to operate multiple large trials concurrently, including trials in Europe. EU regulations require that each lot of clinical trial material be certified and released by a designated qualified person. This certification and release process in the EU can cause delays in supplying clinical trial materials to clinical sites. Any delays or errors in our PALFORZIA supply chain logistics could delay or adversely affect our ability to commercialize PALFORZIA and our ongoing and planned clinical trials.
 Contract manufacturers often encounter difficulties involving production yields, quality control and quality assurance, as well as shortages of qualified personnel. Qualifying manufacturers and providers of packaging services is a lengthy process. If at any time, one or more of our qualified contract organizations were not able to manufacture or package our commercial product or drug product candidate or provide other requisite services, our business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
 Our third-party suppliers (other than Golden Peanut Company, or GPC), their facilities and all lots of commercial product and product candidates used in our clinical trials are required to be in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to organization and personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports, and returned or salvaged products. The manufacturing facilities for our products must be in compliance with these regulations to the FDA’s satisfaction before any product is approved and we can manufacture commercial products. Our third-party manufacturers are also subject to periodic inspections of facilities by the FDA and other authorities, which may include the evaluation of procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of our products to assess compliance with applicable regulations. Further, producing commercial quantities of PALFORZIA has required us to scale up our existing manufacturing process and design and institute rigorous quality control and assurance procedures in our new manufacturing facility. These procedures include qualification of the manufacturing equipment and building utility systems and validation of the manufacturing process at commercial scale. Designing and implementing these procedures are time-consuming and complex operations. Any aspects of this new manufacturing facility that do not meet the cGMP requirements to the FDA’s satisfaction or the periodic inspections of facilities by the FDA and other authorities could interfere with the commercialization of PALFORZIA.
 Suppliers
 Our lead product candidate, PALFORZIA, contains peanut flour and pharmaceutical-grade ingredients. We source the peanut flour from GPC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Archer Daniels Midland. We chose to use peanut flour from GPC as the basis for PALFORZIA because its peanut flour has been used in most of the leading academic studies of peanut allergy OIT and because we believe that the widespread use of GPC peanut products in the United States may make their peanut flour representative of the type of peanut protein that patients are most likely to encounter in an accidental exposure. The other ingredients in PALFORZIA, such as diluents, glidants and lubricants, are sourced from established producers of pharmaceutical grade ingredients. In order to develop PALFORZIA as an FDA-approved biological product, we took the further step of characterizing the protein signature of GPC flour. Independent scientific research has identified numerous peanut proteins that are the allergens that cause allergic reactions to peanuts. Three of these proteins appear to be the most significant and representative of the levels of the other proteins. Our characterization of PALFORZIA is based on measuring total protein amount and the relative concentrations of those three key proteins as well as their potencies in an antibody binding assay.
 13

We purchase standard food-grade peanut flour from GPC pursuant to a long-term exclusive commercial supply agreement, which was expanded and extended in January 2018. Under the terms of the restated agreement, we are obligated to purchase peanut flour exclusively from GPC, provided that GPC is able to supply the peanut flour in a timely manner with the quantity of peanut flour that we require. GPC is not allowed to sell several peanut flour products to any third party worldwide for use in OIT for the treatment or cure of peanut allergy, provided that we are in compliance with our exclusive purchase obligation and meet specified annual purchase commitments. The restated agreement remains in effect until ten years after the first delivery to us of peanut flour for commercial use and includes an option for us to extend the term for an additional five years. The restated agreement requires GPC to notify its wholesalers and distributors that the peanut flour products subject to the restated agreement cannot be used in OIT for the treatment or cure of peanut allergy. We also have a right of first refusal to obtain rights to new or existing GPC peanut flour products that are not already covered by the restated agreement if a third party intends to use the new or existing GPC product in OIT for the treatment of or cure of peanut allergy. We may terminate the restated agreement at any time for any reason upon providing 60 days’ written notice to GPC. Either party may terminate the restated agreement if the other party fails to cure their material breach within 30 days of receiving notice of such breach from the non-breaching party or if the other party fails to perform their obligations under the agreement for a continuous period of 120 days due to a force majeure event or an insolvency or bankruptcy-related events.
 In connection with the amendment and restatement of the agreement, we issued Archer Daniels Midland Company 300,000 shares of our common stock, vesting over a 3.5-year period. Subject to certain exceptions, in the event that the price per share of our common stock were to fall below a specified level, the restated agreement provides that GPC would only be prohibited from selling one peanut flour product to any third party in the United States, Mexico, Canada, the EU or Japan for use in OIT for the treatment or cure of peanut allergy.
 In May 2019, we entered into a Commercial Supply Agreement, or the Commercial Supply Agreement, pursuant to which CoreRx, Inc. agreed to manufacture commercial supply of PALFORZIA, if approved. Under the Commercial Supply Agreement, we are required to purchase a minimum percentage of our PALFORZIA commercial supply requirements in each of the first six years of the Commercial Supply Agreement, subject to certain conditions and restrictions, ranging from 100% in 2019 and decreasing to a majority in 2024. We are also required to purchase a minimum percentage of our PALFORZIA supply requirements for release testing in each of the first six year of the Commercial Supply Agreement, ranging from 100% in 2019 and decreasing to a significant majority in 2024. The initial term of the Commercial Supply Agreement began upon execution of the Commercial Supply Agreement and will continue until December 31, 2024. The Commercial Supply Agreement then automatically renews for successive two-year terms, unless earlier terminated pursuant to its terms, or upon either party’s notice of termination to the other.
 In November 2019, we entered into a commercial packaging agreement, or the Commercial Packaging Agreement, with AndersonCrecon Inc. doing business as PCI of Illinois, or PCI, pursuant to which PCI package bulk product in accordance with our specifications, applicable laws and the terms and conditions of the Commercial Packaging Agreement. The initial term of the Commercial Packaging Agreement is for four contract years following the effective date. Contract Year one means the period beginning on the effective date of the Commercial Packaging Agreement and ending on December 31, 2019. Each contract year thereafter is the 12-month period from January 1 to December 31. The Commercial Packaging Agreement will automatically be renewed for one-year terms after the end of the Initial Term unless and until one party gives the other party at least three (3) years prior written notice of its desire to terminate as of the end of the then-current term, or is otherwise terminated in accordance with the other terms of the Commercial Packaging Agreement.  
  From time to time, we have and may, in the ordinary course of business, continue to enter into commercial supply agreements with third-parties for the supply of ingredients and proteins necessary for our other product candidates in the ordinary course of business.  For example, in December 2018, we entered into an exclusive supply agreement for egg protein with Michael Foods, Inc. Pursuant to the agreement, we have exclusive access to the clinical and commercial use of Michael Foods’ egg products for any egg allergy treatment, prevention or cure for a period of up to 15 years beyond the potential approval of AR201.
 Intellectual Property
 We have filed patent applications in the United States and foreign countries as well as international patent applications pursuant to the Patent Cooperation Treaty relating to PALFORZIA and certain of our other product candidates. Five patents, covering the formulation, methods of treatment, and certain of our manufacturing methods for PALFORZIA, have been issued in the United States, and four patents have issued in foreign countries covering certain of our manufacturing methods for PALFORZIA. There is no assurance that any additional patents will be issued from any of our pending patent applications. Even if patents do issue, there can be no assurance that the scope of the claims contained in the patents will be broad enough to provide protection from potentially competing products. Our patents and patent applications relating to PALFORZIA have expiration dates ranging from 2034 to 2040 without taking into account any potential patent term extensions. Our patents and patent applications seek protection relating to our formulations, methods of manufacture and improved methods for treating food allergies. We do not own or license, and do not anticipate that we will be able to obtain, a composition of matter patent over the active pharmaceutical ingredient in PALFORZIA or for any other product candidates that are based on widely or readily available food products. We have also licensed intellectual property from Xencor relating to AIMab7195. The licensed intellectual property incudes issued U.S. and foreign patents covering AIMab7195.
 14


In addition to patents, we rely upon trade secrets, know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our partners, collaborators, contract manufacturers, suppliers, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have confidentiality agreements or invention assignment agreements with our partners and consultants. Despite these measures, any of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated, or such intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages. 
 Competition
 Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. While we believe that our development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we may face competition from large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, smaller pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions and others.
 Many of our potential competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources than we have. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop or market products or other novel technologies that are more effective, safer or less costly than any that will be commercialized by us, or if they obtain regulatory approval for their product candidates more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours. Our success will be based in part on our ability to identify, develop and manage a portfolio of drugs that are safer, more efficacious and/or more cost-effective than alternative therapies.
 Currently, other than PALFORZIA, there are no FDA-approved medical therapies for the treatment of food allergies. In October 2017, DBV Technologies S.A. announced results from its completed Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating Viaskin Peanut, a patch technology that epicutaneously delivers food allergens to the patient with the goal of desensitizing the patient to the allergens, in peanut-allergic patients (4 to 11 years of age). DBV submitted, and then subsequently withdrew, a BLA for this product. However, DBV resubmitted the BLA in August 2019, and it was accepted for review by the FDA in October 2019. PALFORZIA and/or any additional product candidate of ours may face competition from DBV’s product candidates, if approved.
We may also face competition from allergists who decide to provide OIT and other desensitization therapies to their patients using their own formulations of food allergens and treatment protocols rather than adopting our product candidates or we may face competition from companies that develop their own OIT products, other desensitization therapy products or products intended to prevent the onset of food allergies in infants or young children. In addition, peanut allergic patients may attempt to use food products as a substitute for PALFORZIA in the fixed dosing portion of our PALFORZIA treatment program.
 In the future, we may face competition from competitors seeking to use PALFORZIA as a reference product while developing a biosimilar product candidate using the FDA’s abbreviated approval pathway for biosimilar products. The abbreviated regulatory pathway created pursuant to the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics. To be considered a biosimilar, a product candidate must be highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components. In addition, there can be no clinically meaningful differences between the product candidate and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product. We believe that the relative concentrations of relevant proteins in the peanut flour we source pursuant to our exclusive contract with the GPC are significantly different from the concentrations of proteins found in other commercially available sources of peanut flour, and that a product candidate using different concentrations of such proteins or different proteins might not be considered “highly similar” to PALFORZIA by the FDA. Such a product candidate would not be eligible for the biosimilar approval pathway. However, there can be no guarantee that the FDA would agree with this interpretation.
 Under the BPCIA, a reference product may be eligible for a 12-year period of exclusivity starting from the date that the product is first licensed by the FDA pursuant to the approval of a BLA, during which time no approval of a biosimilar product under the abbreviated approval pathway may be made effective. With the FDA’s approval of PALFORZIA’s BLA, PALFORZIA qualifies for this 12-year period of market exclusivity, known as reference product exclusivity, such that no approval of a biosimilar version of our product could become effective prior to the expiration of that 12-year period. However, these exclusivity provisions have been subject to various interpretations that have not yet been fully addressed by the FDA, and there is a risk that this exclusivity could be shortened due to congressional action or otherwise, or that the FDA will not consider PALFORZIA to be eligible for reference product exclusivity, potentially creating the opportunity for competition sooner than anticipated. In addition, even if PALFORZIA were to receive reference product exclusivity, a competitor may seek approval of a product candidate under a full BLA rather than a biosimilar product application. In such a case, although the competitor would not enjoy the benefits of the abbreviated pathway for biosimilar approval created under the BPCIA, the FDA would not be precluded from making effective an approval of the competitor product pursuant to a BLA prior to the expiration of our 12-year period of marketing exclusivity.

Coverage and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of PALFORZIA and any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. Our ability to commercialize any products successfully in the United States will depend in part on the extent to which adequate coverage and reimbursement for these products becomes available from third-party payors, including government health administration authorities, such as those that administer the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and private health insurers. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the drug products for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the studies required to obtain regulatory approvals. In the United States, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for our products, if approved, will be made on a payor by payor basis. Each payor determines whether or not it will provide coverage for a drug, what amount it will pay for the drug, and on what tier of its formulary the drug will be placed. The drug’s formulary placement generally determines the out-of-pocket costs to a patient in order to obtain the drug and can strongly influence the adoption of a drug by patients and physicians. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided, and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products and related services.
 The cost of pharmaceuticals continues to generate substantial governmental, third-party payor and media interest. We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will experience pricing pressures due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations and possible legislative proposals. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. Adoption of such controls and measures and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as the drug candidates that we are developing and could adversely affect our net revenue and results.
 Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in each country. In the European Community, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available treatment approaches. Other member states allow companies to set their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products.
 Currently, there is no dedicated reimbursement code for the administration of oral immunotherapy today as allergists can use several different reimbursement coding options to seek reimbursement for their time in administrating the service.  However, with such codes, there is no guarantee that a third-party payor will provide reimbursement for such codes as that decision is solely at the payor’s discretion and must be negotiated on a case-by-case basis between providers and payors.  Most recently as of November 2019, both the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology and the American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology have issued a joint guidance on how to code for services related to PALFORZIA, specifically around the dose escalation and up-dosing phases of treatment.  However, it was also acknowledged that allergy practices should follow health plan and payer policies as they may differ from what was recommended.  In markets outside of the United States, we will need to evaluate clinician compensation mechanisms in each market to determine whether there is appropriate payment of physicians for administration of the treatment regimens.
 .
 Healthcare Reform
 In the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations as we begin to directly commercialize our products.
 16

In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the U.S. federal and state level that seek to reduce healthcare costs. Initiatives to reduce the federal deficit and to reform healthcare delivery are increasing cost-containment efforts. We anticipate that Congress, state legislatures and the private sector will continue to review and assess alternative benefits, controls on healthcare spending through limitations on the growth of private health insurance premiums and Medicare and Medicaid spending, the creation of large insurance purchasing groups, price controls on pharmaceuticals and other fundamental changes to the healthcare delivery system. Any proposed or actual changes could limit or eliminate our spending on development projects and affect our ultimate profitability.
 In March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, established: an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents; revised the methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers for covered outpatient drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated; increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate program to utilization of certain injectable outpatient drugs, as well as prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations.
 We expect that the current Presidential Administration and U.S. Congress will likely continue to seek to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the Affordable Care Act. Since its enactment, there have also been other judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. As a result, there have been delays in the implementation of, and action taken to repeal or replace, certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. Recently, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) was enacted, which, among other things, removes penalties for not complying with the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate to carry health insurance. Further, on December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the Affordable Care Act, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are invalid as well. While the Trump Administration and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services have both stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, if any, will impact the law. Any changes will likely take time to unfold and it is uncertain if any such changes may impact our business.
 In addition, recently, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for medical products. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. 
 In addition, third-party payors may revise the payment methodologies used to determine reimbursement amounts. This includes annual updates to payments to physicians for the procedures performed using our products, which could directly impact the demand for any of our product candidates that may be approved. 
 In the future, there may continue to be additional proposals relating to the reform of the United States healthcare system, some of which could further limit the prices we are able to charge for our products candidates or increase the co-pay obligations of patients. 
 Government Regulation
 Government Regulation in the United States
 Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, promotion, advertising, storage, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and export and import of biologics such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various pre-clinical, clinical and commercial requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
Overview of Biologics Regulation in the United States
 In the United States, our product candidates are regulated by the FDA as biologics under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and regulations implemented by the FDA. Section 351(i)(1) of the PHSA defines a biological product (biologic) as a virus, therapeutic serum, toxin, antitoxin, vaccine, blood, blood component or derivative, 
 17

allergenic product, protein (except any chemically synthesized polypeptide), or analogous product applicable to the prevention, treatment, or cure of a disease or condition of human beings. The process required by the FDA before biologic product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
  
• | completion of pre-clinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, regulations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is initiated;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended purpose;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation, and submission to the FDA, of a BLA after completion of clinical trials;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s continued safety, purity and potency; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the BLA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the product in the United States.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Pre-clinical Studies and IND Application
 Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical trials. The IND also generally includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. We filed an IND for AR201 in December 2018 for use in oral desensitization therapy for egg allergy in children and adults. We filed an IND for PALFORZIA in April 2013 for use in oral desensitization therapy for peanut allergy in children and adults. Because there are no robust animal models of egg or peanut allergy, we did not conduct any pre-clinical efficacy studies of AR201 or PALFORZIA. In addition, because AR201 and PALFORZIA are based on food products, the FDA did not require us to submit any pre-clinical toxicology data before authorizing us to proceed with clinical trials under our IND for AR201. 
 Clinical Trials
 An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to the proposed clinical trials. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trials can begin. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each clinical protocol and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and an IRB at each site where the study is to be conducted must also approve the study. The IRB must monitor the study until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries. Clinical trials typically are conducted in three or four sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined.
  
• | Phase 1. The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population to evaluate dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks and preliminarily evaluate efficacy.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 18

 
• | Phase 3. The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical study sites to generate enough data to statistically evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational product, and to provide an adequate basis for product licensure.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 4. In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of a BLA for a product candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials after approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical trials after approval to gain more information about the product. Such post-approval studies are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA, the IRB, or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional in vitro studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the safety, purity and potency of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 Review and Approval of a BLA
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed information regarding the investigational product is submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent pre-clinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of the product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. Under federal law, the submission of most BLAs is subject to an application user fee, and the sponsor of an approved BLA is also subject to annual program user fees. These fees are typically increased annually. A waiver of user fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. Applications for certain products, such as allergenic extracts, are exempt from such user fees and may not be subject to review under the same timelines as applications for user-fee-paying products.  
 Once a BLA has been submitted, the FDA’s goal is generally to review the application within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application receives priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing  However, these review timelines may not apply to BLAs submitted for allergenic extract products.  Moreover, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed, or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency.
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 The FDA is required to refer an application for a novel product to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 trial or trials, and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, pre-clinical trials or manufacturing. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA may also approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk 
 19

minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct one or more post-market studies or clinical trials and may limit further marketing of the product based on results of these post-marketing studies. Such post-market testing may include Phase 4 trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. In addition, once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. New government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may also be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.
 Expedited Review and Approval Programs
 A sponsor may seek approval of its product candidate under programs designed to accelerate the FDA’s review and approval of new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for that disease or condition. For a Fast Track product, the FDA may consider sections of the BLA for review on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted if relevant criteria are met. PALFORZIA was granted Fast Track designation in September 2014.  
 A product candidate may also qualify for priority review, under which the FDA generally sets the target date for FDA action on the BLA that is subject to the prescription drug user fee amendments, or PDUFA, goals at six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing, or for drugs that are not new chemical entities, six months after the FDA receives the application. Priority review is granted when there is evidence that the proposed product would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious condition. If criteria are not met for priority review, the application is subject to the standard FDA PDUFA review period of 10 months after the FDA accepts the application for filing, or for drugs that are not new chemical entities, 10 months after FDA receives the application. Priority review designation does not change the scientific or medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
 Under the accelerated approval program, the FDA may approve a BLA on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Post-marketing studies or completion of ongoing studies after regulatory approvals are generally required to verify the biologic’s clinical benefit in relationship to the surrogate endpoint or ultimate outcome in relationship to the clinical benefit. Biologics granted accelerated approval may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures if the product sponsor fails to conduct the required post-marketing studies, or if such post-marketing studies fail to verify a clinical benefit. 
 The FDA may also designate a product candidate as a Breakthrough Therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Breakthrough Therapy designation includes all of the Fast Track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance. The Breakthrough Therapy designation is a distinct status from both accelerated approval and priority review, which can also be granted to the same biologic if relevant criteria are met. If a product is designated as breakthrough therapy, the FDA will work to expedite the development and review of such product. 
 Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation and priority review do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. 
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Biologics manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products. Manufacturers of biologics and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
 20

The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of biologics. A company may make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturers’ communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.
 Abbreviated Licensure Pathway of Biological Products as Biosimilar or Interchangeable
 The Affordable Care Act, or ACA, signed into law on March 23, 2010, included the BPCIA, which amended the PHSA and established a regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve biosimilars and interchangeable biosimilars. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining its current approach to the review and approval of biosimilars.
 Under the BPCIA, a manufacturer may submit an application for licensure of a biologic product that is “biosimilar to” or “interchangeable with” a previously approved biological product or “reference product.” In order for the FDA to approve a biosimilar product, it must find that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the reference product and proposed biosimilar product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. For the FDA to approve a biosimilar product as interchangeable with a reference product, the agency must find that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product, and (for products administered multiple times) that the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic.
 Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years after the date that the reference product is first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of an application for a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years after the date that the reference product is first licensed by the FDA. These exclusivity provisions have been subject to various interpretations that have not yet been fully addressed by the FDA. In addition, even if a product is considered to be a reference product eligible for exclusivity, another company could market a competing version of that product if the FDA approves a full BLA for such product containing the sponsor’s own pre-clinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
 Other Healthcare Laws in the United States
 In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the United States Department of Justice and individual United States Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. The laws we are subject to include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, physician payment transparency and privacy and security laws and regulations.
 21

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Anti-Kickback Statute is subject to evolving interpretations. In the past, the government has enforced the Anti-Kickback Statute to reach large settlements with healthcare companies based on sham consulting and other financial arrangements with physicians. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws which establish similar prohibitions and, in some cases, may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.
 Additionally, federal, civil and criminal false claims laws, including the False Claims Act prohibits knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the United States government. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies throughout the country, for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales and marketing practices. The government has obtained multi-million and multi-billion dollar settlements under the False Claims Act in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws.
 The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law prohibits, among other things, the offering or transferring of remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services. Noncompliance with such beneficiary inducement provision of the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law can result in civil money penalties for each wrongful act, assessment of three times the amount claimed for each item or service and exclusion from the federal healthcare programs
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, also created federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 There has also been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act, among other things, imposed new reporting requirements on drug manufacturers for payments made by them to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Drug manufacturers are required to submit reports to the government by the 90th day of each calendar year. Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of marketing expenditures and pricing information as well as gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians.
 We may also be subject to data privacy and security laws and regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business, in particular laws and regulations relating to protected health information. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes specified federal law requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH extends some of HIPAA’s privacy and security standards beyond “covered entities” making them also directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA-related violations and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 The U.S. is also increasingly introducing new general data privacy and security legislation, including notably the recent California Consumer Privacy Act, which comes into force in 2020 and regulates the collection of personal information about California residents regardless of the industry in which the business operates.

Federal and state government price reporting laws require manufacturers to calculate and report complex pricing metrics to government programs. Such reported prices may be used in the calculation of reimbursement and/or discounts on marketed products. Participation in these programs and compliance with the applicable requirements subject manufacturers to potentially significant discounts on products, increased infrastructure costs, and potentially limit the ability to offer certain marketplace discounts.
 Government Regulation in Europe and European laws regarding the protection of personal data
 In the European Economic Area, or EEA, (which is composed of the 27 Member States of the EU, plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), and the United Kingdom until the end of the transition period on December 31, 2020 provided for in the Withdrawal Agreement between the EU and the UK), medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA.
 There are two types of MAs:
  
• | The Community MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the EMA, and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, and medicinal products that contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. Under the Centralized Procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP). Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when the authorization of a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. Under the accelerated procedure the standard 210 days review period is reduced to 150 days.

• | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
 In the EEA, new products authorized for marketing, or reference products, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity period prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from relying on the pre-clinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic or biosimilar applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until 10 years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EU. The 10-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those 10 years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
 In the EEA, marketing authorization applications for new medicinal products not authorized have to include the results of studies conducted in the pediatric population, in compliance with a pediatric investigation plan, or PIP, agreed with the EMA's Pediatric Committee, or PDCO. The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the drug for which marketing authorization is being sought. The PDCO can grant a deferral of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults. Further, the obligation to provide pediatric clinical trial data can be waived by the PDCO when these data is not needed or appropriate because the product is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in children, the disease or condition for which the product is intended occurs only in adult populations, or when the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients. Once the marketing authorization is obtained in all Member States of the EU and study results are included in the product information, even when negative, the product is eligible for six months' supplementary protection certificate extension. For orphan-designated medicinal products, the 10-year period of market exclusivity is extended to 12 years.
 The collection and processing of personal data – including health data –EEA (including the EU), is currently governed by the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which became enforceable on May 25, 2018, replacing the Data Protection Directive 
 23

95/46/EC. The GDPR implements more stringent operational requirements for processors and controllers of personal data, including, for example, expanded disclosures about how personal information is collected and used, limitations on retention of information, increased requirements pertaining to health data and pseudonymised (i.e., key-coded) data, mandatory data breach notification requirements, more robust rights for individuals in regard to their personal data and higher standards for controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent for certain data processing activities. The GDPR provides that EU and EEA Member States may make their own further laws and regulations, which may impose further limitations, including in relation to the processing of genetic, biometric or health data, which may result in differences between Member State laws, limit our ability to use and share personal data,  cause our costs to increase, and/or harm our business and/or financial condition. 
 We are also subject to strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EEA, including to the United States. The GDPR only permits exports of personal data outside the EEA where there is a suitable data transfer solution in place to safeguard the personal data (e.g., the EU Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses or, in relation to exports to the US, the EU-US Privacy Shield) or where the country receiving such data is approved by the EU Commission as providing adequate protection for personal data. Where we transfer personal data out of the EEA, we rely on a number of data transfer solutions including in regard to transfers of personal data (HR data and non-HR data) to the US (and Switzerland), we are certified under the EU-US (and Swiss-US) Privacy Shield. If it were to be determined that we were not complying with our obligations under the EU-US (and/or Swiss-US) Privacy Shield framework(s) and we were to lose our applicable Privacy Shield certification from the US Department of Commerce, we will need to find an alternative solution for transferring personal data from EU to the US. 
 On January 31, 2020, or the Exit Date, the UK left the EU and entered a transition period, which is currently scheduled to end on December 31, 2020. Following the withdrawal of the UK from the EU, the relationship between the UK and EU in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear. Personal data exports from the EU and EEA to the UK can continue without change until the end of the transition period. However, after this time, we may be required to find alternate solutions for the compliant transfer of personal data into (and possibly from) the UK.
 Where we are a data controller, we will be accountable for any service providers (including clinical research organizations) we engage to process personal data on our behalf. We attempt to mitigate the associated risks of using service providers by entering into contractual arrangements to ensure that they only process personal data according to our instructions, and that they have sufficient technical and organizational security measures in place. Where we transfer personal data from the EEA to such third parties, we do so in compliance with the relevant data export requirements as described above. There is no assurance that these contractual measures and our own privacy and security-related safeguards will protect us from the risks associated with the service provider’s processing, storage and transmission of such data. Any violation of data or security laws by our processors could have a material adverse effect on our business and result in the fines and penalties outlined above.
 Failure to comply with the GDPR may result in fines of up to €20.0 million or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year (whichever is higher) and other administrative penalties, as well as enforcement notices, assessment notices (for a compulsory audit), orders to cease/ change our processing of our data, regulatory investigations and potential civil claims including class action type litigation where individuals suffer harm, which may be onerous and adversely affect our clinical trials, business, reputation, financial condition, operations and prospects.
 We are also subject to evolving EU data privacy laws on cookies and e-marketing. The EU is in the process of replacing the e-Privacy Directive (2002/58/EC) with a new set of rules taking the form of a regulation, which will be directly effective in the laws of each EU Member State. The draft e-Privacy Regulation imposes strict opt-in marketing rules with limited exceptions for business-to-business communications, alters rules on third-party cookies, web beacons and similar technology and significantly increases fining powers to the same levels as the GDPR (i.e. the greater of €20.0 million or 4% of total global annual revenue). While the text of the e-Privacy Regulation is still under development, a recent European court decision and regulators’ recent guidance are driving increased attention to cookies and tracking technologies. If regulators start to enforce the strict approach in recent guidance, this could lead to substantial costs and require significant systems changes. 
 Other Regulations 
 We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future.
Employees
 As of December 31, 2019, we had 275 full-time employees. Of these employees, 129 are engaged in research and development. Our employees are not represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
