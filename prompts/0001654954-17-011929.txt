 ITEM 1.    DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
  
  BACKGROUND AND CAPITAL STRUCTURE
  
  Visualant, Incorporated (the “Company,” “Visualant, Inc.” or “Visualant”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada in 1998. We have authorized 105,000,000 shares of capital stock, of which 100,000,000 are shares of voting common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and 5,000,000 are shares preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share.
 BUSINESS
  
  We are focused on the development, marketing and sales of a proprietary technology which is capable of uniquely identifying and authenticating almost any substance using light to create, record and detect the unique digital “signature” of the substance. We call this our “ChromaID™” technology.
 Overview
 
 For the past several years we have focused on the development of our proprietary ChromaID™ technology. Using light from low-cost LEDs (light emitting diodes) we map the color of substances, fluids and materials and with our proprietary processes we can authenticate, identify and diagnose based upon the color that is present. The color is both visible to us as humans but also outside of the humanly visible color spectrum in the near infra-red and near ultra-violet and beyond. Our ChromaID scanner sees what we like to call “Nature’s Color Fingerprint.” Everything in nature has a unique color identifier and with ChromaID we can see it, and identify, authenticate and diagnose based upon the color that is present. Our ChromaID scanner is capable of uniquely identifying and authenticating almost any substance or liquid using light to create, record and detect its unique color signature. While we will continue to develop and enhance our ChromaID technology and extend its capacity, we have moved into the commercialization phase of our Company as we begin to both work with partners and internally to create revenue generating products for the marketplace.
 Our ChromaID™ Technology
 
 We have developed a proprietary technology to uniquely identify and authenticate almost any substance. This patented technology utilizes light at the photon (elementary particle of light) level through a series of emitters and detectors to generate a unique signature or “fingerprint” from a scan of almost any solid, liquid or gaseous material. This signature of reflected or transmitted light is digitized, creating a unique ChromaID signature. Each ChromaID signature is comprised of from hundreds to thousands of specific data points.
 
 The ChromaID technology looks beyond visible light frequencies to areas of near infra-red and ultraviolet light and beyond that are outside the humanly visible light spectrum. The data obtained allows us to create a very specific and unique ChromaID signature of the substance for a myriad of authentication, verification and diagnostic applications.

 Traditional light-based identification technology, called spectrophotometry, has relied upon a complex system of prisms, mirrorsand visible light. Spectrophotometers typically have a higher cost and utilize a form factor (shape and size) more suited to a laboratory setting and require trained laboratory personnel to interpret the information. The ChromaID technology uses lower cost LEDs and photodiodes and specific frequencies of light resulting in a more accurate, portable and easy-to-use solution for a wide variety of applications. The ChromaID technology not only has significant cost advantages as compared to spectrophotometry, it is also completely flexible is size, shape and configuration. The ChromaID scan head can range in size from endoscopic to a scale that could be the size of a large ceiling-mounted florescent light fixture.
 
 In normal operation, a ChromaID master or reference scan is generated and stored in a database. We call this the ChromaID Reference Library. The Visualant scan head can then scan similar materials to identify, authenticate or diagnose them by comparing the new ChromaID digital signature scan to that of the original or reference ChromaID signature or scan result. Over time, we believe the ChromaID Reference Libraries can become a significant asset of the Company, providing valuable information in numerous fields of use.
 
 We have pursued an active intellectual property strategy and have been granted eleven patents. We also have 20 patents pending. We possess all right, title and interest to the issued patents. Ten of the pending patents are licensed exclusively to us in perpetuity by our strategic partner, Allied Inventors, a spin off corporation from Intellectual Ventures, the large intellectual property fund.
 
  ChromaID: A Foundational Platform Technology
 
 Our ChromaID technology provides a platform upon which a myriad of applications can be developed. As a platform technology, it is analogous to a smartphone, upon which an enormous number of previously unforeseen applications have been developed. The ChromaID technology is an enabling technology that brings the science of light and photonics to low cost, real world commercialization opportunities across multiple industries. The technology is foundational and as such, the basis upon which the Company believes a significant business can be built.
 
 As with other foundational technologies, a single application may reach across multiple industries. The ChromaID technology can, for example effectively differentiate and identify different brands of clear vodkas that appear identical to the human eye. By extension this same technology can identify pure water from water with contaminants present. It can provide real time detection of liquid medicines such as morphine that have been adulterated or compromised. It can detect if jet fuel has water contamination present. It could determine when it is time to change oil in a deep fat fryer. These are but a few of the potential applications of the ChromaID technology based upon extensions of its ability to identify different clear liquids.
 
 The cornerstone of a company with a foundational platform technology is its intellectual property. We have pursued an active intellectual property strategy and has been granted eleven patents. We currently have 20 patents pending. We possesses all right, title and interest to the issued patents. Ten of the pending patents are licensed exclusively to us in perpetuity by our strategic partner, Allied Inventors.
