 Item 1. Business
Unless the context requires otherwise, the words MannKind, we, Company, us and our refer to MannKind Corporation and its subsidiaries. 
 MannKind Corporation is a biopharmaceutical company focused primarily on the discovery and development of therapeutic products for diseases such as diabetes. Our only approved product, Afrezza, is a rapid-acting inhaled insulin that was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the FDA) on June 27, 2014 to improve glycemic control in adult patients with diabetes. Afrezza became available by prescription in United States retail pharmacies in February 2015. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately 29.1 million people in the United States had diabetes in 2012. Globally, the International Diabetes Federation has estimated that approximately 415.0 million people had diabetes in 2015 and approximately 642.0 million people will have diabetes by 2040. 
 Afrezza is a rapid-acting, inhaled insulin used to control high blood sugar in adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The product consists of a dry powder formulation of human insulin delivered from a small and portable inhaler. Administered at the beginning of a meal, Afrezza dissolves rapidly upon inhalation to the lung and delivers insulin quickly to the bloodstream. Peak insulin levels are achieved within 12 to 15 minutes of administration. 
 On August 11, 2014, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement (the Sanofi License Agreement) with Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH (which subsequently assigned its rights and obligations 
 
1 
 
 under the agreement to Sanofi-Aventis U.S. LLC (Sanofi)), pursuant to which Sanofi was responsible for global commercial, regulatory and development activities for Afrezza. 
 On January 4, 2016, we received written notification from Sanofi of its election to terminate in its entirety the Sanofi License Agreement. The effective date of termination was April 4, 2016, which was when we assumed responsibility for worldwide development and commercialization of Afrezza. Under the terms of a transition agreement, Sanofi continued to fulfill orders for Afrezza in the United States until we began distributing MannKind-branded Afrezza product to major wholesalers in late July 2016. We began recognizing commercial product sales revenue when MannKind-branded Afrezza was dispensed from pharmacies to patients in August 2016. 
 On November 9, 2016, we entered into a settlement agreement with Sanofi (the Settlement Agreement). Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, the promissory note (the Sanofi Loan Facility) between us and Aventisub LLC (Aventisub), a Sanofi affiliate, was terminated, with Aventisub agreeing to forgive the full outstanding loan balance of $72.0 million, which includes $0.5 million in the previously uncharged costs. Sanofi also agreed to purchase $10.2 million of insulin from us in December 2016 under an existing insulin put option as well as make a cash payment of $30.6 million to us in early January 2017 as acceleration and in replacement of all other payments that Sanofi would otherwise have been required to make in the future pursuant to the insulin put option, without us being required to deliver any insulin for such payment. We were also relieved of our obligation to pay Sanofi $0.5 million in previously uncharged costs pursuant to the Sanofi License Agreement. We and Sanofi also agreed to a general release of potential claims against each other. As of the date of this filing, we have received $30.6 million and $10.2 million related to this agreement. 
 During our initial transition of the commercial responsibilities from Sanofi, we utilized a contract sales organization to promote Afrezza while we focused our internal resources on establishing a channel strategy, entering into distribution agreements and developing co-pay assistance programs, a voucher program, data agreements and payor relationships. In early 2017, we recruited our own sales force, which included some of the sales representatives that previously were employed by the contract sales organization. We intend to continue the commercialization of Afrezza in the United States through our internal commercial organization. Our current strategy for the future commercialization of Afrezza outside of the United States, subject to receipt of the necessary foreign regulatory approvals, is to seek and establish regional partnerships in foreign jurisdictions where there are appropriate commercial opportunities. 
 As part of the approval of Afrezza, the FDA required us to conduct certain post-marketing studies, including: 
 

 | An open-label PK and multiple-dose safety and tolerability dose-titration trial of Afrezza in pediatric patients ages 4 to 17 years with type 1 diabetes followed by a prospective, open-label, randomized, controlled trial comparing the efficacy and safety of prandial Afrezza to prandial subcutaneous insulin as part used in combination with subcutaneous basal insulin in pediatric patients 4 to 17 years old with type 1 or type 2 diabetes; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | A five-year, randomized, controlled trial in 8,000-10,000 patients with type 2 diabetes to assess the potential serious risk of pulmonary malignancy with Afrezza use.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The obligation to complete the pediatric study and to conduct the five-year pulmonary safety study reverted to us when the NDA for Afrezza was transferred back to us in connection with the termination of the Sanofi License Agreement. In addition, we plan to conduct other clinical studies of Afrezza, including dose optimization studies in type 1 and type 2 patients and a study of the time that Afrezza patients remain within a desirable glycemic range as determined by continuous glucose monitoring. 
 Manufacturing and Supply 
 We manufacture Afrezza in our Danbury, Connecticut facility, where we formulate the Afrezza inhalation powder, fill it into plastic cartridges and then blister package the cartridges and seal the blister cards inside a foil 
 
2 
 
 overwrap. These overwraps are then packaged into cartons along with inhalers and printed material by a third-party packager. The cartridges and inhalers are manufactured for us by a third-party plastic-molding company; the cartridges are delivered to our Connecticut facility whereas the inhalers are shipped directly to the packaging contractor. 
 The quality management systems of our Connecticut facility were certified to be in conformance with the ISO 13485 and ISO 9001 standards. Our facility has been inspected twice by the FDA, once for a pre-approval inspection in the fall of 2009 and once for a regular inspection in May 2013. The FDA is expected to conduct additional inspections of our facility. 
 We believe that our Connecticut facility has enough capacity to satisfy the current commercial demand for Afrezza. In addition, the facility includes expansion space to accommodate additional filling lines and other equipment, allowing production capacity to be increased based on the demand for Afrezza over the next several years. 
 Currently, the only approved source of insulin for Afrezza is manufactured by Amphastar France Pharmaceuticals S.A.S. (Amphastar). In April 2014, Amphastar acquired a manufacturing facility from N.V. Organon, a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc., where we had previously obtained the insulin that we use to make Afrezza. On July 31, 2014, we entered into a supply agreement with Amphastar (the Insulin Supply Agreement), pursuant to which we agreed to purchase certain annual minimum quantities of insulin for calendar years 2015 through 2019 for an aggregate total purchase price of approximately 120.1 million, of which 93.0 million remained unpurchased as of December 31, 2016. On November 9, 2016, we amended the contract with Amphastar to extend the term over which we are required to purchase insulin, by four additional years, without reducing the total amount of insulin we will purchase. Unless earlier terminated, the term of the Insulin Supply Agreement now expires on December 31, 2023 and can be renewed for additional, successive two year terms upon 12 months written notice given prior to the end of the initial term or any additional two year term. We and Amphastar each have normal and customary termination rights, including termination for material breach that is not cured within a specific time frame or in the event of liquidation, bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party. In addition, we may terminate the Insulin Supply Agreement upon two years prior written notice to Amphastar without cause or upon 30 days prior written notice to Amphastar if a controlling regulatory authority withdraws approval for Afrezza, provided, however, in the event of a termination pursuant to either of the latter two scenarios, the provisions of the Insulin Supply Agreement require us to pay the full amount of all unpaid purchase commitments due over the initial term within 60 calendar days of the effective date of such termination. 
 Currently, we purchase the raw material for our proprietary excipient, FDKP (fumaryl diketopiperazine), which is the primary component of our Technosphere technology platform, from a major chemical manufacturer with facilities in Europe and North America. However, we also have the capability to manufacture FDKP in our Connecticut facility. 
 We have a supply agreement with the contract manufacturer that produces our inhaler and the corresponding cartridges. We expect to be able to qualify an additional vendor of plastic-molding contract manufacturing services, if warranted by demand. 
 We also have an agreement with the contractor that performs the final packaging of Afrezza overwraps, inhalers and printed material into patient kits. We expect to be able to qualify an additional vendor of packaging services, if warranted by demand. 
 Our third-party suppliers are subject to extensive governmental regulation. We rely on our suppliers to comply with relevant regulatory requirements, including compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMPs).

Technosphere Formulation Technology 
 Afrezza utilizes our proprietary Technosphere formulation technology; however, the application of this technology is not limited to insulin delivery. We believe it represents a versatile drug delivery platform that may allow the oral inhalation of a wide range of therapeutics. We have successfully prepared Technosphere formulations of anionic and cationic drugs, hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs, proteins, peptides and small molecules. Technosphere powders are based on our proprietary excipient, FDKP, which is a pH-sensitive organic molecule that self-assembles into small particles under acidic conditions. Certain drugs, such as insulin, can be loaded onto these particles by combining a solution of the drug with a suspension of Technosphere material, which is then dried to powder form. The resulting powder has a consistent and narrow range of particle sizes with good aerodynamic properties that enable efficient delivery deep into the lungs. Technosphere powders dissolve extremely fast after inhalation when the particles contact the moist lung surface with its neutral pH, releasing the drug molecules to diffuse across a thin layer of cells into the arterial circulation, bypassing the liver to provide excellent systemic exposure. 
 We have also created an innovative line of breath-powered, dry powder inhalers. Our inhalers are easy to use, cost-effective and can be produced in both a reusable (chronic treatment) and a single-use (acute treatment) format. Both the reusable and single use inhaler formats use the same internal air-flow design. Being breath-powered, our inhalers require only the patients inhalation effort to deliver the powder. To administer the inhalation powder, a patient loads a cartridge into our inhaler and inhales through the mouthpiece. Upon inhalation, the dry powder is lifted out of the cartridge and broken (or de-agglomerated) into small particles. The inhalers are engineered to produce an aggressive airstream to de-agglomerate the powder while keeping the powder moving slowly. This slow-moving powder effectively navigates the patients airways for delivery into the lung with minimal deposition at the back of the throat. Our inhalers show very little change in performance over a wide range of inhalation efforts and produce high bioavailability. In a handling study, pediatric subjects as young as four years old were readily able to effectively use the inhaler. 
 To aid in the development of our oral inhalation products, we have created a number of innovative development tools and techniques. For example, our BluHale technology is a novel inhalation profiling tool that uses miniature sensors to assess the drug delivery process at the level of an individual inhaler. This tool provides real-time insight into patient usage, device system performance and pharmacokinetic effects. We can combine this tool with other development tools, such as patient inhalation simulators and anatomically correct airway models, in order to integrate inhaler performance with formulation development right from the beginning of the development program. The result is a powder/inhaler combination product customized to the target patient population from the first clinical study. 
 As one example of an additional application of our formulation and delivery technologies, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Receptor Life Sciences (Receptor) in January 2016, pursuant to which we performed initial formulation studies on compounds identified by Receptor that treat conditions such as chronic pain, neurologic diseases and inflammatory disorders. Following the successful completion of these formulation studies, Receptor exercised its option to acquire an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize inhaled formulations of these compounds utilizing our technology. 
 Our Strategy 
 The following are the key elements of our strategy: 
 Commercialization and development of Afrezza. Our primary focus is the commercial success of Afrezza. Over the course of the last year, we have transformed from a manufacturing-based company into an integrated company with new capabilities in marketing, sales, managed care and market access. During the second half of 2016, we undertook a number of initiatives, such as launching a new marketing campaign, expanding the patient assistance program, creating a robust speakers program, introducing new product packages that enhance dosing 
 
4 
 
 flexibility and securing improved insurance coverage, all of which are expected to increase the promotional responsiveness of Afrezza. Our current priority is the commercial opportunity for Afrezza in the United States; however, in the future we also intend to seek regional partnerships for the development and commercialization of Afrezza in foreign jurisdictions where there are appropriate commercial opportunities. 
 Capitalize on our proprietary Technosphere and inhaler technology for the delivery of active pharmaceutical ingredients. We believe that Technosphere formulations of active pharmaceutical ingredients have the potential to demonstrate clinical advantages over existing therapeutic options in a variety of therapeutic areas. In addition to our collaboration with Receptor, we are actively exploring other opportunities to out-license our proprietary Technosphere formulation and device technologies. We are also evaluating several product opportunities that we would consider developing as internally and/or externally funded efforts. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our success will depend in large measure on our ability to continue enforcing our intellectual property rights, effectively maintain our trade secrets and avoid infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Our policy is to file patent applications on what we deem to be important technological developments that might relate to our product candidates or methods of using our product candidates and to seek intellectual property protection in the United States, Europe, Japan and selected other jurisdictions for all significant inventions. We have obtained, are seeking, and will continue to seek patent protection on the compositions of matter, methods and devices flowing from our research and development efforts. 
 Our Technosphere drug delivery platform, including Afrezza, enjoys patent protection relating to the particles, their manufacture, and their use for pulmonary delivery of drugs. We have additional patent coverage relating to dry powder formulations and the treatment of diabetes using Afrezza. We have been granted patent coverage for the commercial version of our inhaler and cartridges. We have additional pending patent applications, and expect to file further applications, relating to the drug delivery platform, methods of manufacture, the Afrezza product and its use, and other Technosphere-based products, inhalers and inhaler cartridges. Overall, Afrezza is protected by over 425 issued patents in the United States and selected jurisdictions around the world and we also have over 250 applications pending that may provide additional protection if and when they are allowed. These include composition and inhaler and cartridge patents providing protection for Afrezza with various expiration dates, the longer-lived of which will not expire until 2032. In addition, we have certain method of treatment claims that have terms extending into 2031. 
 The field of pulmonary drug delivery is crowded and a substantial number of patents have been issued in these fields. In addition, because patent positions can be highly uncertain and frequently involve complex legal and factual questions, the breadth of claims obtained in any application or the enforceability of issued patents cannot be confidently predicted. Further, there can be substantial delays in commercializing pharmaceutical products, which can partially consume the statutory period of exclusivity through patents. 
 In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before a patent is issued, either in the United States or abroad. Statutory differences in patentable subject matter may limit the protection we can obtain on some of our inventions outside of the United States. For example, methods of treating humans are not patentable in many countries outside of the United States. These and other issues may limit the patent protection we are able to secure internationally. Consequently, we do not know whether any of our pending or future patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or, to the extent patents have been issued or will be issued, whether these patents will be subjected to further proceedings limiting their scope, will provide significant proprietary protection or competitive advantage, or will be circumvented or invalidated. Furthermore, patents already issued to us or our pending applications may become subject to disputes that could be resolved against us. In addition, in certain countries, including the United States, applications are generally published 18 months after the applications priority date. In any event, because publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature often trails behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that we were the first 
 
5 
 
 inventor of the subject matter covered by our pending patent applications or that we were the first to file patent applications on such inventions. 
 Although we own a number of domestic and foreign patents and patent applications relating to Afrezza and our oral inhalation technologies, we have identified certain third-party patents having claims that may trigger an allegation of infringement by virtue of the commercial manufacture and sale of Afrezza. We do not believe that Afrezza infringes on any patents owned by third parties. However, if a court were to determine that the manufacture or sale of Afrezza were infringing any of these patent rights, we would have to establish with the court that these patents were invalid in order to avoid legal liability for infringement of these patents. Proving patent invalidity can be difficult because issued patents are presumed valid. Therefore, in the event that we are unable to prevail in an infringement or invalidity action we will either have to acquire the third-party patents outright or seek a royalty-bearing license. Royalty-bearing licenses effectively increase costs and therefore may materially affect product profitability. Furthermore, if the patent holder refuses to either assign or license us the infringed patents, it may be necessary to cease manufacturing the product entirely and/or design around the patents. In either event, our business would be harmed and our profitability could be materially adversely impacted. If third parties file patent applications, or are issued patents claiming technology also claimed by us in pending applications, we may be required to participate in interference proceedings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to determine priority of invention. We may also be required to participate in interference proceedings involving our issued patents. We also rely on trade secrets and know-how, which are not protected by patents, to maintain our competitive position. We require our officers, employees, consultants and advisors to execute proprietary information and invention and assignment agreements upon commencement of their relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of our relationship must be kept confidential, except in specified circumstances. These agreements also provide that all inventions developed by the individual on behalf of us must be assigned to us and that the individual will cooperate with us in connection with securing patent protection on the invention if we wish to pursue such protection. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection for our inventions, trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information. 
 We also execute confidentiality agreements with outside collaborators. However, disputes may arise as to the ownership of proprietary rights to the extent that outside collaborators apply technological information to our projects that are developed independently by them or others, or apply our technology to outside projects, and there can be no assurance that any such disputes would be resolved in our favor. In addition, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our confidential information or our competitors might learn of the information in some other way. If any trade secret, know-how or other technology not protected by a patent were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. 
 Competition 
 The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are highly competitive and characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense research and development efforts. We compete with companies, including major global pharmaceutical companies, and other institutions that have substantially greater financial, research and development, marketing and sales capabilities and have substantially greater experience in undertaking preclinical and clinical testing of products, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing and selling biopharmaceutical products. We face competition based on, among other things, product efficacy and safety, the timing and scope of regulatory approvals, product ease of use and price. 
Diabetes Treatments 
 We believe that Afrezza has important competitive advantages in the delivery of insulin when compared with currently known alternatives. However, new drugs or further developments in alternative drug delivery 
 
6 
 
 methods may provide greater therapeutic benefits, or comparable benefits at lower cost, than Afrezza. There can be no assurance that existing or new competitors will not introduce products or processes competitive with or superior to our product candidates. 
 We have set forth below more detailed information about certain of our competitors. The following is based on information currently available to us. 
 Rapid-acting (Injected) Insulin 
 Currently, there is no approved insulin product that is absorbed into the bloodstream as rapidly as Afrezza, i.e., reaching peak levels within 12 to 15 minutes after administration. There are several formulations of rapid-acting insulin analogs that reach peak insulin levels within 45 to 90 minutes after injection. The principal products in this category are insulin lispro, which is marketed by Eli Lilly & Company, or Lilly; insulin aspart, which is marketed by Novo Nordisk A/S, or Novo Nordisk; and insulin glulisine, which is marketed by Sanofi. 
 In January 2017, Novo Nordisk announced that Fiasp®, a faster formulation of insulin aspart, was approved in Europe and Canada. It is currently undergoing regulatory review in the United States. 
 Inhaled Insulin Delivery Systems 
 In January 2006, Exubera®, developed by Pfizer in collaboration with Nektar Therapeutics, Inc., was approved for the treatment of adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Exubera® was slow to gain market acceptance and, in October 2007, Pfizer announced that it was discontinuing the product. Pfizer subsequently withdrew the NDA for Exubera from the FDA. 
 In January 2008, Novo Nordisk announced that it was halting development of its inhaled insulin product, having reached the conclusion that the product did not have adequate commercial potential. 
 In March 2008, Lilly announced that it was terminating the development of its AIR® inhaled insulin system. Lilly stated that this decision resulted from increasing uncertainties in the regulatory environment and after a thorough evaluation of the evolving commercial and clinical potential of its product compared to existing medical therapies. 
 Dance Biopharm, Inc. has completed Phase 2 clinical studies of an inhaled insulin product that utilizes a liquid formulation of human insulin, dispensed through a handheld electronic aerosol device. 
 Non-insulin Medications 
 Afrezza also competes with currently available non-insulin medication products for type 2 diabetes. These products include the following: 
 

 | GLP-1 agonists, such as exenatide or liraglutide, which mimic a naturally occurring hormone that stimulates the pancreas to secrete insulin when blood glucose levels are high.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase IV, such as sitagliptin or saxagliptin, are a class of drugs that work by blocking the enzyme that normally degrades GLP-1.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Sulfonylureas and meglitinides, which are classes of drugs that act on the pancreatic cells to stimulate the secretion of insulin.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Thiazolidinediones, such as pioglitizone and biguanides, such as metformin, which lower blood glucose by improving the sensitivity of cells to insulin, or diminishing insulin resistance.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, which lower the amount of glucose absorbed from the intestines, thereby reducing the rise in blood glucose that occurs after a meal.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
7 
 

 | SGLT-2 inhibitors, such as dapagliflozin and canagliflozin, are a class of medications that lower blood glucose by increasing glucose excretion in urine.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Government Regulation and Product Approval 
 The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state, local and foreign jurisdictions impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, manufacture and marketing of medical devices and new drug and biologic products. These agencies, through regulations that implement the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended (FDCA), and other regulations, regulate research and development activities and the development, testing, manufacture, labeling, storage, shipping, approval, recordkeeping, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of such products. In addition, if any of our products are marketed abroad, they will also be subject to export requirements and to regulation by foreign governments. The regulatory approval process is generally lengthy, expensive and uncertain. Failure to comply with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements can result in sanctions being imposed on us or the manufacturers of our products, including hold letters on clinical research, civil or criminal fines or other penalties, product recalls, or seizures, or total or partial suspension of production or injunctions, refusals to permit products to be imported into or exported out of the United States, refusals of the FDA to grant approval of drugs or to allow us to enter into government supply contracts, withdrawals of previously approved marketing applications and criminal prosecutions. 
 The steps typically required before an unapproved new drug or biologic product for use in humans may be marketed in the United States include: 
 

 | Preclinical studies that include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product. Certain preclinical tests must be conducted in compliance with good laboratory practice regulations. Violations of these regulations can, in some cases, lead to invalidation of the studies, or requiring such studies to be repeated. In some cases, long-term preclinical studies are conducted while clinical studies are ongoing.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application (IND), which must become effective before human clinical trials may commence. The results of the preclinical studies are submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Unless the FDA objects and places a clinical hold, the IND becomes effective 30 days following receipt by the FDA.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Approval of clinical protocols by independent institutional review boards (IRBs) at each of the participating clinical centers conducting a study. The IRBs consider, among other things, ethical factors, the potential risks to individuals participating in the trials and the potential liability of the institution. The IRB also approves the consent form signed by the trial participants. The IRB of FDA may place a trial on hold at any time if it believes the risks to subjects outweigh the potential benefits.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product. Clinical trials involve the administration of the drug to healthy volunteers or to patients under the supervision of a qualified medical investigator according to an approved protocol. The clinical trials are conducted in accordance with protocols that detail the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used to monitor participant safety and efficacy or other criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol is submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Human clinical trials are typically conducted in the following four sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | In Phase 1, the drug is initially introduced into a small number of individuals and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. Phase 1 clinical trials are often conducted in healthy human volunteers and such cases do not provide evidence of efficacy. In the case of severe or life-threatening diseases, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients rather than healthy volunteers. Because these patients already have the target disease, these studies may provide initial evidence of efficacy that would traditionally be obtained in Phase 2 clinical trials. Consequently, these types of trials are frequently referred to as Phase 1/2 clinical
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
8 
 

trials. The FDA receives reports on the progress of each phase of clinical testing and it may require the modification, suspension or termination of clinical trials if it concludes that an unwarranted risk is presented to patients or healthy volunteers.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 2 involves clinical trials in a limited patient population to further identify any possible adverse effects and safety risks, to determine the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. Phase 3 clinical trials usually include a broader patient population so that safety and efficacy can be substantially established. Phase 3 clinical trials cannot begin until Phase 2 evaluation demonstrates that a dosage range of the product may be effective and has an acceptable safety profile.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 4 clinical trials are performed if the FDA requires, or a company pursues, additional clinical trials after a product is approved. These clinical trials may be made a condition to be satisfied after a drug receives approval. The results of Phase 4 clinical trials can confirm the effectiveness of a product and can provide important safety information to augment the FDAs voluntary adverse event reporting system.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Concurrent with clinical trials and preclinical studies, companies also must develop information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in accordance with the FDAs current good manufacturing practices (cGMPs), requirements for drug products. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product and the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the quality, purity and potency of the final products. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and chemistry stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf-life.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Submission to the FDA of an NDA based on the clinical trials. The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA for approval of the marketing and commercial shipment of the product. Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, NDAs are required to include an assessment, generally based on clinical study data, of the safety and efficacy of drugs for all relevant pediatric populations. The statute provides for waivers or deferrals in certain situations.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In its review of an NDA, the FDA may also convene an advisory committee of external experts to provide input on certain review issues relating to risk, benefit and interpretation of clinical trial data. The FDA may delay approval of an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied and/or the FDA requires additional testing or information. Before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the manufacturing facility complies with cGMPs and will also inspect clinical trial sites for integrity of data supporting safety and efficacy. The FDA will issue either an approval of the NDA or a Complete Response Letter, detailing the deficiencies and information required in order for reconsideration of the NDA. 
 Medical products containing a combination of new drugs, biological products, or medical devices are regulated as combination products in the United States. A combination product generally is defined as a product comprised of components from two or more regulatory categories (e.g., drug/device, device/biologic, drug/biologic). Each component of a combination product is subject to the requirements established by the FDA for that type of component, whether a new drug, biologic, or device. 
 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources. Data that we submit are subject to varying interpretations, and the FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in foreign 
 
9 
 
 jurisdictions may not agree that our product candidates have been shown to be safe and effective. We cannot be certain that any approval of our investigational products will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. For an approved product such as Afrezza, we are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including post marketing study commitments or requirements, risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, submitting other periodic reports, drug sampling and distribution requirements, notifying the FDA and gaining its approval of certain manufacturing or labeling changes, and complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements. Prior to and following approval, if granted, all manufacturing sites are subject to inspection by the FDA and other national regulatory bodies and must comply with cGMP, QSR and other requirements enforced by the FDA and other national regulatory bodies through their facilities inspection program. Foreign manufacturing establishments must comply with similar regulations. In addition, our drug-manufacturing facilities located in Danbury and the facilities of our insulin supplier, the supplier(s) of FDKP and the supplier(s) of our inhaler and cartridges are subject to federal registration and listing requirements and, if applicable, to state licensing requirements. Failure, including those of our suppliers, to obtain and maintain applicable federal registrations or state licenses, or to meet the inspection criteria of the FDA or the other national regulatory bodies, would disrupt our manufacturing processes and would harm our business. In complying with standards set forth in these regulations, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to ensure full compliance. Numerous device regulatory requirements apply to the device part of a drug-device combination. These include: 
 

 | product labeling regulations;
--+------------------------------


 | general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or off-label uses;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | corrections and removals (e.g., recalls);
--+------------------------------------------


 | establishment registration and device listing;
--+-----------------------------------------------


 | general prohibitions against the manufacture and distribution of adulterated and misbranded devices; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the Medical Device Reporting regulation, which requires that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Further, the supplier we contract with to manufacture our inhaler and cartridges is subject to QSRs, which requires manufacturers to follow elaborate design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process of medical devices, among other requirements. 
 Failure to adhere to regulatory requirements at any stage of development, including the preclinical and clinical testing process, the review process, or at any time afterward, including after approval, may result in various adverse consequences. These consequences include action by the FDA or another national regulatory body that has the effect of delaying approval or refusing to approve a product; suspending or withdrawing an approved product from the market; seizing or recalling a product; or imposing criminal penalties against the manufacturer. In addition, later discovery of previously unknown problems may result in restrictions on a product, its manufacturer, or the NDA holder, or market restrictions through labeling changes or product withdrawal. Also, new government requirements may be established or current government requirements may be changed at any time, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. 
 In addition, the FDA imposes a number of complex regulations on entities that advertise and promote drugs, which include, among other requirements, standards for and regulations of direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet. The FDA has very broad enforcement authority under the FDCA, and failure to comply with these 
 
10 
 
 regulations can result in penalties, including the issuance of a warning letter requirements for corrective advertising to healthcare providers, a requirement that future advertising and promotional materials be pre-cleared by the FDA, and state and federal civil and criminal investigations and prosecutions. 
 Products manufactured in the United States and marketed outside the United States are subject to certain FDA regulations, as well as regulation by the country in which the products are to be sold. We also would be subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing clinical trials and drug product sales if products are studied or marketed abroad. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries usually must be obtained prior to the marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and the time required may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. 
 There can be no assurance that the current regulatory framework will not change or that additional regulation will not arise at any stage of our product development or marketing that may affect approval, delay the submission or review of an application or require additional expenditures by us. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain necessary regulatory clearances or approvals on a timely basis, if at all, for any of our product candidates under development, and delays in receipt or failure to receive such clearances or approvals, the loss of previously received clearances or approvals, or failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
 In addition to the foregoing, we are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, controlled drug substances, privacy of individually identifiable healthcare information, safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection and fire hazard control. 
 Healthcare Regulatory and Pharmaceutical Pricing 
 Government coverage and reimbursement policies both directly and indirectly affect our ability to successfully commercialize our approved products, and such coverage and reimbursement policies will be affected by future healthcare reform measures. Third-party payors, like government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations that provide healthcare coverage, generally decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels for covered drugs. In particular, in the United States, private third-party payors often provide reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the government (through the Medicare or Medicaid programs) provides reimbursement for such treatments. In the United States, the European Union and other potentially significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and other third-party payors are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which has resulted in lower average selling prices. Further, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the European Union will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and usage, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. Recently, in the United States there has been heightened governmental scrutiny of the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products. For example, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries regarding certain drug manufacturers pricing practices and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. Pricing pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care organizations, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid, healthcare reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in general. 
 The United States and some foreign jurisdictions have enacted or are considering a number of additional legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the U.S. and elsewhere, there is significant interest 
 
11 
 
 in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives, including, most recently, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, PPACA), enacted in March 2010. The Physician Payments Sunshine Act within PPACA, and its implementing regulations, require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Childrens Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. 
 Further, if a drug product is reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs, we must comply with, among others, the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, as amended, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, as amended, and similar state laws. If a drug product is reimbursed by Medicare or Medicaid, pricing and rebate programs must comply with, as applicable, the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, as amended, and the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. Additionally, PPACA substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among other cost containment measures, PPACA established: an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents; a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program; and a new formula that increased the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. There have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of PPACA. As a result there have been delays in the implementation of, and action taken to repeal or replace, certain aspects of the PPACA. In January 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the PPACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the PPACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. Further, in January 2017, Congress adopted a budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, or the Budget Resolution, that authorizes the implementation of legislation that would repeal portions of the PPACA. Following the passage of the Budget Resolution, in March 2017, the U.S. House of Representatives introduced legislation known as the American Health Care Act, which, if enacted, would amend or repeal significant portions of the PPACA. Among other changes, the American Health Care Act would repeal the annual fee on certain brand prescription drugs and biologics imposed on manufacturers and importers, eliminate the 2.3% excise tax on medical devices, eliminate penalties on individuals and employers that fail to maintain or provide minimum essential coverage, and create refundable tax credits to assist individuals in buying health insurance. The American Health Care Act would also make significant changes to Medicaid by, among other things, making Medicaid expansion optional for states, repealing the requirement that state Medicaid plans provide the same essential health benefits that are required by plans available on the exchanges, modifying federal funding, including implementing a per capita cap on federal payments to states, and changing certain eligibility requirements. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since PPACA. For example, through the process created by the Budget Control Act of 2011, there are automatic reductions of Medicare payments to providers up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, following passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers. In the future, there are likely to be additional proposals relating to the reform of the U.S. health care system, some of which could further limit the prices we are able to charge for our products, or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products. If drug products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. All of these activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.

In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), and their respective implementing regulations, imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAAs privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates  independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 Also, many states have similar healthcare statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, that apply regardless of the payer. Additional state laws require pharmaceutical companies to implement a comprehensive compliance program and/or limit expenditure for, or payments to, individual medical or health professionals. 
 We may incur significant costs to comply with these laws and regulations now or in the future. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, individual imprisonment, disgorgement, exclusion of products from reimbursement under government programs, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Our research and development expenses totaled $14.9 million, $29.7 million and $100.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
 Long-Lived Assets 
 Our long-lived assets are located in the United States and totaled $28.9 million, $48.7 million and $192.1 million as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our long-lived assets as of December 31, 2016 do not include an asset held for sale totaling $16.7 million. 
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2016, we had 153 full-time employees, of which 66 were engaged in manufacturing, 34 in research and development, 30 in general and administrative and 23 in selling and marketing. Fifteen of these employees had a Ph.D. degree and/or M.D. degree and were engaged in activities relating to research and development, manufacturing, quality assurance or business development. 
 None of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe relations with our employees are good. 
 Corporate Information 
 We were incorporated in the State of Delaware on February 14, 1991. Our principal executive offices are located at 25134 Rye Canyon Loop Suite 300, Valencia, California 91355, and our telephone number at that

Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, are available free of charge on our website as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. The contents of these websites are not incorporated into this Annual Report. Further, our references to the URLs for these websites are intended to be inactive textual reference only. 
 On March 1, 2017, we filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a Certificate of Amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the Charter Amendment) to (i) implement a one-for-five reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock (the Reverse Stock Split), without any change in par value per share, and (ii) reduce the authorized number of shares of our common stock from 700,000,000 to 140,000,000 shares, as previously authorized and approved at a special meeting of stockholders on March 1, 2017. The Charter Amendment became effective at 5:01 p.m. Eastern Time on March 2, 2017 (the Effective Time). No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. Instead, we issued one full share of the post-Reverse Stock Split common stock to any stockholder of record who was entitled to receive a fractional share as a result of the process. 
 As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, proportionate adjustments were made to the per share exercise price and the number of shares issuable upon the exercise or vesting of all stock options, restricted stock units and warrants issued by us and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, which resulted in a proportionate decrease in the number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance upon exercise or vesting of such stock options, restricted stock units and warrants, and, in the case of stock options and warrants, a proportionate increase in the exercise price of all such stock options and warrants. In addition, the number of shares authorized for future grant under our equity incentive/compensation plans immediately prior to the Effective Time were reduced proportionately. 
 On March 3, 2017, our common stock began trading on The NASDAQ Global Market on a split-adjusted basis. All references to shares of common stock, all per share data, and all warrant, stock option and restricted stock unit activity for all periods presented in this Annual Report have been adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split on a retroactive basis.
