ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 
OVERVIEW
 
Fresh Harvest Products, Inc. (the “Parent Company”) is a corporation formed in the State of New Jersey. Until October of 2012, we were a developer of proprietary brands and a marketer of organic and natural food products. Our goal was to make our “Wings of Nature™” and “AC LaRocco” brands, national brands of organic and natural foods that would attract consumers because of high quality and affordable pricing. 
 
We believe that the consumers that we targeted during 2011-2012 were actively looking for quality organic food offerings, and the stores in which they shop were responding to their demands by allocating shelf space for this rapidly expanding segment of the food market. In August 2009, we formed Wings of Nature, LLC in the State of New York and it is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent Company. In April 2010, the Parent Company formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, A.C. LaRocco, Inc. (“New A.C. LaRocco”) in the State of Delaware for the purpose of implementing its new pizza business.
 
We sold our products to consumers at, what we believe are, reasonable prices through local, regional and national supermarkets, retailers, distributors, brokers, and wholesalers. Our strategy was to focus on finding and developing and selling the best organic and natural food products in the world. Part of this strategy is to have the “Wings of Nature™” or “AC LaRocco” names branded on our products, as well as acquiring other natural and organic food brands. 
 
During October 2012, the Parent Company began integrating a digital plan and strategy which shifted the Company’s focus to expanding the online network and community, as well as an expansion of online services, with a focus on developing various SaaS models in the health, wellness, fitness, lifestyles of health and sustainability (LOHAS) and healthcare industries.
 
The Company expects to develop, license and acquire software applications that will generate revenue through subscription fees, in-app upgrades, purchases and advertising. The Company is currently working on several software applications including a calorie calculator and food comparison software solution so that consumers can be informed and compare what foods they are eating and be able to accurately calculate their daily calories per item, as well as compare foods with each other to learn and understand what the healthier options are. The Company is actively seeking strategic partners and acquisition targets in order to grow and expand.
 
During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2012, we did not generate any revenues as we were integrating our new business model, and developing software products. 
 
The Company continues to have limited capital resources and has experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations and expects these conditions to continue for the foreseeable future. As of October 31, 2012, the Company had no cash available for operations and had an accumulated deficit of $9,318,185. Management believes that cash on hand as of October 31, 2012 is not sufficient to fund operations through October 31, 2013. The Company will be required to raise additional funds to meet its short and long-term planned goals. There can be no assurance that such funds, if available at all, can be obtained on terms reasonable to the Company.
 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, the Company has limited revenue and without realization of additional capital, it would be highly unlikely for the Company to continue as a going concern.
