 Our products offer high levels of field reliability, which provides end users an advantage in life-cycle cost.  We address competition in aftermarket service through responsiveness to our customers’ needs, providing short turnaround times, greater performance such as longer time between repairs, and maintaining a global presence. 
 Some of our customers are affiliated with our competitors through ownership or joint venture agreements.  We compete in part by establishing relationships with our customers’ engineering organizations, and by offering innovative technical and commercial solutions to meet their market requirements.  During fiscal year 2016 we entered into a strategic joint venture (“JV”) with General Electric Company (“GE”), acting through its GE Aviation business unit.  The JV sells fuel systems for GE’s large engine programs and is described further in Note 4, Joint Venture, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” 
 Industrial operates in the global markets for industrial turbines, industrial reciprocating engines, electric power generation systems, power distribution networks, and wind turbines.  Many of these markets are subject to regulartory product and performance certifications to meet emissions and safety requirements, which form a basis for competition as well as a barrier to entry.  
 We compete with numerous companies that specialize in various engine, turbine, and power management products, and our OEM customers are often capable of developing and manufacturing similiar products internally.  Many of our customers are large global OEMs that require suppliers to support them around the world and to meet increasingly higher requirements in terms of safety, quality, delivery, reliability and cost. 
 Competitors include ABB, Emerson, Heinzmann GmbH & Co., Hoerbiger, Invensys, L’Orange GmbH, Meggitt, Robert Bosch AG, and Schweitzer Electric.  OEM customers with internal capabilities for similar products include Caterpillar, Cummins, General Electric, Siemens and Wartsila.
 We believe we are a market leader in providing our customers advanced technology and superior product performance at a competitive price.  We focus on developing and maintaining close relationships with our OEM customers’ engineering teams.  Competitive success is based on the development of innovative components and systems that are aligned with the OEMs’ technology roadmaps to achieve future reliability, emission, efficiency, and fuel flexibility targets.  
 Government Contracts and Regulation
 Portions of our business, particularly in our Aerospace segment, are heavily regulated.  We contract with numerous U.S. Government agencies and entities, including all of the branches of the U.S. military, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (“NASA”), and the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, and Transportation.  We also contract with similar government authorities outside the United States, subject in all cases to applicable law.
 The U.S. Government, and potentially other governments, may terminate any of our government contracts, or any government contracts under which we are a subcontractor, at their convenience, as well as for default based on specified performance measurements.  If any of our U.S. government contracts were to be terminated for convenience, we generally would be entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs.  If any of our U.S. government contracts were to be terminated for our default, the U.S. Government generally would pay only for the work accepted, and could require us to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to re-procure the contract items, net of the work accepted from the original contract.  The U.S. Government could also hold us liable for damages resulting from the default.
 We must comply with, and are affected by, laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of U.S. Government contracts.  These laws and regulations, among other things:

· | require accurate, complete and current disclosure and certification of cost and pricing data in connection with certain contracts;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | impose specific and unique cost accounting practices that may differ from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”), and therefore require robust systems to reconcile;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | impose regulations that define allowable and unallowable costs and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under certain cost-based U.S. Government contracts;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | impose manufacturing specifications and other quality standards that may be more restrictive than for non-government business activities; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | restrict the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes due to the regulations of the U.S. Government and foreign governments pertaining to the export of certain products and technical data.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Sales made directly to U.S. Government agencies and entities, or indirectly through third party manufacturers utilizing Woodward parts and subassemblies, collectively represented 23% of our sales for fiscal year 2017, 21% of our sales for fiscal year 2016, and 18% of our sales for fiscal year 2015.  The level of U.S. spending for defense, alternative energy and other programs, and the mix of programs to which such funding is allocated, is subject to periodic congressional appropriation actions, and is subject to change, including elimination, at any time.

  Seasonality
 We do not believe our sales, in total or in either business segment, are subject to significant seasonal variation.  However, our sales have generally been lower in the first quarter of our fiscal year as compared to the immediately preceding quarter due to fewer working days resulting from the observance of various holidays and scheduled plant shutdowns for annual maintenance.  Sales Order Backlog
 Our backlog of unshipped sales orders by segment as of October 31, 2017 and 2016 was as follows:
 ﻿

﻿ | | | | | | | 
-----------+------------------+-----------+-----------------------------------------------+----+------------------+---+--------
﻿ | | | | | | | 
﻿ | October 31, 2017 | | % Expected to be filled by September 30, 2018 | | October 31, 2016

Industrial | | 189,283 | | 93 | | | 189,397
﻿ | $ | 1,015,379 | | 80 | % | $ | 875,189

  Our current estimate of the sales order backlog is based on unshipped sales orders that are open in our order entry systems.  Unshipped orders are not necessarily an indicator of future sales levels because of variations in lead times and customer production schedules. 
 Manufacturing
 We operate manufacturing and assembly plants in the United States, Europe and Asia.  Our products consist of mechanical, electronic and electromechanical systems and components. 
 Aluminum, iron and steel are primary raw materials used to produce our mechanical components.  Other commodities, such as gold, copper and nickel, are also used in the manufacture of our products, although in much smaller quantities.  We purchase various goods, including component parts and services used in production, logistics and product development processes from third parties.  Generally there are numerous sources for the raw materials and components used in our products, which we believe are sufficiently available to meet current requirements.
 We maintain global strategic sourcing models to meet our global facilities' production needs while building long-term supplier relationships and efficiently managing our overall supply costs. We expect our suppliers to maintain adequate levels of quality raw materials and component parts, and to deliver such parts on a timely basis to support production of our various products.  We use a variety of agreements with suppliers intended to protect our intellectual property and processes and to monitor and mitigate risks of disruption in our supply base that could cause a business disruption to our production schedules or to our customers.  The risks 

 
7

monitored include supplier financial viability, business continuity, quality, delivery and protection of our intellectual property and processes.
 Our customers expect us to maintain adequate levels of certain finished goods and certain component parts to support our warranty commitments and sales to our aftermarket customers, and to deliver such parts on a timely basis to support our customers’ standard and customary needs.  We carry certain finished goods and component parts in inventory to meet these rapid delivery requirements of our customers. 
 The Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) adopted disclosure rules for companies that use tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold or their derivatives (collectively referred to as “conflict minerals”) in their products, with substantial supply chain verification requirements in the event the conflict minerals come or may come from the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries.  The European Union is considering the imposition of similar reporting obligations.  Our conflict minerals report for calendar year 2016 was filed with the SEC on May 24, 2017.  We may face reputational challenges with our customers, stockholders and other stakeholders if we use and/or are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the conflict minerals used in our products.  Further, due to the complexity of our supply chain, the implementation of the existing U.S. requirements and any additional European requirements could affect the sourcing and availability of metals used in the manufacture of a number of parts contained in our products.  Regardless, we have and will continue to incur costs associated with compliance, including time-consuming and costly efforts to determine the source of conflict minerals that may be used in our products.
 Research and Development
 We finance our research and development activities primarily with our own independent research and development funds.  Our research and development costs include basic research, applied research, component and systems development, and other concept formulation studies.  
 Company funded expenditures related to new product development activities are expensed as incurred and are separately reported in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Earnings.  Across both of our segments, research and development costs totaled $126,519 in fiscal year 2017, $126,170 in fiscal year 2016, and $134,485 in fiscal year 2015.  Research and development costs were 6.0% of consolidated net sales in fiscal year 2017 compared to 6.2% in fiscal year 2016 and 6.6% in fiscal year 2015.  See “Research and development costs” in Note 1, Operations and summary of significant accounting policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” 
 Aerospace is focused on developing systems and components that we believe will be instrumental in helping our customers achieve their objectives of lower fuel consumption, lighter weight, more efficient performance, reduced emissions, and improved operating economics.  Our development efforts support technology for a wide range of:

· | aerospace turbine engine applications, which include commercial, business and military turbofan engines of various thrust classes, turboshaft engines and turboprop engines;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | electromechanical and hydraulic actuation systems for flight deck-to-flight surface control of fixed-wing aircraft and rotorcraft, and turbine engine nacelles, as well as guidance for weapon systems; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | motion control components for integration into comprehensive actuation systems.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The aerospace industry has moved toward more electric (“fly-by-wire”), lighter weight aircraft, while demanding increased reliability and redundancy.  In response, we are developing an expanded family of intelligent flight deck control products (including throttle and rudder controls) with both conventional and fly-by-wire technology, as well as motor driven actuation systems.
 We collaborate closely with our customers as they develop their technology plans, which leads to new product concepts.  We believe this collaboration allows us to develop technology that is aligned with our customers’ needs and therefore, increases the likelihood that our systems and components will be selected for inclusion in the platforms developed by our customers.  Further, we believe our close collaboration with our customers during preliminary design stages allows us to provide products that deliver the component and system performance necessary to bring greater value to our customers.  
 Most technology development programs begin years before an expected entry to service, such as those for the next generation of commercial aircraft.  Other development programs result in nearer-term product launches associated with new OEM offerings, product upgrades, or product replacements on existing programs.  Some of the major projects/programs we are developing are listed below.
 We developed the fuel system, air management system, and actuation hardware for CFM International’s LEAP engine program.  We also developed the actuation system, combustion system and oil system components for Pratt & Whitney’s Geared Turbo Fan (“GTF”) engine program.  These programs target applications in the single aisle and regional aircraft markets with entry into service in the 2016 to 2020 timeframe.  Both the LEAP engine and the GTF engine have been selected by Airbus as options to power its A320neo aircraft, which entered service in 2016.  In addition, the LEAP engine was selected exclusively by Boeing for its 737 MAX, which entered service in 2017, and by Comac for its C919 aircraft.  The GTF engine was selected exclusively by Bombardier for its CSeries aircraft, which also entered service in 2016, by Embraer for its EJets E2 aircraft family, and by Irkut for the MS-21 aircraft.

During fiscal year 2016 we entered into a JV with GE, acting through its GE Aviation business unit.  The JV sells fuel systems for GE’s large engine programs.  The JV is developing the fuel system for the GE9X engine (which will power the Boeing 777X).  We have been selected as the JV’s supplier of this fuel system.
 We are the supplier for the thrust reverser actuation system (“TRAS”) for the Boeing 737 MAX and the CFM LEAP-engined Airbus A320neo.  We are developing the TRAS for the Boeing 777X and the Airbus A330neo, and have been awarded the new nacelle version of the GTF-engined Airbus A320neo.  The A330neo is scheduled to enter service in 2018, and the 777X in 2020.
 We are currently developing the fuel system, air management components, and actuation hardware for the Passport engine program, as well as the TRAS for the integrated propulsion system.  Passport is the next generation GE Aviation engine for the large business aviation market, and has been selected by Bombardier to power its Global 7000 and 8000 long-range business aircraft, expected to enter into service in 2018 and 2019, respectively.
 In addition, we developed sensor solutions for the Airbus A350 high lift system, an actuation sub-system for the Boeing 787-9 that improves fuel burn, flight deck components for the Bombardier CSeries and control and sensing solutions for the Boeing KC-46A refueling tanker boom subsystem.  We are currently developing flight deck components for the Bombardier Global 7000 and 8000 aircraft.
 Industrial is focused on developing improved technologies, including integrated control systems and system components, that will enable our OEM customers to cost-effectively meet mandated emissions regulations and fuel efficiency demands, allow for usage of a wider range of fuel sources, increase reliability (particularly in harsh environments), reduce total cost of ownership, support global infrastructure growth, and safely distribute power on the electrical grid.  
 Our efforts include research and development of technologies and products that improve combustion processes and provide more precise flow of various fuels and gases in our customers’ gas turbines and industrial reciprocating engines.  We also develop electronic devices and software that provide improved control and protection of reciprocating engines, gas turbines, steam turbines, wind turbines, and engine- and turbine-powered equipment.  In addition, we are developing advanced prognostic and predictive intelligence into many of our complex products. Major development projects include enhancement of high pressure common rail diesel fuel injection systems, comprehensive gas engine control systems, fuel flow control valves and actuators, and various other technologies.  Our technologies help our OEM customers’ engines, turbines, power generation, power distribution, compressor and other powered equipment operate more efficiently and more reliably.  
 Employees
 As of October 31, 2017, we employed approximately 6,900 full-time employees of which approximately 1,600 were located outside of the United States, with the majority in Germany, Poland and China.  We believe that our relationships with our employees are good.
 Approximately 17% of our total full-time workforce were union employees as of October 31, 2017, all of whom work for our Aerospace segment and are located in the United States.  The collective bargaining agreements with our union employees are generally renewed through contract renegotiation near the contract expiration dates.  The MPC Employees Representative Union contract, which covers 491 employees as of October 31, 2017, expires October 1, 2021.  The Local Lodge 727-N International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers agreement, which covers 438 employees as of October 31, 2017, expires April 22, 2021.  The International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America and Local No. 509 agreement, which covers 233 employees as of October 31, 2017, expires June 4, 2021.  We believe that our relationships with our union employees and the representative unions are good.
 Almost all of our other employees in the United States were at-will employees as of October 31, 2017, and therefore, not subject to any type of employment contract or agreement.  Our executive officers each have change-in-control agreements which have been filed with the SEC.
 Outside of the United States, we enter into employment contracts and agreements in those countries in which such relationships are mandatory or customary, including coordination through local works’ councils.  The provisions of these agreements correspond in each case with the required or customary terms in the subject jurisdiction.
 Patents, Intellectual Property, and Licensing
 We own numerous patents and other intellectual property, and have licenses for the use of patents and other intellectual property owned by others, which relate to our products and their manufacture.  In addition to owning a large portfolio of intellectual property, we also license intellectual property to and from third parties.  For example, the U.S. Government has certain rights in our patents and other intellectual property developed in performance of certain government contracts, and it may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by such patents for government purposes as allowed by law.  
 Intellectual property not covered by patents (or patent applications) includes trade secrets and other technological know-how that is not patentable or for which we have elected not to seek patent protection, including intellectual property relating to our manufacturing processes and engineering designs.  Such unpatented technology, including research, development and engineering 

 
9

technical skills and know-how, as well as unpatented software, is important to our overall business and to the operations of each of our segments.  
 While our intellectual property assets taken together are important, we do not believe our business or either of our segments would be materially affected by the expiration of any particular intellectual property right or termination of any particular intellectual property patent license agreement. 
 As of September 30, 2017, our Consolidated Balance Sheet includes $171,882 of net intangible assets.  This value represents the carrying values, net of amortization, of certain assets acquired in various business acquisitions and does not purport to represent the fair value of our acquired intellectual property as of September 30, 2017. 
 U.S. GAAP requires that research and development costs be expensed as incurred; therefore, as we develop new intellectual property in the normal course of business, the costs of developing such assets are expensed as incurred, with no corresponding intangible asset recorded. 
 Environmental Matters and Climate Change
 The Company is regulated by federal, state and international environmental laws governing our use, transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions.  Compliance with these existing laws has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or global competitive position.
 We use hazardous materials and/or regulated materials in our manufacturing operations.  We also own, operate, and may acquire facilities that were formerly owned and operated by others that used such materials.  We believe that the risk that a significant release of regulated materials has occurred in the past or will occur in the future cannot be completely eliminated or prevented.  From time to time we engage in environmental remedial acitivites, generally in coordination with other companies, pursuant to federal and state laws.  In addition, we may be exposed to other environmental costs including participation in superfund sites or other similar jurisdictional initiatives.  When it is reasonably probable we will pay remediation costs at a site, and those costs can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for such future costs with a related charge against our earnings.  In formulating that estimate and recognizing those costs, we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies, or others, until such recovery is assured.  Currently, we have no sites undergoing remediation.  
 Our manufacturing facilities generally do not produce significant volumes or quantities of byproducts, including greenhouse gases, that would be considered hazardous waste or otherwise harmful to the environment.  We do not expect legislation currently pending or expected in the next several years to have a significant negative impact on our operations in any of our segments. 
 Domestic and foreign legislative initiatives on emissions control, renewable energy, and climate change tend to favorably impact the sale of our energy control products.  For example, our Industrial segment produces inverters for wind turbines and energy control products that help our customers maximize engine efficiency and minimize wasteful emissions, including greenhouse gases.

 WOODWARD, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 (In thousands, except per share amounts)
 Note 1.  Operations and summary of significant accounting policies
 Basis of presentation
 The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and include the accounts of Woodward, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively “Woodward” or “the Company”).  Dollar amounts contained in these Consolidated Financial Statements are in thousands, except per share amounts.
 Nature of operations
 Woodward enhances the global quality of life, creating innovative energy control solutions that optimize the performance, efficiency and emissions of its customers’ products.  Woodward is an independent designer, manufacturer, and service provider of energy control and optimization solutions.  Woodward designs, produces and services reliable, efficient, low-emission, and high-performance energy control products for diverse applications in challenging environments.  Woodward has significant production and assembly facilities in the United States, Europe and Asia, and promotes its products and services through its worldwide locations.  
 Woodward’s strategic focus is providing energy control and optimization solutions for the aerospace and industrial markets.  The precise and efficient control of energy, including motion, fluid, combustion and electrical energy, is a growing requirement in the markets it serves.  Woodward’s customers look to it to optimize the efficiency, emissions and operation of power equipment in both commercial and defense operations.  Woodward’s core technologies leverage well across its markets and customer applications, enabling it to develop and integrate cost-effective and state-of-the-art fuel, combustion, fluid, actuation and electronic systems.

Woodward also provides aftermarket repair, maintenance, replacement and other service support for its installed products. 
 Woodward’s components and integrated systems optimize performance of commercial aircraft, defense aircraft, military ground vehicles and other equipment, gas and steam turbines, wind turbines, including converters and power grid related equipment, industrial diesel, gas, bio-diesel and dual fuel reciprocating engines, and electrical power systems.  Woodward’s innovative motion, fluid, combustion and electrical energy control systems help its customers offer more cost-effective, cleaner, and more reliable equipment.
 Summary of significant accounting policies
 Principles of consolidation: These Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and include the accounts of Woodward and its wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries.  Transactions within and between these companies are eliminated.
 Use of estimates: The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements and the reported revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period, and certain financial statement disclosures.  Significant estimates include allowances for uncollectible amounts, net realizable value of inventories, customer rebates earned, useful lives of property and identifiable intangible assets, the evaluation of impairments of property, identifiable intangible assets and goodwill, the provision for income tax and related valuation reserves, the valuation of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations, assumptions used in the determination of the funded status and annual expense of pension and postretirement employee benefit plans, the valuation of stock compensation instruments granted to employees, and contingencies. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 Foreign currency exchange rates: The assets and liabilities of substantially all subsidiaries outside the United States are translated at fiscal year-end rates of exchange, and earnings and cash flow statements are translated at weighted-average rates of exchange.  Translation adjustments are accumulated with other comprehensive (losses) earnings as a separate component of stockholders’ equity and are presented net of tax effects in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity.  The effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on loans between consolidated subsidiaries that are considered permanent in nature are also accumulated with other comprehensive earnings, net of tax.
 The Company is exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates because some sales transactions, and certain of the assets and liabilities of its domestic and foreign subsidiaries, are denominated in foreign 

 
56

currencies.  Selling, general, and administrative expenses include a net foreign currency loss of $651 in fiscal year 2017, net foreign currency gain of $701 in fiscal year 2016, and a net foreign currency loss of $1,721 in fiscal year 2015.
 Revenue recognition: Woodward recognizes revenue upon shipment or delivery of products or services and when collectability is reasonably assured.  Delivery is upon completion of manufacturing, customer acceptance, and the transfer of the risks and rewards of ownership.  In countries whose laws provide for retention of some form of title by sellers, enabling recovery of goods in the event of customer default on payment, product delivery is considered to have occurred when the customer has assumed the risks and rewards of ownership of the products.
 Occasionally, Woodward transfers title of product to customers, but retains substantive performance obligations such as completion of product testing, customer acceptance or in some instances regulatory acceptance.  In addition, occasionally customers pay Woodward for products or services prior to Woodward satisfying its performance obligation.  Under these circumstances, revenue is deferred until the performance obligations are satisfied.  In addition, service revenue is also recognized upon completion of applicable performance obligations.
 Certain Woodward products include incidental software or firmware essential to the performance of the product as designed, which are treated as units of accounting associated with the related tangible product with which the software is included.  Woodward does not generally sell software on a standalone basis, although software upgrades, if any, are generally paid for by the customer.  
 Revenue for certain non-recurring engineering projects is recognized when contractually specified milestones are achieved.  
 Product freight costs are included in cost of goods sold.  Freight costs charged to customers are included in net sales.
 Taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities are excluded from revenue and are recorded as liabilities until the taxes are remitted to the appropriate U.S. or foreign government authority.
 Net sales generated through shipment of tangible products to customers represents more than 90% of total net sales for fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015.
 Customer payments:  Woodward occasionally agrees to make payments to certain customers in order to participate in anticipated sales activity.  Payments made to customers are accounted for as a reduction of revenue unless they are made in exchange for identifiable goods or services with fair values that can be reasonably estimated.  Reductions in revenue associated with these customer payments are recognized immediately to the extent that the payments cannot be attributed to anticipated future sales, and are recognized in future periods to the extent that the payments relate to anticipated future sales.  Such determinations are based on the facts and circumstances underlying each payment.
 Stock-based compensation: Compensation cost relating to stock-based payment awards made to employees and directors is recognized in the financial statements using a fair value method.  Non-qualified stock option awards and restricted stock awards are issued under Woodward’s stock-based compensation plans.  The cost of such awards, measured at the grant date, is based on the estimated fair value of the award.
 Forfeitures are estimated at the time of each grant in order to estimate the portion of the award that will ultimately vest.  The estimate is based on Woodward’s historical rates of forfeitures and is updated periodically.  The portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods, which is generally the vesting period of the awards.
 Research and development costs:  Company funded expenditures related to new product development, and significant product enhancement and/or upgrade activities are expensed as incurred and are separately reported in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 
 Income taxes: Deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of Woodward’s assets, liabilities, and certain unrecognized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (losses) earnings.  Woodward provides for taxes that may be payable if undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries were to be remitted to the United States, except for those earnings that it considers to be indefinitely invested.
 Cash equivalents: Highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents.
 Cash and cash equivalents are maintained with multiple financial institutions.  Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions with reputable credit and therefore bear minimal credit risk.  Woodward holds cash and cash equivalents at financial institutions in excess of amounts covered by the Federal Depository Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”), sometimes invests excess cash in money market funds or other highly liquid investments not insured by the FDIC, and holds cash and cash equivalents outside the United States that are not insured by the FDIC.


 
57

Accounts receivable: Almost all of Woodward’s sales are made on credit and result in accounts receivable, which are recorded at the amount invoiced and are generally not collateralized.  In the normal course of business, not all accounts receivable are collected and, therefore, an allowance for uncollectible amounts is provided equal to the amount that Woodward believes ultimately will not be collected.  In establishing the amount of the allowance related to the credit risk of accounts receivable, customer-specific information is considered related to delinquent accounts, past loss experience, bankruptcy filings, deterioration in the customer’s operating results or financial position, and current economic conditions. Accounts receivable losses are deducted from the allowance, and the related accounts receivable balances are written off when the receivables are deemed uncollectible.  Recoveries of accounts receivable previously written off are recognized when received.  In addition, an allowance associated with anticipated future sales returns is also established and is included in the allowance for uncollectible amounts.
 ﻿
 Consistent with common business practice in China, Woodward’s Chinese subsidiary accepts from Chinese customers, in settlement of certain customer accounts receivable, bankers’ acceptance notes issued by Chinese banks that are believed to be creditworthy.  Bankers’ acceptance notes are financial instruments issued by Chinese financial institutions as part of financing arrangements between the financial institution and a customer of the financial institution.  Bankers’ acceptance notes represent a commitment by the issuing financial institution to pay a certain amount of money at a specified future maturity date to the legal owner of the bankers’ acceptance note as of the maturity date.  The maturity date of bankers’ acceptance notes varies, but it is Woodward’s policy to only accept bankers’ acceptance notes with maturity dates no more than 180 days from the date of Woodward’s receipt of such draft.  The issuing financial institution is the obligor, not Woodward’s customers.  Upon Woodward’s acceptance of a banker’s acceptance note from a customer, such customer has no further obligation to pay Woodward for the related accounts receivable balance.  Woodward only accepts bankers’ acceptance notes issued by banks that are believed to be creditworthy and to which the credit risks associated with the bankers’ acceptance notes are believed to be minimal.
 ﻿
 The composition of Woodward’s accounts receivable at September 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016 follows:
 ﻿
 ﻿
 ﻿
 ﻿

﻿ | | | | | 
---------------------------------------------+---------------+---------+---------------+---+--------
﻿ | | | | | 
﻿ | September 30, | | September 30,
﻿ | 2017 | | 2016 
Accounts receivable from: | | | | | 
Customers | $ | 367,715 | | $ | 341,215
Other (Chinese financial institutions) | | 38,243 | | | 5,093 
Allowance for uncollectible customer amounts | | (3,776) | | | (2,540)
﻿ | $ | 402,182 | | $ | 343,768

   Inventories: Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost being determined using methods that approximate a first-in, first-out basis.
 Short-term investments: From time to time, certain of Woodward’s foreign subsidiaries will invest excess cash in short-term time deposits with a fixed maturity date of longer than three months but less than one year from the date the deposit. Woodward believes that the investments are with creditworthy financial institutions.  Amounts with maturities of less than 365 days are classified as “Other current assets.”     Property, plant, and equipment: Property, plant, and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets.  Assets are generally depreciated using the straight-line method.  Assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
 Estimated lives over which fixed assets are generally depreciated at September 30, 2017 were as follows:

﻿ | | | | 
-----------------------------------+---+---+----+------
﻿ | | | | 
Land improvements | 3 | - | 20 | years
Buildings and improvements | 3 | - | 40 | years
Leasehold improvements | 1 | - | 10 | years
Machinery and production equipment | 3 | - | 20 | years
Computer equipment and software | 3 | - | 10 | years
Office furniture and equipment | 3 | - | 13 | years
Other | 3 | - | 13 | years

 

 
58

Included in computer equipment and software are Woodward’s enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) systems, which have an estimated useful life of 10 years.  All other computer equipment and software is generally depreciated over three to five years.
 Goodwill: Woodward tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.  Based on the relevant U.S. GAAP authoritative guidance, Woodward aggregates components of a single operating segment into a reporting unit, if appropriate.   The impairment tests consist of comparing the implied fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount that includes goodwill.  If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its implied fair value, Woodward compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the recorded carrying amount of goodwill.  If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, an impairment loss would be recognized to reduce the carrying amount to its implied fair value.  Based on the results of Woodward’s goodwill impairment testing it has recorded no impairment charges.
 Other intangibles: Other intangibles are recognized apart from goodwill whenever an acquired intangible asset arises from contractual or other legal rights, or whenever it is capable of being separated or divided from the acquired entity and sold, transferred, licensed, rented, or exchanged, either individually or in combination with a related contract, asset, or liability.  All of Woodward’s intangibles have an estimated useful life and are being amortized using patterns that reflect the periods over which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be realized.  Amortization expense is allocated to cost of goods sold and selling, general, and administrative expenses based on the nature of the intangible asset.  Impairment losses are recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible is both not recoverable and exceeds its fair value.  Woodward has recorded no impairment charges on its other intangibles. 
 Estimated lives over which intangible assets are amortized at September 30, 2017 were as follows:

﻿ | | | | 
-----------------------+----+---+----+------
﻿ | | | | 
Customer relationships | 9 | - | 30 | years
Intellectual property | 10 | - | 17 | years
Process technology | 8 | - | 30 | years
Other | | | 15 | years

  Impairment of long-lived assets: Woodward reviews the carrying amount of its long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable.  Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. 
 If such facts indicate a potential impairment, the Company would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group.  If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying amount of the asset group is not recoverable, the Company will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies, which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows.  Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value. There were no impairment charges recorded in fiscal years 2017, 2016 or 2015.    
 Investment in marketable equity securities:  Woodward holds marketable equity securities related to its deferred compensation program.  Based on Woodward’s intentions regarding these instruments, marketable equity securities are classified as trading securities.  The trading securities are reported at fair value, with realized gains and losses recognized in “Other (income) expense, net.” The trading securities are included in “Other assets.”  The associated obligation to provide benefits is included in “Other liabilities.”
 Investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries: Investments in, and operating results of, entities in which Woodward does not have a controlling financial interest or the ability to exercise significant influence over the operations are included in the financial statements using the cost method of accounting.  Investments and operating results of entities in which Woodward does not have a controlling interest but does have the ability to exercise significant influence over operations are included in the financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
 Deferred compensation: The Company maintains a deferred compensation plan, or “rabbi trust,” as part of its overall compensation package for certain employees. 
 Deferred compensation obligations will be settled either by delivery of a fixed number of shares of Woodward’s common stock (in accordance with certain eligible members’ irrevocable elections) or in cash.  Woodward has contributed shares of its common stock into a trust established for the future settlement of deferred compensation obligations that are payable in shares of Woodward’s common stock.  Common stock held by the trust is reflected in the Consolidated Balance 

 
59

Sheet as “Treasury stock held for deferred compensation” and the related deferred compensation obligation is reflected as a separate component of equity in amounts equal to the fair value of the common stock at the dates of contribution.  These accounts are not adjusted for subsequent changes in the fair value of the common stock.  Deferred compensation obligations that will be settled in cash are accounted for on an accrual basis in accordance with the terms of the underlying contract and are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as “Other liabilities.” 
 Derivatives: The Company is exposed to various market risks that arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business.  The Company has historically utilized derivative instruments, such as treasury lock agreements to lock in fixed rates on future debt issuances, which qualify as cash flow or fair value hedges to mitigate the risk of variability in cash flows related to future interest payments attributable to changes in the designated benchmark rate.  The Company records all such interest rate hedge instruments on the balance sheet at fair value.  Cash flows related to the instrument designated as a qualifying hedge are reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the same categories as the cash flows from the items being hedged.  Accordingly, cash flows relating to the settlement of interest rate derivatives hedging the forecasted future interest payments on debt have been reflected upon settlement as a component of financing cash flows.  The resulting gain or loss from such settlement is deferred to other comprehensive income and reclassified to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt.  This reclassification of the deferred gains and losses impacts the interest expense recognized on the underlying debt that was hedged and is therefore reflected as a component of operating cash flows in periods subsequent to settlement.  The periodic settlement of interest rate derivatives hedging outstanding variable rate debt is recorded as an adjustment to interest expense and is therefore reflected as a component of operating cash flows.

From time to time, in order to hedge against foreign currency exposure, Woodward designates certain non-derivative financial instrument loans as net investment hedges.  Foreign exchange gains or losses on the loans are recognized in foreign currency translation adjustments within total comprehensive (losses) earnings.  Further information on net investment hedges can be found at Note 6, Derivative instruments and hedging activities.
 Financial instruments: The Company’s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, investments in the deferred compensation program, notes receivable from municipalities, investments in term deposits and debt.  Because of their short-term maturity, the carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents and short-term debt approximate fair value.  The fair value of investments in the deferred compensation program are adjusted to fair value based on the quoted market prices for the investments in the various mutual funds owned.  The fair value of the long-term notes from municipalities are estimated based on a model that discounts future principal and interest payments received at interest rates available to the Company at the end of the period for similarly rated municipality notes of similar maturity.  The fair value of term deposits are estimated based on a model that discounts future principal and interest payments received at interest rates available to the Company at the end of the period for similar term deposits with the same maturity in the same jurisdictions.  The fair value of long-term debt is estimated based on a model that discounts future principal and interest payments at interest rates available to the Company at the end of the period for similar debt with the same maturity.  Further information on the fair value of financial instruments can be found at Note 5, Financial instruments and fair value measurements.
 Financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets are categorized based upon a fair value hierarchy established by U.S. GAAP, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into the following levels:
 Level 1: Inputs based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.  
 Level 2: Quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable and can be corroborated by observable market data.
 Level 3: Inputs reflect management’s best estimates and assumptions of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.  The inputs are unobservable in the market and significant to the valuation of the instruments.
 Postretirement benefits: The Company provides various benefits to certain current and former employees through defined benefit pension and postretirement plans.  For financial reporting purposes, net periodic benefits expense and related obligations are calculated using a number of significant actuarial assumptions.  Changes in net periodic expense and funding status may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions.  The funded status of defined pension and postretirement plans recognized in the statement of financial position is measured as the difference between the fair market value of the plan assets and the benefit obligation.  For a defined benefit pension plan, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation; for any other defined benefit postretirement plan, such as a retiree health care plan, the benefit obligation is the accumulated benefit obligation.  Any over-funded status is recognized as an asset and any underfunded status is recognized as a liability. 


 
60

Projected benefit obligation is the actuarial present value as of the measurement date of all benefits attributed by the plan benefit formula to employee service rendered before the measurement date using assumptions as to future compensation levels if the plan benefit formula is based on those future compensation levels.  The accumulated benefit obligation is the actuarial present value of benefits (whether vested or unvested) attributed by the plan benefit formula to employee service rendered before the measurement date and based on employee service and compensation, if applicable, prior to that date.  The accumulated benefit obligation differs from the projected benefit obligation in that it includes no assumption about future compensation levels.    Reclassification
 In the Statements of Earnings for all periods presented amortization of intangible assets has been reclassified from a separate line to an allocated expense/cost component of cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative expenses based on the nature of the intangible asset that is being amortized.  Prior year amounts have been recast to reflect this reclassification.  The following tables reflect the amounts reclassified.

 Note 2.  New accounting standards
 From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) or other standards setting bodies issue new accounting pronouncements.  Updates to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) are communicated through issuance of an Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”).
 In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, “Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities.”  ASU 2017-12 is intended to more closely align the financial statement reporting of hedging relationships with the economic results of an entity’s risk management activities and to make certain targeted improvements to simplify the application of hedge accounting guidance in current GAAP.  ASU 2017-12 is also intended to increase standardization of financial statement disclosures including requiring a tabular disclosure of the income statement effects of fair value and cash flow hedges.  ASU 2017-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 (fiscal year 2020 for Woodward) and early adoption is permitted in any interim period.  Upon adoption, an entity should apply a cumulative-effect adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive earnings with a corresponding adjustment to retained earnings to eliminate the separate measurement of ineffectiveness for cash flow and net investment hedges, if any. Also upon adoption, the amended presentation and disclosure guidance should be applied prospectively.  Woodward has not determined in which period it will adopt the new guidance.  Woodward does not believe the application of the new guidance will have any impact on its current hedging arrangements.
 In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, “Compensation – Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting.”  ASU 2017-09 was issued to provide clarity and reduce both 1) diversity in practice and 2) cost

and complexity when applying the guidance in Topic 718 to a change in the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award.  ASU 2017-09 provides guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting under Topic 718.  The amendments in ASU 2017-09 are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017 (fiscal year 2019 for Woodward).  Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in any interim period.  The amendments in ASU 2017-09 should be applied prospectively to an award modified on or after the adoption date.  Woodward adopted the new guidance in its third quarter of fiscal year 2017 and will apply the guidance to any future changes to the terms or conditions of its share-based payment awards. 
 In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, “Compensation – Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost.”  ASU 2017-07 requires that the service cost component of net periodic benefit costs from defined benefit and other postretirement benefit plans be included in the same Statement of Earnings captions as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the covered employees during the period.  The other components of net benefit cost will be presented in the Statement of Earnings separately from service costs.  ASU 2017-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2017 (fiscal year 2019 for Woodward).  Following adoption, only service costs will be eligible for capitalization into manufactured inventories, which should reduce diversity in practice.  The amendments of ASU 2017-07 should be applied retrospectively for the presentation of the service cost component and the other components of net periodic benefit costs from defined benefit and other postretirement benefit plans in the earnings statement and prospectively, on and after the effective date, for the capitalization of the service cost component into manufactured inventories.  Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of Woodward’s fiscal year 2018.  Woodward has not determined whether it will adopt the new guidance in fiscal year 2018 or fiscal year 2019, and expects changes to earnings before income taxes to be insignificant in the year of adoption. 
 In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, “Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (Topic 350):  Simplifying the Accounting for Goodwill Impairment,” to simplify financial reporting by eliminating the need to determine the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit to measure goodwill impairment.  Under ASU 2017-04, an entity should perform its goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, up to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.  The new guidance effectively eliminates “Step 2” from the previous goodwill impairment test.  ASU 2017-04 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2019 (fiscal year 2021 for Woodward).  Early adoption is permitted for goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017.  Woodward adopted the new guidance in its fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 when it performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of July 31, 2017.  The adoption of ASU 2017-04 did not have a significant impact on the results of its goodwill impairment testing. 
 In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, “Accounting for Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Asset Transfers of Assets Other than Inventory.”  ASU 2016-16 eliminates the current U.S. GAAP exception deferring the tax effects of intercompany asset transfers (other than inventory) until the transferred asset is sold to a third party or otherwise recovered through use.  After adoption of ASU 2016-16, Woodward will recognize the tax consequences of intercompany asset transfers in the buyer’s and seller’s tax jurisdictions when the transfer occurs, even though the pre-tax effects of these transactions are eliminated in consolidation.  ASU 2016-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 (fiscal year 2019 for Woodward), including interim periods within the year of adoption.  Early adoption is allowed only in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 or the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.  Modified retrospective adoption is required with any cumulative-effect adjustment recorded to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption.  Woodward has not determined in which period it will adopt the new guidance.  Woodward currently anticipates the adoption of ASU 2016-16 will result in balance sheet reclassifications, but based on Woodward’s current transactional activity, such adjustments are not expected to be significant.
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.”  ASU 2016-13 adds a current expected credit loss (“CECL”) impairment model to U.S. GAAP that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses.  Modified retrospective adoption is required with any cumulative-effect adjustment recorded to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption.  ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 (fiscal year 2021 for Woodward), including interim periods within the year of adoption.  Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 (fiscal year 2020 for Woodward), including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Woodward has not determined in which period it will adopt the new guidance but does not expect the application of the CECL impairment model to have a significant impact on Woodward’s allowance for uncollectible amounts for accounts receivable and notes receivable from municipalities.
     In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842).”  The purpose of ASU 2016-02 is to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements.  In addition, ASU 2016-02 modifies the definition of a lease to clarify 

 
62

that an arrangement contains a lease when such arrangement conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 (fiscal year 2020 for Woodward), including interim periods within the year of adoption.  In transition, Woodward will be required to recognize and measure leases beginning in the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach; therefore, Woodward anticipates restating its Consolidated Financial Statements for the two fiscal years prior to the year of adoption.  Early adoption is permitted.  Woodward has not determined in which period it will adopt the new guidance.  Woodward is currently assessing the impact this guidance may have on its Consolidated Financial Statements, including which of its existing lease arrangements will be impacted by the new guidance and whether other arrangements not currently classified as leases may become subject to the guidance of ASU 2016-02.  Rent expense for all operating leases in fiscal year 2017, none of which was recognized on the balance sheet, was $8,302.  As of September 30, 2017, future minimum rental payments required under operating leases, none of which were recognized on the balance sheet, were $23,215.
 In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” and has subsequently issued several supplemental and/or clarifying ASUs (collectively “ASC 606”).  ASC 606 prescribes a single common revenue standard that replaces most existing U.S. GAAP revenue recognition guidance.  ASC 606 outlines a five-step model, under which Woodward will recognize revenue as performance obligations within a customer contract are satisfied.  ASC 606 is intended to provide more consistent interpretation and application of the principles outlined in the standard across filers in multiple industries and within the same industries compared to current practices, which should improve comparability.  Adoption of ASC 606 is required for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (fiscal year 2019 for Woodward), including interim periods within the reporting period.  While Woodward could elect to adopt ASC 606 early, it will not be adopting the new standard in fiscal year 2018.  Upon adoption, Woodward must elect to adopt either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or using the cumulative effect transition method with the cumulative effect of initial adoption recognized at the date of initial application.  Woodward has not determined what transition method it will use.     Woodward is currently assessing the impact that the future adoption of ASC 606 may have on its Consolidated Financial Statements by analyzing its current portfolio of customer contracts, including a review of historical accounting policies and practices to identify potential differences in applying the guidance of ASC 606.  Woodward is also performing a comprehensive review of its current processes and systems to determine and implement changes required to support the adoption of ASC 606 on October 1, 2018, the first day of Woodward’s fiscal year 2019.  As part of this review process, Woodward is implementing new software solutions to support revenue reporting after adoption.     Based on Woodward’s review of its customer contracts, Woodward has determined that revenue on the majority of its customer contracts will continue to be recognized at a point in time, generally upon shipment of products, consistent with Woodward’s current revenue recognition model.  Upon adoption of ASC 606, however, Woodward also believes some of its revenues from sales of products and services to customers will be recognized over time, rather than at a point in time, due primarily to the terms of certain customer contracts.  As a result of recognizing some revenue over time, various balance sheet line items will be impacted.  As such, Woodward believes the adoption of ASC 606 will have an impact on both the timing of revenue recognition and various line items within the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 Woodward generally expenses costs as incurred for the engineering and development of new products.  Customer funding received for such engineering and development efforts is currently recognized as revenue when earned, with the corresponding costs recognized as cost of sales. ASC 606 requires customer funding of product engineering and development to be deferred and recognized as revenue as the related products are delivered to the customer.  ASC 606 also requires product engineering and development costs to be capitalized as contract fulfillment costs, to the extent recoverable from the deferred customer funding, and subsequently amortized as the related products are delivered to the customer.  Therefore, under ASC 606, Woodward expects to record both contract assets and contract liabilities related to such funded engineering and development efforts, which are expected to become material over time.  Recognized revenues and research and development costs are both expected to decrease in the year of adoption and for at least several years thereafter, due to the recognition of these contract assets and liabilities.  However, recognition of these contract assets and liabilities are expected to have an immaterial impact on pre-tax earnings in future periods. 
 In addition, ASC 606 will require more comprehensive disclosures about revenue streams and contracts with customers, including significant judgments required.  Woodward is currently evaluating potential changes to its processes for preparing required disclosures and to information systems that support the financial reporting process.  
 Woodward is also evaluating implications to the Company’s system of internal controls, relative to revenue recognition and the related revenue disclosures, which are based on the criteria outlined in the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission’s 2013 Internal Control – Integrated Framework.

Note 3.  Earnings per share
 Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period.
 Diluted earnings per share reflects the weighted-average number of shares outstanding after consideration of the dilutive effect of stock options and restricted stock.    The following is a reconciliation of net earnings to basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share:

  On June 2, 2015, Woodward entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the “ASR Agreement”) with Goldman, Sachs & Co. (“Goldman”) under which Woodward repurchased shares of its common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $125,000.  Upon execution of the ASR Agreement, Goldman initially delivered to Woodward 2,048 shares of common stock.  Goldman completed the ASR Agreement on September 3, 2015 and delivered 458 additional shares to Woodward.  The final number of shares delivered to Woodward was based generally on the average daily volume-weighted average price of Woodward stock during the term of the ASR Agreement of $49.89.  The 2,506 shares of common stock delivered by Goldman to Woodward related to the ASR Agreement are reflected in the calculation of basic shares outstanding used in the calculation of earnings per share.
  The following stock option grants were outstanding during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, but were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.

      Note 4.  Joint venture
 On January 4, 2016, Woodward and General Electric Company (“GE”), acting through its GE Aviation business unit, consummated the formation of a strategic joint venture between Woodward and GE (the “JV”) to design, develop and source fuel systems for specified existing and all future GE commercial aircraft engines that produce thrust in excess of fifty thousand pounds. 
 As part of the JV formation, Woodward contributed to the JV certain contractual rights and intellectual property applicable to the existing GE commercial aircraft engine programs within the scope of the JV.  Woodward had no initial cost basis in the JV because Woodward had no cost basis in the contractual rights and intellectual property contributed to the JV.

GE purchased from Woodward a 50% ownership interest in the JV for a $250,000 cash payment to Woodward.  In addition, GE will pay contingent consideration to Woodward consisting of fifteen annual payments of $4,894 per year which began on January 4, 2017 subject to certain claw-back conditions.  Woodward received its first annual payment of $4,894 during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, which was recorded as deferred income and is included in Net cash provided by operating activities under the caption “Other” on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.  Neither Woodward nor GE contributed any tangible assets to the JV. 
 Woodward determined that the JV formation was not the culmination of an earnings event because Woodward has significant performance obligations to support the future operations of the JV.  Therefore, Woodward recorded the $250,000 consideration received from GE, in January of 2016, for its purchase of a 50% equity interest in the JV as deferred income.  The $250,000 deferred income will be recognized as an increase to net sales in proportion to revenue realized on sales of applicable fuel systems within the scope of the JV in a particular period as a percentage of total revenue expected to be realized by Woodward over the estimated remaining lives of the underlying commercial aircraft engine programs assigned to the JV.  Unamortized deferred income recorded in connection with the JV formation included accrued liabilities of $6,451 as of September 30, 2017 and $6,552 as of September 30, 2016, and other liabilities of $236,896 as of September 30, 2017 and $238,187 as of September 30, 2016.  Amortization of the deferred income recognized as an increase to sales was $6,286 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2017, and $5,261 for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016.    Woodward and GE jointly manage the JV and any significant decisions and/or actions of the JV require the mutual consent of both parties.  Neither Woodward nor GE has a controlling financial interest in the JV, but both Woodward and GE do have the ability to significantly influence the operating and financial decisions of the JV.  Therefore, Woodward is accounting for its 50% ownership interest in the JV using the equity method of accounting.  The JV is a related party to Woodward.  Other income includes income of $2,568 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, and income of $6,204 for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 related to Woodward’s equity interest in the earnings of the JV.  During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, Woodward received a $2,500 cash distribution from the JV which is included in Net cash provided by operating activities under the caption “Other” on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Woodward received no cash distributions from the JV in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016.  Woodward’s net investment in the JV, which is included in other assets, was $6,272 as of September 30, 2017 and $6,204 as of September 30, 2016. 
 Woodward’s net sales include $70,234 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 of sales to the JV, compared to $46,973 for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016.  Woodward recorded a reduction to sales of $26,133 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 related to royalties paid to the JV by Woodward on sales by Woodward directly to third party aftermarket customers, compared to $21,391 for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016.  The Consolidated Balance Sheets include “Accounts receivable” of $8,554 at September 30, 2017, and $5,326 at September 30, 2016 related to amounts the JV owed Woodward, and include “Accounts payable” of $6,741 at September 30, 2017, and $3,926 at September 30, 2016 related to amounts Woodward owed the JV.
 ﻿
 Note 5.  Financial instruments and fair value measurements
 Financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets are categorized based upon a fair value hierarchy established by U.S. GAAP.
 The table below presents information about Woodward’s financial assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques Woodward utilized to determine such fair value.  Woodward had no financial liabilities required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2017 or September 30, 2016.

  ﻿
 Investments in money market funds: Woodward sometimes invests excess cash in money market funds not insured by the FDIC.  Woodward believes that the investments in money market funds are on deposit with creditworthy financial 

 
65

institutions and that the funds are highly liquid.  The investments in money market funds are reported in “Cash and cash equivalents” at fair value, with realized gains from interest income recognized in earnings.  The fair values of Woodward’s investments in money market funds are based on the quoted market prices for the net asset value of the various money market funds.
 Investments in reverse repurchase agreements: Woodward sometimes invests excess cash in reverse repurchase agreements.  Under the terms of Woodward’s reverse repurchase agreements, Woodward purchases an interest in a pool of securities and is granted a security interest in those securities by the counterparty to the reverse repurchase agreement.  At an agreed upon date, generally the next business day, the counterparty repurchases Woodward’s interest in the pool of securities at a price equal to what Woodward paid to the counterparty plus a rate of return determined daily per the terms of the reverse repurchase agreement.  Woodward believes that the investments in these reverse repurchase agreements are with creditworthy financial institutions and that the funds invested are highly liquid.  The investments in reverse repurchase agreements are reported at fair value, with realized gains from interest income recognized in earnings, and are included in “Cash and cash equivalents.”  Since the investments are generally overnight, the carrying value is considered to be equal to the fair value as the amount is deemed to be a cash deposit with no risk of change in value as of the end of each fiscal quarter.
 Investments in term deposits with foreign banks: Woodward’s foreign subsidiaries sometimes invest excess cash in various highly liquid financial instruments that Woodward believes are with creditworthy financial institutions.  Such investments are reported in “Cash and cash equivalents” at fair value, with realized gains from interest income recognized in earnings.  The carrying value of Woodward’s investments in term deposits with foreign banks are considered equal to the fair value given the highly liquid nature of the investments.
 Equity securities: Woodward holds marketable equity securities, through investments in various mutual funds, related to its deferred compensation program.  Based on Woodward’s intentions regarding these instruments, marketable equity securities are classified as trading securities.  The trading securities are reported at fair value, with realized gains and losses recognized in “Other (income) expense, net.”  The trading securities are included in “Other assets.”  The fair values of Woodward’s trading securities are based on the quoted market prices for the net asset value of the various mutual funds.
 Accounts receivable, accounts payable, the current portion of long-term debt, and short-term borrowings are not remeasured to fair value, as the carrying cost of each approximates its respective fair value.  The estimated fair values and carrying costs of other financial instruments that are not required to be remeasured at fair value in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets were as follows:

  ﻿
 In fiscal years 2014 and 2013, Woodward received long-term notes from municipalities within the states of Illinois and Colorado in connection with certain economic incentives related to Woodward’s development of a second campus in the greater-Rockford, Illinois area for its Aerospace segment and Woodward’s development of a new campus at its corporate headquarters in Fort Collins, Colorado. The fair value of the long-term notes was estimated based on a model that discounted future principal and interest payments received at an interest rate available to the Company at the end of the period for similarly rated municipal notes of similar maturity, which is a level 2 input as defined by the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy.  The interest rates used to estimate the fair value of the long-term notes were 2.6% at September 30, 2017 and 2.2% at September 30, 2016. 
 From time to time, certain of Woodward’s foreign subsidiaries will invest excess cash in short-term time deposits with a fixed maturity date of longer than three months but less than one year from the date of the deposit.  Woodward believes that the investments are with creditworthy financial institutions.  The fair value of the investments in short-term time deposits was estimated based on a model that discounted future principal and interest payments to be received at an interest rate available to the foreign subsidiary entering into the investment for similar short-term time deposits of similar maturity.  This was determined to be a level 2 input as defined by the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy.  The interest rate used to estimate the fair value of the short-term time deposits was 5.3% at September 30, 2017 and 6.9% at September 30, 2016.  


 
66

The fair value of long-term debt was estimated based on a model that discounted future principal and interest payments at interest rates available to the Company at the end of the period for similar debt of the same maturity, which is a level 2 input as defined by the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy.  The weighted-average interest rates used to estimate the fair value of long-term debt were 2.4% at September 30, 2017 and 1.9% at September 30, 2016.
     Note 6.  Derivative instruments and hedging activities
 Woodward has exposures related to global market risks, including the effect of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, changes in certain commodity prices and fluctuations in various producer indices.  From time to time, Woodward enters into derivative instruments for risk management purposes only, including derivatives designated as accounting hedges and/or those utilized as economic hedges.  Woodward uses interest rate related derivative instruments to manage its exposure to fluctuations of interest rates.  Woodward does not enter into or issue derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.
 By using derivative and/or hedging instruments to manage its risk exposure, Woodward is subject, from time to time, to credit risk and market risk on those derivative instruments.  Credit risk arises from the potential failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative and/or hedging instrument.  When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty owes Woodward, which creates credit risk for Woodward.  Woodward mitigates this credit risk by entering into transactions with only counterparties that are believed to be creditworthy.  Market risk arises from the potential adverse effects on the value of derivative and/or hedging instruments that result from a change in interest rates, commodity prices, or foreign currency exchange rates.  Woodward minimizes this market risk by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken.
 Other than the net investment hedges discussed below, Woodward did not enter into any derivatives or hedging transactions during any of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017, September 30, 2016, and September 30, 2015.
 Derivatives in cash flow hedging relationships
 In June 2013, in connection with Woodward’s expected refinancing of current maturities on its existing long-term debt, Woodward entered into a treasury lock agreement with a notional amount of $25,000 that qualified as a cash flow hedge under ASC Topic 815, “Derivatives and Hedging.”  The objective of this derivative instrument was to hedge the risk of variability in cash flows attributable to changes in the designated benchmark interest rate over a seven-year period related to the future interest payments on a portion of anticipated future debt issuances.  The treasury lock agreement was settled in August 2013 and the resulting gain of $507 is being recognized as a reduction of interest expense over a seven-year period.  The unrecognized portion of the gain is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (losses) earnings, net of tax.
 In March 2009, Woodward entered into LIBOR lock agreements that qualified as cash flow hedges under authoritative guidance for derivatives and hedging.  The objective of this derivative instrument was to hedge the risk of variability in cash flows over a seven-year period related to future interest payments of a portion of anticipated future debt issuances attributable to changes in the designated benchmark interest rate associated with the then expected issuance of long-term debt to acquire HR Textron Inc. (“HRT”).  The discontinuance of the LIBOR lock agreements resulted in a loss that was being recognized as an increase of interest expense over a seven-year period on the hedged Series E and F Notes, which were issued on April 3, 2009, using the effective interest method.  The unrecognized portion of the loss was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (losses) earnings, net of tax.  The unrecognized portion of the loss was fully amortized to interest expense during the second quarter of fiscal year 2016, and as of September 30, 2016 there was no unrecognized loss associated with this cash flow hedge in Woodward’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.  
 In September 2008, the Company entered into treasury lock agreements that qualified as cash flow hedges under authoritative guidance for derivatives and hedging.  The objective of this derivative instrument was to hedge the risk of variability in cash flows related to future interest payments of a portion of the anticipated future debt issuances attributable to changes in the designated benchmark interest rate associated with the expected issuance of long-term debt to acquire Techni-Core, Inc. (“Techni-Core”) and MPC Products Corporation (“MPC Products” and, together with Techni-Core, “MPC”).  The discontinuance of these treasury lock agreements resulted in a gain that was being recognized as a reduction of interest expense over a seven-year period on the hedged Series C and D Notes, which were issued on October 1, 2008, using the effective interest method.  The unrecognized portion of the gain was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (losses) earnings, net of tax.  The unrecognized portion of the gain was fully amortized to interest expense during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, and as of September 30, 2015 there was no unrecognized gain associated with this cash flow hedge in Woodward’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The remaining unrecognized gains and losses in Woodward’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets associated with derivative instruments that were previously entered into by Woodward, which are classified in accumulated other comprehensive (losses) earnings (“accumulated OCI”), were net gains of $218 as of September 30, 2017 and $290 as of September 30, 2016.
 The following table discloses the impact of derivative instruments in cash flow hedging relationships on Woodward’s Consolidated Statements of Earnings, recognized in interest expense:

 Based on the carrying value of the realized but unrecognized gains on terminated derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges as of September 30, 2017, Woodward expects to reclassify $72 of net unrecognized gains on terminated derivative instruments from accumulated other comprehensive (losses) earnings to earnings during the next twelve months.

 Net investment hedges
 On September 23, 2016, Woodward and Woodward International Holding B.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of Woodward organized under the laws of The Netherlands (the “BV Subsidiary”), each entered into a note purchase agreement (the “2016 Note Purchase Agreement”) relating to the sale by Woodward and the BV Subsidiary of an aggregate principal amount of €160,000 of senior unsecured notes in a series of private placement transactions.  Woodward issued €40,000 aggregate principal amount of Woodward’s Series M Senior Notes due September 23, 2026.  Woodward designated the €40,000 Series M Notes as a hedge of a foreign currency exposure of Woodward’s net investment in its Euro denominated functional currency subsidiaries.  Foreign exchange losses on the Series M Notes of $2,395 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 and $47 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 are included in foreign currency translation adjustments within total comprehensive (losses) earnings.  
 In June 2015, Woodward designated an intercompany loan of 160,000 Renminbi (“RMB”) between two wholly owned subsidiaries as a hedge of a foreign currency exposure of the net investment of the borrower in the lender.  In June 2016, the intercompany loan was repaid, resulting in a realized gain of $1,484 that was recognized within total comprehensive earnings, of which $912 was recognized in fiscal year 2016 and $572 was recognized in fiscal year 2015.
 In July 2016, Woodward designated a new intercompany loan of 160,000 RMB between two wholly owned subsidiaries as a hedge of a foreign currency exposure of the net investment of the borrower in the lender.  In July 2017, the intercompany loan was repaid, resulting in a realized gain of $380 that was recognized within total comprehensive earnings, of which a gain of $453 was recognized in fiscal year 2017 and a loss of $73 was recognized in fiscal year 2016.

 Included in “Office furniture and equipment” and “Other” is $1,653 at each of September 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016, of gross assets acquired on capital leases, and accumulated depreciation included $739 at September 30, 2017 and $322 at September 30, 2016 of amortization associated with the capital lease assets.
 In fiscal year 2015, Woodward completed and placed into service a manufacturing and office building on a second campus in the greater-Rockford, Illinois area and has occupied the new facility for its Aerospace segment.  This campus is intended to support Woodward’s expected growth in its Aerospace segment over the next ten years and beyond, required as a result of Woodward being awarded a substantial number of new system platforms, particularly on narrow-body aircraft.  Included in “Construction in progress” are costs of $49,347 at September 30, 2017 and $26,741 at September 30, 2016 associated with new equipment purchases for the second campus.  
 Concurrent with and in relation to Woodward’s significant investment in three new campuses and related equipment in the greater-Rockford, Illinois area, the new campus at its corporate headquarters in Fort Collins, Colorado (both discussed above), and the new campus in Niles, Illinois that was completed in fiscal year 2015, Woodward initiated a comprehensive review of its depreciation lives as required by U.S. GAAP to evaluate the estimates of the useful lives of Woodward assets.  This review resulted in estimates of the useful lives of both existing and new assets generally in excess of those utilized prior to fiscal year 2016.  The revised estimates were used in fiscal year 2016 and will be used going forward and result in a downward adjustment of depreciation on existing assets of approximately $12,000 for fiscal year 2016.
 For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017, 2016, and 2015, Woodward had depreciation expense as follows:

  ﻿
 Woodward tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.  Woodward completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of July 31, 2017 during the quarter ended September 30, 2017.  At that date, Woodward determined it was appropriate to aggregate certain components of the same operating segment into a single reporting unit.  The fair value of each of Woodward’s reporting units was determined using a discounted cash flow method.  This method represents a level 3 input and incorporates various estimates and assumptions, the most significant being projected revenue growth rates, earnings margins, future tax rates, and the present value, based on an estimated weighted-average cost of capital (or the discount rate) and terminal growth rate, of forecasted cash flows.  Management projects revenue growth rates, earnings margins and cash flows based on each reporting unit’s current operational results, expected performance and operational strategies over a ten-year period.  These projections are adjusted to reflect current economic conditions and demand for certain products, and require considerable management judgment.
 Forecasted cash flows used in the July 31, 2017 impairment test were discounted using weighted-average cost of capital assumptions ranging from 9.57% to 13.86%. The terminal values of the forecasted cash flows were calculated using the Gordon Growth Model and assumed an annual compound growth rate after ten years of 3.39%. These inputs, which are unobservable in the market, represent management’s best estimate of what market participants would use in determining the present value of the Company’s forecasted cash flows.  Changes in these estimates and assumptions can have a significant impact on the fair value of forecasted cash flows.  Woodward evaluated the reasonableness of the reporting units’ resulting fair values utilizing a market multiple method.
 The results of Woodward’s goodwill impairment tests performed as of July 31, 2017 did not indicate impairment of any of Woodward’s reporting units.

﻿ | $ | 1,017,588 | | $ | (10,972) | $ | (32,600) | $ | 974,016

  Revolving credit facility
 Woodward maintains a $1,000,000 revolving credit facility established under a revolving credit agreement among Woodward, a syndicate of lenders and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent (the “Revolving Credit Agreement”).  The Revolving Credit Agreement provides for the option to increase available borrowings to up to $1,200,000, subject to lenders’ participation.  Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement generally bear interest at LIBOR plus 0.85% to 1.65%.  The Revolving Credit Agreement matures in April 2020.  Under the Revolving Credit Agreement, there were $32,600 in principal amount of borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2017, at an effective interest rate of 2.29%, and $156,700 in principal amount of borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2016, at an effective interest rate of 1.77%.  As of September 30, 2017, all of the borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement were classified as short-term based on Woodward’s intent and ability to pay this amount in the next twelve months.  As of September 30, 2016, $150,000 of the borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement were classified as short-term debt.
 The Revolving Credit Agreement contains certain covenants customary with such agreements, which are generally consistent with the covenants applicable to Woodward’s long-term debt agreements, and contains customary events of default, including certain cross default provisions related to Woodward’s other outstanding debt arrangements in excess of $60,000, the occurrence of which would permit the lenders to accelerate the amounts due thereunder.  In addition, the Revolving Credit Agreement includes the following financial covenants: (i) a maximum permitted leverage ratio of consolidated net debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, stock-based compensation, and amortization, plus any usual non-cash charges to the extent deducted in computing net income minus any usual non-cash gains to the extent added in computing net income (“Leverage Ratio”) for Woodward and its consolidated subsidiaries of 3.5 to 1.0, which ratio, subject to certain restrictions, may increase to 4.0 to 1.0 for the fiscal quarter (and the immediately following fiscal quarter) during which a permitted acquisition occurs and to 3.75 to 1.0 for the following two succeeding fiscal quarters, and (ii) a minimum consolidated net worth of $800,000 plus (a) 50% of Woodward’s positive net income for the prior fiscal year and (b) 50% of Woodward’s net cash proceeds resulting from certain issuances of stock, subject to certain adjustments.
 Woodward’s obligations under the Revolving Credit Agreement are guaranteed by Woodward FST, Inc., Woodward MPC, Inc., and Woodward HRT, Inc., each of which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Woodward.
 Short-term borrowings
 Woodward has other foreign lines of credit and foreign overdraft facilities at various financial institutions, which are generally reviewed annually for renewal and are subject to the usual terms and conditions applied by the financial institutions.  Pursuant to the terms of the related facility agreements, Woodward’s foreign performance guarantee facilities are limited in use to providing performance guarantees to third parties.  There were no borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016 on Woodward’s foreign lines of credit and foreign overdraft facilities.

  The Notes
 In October 2008, Woodward entered into a note purchase agreement relating to the Series D Notes (the “2008 Notes”).  In April 2009, Woodward entered into a note purchase agreement relating to the Series F Notes (the “2009 Notes”).
 On October 1, 2013, Woodward entered into a note purchase agreement relating to the sale by Woodward of an aggregate principal amount of $250,000 of its senior unsecured notes in a series of private placement transactions.  Woodward issued the Series G, H and I Notes (the “First Closing Notes”) on October 1, 2013.  Woodward issued the Series J, K and L Notes (the “Second Closing Notes,” and together with the 2008 Notes, 2009 Notes and the First Closing Notes, the “USD Notes”) on November 15, 2013.    On September 23, 2016, Woodward and the BV Subsidiary each entered into note purchase agreements relating to the sale by Woodward and the BV Subsidiary of an aggregate principal amount of €160,000 of senior unsecured notes in a series of private placement transactions.  Woodward issued €40,000 aggregate principal amount of Woodward’s Series M Senior Notes (the “Series M Notes”).  The BV Subsidiary issued (a) €77,000 aggregate principal amount of the BV Subsidiary’s Series N Senior Notes (the “Series N Notes”) and (b) €43,000 aggregate principal amount of the BV Subsidiary’s Series O Senior Notes (the “Series O Notes” and together with the Series M Notes and the Series N Notes, the “2016 Notes,” and together with the USD Notes, collectively, the “Notes”).  
 Interest on the 2008 Notes, the First Closing Notes, and the Series K and L Notes is payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year until all principal is paid.  Interest on the 2009 Notes is payable semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year until all principal is paid.  Interest on the 2016 Notes is payable semi-annually on March 23 and September 23 of each year, until all principal is paid.  Interest on the Series J Notes is payable quarterly on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 of each year until all principal is paid.  As of September 30, 2017, the Series J Notes bore interest at an effective rate of 2.6%.
 None of the Notes were registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and they may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements.  Holders of the Notes do not have any registration rights.  
 All of the issued Notes are held by multiple institutions.
 Woodward’s obligations under the Notes are guaranteed by (i) Woodward FST, Inc., Woodward MPC, Inc., and Woodward HRT, Inc., each of which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Woodward, and (ii) in the case of the BV Subsidiary’s Series N and O Notes, by Woodward.  Woodward’s obligations under the Notes rank equal in right of payment with all of Woodward’s other unsecured unsubordinated debt, including its outstanding debt under its revolving credit facility.

The USD Notes and the 2016 Notes contain covenants customary for such financings, including, among other things, covenants that place limits on Woodward’s ability to incur liens on assets, incur additional debt (including a leverage or coverage based maintenance test), transfer or sell Woodward’s assets, merge or consolidate with other persons and enter into material transactions with affiliates.  Under the financial covenants contained in the note purchase agreement governing the USD Notes, Woodward’s priority debt may not exceed, at any time, 25% of its consolidated net worth.  Woodward’s Leverage Ratio cannot exceed 4.0 to 1.0 during any material acquisition period, or 3.5 to 1.0 at any other time on a rolling four quarter basis. In the event that Woodward’s Leverage Ratio exceeds 3.5 to 1.0 during any material acquisition period, the interest rate on each series of Notes will increase.  Further for the Series D and F notes, Woodward’s consolidated net worth must at all times equal or exceed $485,940 plus 50% of Woodward’s consolidated net earnings for each fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year ending September 30, 2009.  For the Series G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, and O notes, Woodward’s consolidated net worth must at all times equal or exceed $1,046,619 plus 50% of Woodward’s positive net income for each completed fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016. 
 Woodward, at its option, is permitted at any time to prepay all, or any part of the then-outstanding principal amount of any series of the Notes at 100% of the principal amount of the series of Notes to be prepaid (but, in the case of partial prepayment, not less than $1,000 for the USD Notes and not less than €1,000 for the 2016 Notes), together with interest accrued on such amount to be prepaid to the date of payment, plus any applicable prepayment compensation amount. The prepayment compensation amount, as to the USD Notes other than the Series J Notes, is computed by discounting the remaining scheduled payments of interest and principal of the USD Notes being prepaid at a discount rate equal to the sum of 50 basis points and the yield to maturity of U.S. Treasury securities having a maturity equal to the remaining average life of the USD Notes being prepaid. The prepayment compensation amount, as to the Series J Notes, generally is computed as a percentage of the principal amount of the Series J Notes equal to (a) 2%, on or prior to November 15, 2014, (b) 1%, after November 15, 2014 and on or prior to November 15, 2015, and (c) 0% after November 15, 2015.  The prepayment compensation amount as to the 2016 Notes that is not subject to a swap agreement is computed by discounting the remaining scheduled payments of interest and principal of such notes being prepaid at a discount rate equal to the sum of 50 basis points and the yield to maturity of the German Bund having a maturity equal to the remaining average life of the 2016 Notes being prepaid.  The prepayment compensation amount as to a 2016 Note that is subject to a swap agreement entered into by the holder of such note under which the holder will receive payment in U.S. dollars in exchange for scheduled Euro payments of principal and interest on the Euro denominated 2016 Notes, adjusted for theoretical holder returns foregone on hypothetical reinvestments in U.S. Treasury securities (the “Swapped Notes”) is equal to the excess of an amount equal to the remaining scheduled payments to be paid in respect of such called principal under such swap agreement discounted at a rate equal to 50 basis points and the yield to maturity of U.S. Treasury securities having a maturity equal to the remaining average life of the Swapped Notes being prepaid over the amount of payments in U.S. dollars that would be paid to the holder of the Swapped Note in respect of the called principal under the swap agreement, which amount will be increased or reduced, as applicable, in an amount equal to any net gain or loss realized by the holder of such Swapped Note on swap transactions under such swap agreement as a result of such prepayment.
 Required future principal payments of the Notes as of September 30, 2017 are as follows:

Debt Issuance Costs
 In connection with the 2016 Note Purchase Agreements, in fiscal year 2016, Woodward incurred $863 in financing costs, which are deferred and will be amortized using the straight-line method over the life of the agreement.
 In connection with the Revolving Credit Agreement, in fiscal year 2015, Woodward incurred $2,359 in financing costs, which are deferred and are being amortized using the straight-line method over the life of the agreement.  As of April 28, 2015, Woodward also had $2,014 remaining of deferred financing costs incurred in connection with the prior revolving credit agreement, which have been combined with the financing costs associated with the Revolving Credit Agreement and are being amortized using the straight-line method over the life of the Revolving Credit Agreement.
 Amounts recognized as interest expense from the amortization of debt issuance costs were $1,130 in fiscal year 2017, $1,165 in fiscal year 2016, and $1,114 in fiscal year 2015.  Unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the Notes of $1,794 as of September 30, 2017 and $2,091 as of September 30, 2016 have been recorded as a reduction in “Long-term debt, less current portion” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the Revolving Credit Agreement of $2,259 as of September 30, 2017 and $3,134 as of September 30, 2016 have been recorded as “Other assets” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Amortization of debt issuance costs is included in operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

 Warranties
 Provisions of Woodward’s sales agreements include product warranties customary to these types of agreements.  Accruals are established for specifically identified warranty issues that are probable to result in future costs.  Warranty costs are accrued on a non-specific basis whenever past experience indicates a normal and predictable pattern exists.  Changes in accrued product warranties were as follows:

 Loss reserve on contractual lease commitments
 In connection with the construction of a new production facility in Niles, Illinois, Woodward vacated a leased facility in Skokie, Illinois.  During the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, Woodward fully vacated the Skokie facility and therefore recorded a charge of $8,165 to recognize a loss reserve against the estimated remaining contractual lease commitments, less anticipated sublease income.  During the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, Woodward entered into an additional sublease agreement with a third party related to a portion of the vacated Skokie facility.  Woodward recorded a reduction in the loss reserve associated with the vacated Skokie facility of $2,322 related to the anticipated sublease income it will receive.
 The summary for the activity in the loss reserve during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016 is as follows:

  Woodward has recorded a net operating loss (“NOL”) deferred tax asset of $4,707 as of September 30, 2017 and $5,255 as of September 30, 2016.  A portion of these NOL carryforwards will start to expire in 2018 and is currently offset by a valuation allowance.  We have placed valuation allowances against all other NOL carryforwards that are less than 50 percent likely to be realized.
 Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  Both positive and negative evidence are considered in forming Woodward’s judgment as to whether a valuation allowance is appropriate, and more weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified.  Valuation allowances are reassessed whenever there are changes in circumstances that may cause a change in judgment.  The change in the valuation allowance was primarily the result of new valuation allowances placed on two wholly owned subsidiaries with net operating losses and a reassessment of another valuation allowance based on a change in estimate of future earnings.
 At September 30, 2017, Woodward has not provided for taxes on undistributed foreign earnings of $405,286 that it considered indefinitely reinvested.  These earnings could become subject to income taxes if they are remitted as dividends, are loaned to Woodward or any of Woodward’s subsidiaries located in the United States, or if Woodward sells its stock in the foreign subsidiaries.  Any additional U.S. taxes could be offset, in part or in whole, by foreign tax credits.  The amount of such taxes and application of tax credits would be dependent on the income tax laws and other circumstances at the time these amounts are repatriated.  Based on these variables, it is impractical to determine the income tax liability that might be incurred if these funds were to be repatriated.

The following is a reconciliation of the U.S. Federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent to Woodward’s effective income tax rate:
 ﻿

﻿ | | | | | | |

﻿ | | | | | | | 
﻿ | Year Ending September 30,

Taxes on international activities | (7.6) | | | (2.2) | | (3.8) | 
Research credit | (3.2) | | | (3.6) | | (0.8) | 
Retroactive extension of research credit | - | | | (3.2) | | (2.4) | 
Net excess income tax benefit from stock-based compensation | (1.4) | | | (2.6) | | - | 
Domestic production activities deduction | (1.5) | | | (2.1) | | (1.6) | 
Adjustments of prior period tax items | (0.9) | | | (0.2) | | (2.1) | 
Other items, net | 0.6 | | | (1.3) | | (0.8) | 
Effective tax rate | 20.7 | % | | 20.2 | % | 24.7 | %

  In determining the tax amounts in Woodward’s financial statements, estimates are sometimes used that are subsequently adjusted in the actual filing of tax returns or by updated calculations.  In addition, Woodward occasionally has resolutions of tax items with tax authorities related to prior years due to the conclusion of audits and the lapse of applicable statutes of limitations.  Such adjustments are included in the “Adjustments of prior period tax items” line in the above table.  The majority of these adjustments are related to the conclusion of audits, effective settlement, and lapse of applicable statutes of limitations in various tax jurisdictions.
 Income taxes for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 benefitted from impact of repatriation to the United States of certain net foreign profits and losses in the first quarter.  The U.S. foreign tax credits available as a result of the repatriation of the foreign net earnings were greater than the U.S. taxes payable on these net foreign earnings.  The excess U.S. foreign tax credit are expected to offset U.S. taxes on other foreign source income.
 On December 18, 2015, the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes (“PATH”) Act of 2015 was enacted, which permanently extended the Research and Experimentation (“R&E”) Tax Credit.  As a result, income taxes for the year ended September 30, 2016 included a net benefit related to the retroactive impact from the last three quarters of fiscal year 2015 of the R&E Credit pursuant to the PATH Act.  In addition, income taxes for the year ended September 30, 2016 included a net benefit related to the full year impact of fiscal year 2016 of the R&E Credit.
 Woodward adopted ASU 2016-09, “Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,” in its second quarter of fiscal year 2016 resulting in the recognition through earnings of a net excess income tax benefit from stock-based compensation.
 On December 19, 2014, the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 was enacted, which retroactively extended the R&E Credit through December 31, 2014.  As a result, income taxes for the year ended September 30, 2015 included a net benefit related to the retroactive impact from the last three quarters of fiscal year 2014 of the R&E Credit pursuant to the Tax Increase Prevention Act.
 A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits follows:
 ﻿

﻿ | | | | | | | 
-------------------------------------------+---------------------------+---------+------+---+---------+---+--------
﻿ | | | | | | | 
﻿ | Year Ending September 30,
﻿ | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015

Additions to current year tax positions | | 2,560 | | | 3,588 | | 2,234 
Reductions to prior year tax positions | | (5,753) | | | (2,292) | | (7,785)
Additions to prior year tax positions | | 3,501 | | | 761 | | 5,124

Ending balance | $ | 20,132 | | $ | 23,526 | $ | 21,469 

  Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits were $9,677 as of September 30, 2017 and $11,426 as of September 30, 2016 of tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.  At this time, Woodward estimates that it is reasonably possible that the liability for unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by as much as $7,726 in the next twelve 

 
79

months due to the completion of reviews by tax authorities, lapses of statutes, and the settlement of tax positions.  Woodward accrues for potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits and all other interest and penalties related to tax payments in tax expense.  Woodward had accrued gross interest and penalties of $1,123 as of September 30, 2017 and $1,273 as of September 30, 2016.
 Woodward’s tax returns are subject to audits by U.S. federal, state, and foreign tax authorities, and these audits are at various stages of completion at any given time.  Reviews of tax matters by authorities and lapses of the applicable statutes of limitations may result in changes to tax expense.  Fiscal years remaining open to examination in significant foreign jurisdictions include 2008 and thereafter.  Woodward’s fiscal years remaining open to examination in the United States include fiscal years 2014 and thereafter.  Woodward is currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for fiscal year 2014.  Woodward has concluded U.S. federal income tax examinations through fiscal year 2012.  Woodward is generally subject to U.S. state income tax examinations for fiscal years 2012 and the periods thereafter.
     Note 17.  Retirement benefits
 Woodward provides various retirement benefits to eligible members of the Company, including contributions to various defined contribution plans, pension benefits associated with defined benefit plans, postretirement medical benefits and postretirement life insurance benefits.  Eligibility requirements and benefit levels vary depending on employee location.
 Defined contribution plans
 Most of the Company’s U.S. employees are eligible to participate in the U.S. defined contribution plan.  The U.S. defined contribution plan allows employees to defer part of their annual income for income tax purposes into their personal 401(k) accounts.  The Company makes matching contributions to eligible employee accounts, which are also deferred for employee personal income tax purposes.  Certain foreign employees are also eligible to participate in similar foreign plans.
 Most of Woodward’s U.S. employees with at least two years of service receive an annual contribution of Woodward stock, equal to 5% of their eligible prior year wages, to their personal Woodward Retirement Savings Plan accounts.  In the second quarter of fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, Woodward fulfilled its annual Woodward stock contribution obligation using shares held in treasury stock by issuing 199 shares of common stock for a value of $14,014 in fiscal year 2017, 317 shares of common stock for a value of $13,999 in fiscal year 2016, and 259 shares of common stock for a value of $12,574 in fiscal year 2015.  The Woodward Retirement Savings Plan (the “WRS Plan”) held 4,183 shares of Woodward stock as of September 30, 2017 and 4,488 shares as of September 30, 2016.  The shares held in the WRS Plan participate in dividends and are considered issued and outstanding for purposes of calculating basic and diluted earnings per share.  Accrued liabilities included obligations to contribute shares of Woodward common stock to the WRS Plan of $11,355 as of September 30, 2017 and $11,314 as of September 30, 2016.
 The amount of expense associated with defined contribution plans was as follows:

﻿ | | Year Ended September 30,
﻿ | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015 
Company costs | $ | 32,008 | | $ | 31,893 | $ | 30,933

  ﻿
 Defined benefit plans
 Woodward has defined benefit plans that provide pension benefits for certain retired employees in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan.  Woodward also provides other postretirement benefits to its employees including postretirement medical benefits and life insurance benefits.  Postretirement medical benefits are provided to certain current and retired employees and their covered dependents and beneficiaries in the United States and the United Kingdom.  Life insurance benefits are provided to certain retirees in the United States under frozen plans, which are no longer available to current employees.  A September 30 measurement date is utilized to value plan assets and obligations for all of Woodward’s defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans.
 During the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, Woodward opened a lump-sum buy-out window, which closed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 and was fully settled during the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, for certain former U.S. employees and/or their dependents eligible to receive postretirement defined benefit pension payments for past employment services to the Company.  Eligible pension plan participants were provided the opportunity to elect to receive a one-time lump-sum payment or an immediate annuity in lieu of future pension benefit payments.  Pension benefit payments paid from available pension plan assets under the lump-sum buy-out options were $670 during fiscal year 2017.  Woodward expects to make no further pension benefit payments under the lump-sum buy-out options. 


 
80

Effective June 30, 2015, the Company terminated the defined benefit pension plan for employees at its Duarte, California manufacturing facility (the “Duarte Pension Plan”).  The plan, which was established in fiscal year 2013 in connection with the December 2012 acquisition of the Duarte business, was amended in fiscal year 2013 to cease all future benefit accruals under the plan and was at that time closed to new entrants.  Regulatory approval of the plan termination was received in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016.  In exchange for the freeze and termination of the plan, which were agreed upon through negotiations with the applicable employee union, the employees were provided replacement benefits through full participation in the Woodward U.S. defined contribution plan.  Woodward recorded settlement costs of $47 in fiscal year 2016 in connection with cash payouts to the beneficiaries of the plan and associated termination costs.  As of September 30, 2017 and 2016, Woodward had no liability associated with the Duarte Pension Plan.  
 In addition to the Duarte Pension Plan, excluding the Woodward HRT Plan, the defined benefit plans in the United States were frozen in fiscal year 2007 and no additional employees may participate in the U.S. plans and no additional service costs will be incurred.

 The actuarial assumptions used in measuring the net periodic benefit cost and plan obligations of retirement pension benefits were as follows:

Long-term rate of return on plan assets | 7.38 | | | 7.62 | | 7.62 | 

  The discount rate assumption is intended to reflect the rate at which the retirement benefits could be effectively settled based upon the assumed timing of the benefit payments. 
 In the United States, Woodward uses a bond portfolio matching analysis based on recently traded, non-callable bonds rated AA or better that have at least $50 million outstanding to determine the benefit obligations at year end.

 In the United Kingdom and Japan, Woodward uses a high-quality corporate bond yield curve matched with separate cash flows to develop a single rate to determine the single rate equivalent to settle the entire benefit obligations in each jurisdiction.  For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, the discount rate used to determine periodic service cost and interest cost components of the overall benefit costs was based on spot rates derived from the same high-quality corporate bond yield curve used to determine the September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, benefit obligation matched with separate cash flows for each future year.  Prior to this change in method, the discount rate used to determine the periodic benefit costs for the year ending September 30, 2015 was based on a single rate equivalent.
 Compensation increase assumptions, where applicable, are based upon historical experience and anticipated future management actions.
 In determining the long-term rate of return on plan assets, Woodward assumes that the historical long-term compound growth rates of equity and fixed-income securities will predict the future returns of similar investments in the plan portfolio.  Investment management and other fees paid out of the plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions.
 Mortality assumptions are based on published mortality studies developed primarily based on past experience of the broad population and modified for projected longevity trends.  The projected benefit obligations in the United States as of September 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016 and 2015 were based on the Society of Actuaries (“SOA”) RP-2014 Mortality Tables Report projected back to 2006 using the SOA’s Mortality Improvement Scale MP-2014 (“MP-2014”) and projected forward using a custom projection scale based on MP-2014 with a 10-year convergence period and a long-term rate of 0.75%.  As of September 30, 2017, 2016, and 2015, mortality assumptions in Japan were based on the Standard rates 2014, and mortality assumptions for the United Kingdom pension scheme were based on the Self-administered pension scheme (“SAPS”) S2 “all” tables with a projected 1.5% annual improvement rate.

  Woodward expects its pension plan contributions in fiscal year 2018 will be $397 in the United Kingdom and $217 in Japan.  Woodward expects to have no pension plan contributions in fiscal year 2018 in the United States.
 Pension plan assets
 The overall investment objective of the pension plan assets is to earn a rate of return over time which, when combined with Company contributions, satisfies the benefit obligations of the pension plans and maintains sufficient liquidity to pay benefits. 
 As the timing and nature of the plan obligations varies for each Company sponsored pension plan, investment strategies have been individually designed for each pension plan with a common focus on maintaining diversified investment portfolios that provide for long-term growth while minimizing the risk to principal associated with short-term market behavior.  The strategy for each of the plans balances the requirements to generate returns, using investments expected to produce higher returns, such as equity securities, with the need to control risk within the pension plans using less volatile investment assets, such as debt securities.  A strategy of more equity-oriented allocation is adopted for those plans which have a longer-term investment plan based on the timing of the associated benefit obligations.  
 A pension oversight committee is assigned by the Company to each pension plan.  Among other responsibilities, each committee is responsible for all asset class allocation decisions.  Asset class allocations, which are reviewed by the respective pension committee on at least an annual basis, are designed to meet or exceed certain market benchmarks and align with each plan’s investment objectives.  In evaluating the asset allocation choices, consideration is given to the proper long-term level of risk for each plan, particularly with respect to the long-term nature of each plan’s liabilities, the impact of asset allocation on investment results and the corresponding impact on the volatility and magnitude of plan contributions and expense and the impact certain actuarial techniques may have on the plans’ recognition of investment experience.  From time to time, the plans may move outside the prescribed asset class allocation in order to meet significant liabilities with respect to one or more individuals approaching retirement.  
 Risks associated with the plan assets include interest rate fluctuation risk, market fluctuation risk, risk of default by debt issuers and liquidity risk.  To manage these risks, the assets are managed by established, professional investment firms and performance is evaluated regularly by the Company’s pension oversight committee against specific benchmarks and each plan’s investment objectives.  Liability management and asset class diversification are central to the Company’s risk management approach and overall investment strategy. 
 The assets of the U.S. plans are invested in actively managed mutual funds.  The assets of the plans in Japan and the plan in the United Kingdom are invested in actively managed pooled investment funds.  Each individual mutual fund or pooled investment fund has been selected based on the investment strategy of the related plan, which mirrors a specific asset class within the associated target allocation.  Pension plan assets at September 30, 2017 and 2016 do not include any direct investment in Woodward’s common stock.

The asset allocations are monitored and rebalanced regularly by investment managers assigned to the individual pension plans.  The actual allocations of pension plan assets and target allocation ranges by asset class, are as follows:

Cash and cash equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents held by the Company's pension plans are held on deposit with creditworthy financial institutions.  The fair value of the cash and cash equivalents are based on the quoted market price of the respective currency in which the cash is maintained.
 Pension assets invested in mutual funds: The assets of the Company’s U.S. pension plans are invested in various mutual funds which invest in both equity and debt securities.  The fair value of the mutual funds is determined based on the quoted market price of each fund.
 Pension assets invested in pooled funds: The assets of the Company’s Japan and United Kingdom pension plans are invested in pooled investment funds, which include both equity and debt securities.  The assets of the United Kingdom pension plan are invested in index-linked pooled funds which aim to replicate the movements of an underlying market index to which the fund is linked.  Fair value of the pooled funds is based on the net asset value of shares held by the plan as reported by the fund sponsors.  All pooled funds held by plans outside of the United States are considered to be invested in international equity and debt securities.  Although the underlying securities may be largely domestic to the plan holding the investment assets, the underlying assets are considered international from the perspective of the Company. 
 There were no transfers into or out of Level 3 assets in fiscal years 2017 or 2016.
 Other postretirement benefit plans
 Woodward provides other postretirement benefits to its employees including postretirement medical benefits and life insurance benefits.  Postretirement medical benefits are provided to certain current and retired employees and their covered dependents and beneficiaries in the United States and the United Kingdom.  Benefits include the option to elect company provided medical insurance coverage to age 65 and a Medicare supplemental plan after age 65.  Life insurance benefits are also provided to certain retirees in the United States under frozen plans which are no longer available to current employees.  A September 30 measurement date is utilized to value plan assets and obligations for Woodward’s other postretirement benefit plans.  
 The postretirement medical benefit plans, other than the plan assumed in an acquisition in fiscal year 2009, were frozen in fiscal year 2006 and no additional employees may participate in the plans.  Generally, employees who had attained age 55 and had rendered 10 or more years of service before the plans were frozen were eligible for these postretirement medical benefits. 
 Certain participating retirees are required to contribute to the plans in order to maintain coverage.  The plans provide postretirement medical benefits for approximately 770 retired employees and their covered dependents and beneficiaries and may provide future benefits to 13 active employees and their covered dependents and beneficiaries, upon retirement, if the employees elect to participate.  Six beneficiaries participate in the United Kingdom plan.  All the postretirement medical plans are fully insured for retirees who have attained age 65.
 The actuarial assumptions used in measuring the net periodic benefit cost and plan obligations of postretirement benefits were as follows:
 ﻿

﻿ | | | | | | | 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------+---+------+------+------+------+--
﻿ | | | | | | | 
﻿ | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015
Weighted-average discount rate used to determine benefit obligation at September 30 | 3.78 | % | | 3.63 | % | 4.01 | %
Weighted-average discount rate used to determine net periodic benefit cost for years ended September 30 | 3.63 | | | 4.01 | | 4.40 | 

  The discount rate assumption is intended to reflect the rate at which the postretirement benefits could be effectively settled based upon the assumed timing of the benefit payments.  
 In the United States, Woodward used a bond portfolio matching analysis based on recently traded, non-callable bonds rated AA or better that have at least $50 million outstanding to determine the benefit obligations at year end.  
 In the United Kingdom, Woodward uses a high-quality corporate bond yield curve matched with separate cash flows to develop a single rate to determine the single rate equivalent to settle the entire benefit obligations in each jurisdiction.  For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016, the discount rate used to determine periodic service cost and interest cost components of the overall benefit costs was based on spot rates derived from the same high-quality corporate bond yield curve used to determine the September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, benefit obligation matched with separate cash flows for each future year.

Mortality assumptions are based on published mortality studies developed primarily based on past experience of the broad population and modified for projected longevity trends.  The projected benefit obligations in the United States as of September 30, 2017, 2016, and 2015 were based on the SOA’s RP-2014 Mortality Tables Report projected back to 2006 using the SOA’s MP-2014 and projected forward using a custom projection scale based on MP-2014 with a 10-year convergence period and a long-term rate of 0.75%.  As of September 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016, mortality assumptions for the United Kingdom postretirement medical plan were based on the SAPS S2 “all” tables with a projected 1.5% annual improvement rate.
 Assumed healthcare cost trend rates at September 30, were as follows:
 ﻿

﻿ | | | | | 
--------------------------------------------------------+------+---+------+------+--
﻿ | | | | | 
﻿ | 2017 | | 2016
Health care cost trend rate assumed for next year | 6.75 | % | | 7.00 | %
Rate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline | | | | | 
(the ultimate trend rate) | 5.00 | % | | 5.00 | %
Year that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate | 2025 | | | 2025 | 

  Healthcare costs have generally trended upward in recent years, sometimes by amounts greater than 5%.  Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for postretirement medical plans.  A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects:
 ﻿

﻿ | | | | | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+-------+-------------+---+--------
﻿ | | | | | 
﻿ | Change In Health Care Cost Trend Rate

Effect on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at September 30, 2017 | | 2,960 | | | (2,605)

  Net periodic benefit costs consist of the following components reflected as expense in Woodward’s Consolidated Statements of Earnings:

  Multiemployer defined benefit plans
 Woodward operates two multiemployer defined benefit plans for certain employees in the Netherlands and Japan.  The amounts of contributions associated with the multiemployer plans were as follows:
 ﻿

﻿ | | | | | | | 
----------------------+------+--------------------------+------+---+------+---+----

﻿ | | Year Ended September 30,
﻿ | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015
Company contributions | $ | 292 | | $ | 475 | $ | 600

  The plan in the Netherlands is a quasi-mandatory plan that covers all of Woodward’s employees in the Netherlands and is part of the Dutch national pension system.
 The Company may elect to withdraw from its multiemployer plan in Japan, although it has no plans to do so.  If the Company elects to withdraw from the Japanese plan, it would incur an immaterial one-time contribution cost.  Changes in Japanese regulations could trigger reorganization of or abolishment of the Japanese multiemployer plan, which could impact future funding levels.

Stock repurchase program
 In the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, Woodward’s Board of Directors terminated the Company’s prior stock repurchase program (the “Prior Repurchase Program”) and replaced it with a new program for the repurchase of up to $500,000 of Woodward’s outstanding shares of common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions over a three-year period that will end in 2019 (the “2016 Authorization”).  Under the 2016 Authorization, in fiscal year 2017, Woodward purchased 1,027 shares of its common stock for $71,197, of which 491 shares were purchased pursuant to 10b5-1 plans and 536 shares were purchased pursuant to a 10b-18 plan.
 In the third quarter of fiscal year 2015, Woodward entered into an ASR Agreement with Goldman under which Woodward repurchased shares of its common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $125,000.  A total of 2,506 shares of common stock were repurchased pursuant to the ASR Agreement under the Prior Repurchase Program.
 Under the Prior Repurchase Program, in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, Woodward executed a 10b5-1 plan to repurchase up to $125,000 of its common stock for a period that ended on April 20, 2016.  During fiscal year 2016, Woodward purchased 2,635 shares of its common stock for $125,000.
 Stock-based compensation
 Non-qualified stock option awards and restricted stock awards are granted to key management members and directors of the Company.  The grant date for these awards is used for the measurement date.  Vesting would be accelerated in the event of retirement, disability, or death of a participant, or change in control of the Company, as defined in the individual stock option agreements.  These awards are valued as of the measurement date and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite vesting period for all awards, including awards with graded vesting.  Stock for exercised stock options and for restricted stock awards is issued from treasury stock shares.
 Provisions governing outstanding stock option awards are included in the 2006 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2006 Plan”) and the 2002 Stock Option Plan (the “2002 Plan”).  The 2002 Plan provided that no further grants would be made after December 31, 2006.  The 2006 Plan, which was approved by Woodward’s stockholders and became effective January 25, 2006, expired in fiscal year 2016, therefore, no further grants will be made under the 2006 Plan.  
 The 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2017 Plan”) was approved by Woodward’s stockholders in January 2017 and is a successor plan to the 2006 Plan.  As of September 14, 2016, the effective date of the 2017 Plan, Woodward’s Board of Directors delegated authority to administer the 2017 Plan to the compensation committee of the board (the “Committee”), including, but not limited to, the power to determine the recipients of awards and the terms of those awards.  The Committee approved issuance of options under the 2017 Plan, with an award date of October 3, 2016 conditional and subject to approval of the 2017 Plan by the stockholders.  The stock options conditionally awarded under the 2017 Plan were not granted or outstanding for accounting purposes prior to stockholder approval of the 2017 Plan, and as such no stock-based compensation expense was recognized on these stock options during the three-months ended December 31, 2016.  Stock-based compensation expense recognized on these stock options for the nine-months ended September 30, 2017 includes recognition of the elapsed service period of these stock options from October 3, 2016 through September 30, 2017. 
 Stock-based compensation expense recognized was as follows:

  Stock options
 Woodward’s 2017 Plan, which was approved by Woodward’s stockholders, provides for the grant of up to 2,000 shares of Woodward’s common stock, including in the form of stock options to its employees and directors.  To date, equity awards under the 2017 Plan have consisted of grants of stock options to Woodward employees and directors.  Woodward believes that these stock options align the interests of its employees and directors with those of its stockholders.  Stock option awards are granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of Woodward’s stock at the date of grant, a ten-year term, and generally a four-year vesting schedule at a rate of 25% per year.


 
92

The date of grant for stock options is the date when the grants become unconditionally awarded and an employer and grantee reach a mutual understanding of the key terms and conditions of the grant.  Stock options awarded as of October 3, 2016 were conditional and subject to the approval of the 2017 Plan by the stockholders.  As such, those awards have a date of grant for accounting purposes of January 25, 2017, the date the 2017 Plan was approved by stockholders.  
 The fair value of options granted is estimated as of the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-valuation model using the assumptions in the following table.  Woodward calculates the expected term, which represents the average period of time that stock options granted are expected to be outstanding, based upon historical experience of plan participants.  Expected volatility is based on historical volatility using daily stock price observations.  The estimated dividend yield is based upon Woodward’s historical dividend practice and the market value of its common stock.  The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. treasury yield curve, for periods within the contractual life of the stock option, at the time of grant.

  Restricted Stock
 In the first quarter of fiscal year 2014, Woodward granted an award of 24 shares of restricted stock under the 2006 Plan to its Chief Executive Officer and President, Thomas A. Gendron, pursuant to a form restricted stock agreement approved by Woodward’s Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.  Subject to Mr. Gendron’s continued employment by the Company, 100% of these shares of restricted stock would have vested following the end of the Company’s fiscal year 2017 if a specified cumulative earnings per share (“EPS”) target was met or exceeded for fiscal years 2014 through 2017. The cumulative EPS target for fiscal years 2014 through 2017 was not met, and therefore the restricted stock was forfeited by Mr. Gendron as of September 30, 2017.

 Stock-based compensation cost
 Woodward recognizes stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.  Pursuant to form stock option agreements used by the Company, with terms approved by the administrator of the applicable plan, the requisite service period can be less than the four-year vesting period based on the grantee’s retirement eligibility.  As such, the recognition of stock-based compensation expense associated with some stock option grants can be accelerated to a period of less than four years, including immediate recognition of stock-based compensation expense on the date of grant.
 At September 30, 2017, there was approximately $8,823 of total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested stock-based compensation arrangements, both stock options and restricted stock awards, granted under the 2006 Plan (for which no further grants will be made) and stock options granted under the 2017 Plan.  The pre-vesting forfeiture rates for purposes of determining stock-based compensation expense recognized were estimated to be 0% for members of Woodward’s board of directors and 9% for all others.  The remaining unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 2 years.
 Note 19.  Commitments and contingencies
 Woodward has entered into operating leases for certain facilities, equipment, and software with terms in excess of one year under agreements that expire at various dates.  Some leases require the payment of property taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs in addition to rental payments.  Woodward has also entered into capital leases for equipment with terms in

  Woodward enters into unconditional purchase obligation arrangements (i.e. issuance of purchase orders, obligations to transfer funds in the future for fixed or minimum quantities of goods or services at fixed or minimum prices, such as "take-or-pay" contracts) in the normal course of business to ensure that adequate levels of sourced product are available to Woodward.

  The U.S. Government, and other governments, may terminate any of Woodward’s government contracts (and, in general, subcontracts) at their convenience, as well as for default based on specified performance measurements.  If any of Woodward’s government contracts were to be terminated for convenience, the Company generally would be entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs.  If any of Woodward’s government contracts were to be terminated for Woodward’s default, the U.S. Government generally would pay only for the work accepted, and could require Woodward to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to re-procure the contract items, net of the work accepted from the original contract.  The U.S. Government could also hold Woodward liable for damages resulting from the default.
 Woodward is currently involved in claims, pending or threatened litigation or other legal proceedings, investigations and/or regulatory proceedings arising in the normal course of business, including, among others, those relating to product liability claims, employment matters, worker’s compensation claims, contractual disputes, product warranty claims and alleged violations of various laws and regulations.  Woodward accrues for known individual matters where it believes that it is probable the matter will result in a loss when ultimately resolved using estimates of the most likely amount of loss.     Legal costs are expensed as incurred and are classified in “Selling, general and administrative expenses” on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.
 Woodward is partially self-insured in the United States for healthcare and worker’s compensation up to predetermined amounts, above which third party insurance applies.  Management regularly reviews the probable outcome of these claims and proceedings, the expenses expected to be incurred, the availability and limits of the insurance coverage, and the established accruals for liabilities. 


 
95

While the outcome of pending claims, legal and regulatory proceedings, and investigations cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that any liabilities that may result from these claims, proceedings and investigations will not have a material effect on Woodward's liquidity, financial condition, or results of operations.
 In the event of a change in control of Woodward, as defined in change-in-control agreements with its current corporate officers, Woodward may be required to pay termination benefits to such officers.
 Note 20.  Segment information
 Woodward serves the aerospace and industrial markets through its two reportable segments – Aerospace and Industrial.  When appropriate, Woodward’s reportable segments are aggregations of Woodward’s operating segments.  Woodward uses operating segment information internally to manage its business, including the assessment of operating segment performance and decisions for the allocation of resources between operating segments.
 The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those of the Company.  Woodward evaluates segment profit or loss based on internal performance measures for each segment in a given period.  In connection with that assessment, Woodward generally excludes matters such as certain charges for restructuring costs, interest income and expense, certain gains and losses from asset dispositions, or other non-recurring and/or non-operationally related expenses.
