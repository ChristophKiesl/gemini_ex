Our Company
We are a leading designer, manufacturer and marketer of a diverse range of recreational powerboats, including performance sport boats, sterndrive and outboard boats. We have the #1 market share position in the United States in the performance sport boat category through our Malibu and Axis Wake Research (“Axis”) brands. With our recent acquisition of Cobalt Boats, LLC (“Cobalt”) in July 2017, we also have the #1 market share position in the United States through our Cobalt brand in the 24’—29’ segment of the sterndrive category. Our boats are used for water sports, including water skiing, wakeboarding and wake surfing, as well as general recreational boating. We believe we have been a consistent innovator in the recreational powerboat industry, designing products that appeal to an expanding range of recreational boaters and water sports enthusiasts whose passion for boating and water sports is a key aspect of their lifestyle. We believe many of our innovations, such as our 
3

proprietary Surf Gate technology launched in 2012, expand the market for our products by introducing consumers to new and exciting recreational activities. We also added another strong brand in Cobalt with a versatile lineup of boats, further deepening our product portfolio, expanding our addressable market, and ultimately, our ability to provide consumers with a better customer-inspired experience. We believe that the performance, quality, value and multi-purpose features of our boats position us to achieve our goal of increasing our market share in the expanding recreational boating industry.
We sell our boats under three brands—Malibu; Axis; and Cobalt. Our flagship Malibu boats offer our latest innovations in performance, comfort and convenience, and are designed for consumers seeking a premium performance sport boat experience. Retail prices of our Malibu boats typically range from $50,000 to $180,000. We launched our Axis boats in 2009 to appeal to consumers who desire a more affordable performance sport boat product but still demand high performance, functional simplicity and the option to upgrade key features. Retail prices of our Axis boats typically range from $50,000 to $95,000. Our Cobalt boats consist of mid to large-sized luxury cruisers and bowriders that we believe offer the ultimate experience in comfort, performance and quality. Retail prices for our Cobalt boats typically range from $50,000 to $700,000.
 Our boats are constructed of fiberglass, available in a range of sizes, hull designs and propulsion systems (i.e., inboard, sterndrive and outboard). We employ experienced product development and engineering teams that enable us to offer a range of models across each of our brands while consistently introducing innovative features in our product offerings. Our engineering team closely collaborates with our manufacturing personnel in order to improve product quality and process efficiencies. The results of this collaboration are reflected in our receipt of numerous industry awards, including the "WSIA Innovation of Year" for the Malibu Command Center in 2017 and the Boating Industry's "Top Product Award" for the Integrated Surf Platform ("ISP") in 2016. 
We sell our boats through a dealer network that we believe is the strongest in the recreational powerboat industry. As of July 1, 2017, our Malibu and Axis brand distribution channel consisted of 126 independent dealers operating in 146 locations in North America and we had 59 independent dealer locations across 40 countries outside of North America, including Australia. Our Malibu and Axis brand boats are the exclusive performance sport boats offered by the majority of our dealers. Our acquisition of Cobalt has allowed us to expand into Cobalt’s strong network which consists of 111 independent dealers operating 142 locations worldwide with a large percentage of those dealers having the #1 or #2 market share in their respective markets. The acquisition of Cobalt has increased our total independent dealer network to over 300 locations globally. Our dealer base is an important part of our consumers’ experience, our marketing efforts and our brands. We devote significant time and resources to find, develop and improve the performance of our dealers and believe our dealer network gives us a distinct competitive advantage. 
Financial Information About Segments
We currently report our results of operations under two reportable segments called U.S. and Australia segments based on their respective geographic manufacturing footprints. Each segment participates in the manufacturing, distribution, marketing and sale of Malibu and Axis performance sport boats. The U.S. operating segment primarily serves markets in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia while the Australia operating segment principally serves the Australian and New Zealand markets. The segment and geographic information required herein is contained in Note 17 - Segment Reporting, in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.
We acquired Cobalt in July 2017, and as of the date of this report, we have not made a final assessment as to the number of reportable segments the Company will have in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 280, Segment Reporting, going forward. 
Our Market Opportunity
During calendar year 2016, retail sales of new recreational powerboats in the United States totaled $8.2 billion. Of the recreational powerboat categories defined and tracked by the NMMA, our core market corresponds most directly to the inboard ski/wakeboard category, which we refer to as the performance sport boat category. We serve this category through our Malibu, Axis and Cobalt brands. Through our Cobalt brand, we also now directly access the larger outboard and sterndrive categories, which together accounted for $5.5 billion in retail sales in calendar year 2016. Combined, our product portfolio allows us to meaningfully access an addressable market that represented nearly $6.6 billion of sales in 2016. The following table illustrates the size of our addressable market in units and retail sales for calendar year 2016:
4


Powerboat Category | Unit Sales | Retail Sales 
 | | (Dollars in millions)
Outboard | 160,900 | | $ | 4,659
Sterndrive | 12,200 | | 878 | 
Performance sport boat | 8,700 | | 818 | 
Jet boat | 5,000 | | 205 | 
Total addressable market | 186,800 | | $ | 6,560

We believe we are well-positioned to benefit from trends in our addressable market, including: 
Improving Macroeconomic Environment Driving Increased Consumer Demand for Boats. Following the economic downturn, the recreational powerboat industry has grown and is projected to continue to recover by the NMMA. While domestic sales of recreational powerboats in 2016 grew to approximately 186,800 units, they remained 37% below the historical peak 2006 sales volume of approximately 298,000 units. Within our primary category, performance sport boats, units grew to approximately 8,700 in 2016, 34% below the category's historical peak 2006 sales volume of 13,100, We believe there remains significant opportunity for growth from increased consumer demand in the recreational powerboat industry as the economy improves, but there are numerous variables that have potential to impact future growth.
Size and Strong Growth of Outboard Category. The outboard category of the recreational powerboat industry is the largest category, measured both by unit sales and retail sales. In 2016, outboard boats represented approximately 86% of total units sold and approximately 71% of total retail sales in the United States. Additionally, the outboard category has been one of the strongest performers of the recreational powerboat industry over the past several years. The chart below illustrates the performance of the outboard category based on retail sales since 2010, growing, on average, 7.7% in each of the past six years:
With our recent Cobalt acquisition, we now have a product line designed specifically to target the outboard category of the recreational powerboat industry. We believe the outboard category will continue to be the largest and one of the strongest categories of the recreational powerboat industry, and that significant opportunity remains for us to enhance our outboard product portfolio and dealer distribution network to capitalize on the outboard category’s performance.
5

Increasing Ages of Used Boats Driving New Boat Sales. In 2016, according to NMMA retail sales data, new recreational powerboats accounted for approximately one out of five recreational powerboat sales in the United States compared to an average of approximately one out of four between 2002 and 2008. We believe the shift toward purchasing more used boats during the economic downturn helped cause the average age of recreational powerboats in use to increase from 15 years in 1997 to over 21 years today. We believe that as the recreational powerboat industry continues its ongoing recovery and older boats reach the end of their usable lives, we expect consumer purchases of new boats to shift back toward historic levels benefiting new boat manufacturers.
Our Strengths
#1 Market Share Position in Performance Sport Boat Category. According to SSI, we have held the number one market share position, based on unit volume, in the United States among manufacturers of performance sport boats for calendar years since 2010 including 2016. We have grown our U.S. market share from 24.4% in 2010 to 33.0% in 2016. The following table reflects our U.S. market share in the performance sport boat category compared to the market share of our competitors for the periods shown: 

 | U.S. Market Share in Performance Sport Boat Category
Manufacturer/Brand(s) | 2010 | | 2011 | | 2012 | 2013 | | 2014 | | 2015 | 2016 
Malibu Boats/Malibu and Axis | 24.4 | % | | 29.0 | % | 30.8 | % | | 33.0 | % | 32.0 | % | 32.0 | % | 33.0 | %

(1) | In June 2015, Correct Craft acquired majority interest in both Centurion Boats and Supreme Boats. Accordingly, market share for Ski Supreme, Centurion, and Nautique Boat Company, Inc. ("Nautique") are reflected combined here for all periods for better comparison.

In addition, our 48% market share of performance sport boat exports to international markets for the 12 months ended March 31, 2017 was the highest among U.S. manufacturers and was more than the market share of our top two competitors combined.
#1 Market Share Position in the 24’—29’ Segment of the Sterndrive Boat Category. Our recent acquisition of Cobalt has established us as a market leader in the sterndrive category. According to SSI, our Cobalt brand holds the highest market share for sterndrive boats in the 24’—29’ segment, a segment that we believe is the largest segment within the overall sterndrive category by retail sales dollars. Since 2010, Cobalt has expanded its market share in this segment from 14.2% in 2010 to 29.2% in 2016. The following table reflects our U.S. market share in the 24’—29’ segment of the sterndrive boat category compared to the market share of our competitors for the periods shown (certain totals for the table below will not sum to exactly 100% due to rounding):

Industry-leading Product Design and Innovation. We believe that our innovation in the design of new boat models and new features has been a key to our success, helping us increase our market share within our categories and generally broaden the appeal of our products among recreational boaters. As a result of the features we have introduced, we believe that our boats are used for an increasingly wide range of activities and are increasingly easier to use, while maintaining the high performance characteristics that consumers expect. Additionally, by introducing new boat models in a range of price points, sizes, bow and hull designs, engine propulsion, and optional performance features, we believe we have enhanced consumers’ ability to select a boat suited to their individual preferences. Our commitment to, and consistency in, developing new boat models and introducing new features are reflected in several notable achievements, including: 

• | release of our patented Surf Gate technology in 2012, which allows users to surf on either side of the boat’s wake, generates a better quality surf wave and was the WSIA Innovation of the Year in 2013;


• | launch of the Axis brand of boats in 2009, designed from the ground up to be an entry-level product, which has already captured a 11.3% share of the U.S. market in our category as of December 31, 2016;


• | evolution of our patented Power Wedge, introduced in 2006 into the industry leading Integrated Surf Platform that includes an array of exclusive Malibu technology—Power Wedge II, Surf Gate, Surf Band and Command Center—and provides our consumers with the ability to customize the size and shape of their wakes and waves;


• | successful new model introductions each year. For model year 2017, we launched four new Malibu models: the Malibu Wakesetter 24 MXZ, the Malibu Wakesetter 22 MXZ, and the Malibu Wakesetter 21 VLX were all launched in the summer of 2016; and the Malibu Response TXi was launched in November of 2016. For model year 2017, five new Cobalt models were launched: the Gateway Series CS1, the A Series A36, the SD-SC Series 23SC and 25SC Outboards, and the WSS Surf Series CS3WSS Surf; and


• | a strong new expected product lineup for model year 2018 that includes a new Axis T22, a new Axis A24, an unidentified Malibu introduction and the launch of the new Wakesetter 23 LSV. In addition, Cobalt expects to announce three new models for model year 2018.

Focus on Vertical Integration Opportunities. We have vertically integrated several key components of our manufacturing process, including the manufacturing of boat trailers, towers and tower accessories, machined and billet parts, and tooling. Most recently, we announced an initiative to vertically integrate engine marinization for our Malibu and Axis brands. Vertical integration of key components of our boats gives us the ability to increase incremental margin per boat sold by reducing our cost base and improving the efficiency of our manufacturing process. Additionally, it allows us to have greater control over design, consumer customization options, construction quality, and our supply chain. For example, if our engine marinization initiative is implemented, our reliance on our two engine suppliers for Malibu and Axis will be significantly diminished, reducing the risk that a change in cost or production from any engine supplier could adversely affect our business. We continually review our manufacturing process to identify opportunities for additional vertical integration investments.
Intellectual Property. A key element of our growth and increased market share has been our intellectual property, which we believe is the best in our industry. Among the most innovative and sought after features on our boats has been Surf Gate. Together with Power Wedge and Surf Band, we believe that these patented technologies will continue to drive demand for our 
7

products and increased margins. With our acquisition of Cobalt, we have acquired additional valuable intellectual property, such as Swim Step, further increasing the appeal of our product portfolio. Consequently, there is an increased need to vigorously defend our patents and other intellectual property to ensure we maintain our competitive edge. Because of the appeal of these technologies, we have entered into agreements to license them to other manufacturers within the performance sport boat category. We believe licensing our products provides us with a significant strategic advantage over our competitors by allowing us to expand into other markets and broadening the appeal of these technologies into segments that would not otherwise have them, thereby eventually creating a path to a Malibu purchase.
Strong Dealer Network. We have worked diligently with our dealers to develop one of the strongest distribution networks in the recreational powerboat industry. We believe that our Malibu and Axis brand distribution network of 146 North American dealer locations and 59 international dealer locations as of July 1, 2017 allows us to distribute our performance sport boat products more broadly and effectively than our competitors. For calendar year 2016, our Malibu and Axis brand dealers held or tied for the #1 market share position for the performance sport boat category in 70 of 119 U.S. markets. Our Cobalt distribution network includes 142 worldwide dealer locations. Of those, 22 Cobalt dealers are ranked in Boating Industry’s Top 100 Dealers survey, with six Cobalt dealers ranked in the top 10. We continually review our geographic coverage to identify opportunities for expansion and improvement, and will, where necessary, add dealer locations to address previously underserved markets or replace underperforming dealers.
Highly Recognized Brands. We believe our Malibu, Axis and Cobalt brands are widely recognized in the recreational powerboat industry, which helps us reach a growing number of target consumers. For over 30 years, our Malibu brand has generated a loyal following of recreational boaters and water sports enthusiasts who value the brand’s premium performance and features. Our Axis brand has grown rapidly as consumers have been drawn to its more affordable price point and available optional features. Our newly-acquired Cobalt brand has developed into one of the industry’s most recognizable and respected brands over its 50-year history. We believe that the appeal of our superior performance and innovative products combined with our history with boating enthusiasts and professional water sports athletes contributes to our brand awareness with dealers and consumers. We are able to build on this brand recognition and support through a series of marketing initiatives coordinated with our dealers or executed directly by us. Our marketing efforts are conducted using an array of strategies, which include digital advertising, social media engagement, advertisements in endemic media and the sponsorship of grass-roots boating and watersport events. Additionally, our boats, their innovative features, our sponsored athletes and our dealers all frequently win industry awards, which we believe further boosts our brand recognition and reputation for excellence. We believe our marketing strategies and accomplishments enhance our profile in the industry, strengthen our credibility with consumers and dealers, and increase the appeal of our brands.
Diverse Product Offering. Our acquisition of Cobalt broadens our product portfolio, allowing us to engage consumers in multiple categories within the recreational powerboat industry. Malibu operates in the performance sport boat category, controlling the highest market share. Cobalt is the market leader in the 24’—29’ segment of the sterndrive category, and has recently expanded its product portfolio beyond traditional sterndrive boats with the introduction of its wake surfing and outboard product lines, increasing Cobalt’s addressable market. Overall, we believe our acquisition of Cobalt diversifies our product offering and consumer base, while simultaneously building a collectively stronger boat manufacturer.
Compelling Margins and Cash Flow. Our net income margin was 8.0% and 11.0% for fiscal years 2016 and 2017, respectively. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.1% and 19.8% for fiscal years 2016 and 2017, respectively. For the definition of adjusted EBITDA margin and a reconciliation to net income, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - GAAP Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” We also produced $35.6 million and $35.9 million of net cash from operating activities for fiscal years 2016 and 2017, respectively. We have previously executed, and continue to execute, on an array of initiatives focused on reducing our costs and improving the efficiency of our manufacturing process, enabling us to maintain attractive margins and strong cash flows. These efforts include vertical integration of engines, trailers, towers and tower accessories production, giving us the ability to increase incremental margin per boat sold. In addition, our low capital expenditure requirements and highly efficient working capital cycle have allowed us to generate significant excess cash flow from operations, excluding one-time litigation costs incurred in each of fiscal years 2016 and 2017. We believe our strong cash flow increases our financial stability and provides us with more flexibility to invest in growth initiatives. We further believe our experience implementing operational improvements and vertical integration initiatives to expand margin will positively impact the performance of our recently acquired Cobalt subsidiary. Significant opportunities for operational and financial improvement exist within the Cobalt business and include sourcing and procurement, lamination, assembly processes personnel management, and vertical integration. 
Highly Experienced Management Team. Our experienced management team has demonstrated its ability to navigate various economic cycles, identify, create and integrate new product innovations, improve financial performance, optimize operations, enhance our distribution model and recruit top industry talent. Our Chief Executive Officer, Jack Springer, joined Malibu Boats in 2009 and has assembled an executive team with strong, complementary talents and experience. This team has 
8

led a workforce that we believe has produced superior results, including market share gains, sales growth and profitability improvement.
Our Strategy 
We intend to capitalize on the recovery in the recreational powerboat industry through the following strategies: 
Continue to Develop New and Innovative Products in Our Categories. We intend to continue developing and introducing new and innovative products—both new boat models to better address a broader range of consumers and new features to deliver better performance, functionality, convenience, comfort and safety to our consumers. We believe that new products and features are important to the growth of our market share, the continued expansion of our categories and our ability to maintain attractive margins.
Our product development strategy consists of a two-pronged approach. First, we seek to introduce new boat models to target unaddressed or underserved segments of the recreational powerboat industry, while also updating and refreshing our existing boat models regularly. For example, we introduced Axis-branded boats starting in 2009 to address the entry-level segment of the performance sport boat category, we launched the Malibu Wakesetter MXZ product line in 2012 to enter the premium “picklefork” bow design segment of the performance sport boat category, and we released the Malibu M235 in 2016 to deliver luxury and performance in the ultra-premium segment of the performance sport boat category. Second, we seek to develop and integrate innovative new features into our boats, such as Surf Gate, Malibu Touch Command and Power Wedge. Over the past two years, we have continued these strategies by introducing eight new models, including three in the Axis line, and we have enhanced our optional feature offerings with the new Power Wedge II and the industry’s first 12-inch touchscreen dash system. For our 2017 model year, we released the Wakesetter 22 MXZ, the Wakesetter 24 MXZ, the Wakesetter 21VLX and the Malibu Response TXi. We intend to continue releasing new products and features multiple times during the year, which we believe enhances our reputation as a leading-edge boat manufacturer and provides us with a competitive advantage. For our 2018 model year, which began July 1, 2017, we released the newly redesigned Wakesetter 23 LSV, Axis T22 and the Axis A24 and, in November 2017, we expect to launch a new Malibu model. In addition, our initiative to produce our own engines, announced in November 2016, is well underway and we expect to continue our vertical integration strategy focused on delivering better quality and value to our consumers while enhancing margins.
Our recent acquisition of Cobalt is consistent with this strategy, given Cobalt’s strong track record of producing innovative new products and refreshing existing boat models. Cobalt has established a leading market position in the sterndrive category, having progressively updated its portfolio with new models in line with emerging industry trends. In 2017, Cobalt launched a series of Cobalt-branded outboard propulsion models to expand its addressable market. Cobalt has been able to achieve growth in recent years partly by pivoting and expanding into the performance sport boat category through its new Cobalt Surf series, combining new surf features into successful preexisting CS3, R3, R5 and R7 models.
Further Strengthen Our Dealer Network. Our goal is to achieve and maintain leading market share in each of the categories in which we operate. We continually assess our distribution network and believe we take the actions necessary to achieve our goal. We intend to strengthen our current footprint by selectively recruiting market-leading dealers who currently sell our competitors’ products. In addition, we plan to continue expanding our dealer network in certain geographic areas to increase consumer access and service in strategic markets. Our recent acquisition of Cobalt improves our overall dealer network, as Cobalt distributes through a large percentage of dealers with #1 or #2 market share in their respective markets. We believe our targeted initiatives to enhance and grow our dealer network organically and our integration of Cobalt’s dealer network will increase unit sales in the future.
Continue to Seek Vertical Integration Opportunities. Over the past several years, we have focused on expanding our vertical integration capabilities, having brought in-house the production of towers and tower accessories, trailers, machined and billet parts, and, most recently, we announced an initiative to begin marinizing engines for our Malibu and Axis brand boats. Additional vertical integration opportunities exist, and we are aggressively monitoring these opportunities. With our recent acquisition of Cobalt, we believe opportunities exist to leverage Malibu’s vertical integration investments, including manufacturing towers and tower accessories, trailers, and machined and billet parts for Cobalt boats.
Selectively Pursue Strategic Acquisitions. One of our growth strategies is to drive growth in our business through targeted acquisitions that add value while considering our existing brands and product portfolio. We have focused on growth through acquisitions both domestically and abroad, as evidenced by our recent acquisition of Cobalt and our October 2014 acquisition of our Australian licensee. The primary objectives of our acquisitions are to expand our presence in new or adjacent categories, to expand into other product lines and business that may benefit from our operating strengths, and to increase the size of our addressable market. When we identify potential acquisitions, we attempt to target companies with a leading market share, strong cash flows, and an experienced management team and workforce that provide a fit with our existing operations. After completing an acquisition, we focus on integrating the company with our existing business to provide additional value to the 
9

combined entity through cost savings and revenue synergies, such as the optimization of manufacturing operations, improved processes around product development, enhancement of our existing dealer distribution network, administrative cost savings, shared procurement, vertical integration and cross-selling opportunities.
Accelerate International Expansion. Based on our U.S. leadership position, brand recognition, diverse, innovative product offering and distribution strengths, we believe that we are well-positioned to increase our international sales. Our 48% market share of performance sport boat exports to international markets for the twelve months ended March 31, 2017 was the highest among U.S. manufacturers and is supported by an extensive international distribution network of 59 international dealer locations for our Malibu and Axis brand boats. We believe we can increase our international sales both by promoting our products in developed markets where we have a well-established dealer base, such as Western Europe, and by penetrating new and emerging markets where we expect rising consumer incomes to increase demand for recreational products, such as Asia and South America. Our recent acquisition of Cobalt also expands the product offering that we may offer to dealers and allows us the ability to cross-sell into our existing dealer networks where appropriate.
Our Products and Brands
We design, manufacture and sell recreational powerboats, including performance sport boats, sterndrive and outboard boats, that we believe deliver superior performance for general recreational purposes with a significant focus on water sports, including wakeboarding, water skiing and wake surfing. We market our boats under three brands: 

• | Malibu, our flagship brand, dates to our inception in 1982, primarily targeting consumers seeking a premium boating experience and offering our latest innovations in performance, comfort and convenience;


• | Axis, which we launched as a new brand in 2009, targets a younger demographic and provides them with a more affordably priced, entry-level boat that provides high performance, functional simplicity and the option to upgrade key features; and


• | Cobalt, which we acquired in July 2017, has built a longstanding culture of excellence throughout its 50-year history by providing a range of luxury sterndrive and outboard boats.

In addition, we offer various accessories and aftermarket parts. 
Boat Models 
We believe our boats are renowned for their performance, design, innovative technology, quality and ability to provide consumers a high-quality boating experience at varying price points. We currently offer a number of recreational powerboat models across our three brands, which provide consumers with a variety of options across length, hull type, bow type, horsepower and seating capacity in addition to customizable designs and features available for upgrade across our models. The following table provides an overview of our most popular product offerings by brand: 
Brand | Number ofModels | Lengths | Propulsion Types | Bow Types | Retail PriceRange(In thousands)
Malibu | 11 | 20'-25' | Inboard | Traditional, Picklefork | $50-$180 
Axis | 5 | 20’-24’ | Inboard | Traditional,Picklefork | $50-$95 
Cobalt | 18 | 20’-40’ | Sterndrive/Outboard | Traditional | $50-$700 


• | Malibu Brand. Malibu is our flagship line of performance sport boats offering eleven models through three product series: the Wakesetter series, the M series, and the Response series. The Wakesetter series is our premium, top selling series designed for consumers seeking the highest-performance water sport boat and a luxury boating experience. Wakesetters offer consumers a highly-customizable boat with our most innovative technologies and premium features, with the newest color options and interior finishes. The M series, featuring the Malibu M235, is our line of ultra-premium towboats, built from the ground up by a team of our designers, engineers, and athletes, and designed to provide consumers with a seamless blend of beauty, luxury, and power. The M series is loaded with every technologically innovative feature we offer including our Integrated Surf Platform, premium luxury interiors, most advanced helm in the industry, and our most powerful engine. The Response series, completely redesigned in 2017, was designed for consumers who desire a high-performance water ski focused boat. Primarily because of its direct 

10

drive engine setup, the Response series produces the smallest wake of any of our boats and is designed to accommodate both professional and recreational skiers by allowing for an athlete’s best performance at a range of boat speeds and line lengths.

• | Axis Brand. After the continued success with our Wakesetter series, we identified a market opportunity in entry-level performance sport boats and, in 2009, launched our Axis brand. We designed Axis for consumers who desire a lower price point, but who still demand high performance, functional simplicity and the option to upgrade their boats to have key features such as Surf Gate. The Axis series currently has five available models and we plan to refine these models continually as well as add new ones as we build out the brand. We believe the Axis series successfully provides consumers with a high quality water sport and boating experience at an attractive price, as evidenced by its #4 market position in the performance sport boat category after only seven years on the market.


• | Cobalt Brand. Cobalt is our premium line of luxury sterndrive and outboard boats available in five product lines: the Gateway Series, the R series, the A series, the SD-SC series, and the WSS/Surf Series. The Gateway series is an entry level fiberglass sterndrive boat designed for budget-conscious consumers who desire the refined quality of Cobalt boats, but at shorter lengths and a lower price point. The Gateway series is designed to allow for the comfort, convenience, and performance typically found on much larger Cobalt boats while allowing for an “athletic” use. The R series, the brand’s largest segment, is a mid-range premium fiberglass sterndrive boat constructed using a composite Kevlar and a Z-thane barrier coat that blends a sleek, powerful look with a smooth ride and exceptional performance. The combination of innovative features, performance, and design have enabled Cobalt to achieve the #1 market share with the R5. The A series is our super premium fiberglass sterndrive boat line constructed using a multi-part hull mold in composite Kevlar and with a Z-thane barrier coat that blends yacht-like qualities with a unique, powerful look as well as a smooth ride and exceptional performance. The SD-SC series includes outboard boats designed for increased saltwater durability and ease of maintenance to better penetrate saltwater markets. The WSS Surf series is an offering focused on watersports and is based on our Gateway Series and R Series featuring a sport tower for higher tow point, storage racks, integrated billet board racks, optional tower lights, ballast, surf systems and directional speakers with a look designed to appeal to our younger customers. 

Innovative Features 
In addition to the standard features included on all of our boats, we offer consumers the ability to upgrade our base models by adding certain of our full line of innovative features designed to enhance performance, functionality and the overall boating experience. We believe our innovative features drive our high average selling prices. Some of these include: 

• | Surf Gate. Introduced in July 2012 and initially patented in September 2013, Surf Gate is available as an optional feature on all Malibu Wakesetter models and Axis brand boats. Surf Gate has revolutionized the increasingly popular sport of wake surfing. Prior to Surf Gate, boaters needed to empty ballast tanks on one side of the boat and shift passengers around to lean the boat to create a larger, more pronounced surf-quality wake. By employing precisely engineered and electronically controlled panels, Surf Gate alleviates this time-consuming and cumbersome process, allowing boaters to easily surf behind an evenly weighted boat without the need to wait for ballast changes. Recent enhancements to Surf Gate have improved upon the system’s actuators, allowing for easier and faster transfer, as well as the installation of an indicator horn and optional light signaling, which alert riders to wave transfers. For the 2016 model year, we introduced our patented Surf Band technology that allows the rider to control the surf wave, shape, size and side. In 2013, the Watersports Industry Association named Surf Gate as Innovation of the Year.


• | Manual Wedge/Power Wedge. Our patented Manual Wedge and Power Wedge allow riders to customize their wakes by simulating up to 1,200 pounds of ballast weight in the transom of their boats. Used in conjunction with Surf Gate, wake surfers are able to customize the size and shape of the wave. The Manual Wedge is available on all Malibu and Axis brand boats. Unlike our Manual Wedge, the Power Wedge, available exclusively on our Malibu line, is fully automated and integrated within the Malibu Touch Command system, increasing functionality and ease-of-use for the driver. Re-engineered for model year 2015, we released the Power Wedge II. It features a larger foil and a 21% surface-area increase, which equates to an additional 300 pounds of simulated ballast, for a total of 1,500 pounds of wake-creating water displacement. In addition, a new upward angle increases lift, allowing the driver to achieve a fully loaded boat planing much faster.


• | G3/G4 Tower. Our G3 Towers, available on Malibu brand boats, are fully customizable with speakers, power lights and racks, enhancing the overall style, performance and functionality of our boats. Our G3 Tower can easily be folded down by one person with its weightless, gas spring-assisted design, making the G3 Tower safe and easy to store. We are the only manufacturer of performance sport boats that produces towers in-house, allowing us to control this critical design element of our boats. For model year 2015, we offered a new G4 Tower featuring aerospace aluminum and an

11

internal honeycomb structure to provide the optimal strength-to-weight ratio, making the G4 three times more rigid than its predecessor. The new design contains automatic visible locks, a fully integrated wiring harness, Z5 Bimini compatibility, and zero pinch points. The new G4 has an aggressive design yet preserves ease of use by taking less than 30 pounds of force to lift, lower, and latch. 

• | Electronic Dashboard Controls. Every boat in our Wakesetter series is equipped with our MaliView and Malibu Touch Command ("MTC") systems, which function as an electronic command center that enhances the driver’s experience by providing simple and quick control of all systems on board, including the Power Wedge and Surf Gate systems, rider presets, music, lighting and navigation. For the model year 2015, we were first to market with a 12-inch touchscreen. It joined our seven-inch MTC to form the display for our new Command Center, giving the driver endless data in an easy-to-navigate interface. Every major feature is on the home screen, menu paths have been streamlined and each component meets IP60 water-intrusion standards. Built with more processing power, higher levels of integration, a feature-packed new operating system and powerful wireless connectivity, the new Command Center represents the most advanced screen technology available on performance sport boats.


• | Surf Band. Malibu’s exclusive, patented Surf Band allows a rider to strap a buoyant, hi-viz wristband and tap a simple, intuitive remote interface to take command of all aspects of the rider's surfing experience. At the same time, the interface enables the driver to monitor the rider through alerts on the electronic command center, eliminating the need for hand-signals to the spotters or driver. If the rider is wakeboarding, the Surf Band lets the rider adjust the Power Wedge II and control speed.


• | Swim Step. Cobalt's patented Swim Step deploys and retracts in seconds. It is outfitted in electropolished 316 stainless steel. The design provides a safe anchor for all water borne activities.


• | TrueWave. Every boat in Cobalt’s WSS Surf line comes with TrueWave technology, a feature that is currently patent pending. TrueWave is an automated control surf system that adjusts the bi-axis surf tabs to create the optimum surf wake either on the left or right side. TrueWave creates a fully customizable wake that provides smooth transitions, a wide push zone, and a solid pop, helping keep the boat evenly weighted and allows boaters to switch from each side in seconds without the need to re-distribute ballast and people.

We also offer an array of less technological, but nonetheless value-added boat features such as gelcoat upgrades, upholstery upgrades, engine drivetrain enhancements (such as silent exhaust tips, propeller upgrades and closed cooling engine configuration), sound system upgrades, Bimini tops, boat covers and trailers which further increase the level of customization afforded to consumers. 
Our Dealer Network 
We rely on independent dealers to sell our products. We establish performance criteria that our dealers must meet as part of their dealer agreements to ensure our dealer network remains the strongest in the industry. As a member of our network, dealers in North America may qualify for floor plan financing programs, rebates, seasonal discounts, promotional co-op payments and other allowances. We believe our Malibu and Axis dealer network is the most extensive in the performance sport boat category. We recently established a floor plan financing program for our dealers in Europe, which we expect will strengthen our dealers ability to sell our products in Europe. The majority of our Malibu and Axis dealers, including nine in our top ten markets, are exclusive to Malibu and Axis brand boats within the performance sport boat category, highlighting the commitment of our key dealers to our boats. Similarly, many Cobalt dealers have long-standing relationships with Cobalt and derive a significant portion of their income from the Cobalt brand.
North America 
In North America, we had a total of 146 dealer locations for our Malibu and Axis brands as of July 1, 2017. Of these locations, 17% sell our products exclusively, 65% are multi-line locations that only carry non-competitive brands and products and 17% sell our brands as well as other performance sport boat brands. Approximately 32% of our Malibu and Axis dealer locations have been with us for over ten years. For calendar year 2016, our Malibu and Axis dealers held or tied for the #1 market share position for the performance sport boat category in 70 of 119 U.S. markets. In July 2017, we acquired Cobalt and added their dealership network. Our Cobalt distribution network includes 115 North American dealer locations. Of those, 22 Cobalt dealers are ranked in Boating Industry’s Top 100 Dealers survey, with six Cobalt dealers ranked in the top 10.
We consistently review our distribution network to identify opportunities to expand our geographic footprint and improve our coverage of the market. We have the ability to opportunistically add new dealers and new dealer locations to previously underserved markets and use data and performance metrics to monitor dealer performance. We believe our outstanding dealer network allows us to distribute our products more efficiently than our competitors.
12

We do not have a significant concentration of sales among our dealers. For fiscal year 2017, our top ten Malibu and Axis brand dealers accounted for 40.6% of our units sold and none of our dealers accounted for more than 6.8% of our total sales volume. 
We believe that our strong market position in each region of the United States will help us capitalize on growth opportunities as our industry continues to recover from the economic downturn. In particular, we expect to generate continued growth in the southwestern United States (which includes California), a region that experienced the most pronounced decline in sales of new performance sport boats and where we have our highest regional market share. 
International
We have an extensive international distribution network for our Malibu, Axis, and Cobalt brands. As of July 1, 2017, we had 59 international dealer locations in 40 countries, including Europe, Asia, Middle East, South America, South Africa, and Australia/New Zealand for our Malibu and Axis brands. We service our independent dealers in the Australian and New Zealand markets through our Australian operations acquired in October 2014. Including our Australia operations, international unit volumes for Malibu and Axis brands accounted for approximately 9.0% and 8.0% of our total unit volume for fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our Cobalt brand, which was acquired in July 2017, has 27 dealer locations in 24 countries, including Europe, South America, South Africa, Australia, and China. 
Dealer Management 
Our relationship with our dealers is governed through dealer agreements. Each dealer agreement has a finite term lasting between one and three years. Our dealer agreements also are typically terminable without cause by the dealer at any time and by us with 90 days’ prior notice. We may also generally terminate these agreements immediately for cause upon certain events. Pursuant to our dealer agreements, the dealers typically agree to, among other things: 

• | represent our products at specified boat shows;


• | market our products only to retail end users in a specific geographic territory;


• | promote and demonstrate our products to consumers;


• | place a specified minimum number of orders of our Malibu, Axis and/or Cobalt brand products during the term of the agreement in exchange for rebate eligibility that varies according to the level of volume they commit to purchase;


• | provide us with regular updates regarding the number and type of our products in their inventory;


• | maintain a service department to service our products, and perform all appropriate warranty service and repairs; and


• | indemnify us for certain claims.

Our dealer network, including all additions, renewals, non-renewals or terminations, is managed by our sales personnel. Our Malibu and Axis sales team operates using a semi-annual dealer review process involving our senior management team. Each individual dealer is reviewed semi-annually with a broad assessment across multiple key elements, including the dealer’s geographic region, market share and customer service ratings, to identify underperforming dealers for remediation and to manage the transition process when non-renewal or termination is a necessary step. The Cobalt sales team manages their dealer network in a similar manner that is less formal than our Malibu and Axis process.
We have developed a system of financial incentives for our dealers based on customer satisfaction and achievement of best practices. Our brands employ dealer incentive programs that have been refined through decades of experience at each brand and may, from time to time, include the following elements:

• | Rebates and Discount. Our dealers agree to annual commitment volumes that places each dealer into a certain rebate or discount tier and determines its prospective rebate or discount amount. The structure of the dealer incentive depends on the brand represented. If a dealer meets its annual commitment volume as well as other terms of the rebate program, the dealer is entitled to the specified amounts subject to full compliance with our programs. Failure to meet the commitment volume or other terms of the program may result in partial or complete forfeiture of the dealer’s rebate or discount.


• | Co-op. Dealers of the Malibu and Axis product line may earn certain co-op reimbursements upon reaching a specified level of qualifying expenditures.


• | Free flooring. Our dealers that take delivery of current model year boats in the offseason, typically July through spring, are entitled to have us pay the interest to floor the boat until the earlier of (1) the retail sale of the unit or (2) a date near the end

13

of the current model year. This program is an additional incentive to encourage dealers to order in the offseason and helps us balance our seasonal production. 
Our dealer incentive programs are also structured to promote more evenly distributed ordering throughout the fiscal year, which allows us to achieve better level-loading of our production and thereby generate plant operating efficiencies. In addition, these programs may offer further rewards for dealers who are exclusive to our brands. 
Floor Plan Financing
Our North American dealers often purchase boats through floor plan financing programs with third-party floor plan financing providers. During fiscal year 2017, approximately 88% of our domestic shipments were made pursuant to floor plan financing programs through which our dealers participate. These programs allow dealers across our brands to establish lines of credit with third-party lenders to purchase inventory. Under these programs, a dealer draws on the floor plan facility upon the purchase of our boats and the lender pays the invoice price of the boats. As is typical in our industry, we have entered into repurchase agreements with certain floor plan financing providers to our dealers. Under the terms of these arrangements, in the event a lender repossesses a boat from a dealer that has defaulted on its floor financing arrangement and is able to deliver the repossessed boat to us, we are obligated to repurchase the boat from the lender. Our obligation to repurchase such repossessed products for the unpaid balance of our original invoice price for the boat is subject to reduction or limitation based on the age and condition of the boat at the time of repurchase, and in certain cases by an aggregate cap on repurchase obligations associated with a particular floor financing program. 
Our exposure under repurchase agreements with third-party lenders is mitigated by our ability to reposition inventory with a new dealer in the event that a repurchase event occurs. The primary cost to us of a repurchase event is any loss on the resale of a repurchased unit, which is often less than 10% of the repurchase amount. For fiscal year 2017, we did not repurchase any boats under our repurchase agreements. 
Marketing and Sales
We believe that providing a high level of service to our dealers and end consumers is essential to maintaining our reputation. Our sales personnel receive training on the latest Malibu, Axis and Cobalt products and technologies, as well as training on our competitors’ products and technologies, and attend trade shows to increase their market knowledge. This training is then passed along to our dealers to ensure a consistent marketing message and leverage our marketing expenditures. Malibu, Axis and Cobalt enjoy strong brand awareness, as evidenced by our substantial market share in their respective categories. 
Our marketing strategy focuses on strengthening and promoting the Malibu and Axis brands in the performance sport boat marketplace and the Cobalt brand in the outboard and sterndrive marketplaces. In addition to the Malibu, Axis and Cobalt websites and traditional marketing channels such as print advertising and tradeshows, we maintain an active digital advertising and social media platform for all brands, including use of Facebook and Twitter to increase brand awareness, foster loyalty and build a community of users. In addition, we benefit from various Cobalt, Malibu and Axis user-generated videos and photos that are uploaded to websites including YouTube, Vimeo and Instagram. As strategies and marketing plans are developed for our brands and our products, our internal marketing and communications group works to ensure brand cohesion and consistency. We believe that our marketing initiatives, as well as our strategic focus on product innovation, performance and quality attracts aspiring and enthusiast consumers to our brands and products. 
Another element of our marketing strategy for the performance sport boat category involves specialized promotions at competitive water sports events, and individual and team sponsorships. Our leading position in the performance sport boat category is supported by our sponsorship of some of the most prestigious water sports competitions, including the Malibu Evolution Pro Series, Malibu Open and in conjunction with the World Wide Wake Association, the Malibu Riders Experience, which we believe positively influences the purchasing habits of enthusiasts and other consumers seeking high-performance products. These events feature some of the most popular figures in water sports, drawing large audiences of enthusiasts to a variety of sites around the country. Further, these events are focused on fan and retail consumer engagement and offer interactive, experiential opportunities for consumers to experience watersports behind our product. To aid in driving brand awareness we also sponsor a team of elite male and female athletes from the professional water sports tours. Team Malibu includes legendary wakeboarders such Raphael Derome and Tarah Mikacich, along with World Wakeskate Champion and two-time Masters Champion Brian Grubb.  Additionally, leading members of the team are World Champion waterskiers Thomas Degaspari and World Record Holder Regina Jaquess. The Axis Wake Research Pro Team includes watersports legends like King of the Cable, Best Wake Park Rider, and Wake Park World Series Champion Tom Fooshee. We believe that the performance of our products has been demonstrated by, and our brands benefit from, the success of professional athletes who use our products. 
14

Further, the Cobalt brand has engaged in a year-long marketing campaign to celebrate its 50th anniversary in 2017.
Product Development and Engineering
We are strategically and financially committed to innovation, as reflected in our dedicated product development and engineering group and evidenced by our track record of new product introduction. Our product development and engineering group spans both our Tennessee headquarters and our Kansas and California facilities and comprises 20 professionals. These individuals bring to our product development efforts significant expertise across core disciplines, including boat design, trailer design, computer-aided design, electrical engineering and mechanical engineering. They are responsible for execution of all facets of our new product strategy, including designing new and refreshed boat models and new features, engineering these designs for manufacturing and integrating new features into our boats. In addition, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer are actively involved in the product development process and integration into manufacturing. 
We take a disciplined approach to the management of our product development strategy. We use a formalized phase gate process, overseen by a dedicated project manager, to develop, evaluate and implement new product ideas for both boat models and innovative features. Application of the phase gate process requires management to establish an overall timeline that is sub-divided into milestones, or “gates,” for product development. Setting milestones at certain intervals in the product development process ensures that each phase of development occurs in an organized manner and enables management to become aware of and address any issues in timely fashion, which facilitates on-time, on-target release of new products with expected return on investment. Extensive testing and coordination with our manufacturing group are important elements of our product development process, which we believe enable us to minimize the risk associated with the release of new products. Our phase gate process also facilitates our introduction of new boat models and features throughout the year, which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Finally, in addition to our process for managing new product introductions in a given fiscal year, we also engage in longer-term product life cycle and product portfolio planning. 
Manufacturing
Our manufacturing efforts are led by our Chief Operating Officer, who brings more than 30 years of experience in the manufacture of performance sport boats. We manufacture Malibu and Axis boats at both our Tennessee and Australia facilities and Cobalt boats at our Kansas facility. We manufacture towers, tower accessories and stainless steel and aluminum billet for our Malibu and Axis brands at our California facility. We manufacturer trailers at our Tennessee facility for our Malibu and Axis brands. 
Malibu and Axis
Our Malibu and Axis boats are built through a continuous flow manufacturing process that encompasses fabrication, assembly, quality management and testing. Each boat is produced over a seven-day cycle that includes the fabrication of the hull and deck through gelcoat application and fiberglass lamination, grinding and hole cutting, installation of components, rigging, finishing, detailing and on-the-water testing. Trailers are also produced in a continuous flow manufacturing process involving cutting and bending of the main frame from raw top grade carbon steel, painting using our state of the art system and installation of components. We manufacture certain components and subassemblies for our boats, such as upholstery, stainless steel and aluminum billet and towers. We procure other components, such as engines and electronic controls, from third-party vendors and install them on the boat. 
We acquired our tower and tower accessory manufacturing capability for Malibu and Axis in 2009 through the acquisition of certain assets of Titan Wake Accessories, which had been one of our suppliers. Tower-related manufacturing occurs in our Merced-based machine shop, where we use multiple computer-controlled machines to cut all of the aluminum parts required for tower assembly. We are the only performance sport boat company that manufacturers towers in-house. We believe that the vertical integration of these components is a distinct competitive advantage that allows us to control key design elements of our boats and generate higher margins.
We focus on worker safety in our operations. From July 1, 2012 to June 30, 2017, we recorded 3,812,460 consecutive man-hours with only two lost-time accidents, an accomplishment that has reduced workers’ compensation claims and warranty costs, as our most experienced employees continue to remain on the job.
Cobalt
All Cobalt boats, except cruiser boats, are built through a continuous flow manufacturing process that encompasses fabrication, assembly, quality management and testing. Each boat is produced over a 14 day cycle that includes the fabrication of the hull and deck through gelcoat application and fiberglass lamination, grinding and hole cutting, installation of components, rigging, finishing, detailing and in-water testing. Production of cruisers occurs on a dedicated line that allows for 
15

the increased time needed to add the additional content required for production of larger boats. Our plan to integrate Cobalt includes the integration of best practices that will be shared across facilities. We expect bidirectional flow of best practices over the coming years to enhance Cobalt’s operations, as well as Malibu’s operations.
We are committed to continuous improvement in our operations, and we believe our efforts in this regard have resulted in higher gross margins. Specifically, we have increased labor efficiency, reduced cost of materials and reduced warranty claims. Our production engineers evaluate and seek to optimize the configuration of our production line given our production volumes and model mix. We use disciplined mold maintenance procedures to maintain the usable life of our molds and to reduce surface defects that would require rework. We have instituted scrap material reduction and recovery processes, both internally and with our supplier base, helping to manage our material costs. Finally, we have implemented a quality management system to ensure that proper procedures and control measures are in place to deliver consistent, high-quality product, especially as our production volumes have increased. 
Suppliers 
We purchase a wide variety of raw materials from our supplier base, including resins, fiberglass, hydrocarbon feedstocks and steel, as well as product parts and components, such as engines and electronic controls, through a sales order process. 
 We have not experienced any material shortages in any of our raw materials, product parts or components. Temporary shortages, when they do occur, usually involve manufacturers of these products adjusting model mixes, introducing new product lines or limiting production in response to an industry-wide reduction in boat demand. 
The most significant component used in manufacturing our boats, based on cost, are engines. We maintain a strong and long-standing relationship with our primary supplier of engines from whom we purchased approximately 64% of our engines for fiscal year 2017, and we have also developed a relationship with a second supplier from whom we sourced approximately 36% of our engines for fiscal year 2017. As is typical in our industry, our engine suppliers are marinizers of engines that they procure from larger engine block manufacturers, such as General Motors Corporation. 
As a further step in our vertical integration strategy, we entered into an engine supply agreement with General Motors LLC (“General Motors”) in November 2016 for the supply of engines to us for use in our Malibu and Axis brand boats beginning as early as model year 2019 through model year 2023. We will be solely responsible for integrating the engines for marine use. We intend to continue to purchase engines from our two current suppliers for at least model years 2017 and 2018. We adopted this strategy in order to more directly control product path (design, innovation, calibration and integration) of our largest dollar procured part, to differentiate our product from our competitors, and to increase our ability to respond to ongoing changes in the marketplace.
Pursuant to the engine supply agreement, we will submit purchase orders for engines to General Motors and, so long as we are not in breach of the engine supply agreement, General Motors will deliver engines pursuant to the purchase orders. No minimum amount of engines is required to be ordered by us and the parties must discuss any potential capacity increases above 7,000 engines annually. 
The engine supply agreement will expire on November 14, 2023, unless terminated earlier by either party as permitted under the terms of the agreement. General Motors may terminate the engine supply agreement due to market conditions with at least eighteen (18) months’ advanced written notice. Either party may terminate the agreement as a result of a change of control of Malibu Boats, Inc., as defined in the agreement, with at least eighteen (18) months’ advanced written notice. Either party may also terminate the engine supply agreement due to breach of the other party upon written notice and after providing 60 days to cure any breach. General Motors may also suspend engine deliveries to Malibu Boats in the event of a force majeure, as defined in the engine supply agreement.
General Motors will provide up to a one-year warranty on the engines supplied to us and we have agreed to indemnify General Motors for claims and costs arising from or relating to the engines resulting from our actions.
Insurance and Product Warranties 
We carry various insurance policies, including policies to cover general products liability, workers’ compensation and other casualty and property risks, to protect against certain risks of loss consistent with the exposures associated with the nature and scope of our operations. Our policies are generally based on our safety record as well as market trends in the insurance industry and are subject to certain deductibles, limits and policy terms and conditions. 
Effective for model year 2016, we began providing a limited warranty for a period up to five years for both Malibu and Axis brand boats. For model years prior to 2016, we provided a limited warranty for a period of up to three years for our Malibu brand boats and two years for our Axis boats. During the warranty period, we reimburse dealers and Malibu Boats 
16

authorized service facilities for all or a portion of the cost of repair or replacement performed on the products (mainly composed of parts or accessories provided by us and labor costs incurred by dealers or Malibu Boats authorized service facilities). Some materials, components or parts of the boat that are not covered by our limited product warranties are separately warranted by their manufacturers or suppliers. These other warranties include warranties covering engines and other components. For Cobalt boats, we provide a structural warranty of up to ten years which covers hull/deck joints, bulkheads, floor, transom, stringers, and motor mount. In addition, we provide a five year bow-to-stern warranty on all components manufactured or purchased (excluding hull and deck structural components), including canvas and upholstery. Gelcoat is covered up to three years. Like our Malibu and Axis brands, some materials, components or parts of the boat that are not covered by our limited product warranties are separately warranted by their manufacturers or suppliers. These other warranties include warranties covering engines and other components. 
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, trademark and copyright protection, trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our rights in our brand, products and proprietary technology. This is an important part of our business and we intend to continue protecting our intellectual property. We currently hold 23 U.S. patents, four Australian patents, one Canadian patent, and five pending U.S. patent applications. 
We own 32 registered trademarks in various countries around the world. Such trademarks may endure in perpetuity on a country-by-country basis, provided that we comply with all statutory maintenance requirements, including continued use of each trademark in each such country. We currently do not own any registered copyrights. 
Competition 
The recreational powerboat industry, including the performance sport boat, sterndrive and outboard categories, is highly competitive for consumers and dealers. Competition affects our ability to succeed in the markets we currently serve and new markets that we may enter in the future. We compete with several large manufacturers that may have greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. We compete with large manufacturers who are represented by dealers in the markets in which we now operate and into which we plan to expand. We also compete with a wide variety of small, independent manufacturers. Competition in our industry is based primarily on brand name, price and product performance. For more information, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our industry is characterized by intense competition, which affects our sales and profits.” 
Environmental, Safety and Regulatory Matters 
Our operations and products are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety regulation under various federal, commonwealth, state, and local statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations in the United States and Australia where we manufacture our boats, and in other foreign jurisdictions where we sell our products. We believe we are in material compliance with those requirements. However, we cannot be certain that costs and expenses required for us to comply with such requirements in the future, including for any new or modified regulatory requirements, or to address newly discovered environmental conditions, will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, or cash flow. The regulatory programs to which we are subject include the following:
Hazardous Materials and Waste
Certain materials used in our manufacturing, including the resins used in production of our boats, are toxic, flammable, corrosive or reactive and are classified as hazardous materials by the national, state and local governments in those jurisdictions where we manufacture our products. The handling, storage, release, treatment and recycling or disposal of these substances and wastes from our operations are regulated in the United States by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“USEPA”), and state and local environmental agencies. The handling, storage, release, treatment and recycling or disposal of these substances and wastes from our operations are regulated in Australia by the Australian Department of Environment and Energy, the New South Wales EPA and other state and local authorities. Failure by us to properly handle, store, release, treat, recycle or dispose of our hazardous materials and wastes could result in liability for us, including fines, penalties, or obligations to investigate and remediate any contamination originating from our operations or facilities. We are not aware of any material contamination at our current or former facilities for which we could be liable under environmental laws or regulations, and we currently are not undertaking any remediation or investigation activities in connection with any contamination. Future spills or accidents or the discovery of currently unknown conditions or non-compliance could, however, could give rise to investigation and remediation obligations or related liabilities.
Air Quality
17

In the United States, the federal Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and corresponding state and local laws and rules regulate emissions of air pollutants. Because our manufacturing operations involve molding and coating of fiberglass materials, which involves the emission of certain volatile organic compounds, hazardous air pollutants, and particulate matter, we are required to maintain and comply with a CAA operating permit (Title V permit) for our Tennessee facility and local air permits for our California facilities. Our air permits generally require us to monitor our emissions and periodically certify that our emissions are within specified limits. To date, we have not had material difficulty complying with those limits.
The USEPA and the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) have adopted regulations stipulating that many marine propulsion engines and watercraft meet certain air emission standards. Some of these standards require fitting a catalytic converter to the engine. These regulations also require, among other things, that engine manufacturers provide a warranty that their engines meet USEPA and CARB emission standards. The engines used in our products are subject to these regulations. CARB also recently adopted an evaporative emissions regulation that applies to all MY 2018 spark-ignition marine watercraft with permanently installed fuel tanks sold in California. The new regulation requires subject boat manufacturers to use specific CARB-certified components for the fuel systems in their boats, or to certify the boat meets a related performance standard. The USEPA and CARB emissions regulations have increased the cost to manufacture our products.
OSHA 
In the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) standards limit the amount of emissions to which an employee may be exposed without the need for respiratory protection or upgraded plant ventilation. Our facilities are regularly inspected by OSHA and by state and local inspection agencies and departments. We believe that our facilities comply in all material aspects with these regulations. Although capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental laws are expected to increase, we do not currently anticipate any material expenditure will be required to continue to comply with existing OSHA environmental or safety regulations in connection with our existing manufacturing facilities.
At our New South Wales, Australia (“NSW”) facility, employee health and safety is regulated by SafeWork NSW, which also has requirements that limit the amount of certain emissions to which an employee may be exposed without the need for respiratory protection or upgraded plant ventilation. In addition, SafeWork NSW provides licensing and registration for potentially dangerous work, investigates workplace incidents, and enforces work health and safety laws in NSW. Our NSW facilities are regularly inspected by SafeWork NSW. We believe that our facilities comply in all material aspects with these requirements.
Boat Design and Manufacturing Standards
Powerboats sold in the United States must be manufactured to meet the standards of certification required by the United States Coast Guard. In addition, boats manufactured for sale in the European Community must be certified to meet the European Community’s imported manufactured products standards. These certifications specify standards for the design and construction of powerboats. We believe that all of our boats meet these standards. In addition, safety of recreational boats in the United States is subject to federal regulation under the Boat Safety Act of 1971, which requires boat manufacturers to recall products for replacement of parts or components that have demonstrated defects affecting safety. We have instituted recalls for defective component parts produced by certain of our third-party suppliers. None of the recalls has had a material adverse effect on our Company.
Employees 
As of July 31, 2017, we employed 1,244 people, 492 of whom work at our facilities in Tennessee, 640 of whom work at our Cobalt facilities in Kansas, 43 of whom work at our California site, 64 of whom work at our Australia facility and five who work remotely. As of July 31, 2017, approximately 13.5% of our employees were salaried and 86.5% were hourly workers. As of June 30, 2017 and 2016, we had 586 and 540 employees, respectively. We believe we maintain excellent relations with our employees.
Organizational Structure
Malibu Boats, Inc. was incorporated as a Delaware corporation on November 1, 2013 in anticipation of our IPO to serve as a holding company that owns only an interest in Malibu Boats Holdings, LLC. Immediately after the completion of our IPO and the recapitalization we completed in connection with our IPO, Malibu Boats, Inc. held approximately 49.3% of the economic interest in the LLC, which has since increased to approximately 93.4% of the economic interest in the LLC as of June 30, 2017. 
The certificate of incorporation of Malibu Boats, Inc. authorizes two classes of common stock, Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. Holders of our Class A Common Stock and our Class B Common Stock have voting power over 
18

Malibu Boats, Inc., the sole managing member of the LLC, at a level that is consistent with their overall equity ownership of our business. In connection with our IPO and the recapitalization we completed in connection with our IPO, Malibu Boats, Inc. issued to each pre-IPO owner, for nominal consideration, one share of Class B Common Stock of Malibu Boats, Inc., each of which provides its owner with no economic rights but entitles the holder to one vote on matters presented to stockholders of Malibu Boats, Inc. for each LLC Unit held by such holder. Pursuant to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, each share of Class A Common Stock entitles the holder to one vote with respect to each matter presented to our stockholders on which the holders of Class A Common Stock are entitled to vote. Each holder of Class B Common Stock is entitled to the number of votes equal to the total number of LLC units held by such holder multiplied by the exchange rate specified in the exchange agreement with respect to each matter presented to our stockholders on which the holders of Class B Common Stock are entitled to vote. Accordingly, the holders of LLC Units collectively have a number of votes that is equal to the aggregate number of LLC Units that they hold. As the LLC members sell LLC Units to us or subsequently exchange LLC Units for shares of Class A Common Stock of Malibu Boats, Inc. pursuant to the exchange agreement described below, the voting power afforded to them by their shares of Class B Common Stock is automatically and correspondingly reduced. Subject to any rights that may be applicable to any then outstanding preferred stock, our Class A and Class B Common Stock vote as a single class on all matters presented to our stockholders for their vote or approval, except as otherwise provided in our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or required by applicable law. In addition, subject to preferences that may apply to any shares of preferred stock outstanding at the time, the holders of our Class A Common Stock are entitled to share equally, identically and ratably in any dividends or distributions (including in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our affairs) that our board of directors may determine to issue from time to time, while holders of our Class B Common Stock do not have any right to receive dividends or other distributions. 
As noted above, Malibu Boats, Inc. is a holding company with a controlling equity interest in the LLC. Malibu Boats, Inc., as sole managing member of the LLC, operates and controls all of the business and affairs and consolidates the financial results of the LLC. The limited liability company agreement of the LLC provides that it may be amended, supplemented, waived or modified by the written consent of Malibu Boats, Inc., as managing member of the LLC, in its sole discretion without the approval of any other holder of LLC Units, except that no amendment may materially and adversely affect the rights of a holder of LLC Units, other than on a pro rata basis with other holders of LLC Units, without the consent of such holder (unless more than one holder is so affected, then the consent of a majority of such affected holders is required). Pursuant to the limited liability company agreement of the LLC, Malibu Boats, Inc. has the right to determine when distributions (other than tax distributions) will be made to the members of the LLC and the amount of any such distributions. If Malibu Boats, Inc. authorizes a distribution, such distribution will be made to the members of the LLC (including Malibu Boats, Inc.) pro rata in accordance with the percentages of their respective LLC Units.
The diagram below depicts our current organizational structure, as of June 30, 2017:
19

Our organizational structure allows the LLC members to retain their equity ownership in the LLC, an entity that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in the form of LLC Units. Holders of Class A Common Stock, by contrast, hold their equity ownership in Malibu Boats, Inc., a Delaware corporation that is a domestic corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in the form of shares of Class A Common Stock. The holders of LLC Units, including Malibu Boats, Inc., will incur U.S. federal, state and local income taxes on their proportionate share of any taxable income of the LLC. Net profits and net losses of the LLC will generally be allocated to the LLC’s members (including Malibu Boats, Inc.) pro rata in accordance with the percentages of their respective limited liability company interests. The limited liability company agreement provides for cash distributions to the holders of LLC Units if Malibu Boats, Inc. determines that the taxable income of the LLC will give rise to taxable income for its members. In accordance with the limited liability company agreement, we intend to cause the LLC to make cash distributions to the holders of LLC Units for purposes of funding their tax obligations in respect of the income of the LLC that is allocated to them. Generally, these tax distributions will be computed based on our estimate of the taxable income of the LLC allocable to such holder of LLC Units multiplied by an assumed tax rate equal to the highest effective marginal combined U.S. federal, state and local income tax rate prescribed for an individual or corporate resident in Los Angeles, California (taking into account the nondeductibility of certain expenses and the character of our income). For purposes of determining the taxable income of the LLC, such determination will be made by generally disregarding any adjustment to the taxable income of any member of the LLC that arises under the tax basis adjustment rules of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code and is attributable to the acquisition by such member of an interest in the LLC in a sale or exchange transaction. 
Exchanges and Other Transactions with Holders of LLC Units
In connection with our IPO and the recapitalization we completed in connection with our IPO, we entered into an exchange agreement with the pre-IPO owners of the LLC under which (subject to the terms of the exchange agreement) each pre-IPO owner (or its permitted transferee) has the right to exchange its LLC Units for shares of our Class A Common Stock on a one-
20

for-one basis, subject to customary conversion rate adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends and reclassifications, or, at our option, except in the event of a change in control, for a cash payment equal to the market value of the Class A Common Stock. The exchange agreement provides, however, that such exchanges must be for a minimum of the lesser of 1,000 LLC Units, all of the LLC Units held by the holder, or such amount as we determine to be acceptable. The exchange agreement also provides that an LLC member will not have the right to exchange LLC Units if Malibu Boats, Inc. determines that such exchange would be prohibited by law or regulation or would violate other agreements with Malibu Boats, Inc. to which the LLC member may be subject or any of our written policies related to unlawful or insider trading. The exchange agreement also provides that Malibu Boats, Inc. may impose additional restrictions on exchanges that it determines to be necessary or advisable so that the LLC is not treated as a “publicly traded partnership” for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, pursuant to the limited liability company agreement of the LLC, Malibu Boats, Inc., as managing member of the LLC, has the right to require all members of the LLC to exchange their LLC Units for Class A Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the exchange agreement, subject to the consent of the holders of a majority of outstanding LLC Units other than those held by Malibu Boats, Inc.
As a result of exchanges of LLC Units into Class A Common Stock and purchases by Malibu Boats, Inc. of LLC Units from holders of LLC Units, Malibu Boats, Inc. will become entitled to a proportionate share of the existing tax basis of the assets of the LLC at the time of such exchanges or purchases. In addition, such exchanges and purchases of LLC Units are expected to result in increases in the tax basis of the assets of the LLC that otherwise would not have been available. These increases in tax basis may reduce the amount of tax that Malibu Boats, Inc. would otherwise be required to pay in the future. These increases in tax basis may also decrease gains (or increase losses) on future dispositions of certain capital assets to the extent tax basis is allocated to those capital assets. We have entered into a tax receivable agreement with the pre-IPO owners (or their permitted assignees) that provides for the payment by Malibu Boats, Inc. to the pre-IPO owners (or their permitted assignees) of 85% of the amount of the benefits, if any, that Malibu Boats, Inc. is deemed to realize as a result of (1) increases in tax basis and (2) certain other tax benefits related to our entering into the tax receivable agreement, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the tax receivable agreement. These payment obligations are obligations of Malibu Boats, Inc. and not of the LLC.
