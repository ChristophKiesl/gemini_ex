ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.
--------+----------

Introduction 
 
We are a blank check company incorporated on September 25, 2020 as a Delaware corporation for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination, which refer to throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K as our initial business combination, with one or more businesses. Although we are not limited to a particular industry or geographic region for purposes of consummating a business combination, we initially concentrated on target businesses making a positive contribution to sustainability through the ownership, financing and management of societal infrastructure.
Formation 
 
On October 2, 2020, our sponsor paid $25,000 to cover certain offering costs in consideration of 8,625,000 founder shares. On January 12, 2021, we effected a stock dividend of 0.2 shares for each founder share outstanding, resulting in our sponsor holding an aggregate number of 10,350,000 founder shares, such that the founder shares represented 20% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock after our IPO. Up to 1,350,000 founder shares were subject to forfeiture by our sponsor depending on the extent to which the underwriters’ over-allotment option was exercised. On January 15, 2021, as a result of the underwriters’ election to exercise their over-allotment option in full, all 1,350,000 founder shares ceased to be subject to forfeiture, resulting in an aggregate of 10,350,000 founder shares issued and outstanding.
 
Initial Public Offering 
 
On January 15, 2021, we consummated our IPO of 41,400,000 units, including the issuance of 5,400,000 units as a result of the underwriters' exercise of their over-allotment option in full. Each unit consists of one share of common stock of, par value $0.0001 per share, and one-third of one redeemable warrant. Each warrant will become exercisable for one share of common stock, with an exercise price of $11.50 per share, at any time commencing on the later of 12 months from the closing of our IPO or 30 days after the completion of an initial business combination and will expire on the fifth anniversary of our completion of an initial business combination, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. The units were sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $414,000,000. 
 
On January 15, 2021, simultaneously with the closing of our IPO, we consummated the private sale of 6,686,667 warrants at a purchase price of $1.50 per private placement warrant to our sponsor, generating gross proceeds of $10,030,000. The private placement warrants are identical to the warrants sold as part of the units in our IPO, except that the private placement warrants will be non-redeemable for cash and will be exercisable on a cashless basis so long as they are held by our sponsor or its permitted transferees. Our sponsor has agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the private placement warrants (except to certain permitted transferees) until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination.
 
In connection with our IPO, we entered into a forward purchase agreement with Northern Genesis Capital II LLC (formerly Northern Genesis Capital LLC), an entity which is affiliated with our sponsor, pursuant to which, if we determine to raise capital by issuing equity securities in connection with the closing of our initial business combination, the members of Northern Genesis Capital II LLC or affiliates thereof have the first right to purchase up to an aggregate maximum amount of $75,000,000 of forward purchase securities, consisting of either (i) a number of forward purchase units, consisting of one forward purchase share and one-sixth of one forward purchase warrant, for $10.00 per unit or (ii) a number of forward purchase shares for $9.75 per share, in a private placement that would close simultaneously with the closing of our initial business combination. Whether we would issue forward purchase units valued at $10.00 per unit or forward purchase shares valued at $9.75 per share to the forward purchase investors would be determined at our election, and in our sole discretion, at the time we notify Northern Genesis Capital II LLC of our intent to raise capital through the issuance of equity securities. Each whole forward purchase warrant would be exercisable to purchase one share of our common stock at $11.50 per share. The forward purchase warrants would have the same terms as the public warrants and the forward purchase shares would be identical to the shares of our common stock included in the units sold in our IPO, except the forward purchase shares and the forward purchase warrants would be subject to transfer restrictions until registered pursuant to certain registration rights. The funds from the sale of the forward purchase securities may be used as part of the consideration to the sellers in the initial business combination and for expenses in connection with our initial business combination, and any excess funds may be used for the working capital needs of the post-transaction company. The forward purchase transaction is subject to conditions, including one or more forward purchase investors confirming their commitment to purchase forward purchase securities, and the amount thereof, no later than fifteen days after we notify Northern Genesis Capital II LLC of our intention to raise capital in connection with the closing of a business combination. Each forward purchase investor may grant or withhold its confirmation entirely within its sole discretion. Accordingly, if a forward purchase investor does not confirm its purchase, such forward purchase investor will not have the right and will not be obligated to purchase any forward purchase securities.

NYSE Listing 
 
The public shares, units, and public warrants are currently listed for trading on the NYSE under the symbols “NGAB,” “NGAB.U,” and “NGAB.WS,” respectively.
 
Our Company 
 
We are a newly organized blank check company incorporated in Delaware and formed for the purpose of effecting an initial business combination with one or more target businesses. To date, our efforts have been limited to organizational activities, activities relating to our IPO and, following the closing of our IPO, our search for a suitable candidate for our initial business combination. We have generated no revenues to date and we do not expect that we will generate operating revenues until we consummate our initial business combination at the earliest. Although we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any business or industry, we intend to focus on opportunities making a positive contribution to sustainability through the ownership, financing and management of societal infrastructure.
 
Our management team co-founded Northern Genesis Acquisition Corp. (“Northern Genesis Acquisition I”) (NYSE: NGA), a special purpose acquisition company that completed its initial public offering in August 2020, in which it sold 31,945,344 units, each consisting of one share of common stock and one-half of one warrant, with each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of common stock, for an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating aggregate proceeds of approximately $320 million. On November 30, 2020, Northern Genesis Acquisition I announced the execution of a definitive agreement for its initial business combination with The Lion Electric Company. The combined entity, The Lion Electric Company, is expected to be listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “LEV.” We believe that we will benefit from the valuable experience gained by our management team during the launch and operation of Northern Genesis Acquisition I, including the process of evaluating numerous target companies and industry sectors, selecting The Lion Electric Company as its business combination partner and negotiating the terms of the business combination agreement and all of the related transactions. The information contained in this report shall not constitute solicitation of a proxy, consent or authorization with respect to any securities or in respect of Northern Genesis Acquisition I. Past performance by our management team or Northern Genesis Acquisition I may not be indicative of future performance of an investment in us.
 
We believe that there is a growing societal sensitivity on the part of customers, investors and employees to the alignment that a business demonstrates with the principles underlying sustainability. Incorporating these principles into business strategies requires ongoing consideration of certain ESG factors that can both create opportunities and present potential risks. By weaving a focus on sustainability into their business plans and activities, companies can build business models that create social and environmental value in addition to financial or economic value. We believe there are significant, attractive opportunities to invest in businesses that demonstrate a commitment to this ‘triple bottom line’ orientation.
 
While a commitment to ESG covers a broad range of themes, we are specifically focused on evaluating suitable targets whose business practices demonstrate clear alignment with sustainability principles and whose organizational culture embraces the value of such alignment. We believe there are attractive investment opportunities that may benefit, both operationally and economically, from our management team’s commitment to and expertise in designing and incorporating ESG processes and practices. We believe that opportunities for improved business success based on strong ESG alignment exist across a broad range of industries and sectors. As demonstrated by our management team with Northern Genesis Acquisition I’s announced business combination with The Lion Electric Company, we believe the experience of our management team will allow us to evaluate targets in industries such as transition to renewable energy, transportation and electric mobility (including charging infrastructure, batteries, railways and logistics), data and communication (including data centers, internet distribution and mobile infrastructure), agriculture (including product logistics, biofuels and storage) and community services (including waste, recycling, environmental and construction), among others. We believe that organizations operating in all of these sectors can generate attractive returns through strengthened ESG profiles and incorporating environmental sustainability into their business strategies. Companies in our target universe tend to have stable growth rates and would greatly benefit from access to both public market capital and public market expertise.

We believe in the ability of our management team to add significant value to a target company from a commercial, operating, strategic and sustainability perspective. In particular, we will seek to identify and acquire a business that could benefit from a hands-on owner with extensive operational experience and the public company expertise our management team possesses, or that relies on the target’s executive and operational expertise but presents potential for an attractive risk-adjusted return profile following a business combination with us. Even fundamentally sound companies can often underperform their potential due to underinvestment, a temporary period of dislocation in the markets in which they operate, over-levered capital structures, excessive cost structures, incomplete management teams and/or a need to realign business strategies. In addition, these companies may have little or no experience operating in the public markets. Our management team has significant experience in identifying such opportunities and executing on strategies to surface value in a public market context.
 
Our management team includes all of the members of the management team of Northern Genesis Acquisition I. We believe that potential sellers of target businesses will view the fact that our management team has successfully negotiated a business combination for Northern Genesis Acquisition I as a positive factor in considering whether or not to enter into a business combination with us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, past performance of our management team or Northern Genesis Acquisition I is not a guarantee either (i) that we will be able to identify a suitable candidate for our initial business combination or (ii) of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate. You should not rely on the historical record of our management team or Northern Genesis Acquisition I’s performance as indicative of our future performance.
 
Business Strategy
 
We seek to identify and complete our initial business combination with a company that complements the experience of our management team and can benefit from their operating and deal making expertise. Our selection process is expected to leverage our management team’s network of relationships, deal sourcing capability and unique industry experiences to access a wide range of proprietary opportunities. The team members have developed these capabilities during their respective career endeavors. Our management team has a history of sourcing, structuring, acquiring, operating, developing, growing, financing and selling businesses. They also share deep relationships with target companies and capital markets advisors, as well as extensive experience raising both debt and equity capital across business cycles. These experiences have provided them with a broad understanding of public market performance and investor expectations, enhancing their ability to provide mentorship as a target management team transitions from private to public markets.
Initial Business Combination
 
The NYSE rules require that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or from another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. However, we will not be required to meet this condition if we are not then listed on the NYSE.
 
We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that company in which our public stockholders own shares following the transaction will own or acquire 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we anticipate only completing such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to our initial business combination may collectively own less than a majority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the NYSE’s 80% fair market value test. If our initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses.

Our Acquisition Process
 
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review that will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information that will be made available to us. We will also utilize our operational and capital allocation experience.
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.
 
Members of our management team and our independent directors have an indirect financial interest in our founder shares and/or private placement warrants, and may acquire a direct or indirect financial interest in working capital loans to us or in our working capital warrants, which, due to the prices paid for such securities, the lack of redemption rights with respect to such securities and fact that such securities and loans likely would be worthless in the absence of business combination, and other factors, may give rise to conflicts of interest in determining whether to effectuate a particular initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.
 
Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce any interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one that we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and that otherwise would be reasonable for us to pursue. Subject to the foregoing, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she then has fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such entity. In addition, he or she otherwise may choose to present such opportunities to such other entities before he or she presents such opportunities to us, to the extent that he or she determines, in the good faith exercise of his or her professional business judgment, that such opportunities are not suitable for us. Our board of directors has determined that a combination with a particular target generally will not be suitable for us if the cash needed for the acquisition and near-term expansion of the target’s business is less than the $414 million currently held in our trust account.
 
Without limiting the foregoing, all of our officers and directors have contractual obligations and fiduciary duties under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”) to Northern Genesis Holdings Inc. and/or to certain companies in which it has invested or may invest, by reason of his or her position with such company, which may compete with us for business combination opportunities. These entities currently include Northern Genesis Acquisition I and Northern Genesis Acquisition Corp. III (“Northern Genesis Acquisition III”), which, like us, are focused on businesses making a positive contribution to sustainability through the ownership, financing and management of societal infrastructure. Pursuant to the terms of the business combination agreement between Northern Genesis Acquisition I and The Lion Electric Company, the members of our management team will not present any new business combination opportunities to Northern Genesis Acquisition I unless and until such business combination agreement is terminated, in which case members of our management team who are officers or directors of Northern Genesis Acquisition I would have obligations to present to Northern Genesis Acquisition I potential business combination opportunities that are presented to them specifically in their capacity as an officer or director of Northern Genesis Acquisition I or that are otherwise suitable for Northern Genesis Acquisition I. Alternatively, upon consummation of the business combination between Northern Genesis Acquisition I and The Lion Electric Company, it is anticipated that Ian Robertson and Christopher Jarratt will serve on the board of directors of The Lion Electric Company and will have fiduciary obligations to The Lion Electric Company. In addition, our directors and officers also have fiduciary and contractual obligations to Northern Genesis Acquisition III, including obligations to present to Northern Genesis Acquisition III potential business combination opportunities that are presented to them specifically in their capacity as an officer or director of Northern Genesis Acquisition III.

We do not believe that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our business combination.
 
Acquisition Criteria
 
We have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses for a business combination:
 

● | Ability to align with our sustainability principles and support reduction of carbon intensity; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Defined barriers to entry or sustainable competitive advantages; 
● | Predictable revenue and free cash flow to support reinvestment growth; 
● | Little material technology, scale-up or market risk and success not premised on future capital raises to achieve growth plans;
● | Opportunity to benefit from our management team’s network and expertise to drive improved financial performance; and 
● | Ability to benefit from access to the public capital markets. 

 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, these criteria and guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive. Further, we may elect to pursue a business combination with a target business that may not meet any of the foregoing criteria and guidelines. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general criteria and guidelines as well as other considerations, factors, criteria and guidelines that our management may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria and guidelines in our stockholder communications related to our initial business combination, which would be in the form of tender offer documents or proxy solicitation materials that we would file with the SEC.
 
Our Management Team
 
Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they have advised us that they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that any member of our management team will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the current stage of the business combination process.
 
As supported by the business combination with The Lion Electric Company announced for Northern Genesis Acquisition I, we believe our management team’s operating and transaction experience and relationships with companies will provide us with a substantial number of potential business combination targets. Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships around the world. This network has grown through the activities of our management team sourcing, acquiring and financing businesses, our management team’s relationships with sellers, financing sources and target management teams and the experience of our management team in executing transactions under varying economic and financial market conditions.

Status as a Public Company
 
We believe our structure makes us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination. In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares of stock in the target business for shares of our stock or for a combination of shares of our stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. Although there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses will find this method a more certain and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In a typical initial public offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, road show and public reporting efforts that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us.
 
Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring or could have negative valuation consequences. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders’ interests. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th; and (ii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.00 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
 
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) our annual revenues equaled or exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th.

Financial Position
 
With funds available for a business combination initially in the amount of $414,000,000 assuming no redemptions and after payment of $14,490,000 of deferred underwriting fees, we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to complete our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires.
Effecting our Initial Business Combination
 
We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our IPO and the private placement of the private placement warrants, the proceeds of the sale of any of our securities (including forward purchase securities) in connection with our initial business combination, shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing or other sources. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.
 
If the purchase price for our initial business combination is paid in equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the purchase price or for redemptions of our public shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.
 
We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our initial business combination (including, but not limited to, pursuant to the forward purchase agreement), and we may effectuate our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would expect to complete such financing only simultaneously with the completion of our business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately, or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. Other than the forward purchase agreement, at this time we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise.
 
Sources of Target Businesses
 
We anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity groups, investment banking firms, consultants, accounting firms and large business enterprises. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read our filings with the SEC and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition, we may engage the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will engage a finder only to the extent our management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of finder’s fees is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the trust account.

Subject to maintaining funds adequate for our projected obligations, we expect to make payments, up to $2,000,000 in the aggregate, in respect of the services of personnel affiliated with our sponsor, including persons who may be directors or officers of our company, for activities on our behalf, including services related to identifying, investigating and completing an initial business combination and other operational and support services. To the extent any amounts are in respect of the services of individuals who also serve as directors or executive officers of our company, such amounts will be reviewed and approved by our audit committee. We also will reimburse our sponsor, officers, directors and their respective affiliates for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred on our behalf, and we have agreed to pay our sponsor or its affiliate a total of $10,000 per month, from the date our securities were first listed on the NYSE until the closing of our initial business combination, for office space, utilities, secretarial support and administrative services.
 
Some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the post-transaction company following our initial business combination. The presence or absence of any such fees or arrangements will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an acquisition candidate.
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates or making the acquisition through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with any such persons, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent firm that commonly renders valuation opinions that such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.
 
Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of our Initial Business Combination
 
NYSE rules require that our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of our assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination. The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as discounted cash flow valuation or value of comparable businesses. If our board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or from another independent firm that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. Subject to this requirement, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we are not then listed on the NYSE for whatever reason, we would no longer be required to meet the foregoing 80% fair market value test.
 
In any case, we anticipate only completing an initial business combination in which we own or acquire 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquire a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If we own or acquire less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses, the portion of such business or businesses that are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% fair market value test. There is no basis for investors in our company to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any target business with which we may ultimately complete our business combination.
 
To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
 
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review, which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information that will be made available to us.

The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.
 
Lack of Business Diversification
 
For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. In addition, we intend to focus our search for an initial business combination in a single industry. By completing our business combination with only a single entity, our success may depend on the marketing and sale of a limited number of products or services, and we may be subject to any negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments affecting the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination.
Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team
 
Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with that business, our assessment of the target business’ management may not prove to be correct. In addition, future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company.
 
We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that our officers and directors and will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of any particular target business with which we may combine.
 
Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.
 
Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve our Initial Business Combination
 
We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC. However, we will seek stockholder approval if it is required by law or applicable stock exchange rule, or we may decide to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons. Presented in the table below is a graphic explanation of the types of initial business combinations we may consider and whether stockholder approval is currently required under Delaware law for each such transaction.

Type of Transaction | Whether Stockholder Approval is Required
--------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------
Purchase of assets | No 
Purchase of stock of target not involving a merger with the company | No 
Merger of target into a subsidiary of the company | No 
Merger of the company with a target | Yes

Under the NYSE’s listing rules, stockholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example:
 

● | we issue shares of common stock that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of shares of our common stock then outstanding; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | any of our directors, officers or substantial security holders (as defined by the NYSE rules) has a 5% or greater interest, directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired and if the number of shares of common stock to be issued, or if the number of shares of common stock into which the securities may be convertible or exercisable, exceeds either (a) 1% of the number of shares of common stock or 1% of the voting power outstanding before the issuance in the case of any of our directors or officers or (b) 5% of the number of shares of common stock or 5% of the voting power outstanding before the issuance in the case of any substantial security holders; or
● | the issuance or potential issuance of common stock will result in our undergoing a change of control. 

Liquidation if No Business Combination 
 
We will have until January 15, 2023 to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our business combination within such period (and our stockholders have not amended our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to extend this time period), we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares for cash, at a per-share price equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our tax obligations, less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our business combination within the 24-month time period.
 
The holders of our founder shares are not entitled to any liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such founder shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our IPO.
 
Our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to written agreements with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (a) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our IPO or (b) with respect to any other provisions that specifically apply only to the period prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our tax obligations divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares unless our net tangible assets are at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of a business combination (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules).
 
We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing a plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from funds available to us outside the trust account, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. If those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the trust account not required to pay our tax obligations, we may request that the trustee release to us an additional amount of up to $100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses.

If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of our IPO and the sale of the private placement warrants, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders upon our dissolution would be approximately $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public stockholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by stockholders will not be substantially less than $10.00. Under Section 281(b) of the DGCL, our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our remaining assets to our stockholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims.
 
Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent auditors and the underwriters in our IPO), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver.
 
In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to us, or by a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a definitive agreement for a business combination, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below (i) $10.00 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay our tax obligations and up to $100,000 for liquidation expenses, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account (even if such waiver is deemed to be unenforceable) and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We have not independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy this indemnity obligation nor have we asked it to reserve for such eventuality and believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we believe it is unlikely that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the trust account, the funds available for our initial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.00 per public share. In such event, if we are not be able to complete our initial business combination, you would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of your public shares. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.
 
In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below (i) $10.00 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay our tax obligations and up to $100,000 for liquidation expenses, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligation or that it has no indemnification obligation related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligation. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligation to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so if, for example, the cost of such legal action is deemed by the independent directors to be too high relative to the amount recoverable or if the independent directors determine that a favorable outcome is not likely. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than $10.00 per public share.

Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our business combination within 24 months from the closing of our IPO may be considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. However, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following our 24th month and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.
 
Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our business combination within 24 months from the closing of our IPO, is not considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidating distribution.
 
If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.00 per share to our public stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.
 
Our public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete our business combination within 24 months from the closing of our IPO, or if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of the initial business combination, or in connection with certain amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. In no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a stockholder’s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a stockholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above.
 
Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
