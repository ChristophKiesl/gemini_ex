Item 1. BUSINESS.
​
OVERVIEW
​
CUBIC CORPORATION (“we,” “us,” the “Company” and “Cubic”) efficiently provides our global customers with innovative, mission-critical solutions to reduce congestion and increase operational readiness and effectiveness through superior situational understanding. Cubic serves transportation, defense command, control, communication, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR), and defense training customers globally. We offer integrated payment and information systems, expeditionary communications, cloud-based computing and intelligence delivery, as well as state-of-the-art training and readiness solutions. 
​
Our recently launched NextCUBIC strategy focuses on growth, operational excellence and culture, and is founded on our winning proposition – we solve our customers’ most critical challenges through innovative, mission-critical solutions, services and platforms. NextCUBIC, which is underpinned by a thorough outside-in assessment, launches a full-scale program to drive a step change in value creation and deliver sustainable financial improvement through both functional and cultural transformation in the way we work.
​
We believe that we have significant transportation and defense industry expertise which, combined with our innovative technology capabilities, contributes to our leading market positions and allows us to deepen and further expand each of our business segments in key markets. All of our businesses share a common mission with supporting technologies to increase our customers’ situational awareness so they can make better decisions. Our transportation customers benefit from enhanced efficiency and reduced congestion, while our defense customers benefit from increased readiness and mission effectiveness. Headquartered in San Diego, California, we do business on five continents and we had approximately 6,100 employees working in 17 countries as of September 30, 2020. 
​
In recent history we’ve managed our business in three separate business segments: Cubic Transportation Systems (CTS), Cubic Mission Solutions (CMS), and Cubic Global Defense Systems (CGD). In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 we combined our CMS and CGD segments to form a new Cubic Mission and Performance Solutions (CMPS) segment. This new segment will continue to deliver solutions to C4ISR and training customers worldwide. This streamlined organizational structure is designed to:

● | Leverage our world class talent and common technologies across the combined defense business
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Enhance collaboration and customer intimacy globally
--+-----------------------------------------------------


● | Reduce complexity and cost, and
--+--------------------------------


● | Increase organizational efficiency to support customer and shareholder value creation.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Notwithstanding our recent realignment of our defense business, we are still required to report our segment financial results based upon our legacy reportable business segments in fiscal year 2020. However, in fiscal 2021 the defense businesses will be combined into CMPS, a single reportable segment.
​
We have a broad customer base across our businesses, with approximately 61% of our fiscal year 2020 sales generated from U.S. federal, state and local governments. Approximately 3% of these sales were attributable to Foreign Military Sales, which are sales to allied foreign governments facilitated by the U.S. government. The remainder of our fiscal year 2020 sales were attributable to sales to foreign government and foreign municipal agencies. In fiscal year 2020, 64% of our total sales were derived from products, with services sales accounting for the remaining 36%.
​
BUSINESS SEGMENTS
​
For the year ended September 30, 2020, the distribution of our sales across our three legacy business segments was as follows:

Cubic Transportation Systems 
​
CTS is a leading integrator of payment, information technology and services for intelligent travel solutions. We specialize in the design, development, production, installation, maintenance and operation of automated fare payment, traffic management and enforcement solutions, real-time information systems, and revenue management infrastructure and technologies for transportation agencies. As part of our turnkey solutions, CTS also provides these customers with a 

4



comprehensive suite of business process outsourcing (BPO) services and expertise, such as card and payment media management, central systems and application support, retail network management, customer call centers and financial clearing and settlement support.
​
CTS is comprised of approximately 3,100 employees working in major transportation markets worldwide. As an established partner with transportation authorities and operators, we have installed systems in over 40 markets on four continents. While the COVID-19 pandemic has reduced transit ridership, our systems were serving over 41 million users a day, processing approximately 14 billion revenue-related transactions per year, which were generating more than $16 billion of revenue per year for such transportation authorities and operators at pre-pandemic activity levels. 
​
We hold the leading market position in large-scale automated fare payment and revenue management systems and services for major metropolitan areas such as London (Oyster/Contactless Payment), the New York region (Metrocard/OMNY), the Chicago region (Ventra), the San Francisco Bay Area (Clipper), the Vancouver region (Compass), the Sydney region (Opal Card) and the Brisbane region (Go Card). We are currently designing and building major new systems in New York, Boston, Brisbane, and the San Francisco Bay Area.
​
Through our NextBus, ITMS, Trafficware and GRIDSMART businesses, we provide advanced transportation operational management capabilities and related services to hundreds of customers including organizations such as Transport for London, Transport Scotland, Highways England, Transport for Greater Manchester, Los Angeles Metro, San Francisco Muni and the Toronto Transit Commission. We also provide a modern tolling and road user charging alternative that uses state-of-the-art tools that are flexible and modular compared to the proprietary, legacy systems that the industry views as their only option.
​
​
Transportation Industry Overview
​
We define our addressable transportation market as multi-modal transportation revenue management systems (e.g. public transit fare collection, toll revenue collection, congestion charging), Real-Time Passenger Information and Intelligent Transportation Systems and services. We project the long-term growth for this market to be driven primarily by customer infrastructure expansion as well as technological refreshment and advancement which will lead to system replacements and upgrades. Together with additional opportunities that stem from our other businesses as well as entry into new geographies, we believe our overall addressable market to be in excess of $16 billion. We believe industry experience, past performance, technological innovation and price are the key factors customers consider in awarding programs and such factors can serve as barriers to entry to potential competitors when coupled with scale and the upfront investments required for these programs.
​
Advances in communications, networking and security technologies are enabling interoperability of multiple modes of transportation within a single networked system, as well as interoperability of multiple transportation operators within a single networked system. As such, there is a growing trend for regional payment systems. Recent procurements for open payment systems will further extend the acceptance of payment media from smart cards, to contactless bank cards and Near Field Communication (NFC) enabled smartphones.
​

​
Cubic Global Defense
​
CGD is a market leader in live, virtual, constructive (LVC) and game-based training solutions to the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), other U.S. government agencies and allied nations. We design and manufacture realistic, high-fidelity air, ground, and surface instrumentation, visualization and data analytic systems that support LVC training in high fidelity environments. Our customized systems and services accelerate combat readiness in the air, on the ground and at sea while meeting the demands of evolving operations globally. 
​
Our products and systems help our customers to retain operational, tactical, and technological superiority with cost-effective solutions. We also provide ongoing support services for systems we have built for several of our international customers. Our training business portfolio is currently organized into air training, ground training, and synthetic/digital solutions. CGD does business on five continents and is comprised of approximately 1,200 employees working in 12 nations providing training systems to the DoD and allied nations.
​
Our established international footprint in 34 allied nations is a key element of our strategy. Our global footprint helps to mitigate possible shifts or downturns in DoD spending. Sales to international customers accounted for 60% of CGD sales in 2020. In addition, new innovative technologies such as LVC training systems and potential expansion into adjacent markets provides us the means to add scale to our business. Strategically, we believe we are very well positioned to lead the increasing trend to fully integrated solutions that connect LVC and game-based training in multi-domain environments.
​
Air Training Solutions
​
In air training, Cubic was the initial developer and supplier of Air Combat Maneuvering Instrumentation (ACMI) capability during the Vietnam War. The latest ACMI generation, the P5 Combat Training System, provides advanced air combat training capability to the USAF, Navy and Marine Corps, as well as allied nations which has solidified Cubic’s 

6



global market leading position. In addition to procuring the ACMI training system, many nations also rely on Cubic for on-site operations and maintenance support. We are constantly evolving our air combat training solutions to achieve full-spectrum LVC training systems.
 ​
Ground Training Solutions
​
We are a leading provider of realistic, easy-to-use, high-fidelity, reliable, and cost-effective tactical engagement simulation systems that minimize user set-up time and increase training effectiveness. Our leadership role in instrumented training was established during the 1990s when Cubic provided turnkey systems for U.S. Army training centers including the Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC) at Fort Polk, Louisiana, and the Combat Maneuver Training Center (CMTC) at Hohenfels, Germany, now known as the Joint Multinational Readiness Center. Since the completion of these original contracts, we have significantly expanded our market footprint with the sale of fixed, mobile and urban operation training centers to uniformed military and security forces in the United States and allied nations around the world. Our ground combat training systems operate at over 90 combat training centers (CTCs) worldwide. Our laser-based tactical engagement simulation systems, widely known as Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement Systems (MILES), are used to enable realistic training without live ammunition.
​
Synthetic/Digital Solutions
​
Our synthetic/digital solutions integrate instructional material into a gaming environment, thus dramatically reducing instructor costs and providing a platform that is ideal for embedded training. These technologies are easily transferrable to different training domains and subject matters. The experiential learning environment can be augmented with intelligent tutoring and assessment tools increasing the value of this approach.
​
As the blend of LVC training creates broader higher fidelity training environments, the data generated creates a significant opportunity to capitalize on our advanced synthetic and digital capabilities to deliver greater insight into customer training effectiveness.
​
Defense Industry Overview
​
Our CMS markets, including protected communications, ruggedized IoT and C2ISR have a total addressable market of approximately $5 billion annually. We believe that our CMS products and technologies address mission critical requirements such as integrated communications suites for UAVs, ships and the dismounted soldier, battlefield awareness, and secure and encrypted communications. 
​
Our training market is relatively large and stable. According to the 2018 Global Military Simulation and Virtual Training Market report, the value of the global military simulation and virtual training programs market was $10.2 billion in 2018. 
​
The U.S. national debt now exceeds $27 trillion, and now surpasses the U.S.’s Gross Domestic Product, with recent growth in large part due to the response to the current coronavirus pandemic. In this era of deficit spending, the U.S. government has momentarily paused its focus on discretionary spending, tax, and other initiatives to control spending, debt and the deficit. As the economic effects of the pandemic recede, it is likely pressure will mount on controlling discretionary spending but there are presently no indications of reductions to current, near-term defense budgets as the defense industry is identified as essential, nor is there an indication of rising interest rates as Federal Reserve officials expect to leave interest rates near zero for years — through at least 2023 — as they try to coax the economy back to full strength after the coronavirus pandemic-induced recession. 
​
Our defense portfolio is well aligned to support the U.S. national defense strategy. Because of the re-emergence of long-term, strategic competition with China and Russia, the National Defense Strategy priorities are likely to remain in place regardless if there is a change in presidential administrations, and will drive relatively stable defense budgets. We’ve seen strong bipartisan support for national security funding as indicated by the $740 billion FY 2021 defense appropriation. There is also bipartisan support for transportation infrastructure spending, including support for intelligent transportation and congestion management systems, in the next surface authorization act. Beyond FY21 legislation we expect, given the likely prospect of a “divided” government, that Congress will keep the current tax structure in place, 

7



expand infrastructure spending and maintain defense spending at the record highs. Nonetheless, beyond 2021, the President’s administration and Congress will likely continue to debate the size and expected growth of the U.S. federal budget as well as the defense budget and balance decisions regarding defense, homeland security, and other federal spending priorities.

​
Enhance Services Business
​
We view services tied to our technologies as a core element of our business and we are working to expand our service offerings and customer base. In aggregate, approximately 36% of our sales in fiscal year 2020, were from service-related work. We believe that a strong base of service work helps to consistently generate profits and smooth the sales fluctuations inherent in systems work.
​
At CTS, we deliver a number of customer services for multiple transportation authorities worldwide. Due to the technical complexities of operating payment systems, transportation agencies are turning to their system suppliers for IT services and other operational and maintenance services, such as regional settlement, card management and customer support services that would otherwise be performed by the agencies. As a result, we have transitioned from a supplier to a systems integration and services company providing a suite of turnkey outsourced services for more than 20 transit authorities and cities worldwide. Today, CTS delivers a wide range of services from customer support to financial management and technical support at operation centers across the United States, Canada, United Kingdom and Australia.
​
At CGD, we primarily provide services for products for which we are the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). Our services on OEM equipment drive value for our customers and allow us to earn higher margins. Compared to the U.S. market where small business requirements, omnibus contracts and local preferences create acquisition challenges, we believe the international market offers greater opportunities to bundle and negotiate multi-year, turnkey contracts. We believe these long-term contracts reinforce CGD’s competitive posture and enable us to provide enhanced services through regular customer contact and increased visibility of product performance and reliability.
​
Expand International Footprint
​
We have developed a large global presence in our business segments. CTS has delivered over 500 projects in 40 major markets on 4 continents to date. Approximately 41% of the CTS segment’s fiscal year 2020 sales were attributable to international customers. In fiscal 2018, CTS was selected by the Queensland Department of Transport & Main Roads (DTMR) in Australia to design, build and operate a new ticketing system for the state and signed a contract with Transport for New South Wales in Australia to build an Intelligent Congestion Management Platform. In 2017, CTS signed a contract with Transport for London (TfL) for a three-year extension of services to London’s Oyster and contactless ticketing system to extend the contract for these services from 2022 to 2025.

​
CGD has delivered systems in more than 34 allied nations. In fiscal year 2020, approximately 56% of CGD sales were to allied foreign governments and an additional 10% of CGD sales were to projects funded by the U.S. government pursuant to Foreign Military Sales and Foreign Military Financing arrangements. We have expanded our presence in the United Kingdom, Canada, and the Middle-East in response to growing opportunities. These complement a well-established and sound presence in Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, and Italy.
​
Our CMS products are designed to address the needs of numerous international defense and civil applications. Our ISR data links are used by a number of international allied forces. In early fiscal 2018, CMS was awarded an order to provide satellite communication solutions for the New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) under which we are supplying inflatable satellite antennas with supporting hardware and equipment training for the NZDF Network Enabled Army program. In addition, in late fiscal 2018 Australia’s Ministry of Defense procured CMS Atlas Strike kits that provide communications capability and situational awareness for Australia’s Joint Tactical Air Controllers. In fiscal 2019, CMS was awarded a contract from the New Zealand Ministry of Defence to deliver Command and Control (C2) capabilities to support the Network Enabled Army (NEA) program's Tactical Network (TNet) project. The NEA program is a transformational program to be delivered in four tranches over 12 years and will benefit the New Zealand Army's Land Forces and Special Operations Forces. The TNet contract is a framework agreement allowing multiple awards over the life of the contract to address current, emerging and future requirements through support of the four tranches.

​
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
​
We seek to protect our proprietary technology and inventions through patents and other proprietary-right protection, and also rely on trademark laws to protect our brand. However, we do not regard ourselves as materially dependent on patents for the maintenance of our competitive position. We also rely on trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation to remain competitive.
​
REGULATION
​
Our businesses must comply with and are affected by various government regulations that impact our operating costs, profit margins and our internal organization and operation of our businesses. We deal with numerous U.S. government agencies and entities, including all branches of the U.S. military and the DoD. Therefore, we must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of U.S. government and other contracts. These laws and regulations, among other things, include the Federal Acquisition Regulations and all department and agency supplements, which comprehensively regulate the formation, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts. These and other federal regulations require certification and disclosure of cost or pricing data in connection with contract negotiations for certain types of contracts, define allowable and unallowable costs, govern reimbursement rights under cost-based contracts, and restrict the use, dissemination and exportation of products and information classified for national security purposes. For additional discussion of government contracting laws and regulations and related matters, see “Risk Factors” and “Business—Industry Considerations” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgments—Revenue Recognition” with respect to pricing and revenue under government contracts.
​
Our business is subject to a range of foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding environmental protection and employee health and safety, including those that govern the emission and discharge of hazardous or toxic materials into the environment and the generation, storage, treatment, handling, use, transportation and disposal of such materials. From time to time, we have been named as a potentially responsible party at third-party waste disposal sites. We do not currently expect compliance with such laws and regulations to have a material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. However, such laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become increasingly stringent over time. Accordingly, we cannot assure that such laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our business in the future.
​
OTHER MATTERS
​
We do not generally engage in any business that is seasonal in nature. Since our revenues are generated primarily from work on contracts performed by our employees and subcontractors, first quarter revenues tend to be lower than the other three quarters due to our policy of providing many of our employees more holidays in the first quarter, compared to other quarters of the year. The U.S. government’s fiscal year ends on September 30 of each year. It is not uncommon for U.S. government agencies to award extra tasks or complete other contract actions in the weeks before the end of a fiscal year in order to avoid the loss of unexpended funds. These are not necessarily consistent patterns and depend upon actual activities in any given year. 
​
We employed approximately 6,100 persons at September 30, 2020.
​
Our domestic products and services are sold almost entirely by our employees. Overseas sales are made either directly or through representatives or agents.
