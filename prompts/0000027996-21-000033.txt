ITEM 1. BUSINESS


OUR BACKGROUND

Over 105 years ago, Deluxe Corporation began providing payment solutions. Our longevity is a testament to our innovation, our ability to evolve with our customers and the trust they place in us. We have transformed from a check printing company to a Trusted Business TechnologyTM company that champions business so communities thrive. We support millions of small businesses, thousands of vital financial institutions and hundreds of the world's largest consumer brands, while processing more than $2.8 trillion in annual payment volume. We operate primarily in the U.S., but we also sell our products and services in Canada, Australia and portions of Europe and South America.

OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

Effective January 1, 2020, we transitioned from a "company of companies" to a "company of products," reorganizing our management and reporting structure by product type. In conjunction with our reorganization, we began reporting operating results for 4 business segments: Payments, Cloud Solutions, Promotional Solutions and Checks. These segments provide the following products and services:

Business Segment | | Category | | Percentage of 2020 revenue | | Description 
Payments | | Treasury management solutions | | 12.6 | % | | Lockbox, remote deposit capture, integrated receivables, payment acceptance 
 | Other payment solutions | | 4.2 | % | | Payroll, disbursements, Medical Payment Exchange, Deluxe Payment Exchange, eChecks, fraud and security services
Cloud Solutions | | Web and hosted solutions | | 7.5 | % | | Web hosting and design, digital engagement, logo design, financial institution profitability reporting, business incorporation services
 | Data-driven marketing solutions | | 6.7 | % | | Solutions for marketing business-to-business and business-to-consumer 
Promotional Solutions | | Forms and other products | | 17.7 | % | | Business forms, accessories, strategic sourcing services 
 | Marketing and promotional solutions | | 11.9 | % | | Advertising specialties, promotional apparel, retail packaging 
Checks | | Checks | | 39.4 | % | | Printed personal and business checks 


OUR "ONE DELUXE" STRATEGY

Our vision is to be a Trusted Business Technology leader in payments and data. Payments encompasses all of the products and services that help our customers pay and get paid. Data includes our project and platform data businesses. To accomplish this, we are focused on the following key enablers:
•Our customers – Our products and services can be utilized by customers of all sizes and maturities. While we serve customers across all industries, we will focus our efforts on key verticals, including financial institutions, health care, real estate/construction and insurance. In addition, we continue to benefit from a long heritage of offering trusted service to our check customers, which in turn, fuels meaningful cash flow that is redeployed to invest in other areas of the company.
•World class payments and data products and platforms – We will continue investments to build market-leading payments and data products and platforms that are proprietary to Deluxe, so that our customers will build their businesses upon our platforms for the long-term.
•Scale – We believe our volumes in many of our service offerings enable us to offer per-unit costs and reliability superior to our competitors. We plan to continue to focus on scaling our product management capabilities and creating a product innovation center.
•Recurring and reoccurring revenue – Our focus will continue to be on offering products and integrated platforms that generate recurring and reoccurring revenue streams.
•Sales and distribution channels – We have extensive market reach, with millions of small business and consumer customers and thousands of financial institution clients. We plan to deploy our resources, including our sales force and our various strategic partnerships, to cost-effectively reach customers.
In support of our strategy, we continue to invest significant resources to build out our technology platforms. We completed the implementation of a human capital management system in January 2020. We also completed the first implementation phase of sales technology that enables a single view of our customers, thereby providing for deeper cross-sell opportunities, and we continue to invest in enhancing sales technology for continued optimization. In addition, we are investing in our financial tools, including an enterprise resource planning system. Strategically, we believe these enhancements will allow us to better assess and manage our business at the total company level and will make it easier for us to quickly integrate any future acquisitions. While we reduced certain expenditures in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have since resumed our investments in these initiatives and we plan to continue with important system implementations.
We expect to continue our efforts to simplify processes, eliminate duplicative processes and lower costs. During 2020, we continued to review our real estate footprint and announced plans to lower future operating expenses through further site consolidation. We closed 24 facilities during 2020, and we anticipate closing additional facilities in 2021. Additionally, we plan to continue to develop our post-COVID-19 operating model to match expected customer needs and anticipated volumes, as well as to gain efficiencies.

IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC

In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 to be a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic is having widespread, rapidly-evolving and unpredictable impacts on global society, economies, financial markets and business practices. Federal, state and foreign governments have implemented measures in an effort to contain the virus, including social distancing, travel restrictions, border closures, limitations on public gatherings, working from home, supply chain logistical changes, and restrictions on certain non-essential businesses. To protect the health and well-being of our employees, suppliers and customers, we have made substantial modifications to employee travel policies, implemented office closures as employees are advised to work from home, and cancelled or shifted conferences and other sales and marketing events to virtual events. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted, and will continue to impact, our business operations, including our employees, customers, partners and communities, and there is substantial uncertainty as to the nature and degree of its continued effects over time. Please refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations appearing in Part II, Item 7 of this report for further discussion regarding the impact of COVID-19 on our 2020 financial results.
The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business going forward will depend on numerous evolving factors we cannot reliably predict, including the severity and duration of the pandemic; governmental, business and individuals' actions in response to the pandemic; the timing and effectiveness of vaccines; and the resulting impact on economic activity and the financial markets. Please refer to the Risk Factors discussion appearing in Part I, Item 1A of this report for a discussion of these factors and other risks affecting our business, financial position, results of operations and prospects.

OUR SALES AND MARKETING STRATEGY

We continue to make progress in becoming a sales-driven revenue growth company. Everyone sells at Deluxe. We employ a comprehensive "One Deluxe" go-to-market approach, deploying a unified sales team with a complete view of our customer relationships, with the goal of bringing the best of Deluxe to every customer. Our customers rely on our solutions and platforms at all stages of their lifecycle, from start-up to maturity (as illustrated below), allowing our business segments to help each other deliver greater value for our customers and enabling our customers to build their businesses upon our platforms for the long-term. 
Note: Illustration is not indicative of our full set of products and services.
Our sales and marketing strategy employs a multi-channel, demand-generation approach. This includes our enterprise account model, under which our sales force sells directly to financial institutions and major global brands. We also sell our products and services through scalable partnerships, enabling us to cost-effectively reach customers, specifically leveraging our financial Institution partnerships, our e-commerce assets and other strategic partnerships. In addition, millions of in-bound customer contacts buying or re-ordering our products and services provide extensive cross-sell opportunities. In July 2020, we launched our free small business advisory service, providing our expertise to help businesses improve their marketing efforts, reach new customers, find inventive ways to save time and money, navigate how to grow or evolve their business, or start a new business. Excluding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe that we delivered sales-driven quarterly revenue growth throughout 2020, giving us confidence in our go-to-market approach.

INDUSTRY TRENDS AND OUR COMPETITION

Payments, including Checks
The payments industry continues to expand and evolve, with digital payment vehicles and transaction volumes growing around the world. The challenge for payment providers is to modernize their infrastructure to support new service offerings and to identify new revenue streams, as well as to invest in cloud computing and other digital technologies to more rapidly address evolving customer preferences. This pace of change puts pressure on payment providers to transform and adapt in order to remain competitive.
Competition in the payments industry is intense. We are competing against numerous financial technology (Fintech) companies, as well as financial institution in-house capabilities. Volume is the key to staying cost-competitive, and breadth of services is critical to staying relevant to customers. We believe our competitive advantages are: our scalable platform, our extensive distribution channels, frictionless payments (i.e., non-disruptive for payer, and payment choices for payee), our automated receivables management and our strong brand. We also believe there is great opportunity to convert paper checks to digital payments, which we are addressing with our Medical Payments Exchange (MPX) and Deluxe Payments Exchange platforms. 
Our Checks business remains an important part of our strategy. We believe there will continue to be demand for personal and business checks for the foreseeable future, although the total number of checks written in the U.S. has been in decline since the mid-1990s. The cash flow generated by our Checks business partially self-funds our growth investments. Our check programs are also an important source of lead generation for the cost-effective cross-selling of our products and services. Although we saw some decrease in our check volumes resulting from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we do not believe that the pandemic resulted in a significant shift from checks to digital payment solutions, and we have seen some recovery in business checks as a result of new small business formations.
Our Checks business faces intense competition from another large check printer in our traditional financial institution sales channel, from direct mail and internet-based sellers of personal and business checks, from check printing software vendors and from certain significant retailers. Pricing continues to be competitive in our financial institution sales channel, as financial institutions seek to maintain their previous levels of profitability, even as check usage declines. We believe our competitive advantages come from our design and customization options, our quality and service, the trust our customers have in us and our strong financial position.
Cloud Solutions
Data-driven marketing – With increased competition among businesses to target and engage new and existing customers, the use of data-driven marketing has continued to increase and evolve. Competition in this industry is intense, with a wide variety of companies in the data solutions space, including advertising agencies, marketing technology firms, data aggregators and brokers, and source data providers. Adapting to new technology is a key challenge in this industry, along with hiring and retaining the right people. We saw a decrease in data-driven marketing revenue as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as customers suspended their marketing campaigns because of the resulting economic uncertainty. We are not able to predict the rate at which this business will recover, but we are adapting to the changing needs of our customers and expanding our offerings to provide a greater breadth of services.
We believe we have significant growth opportunity in this market. We intend to simplify and integrate our separate businesses operating in this market, monetize the significant amount of data we process across the company, invest in technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, and consolidate our data infrastructure to reduce costs. We also believe that our pay-for-performance offerings provide us a competitive advantage.
Web and hosted solutions – The market for web hosting services is highly competitive and commoditized. As such, significant spending on product development and customer acquisition is required to compete in this space, and value-added services differentiate the competition. The markets for our hosted software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions, including search, social and email marketing, logo design and business incorporation services, are also large, dynamic and highly competitive, with dominant integrated players, as well as niche providers. We believe that it is easy to find our service offerings online, that they are simple to use and that they are competitively priced. We also believe that we will better compete in these markets as we optimize our suite of solutions to deliver more integrated offerings.
Promotional Solutions
The market for business forms and certain accessories has been declining for several years, as continual technological improvements have provided businesses with alternative means to execute and record business transactions. Greater acceptance of electronic signatures also has contributed to the overall decline in printed products. Demand for promotional products was significantly impacted in 2020 by the COVID-19 pandemic, as companies reduced their advertising and marketing spending in response to the overall economic decline and their customers' and governmental responses to the pandemic. We anticipate that demand for promotional products will improve as the overall economy recovers.
The markets for business forms and promotional products are intensely competitive and highly fragmented. Current and potential competitors include traditional storefront printing companies, office superstores, wholesale printers, online printing companies, small business product resellers and providers of custom apparel and gifts. We believe that our competitive advantages include our multi-channel experience, ease of use, our deep sources of supply and our branded merchandise. We also believe that, by expanding our product set and driving integration of physical and digital solutions, we will transition this segment to a technology-driven business that can respond quickly to market opportunities and differentiate us from our competitors. 

OUR OPERATIONS / SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES

We continue to focus on improving the customer experience by providing excellent service and quality, while increasing our productivity and reducing our costs. We accomplish this by embedding lean operating principles into our processes, while emphasizing a culture of continuous improvement. We have a shared services approach, which allows our businesses to leverage shared facilities to optimize capacity utilization and to enhance operational excellence. We continue to reduce costs by utilizing our assets and technologies more efficiently and by enabling employees to better leverage their capabilities and talents.
We continue to sponsor sustainability initiatives that encompass environmentally-friendly practices. We have aligned with suppliers that promote sustainable business practices and we seek opportunities to eliminate wasted material, reduce cycle times, use more environmentally-friendly materials and reduce solid waste sent to landfills. More than 90% of our check and forms paper is purchased from Forest Stewardship Council certified supplier mills, certain of our check designs are made from recycled paper and we use environmentally-friendly janitorial supplies in the majority of our locations. In 2019, we introduced our environmentally-responsible Smart Check by Deluxe® check configuration, which utilizes eco-friendly materials and plant-based ink. In addition, our sustainability initiatives over the past several years have focused on reducing our consumption of water, electricity and natural gas and improving our transportation efficiency. 

CYBERSECURITY

The secure and uninterrupted operation of our networks and systems, as well as the processing, maintenance and confidentiality of the sensitive information that resides on our systems, is critical to our business operations and strategy. Each year, we process hundreds of millions of records containing data related to individuals and businesses. In addition, many of our products are hosted solutions, and the amount of data we store for our customers on our servers, including personal, important business and other potentially sensitive information, has been increasing. Technology-based organizations such as ours are vulnerable to targeted attacks aimed at exploiting network and system applications or weaknesses. A successful cyber attack could result in the disclosure or misuse of sensitive business and personal information and data, cause interruptions in our operations, damage our reputation and deter clients and consumers from ordering our products and services. It could also result in litigation, the termination of client contracts, government inquiries and/or enforcement actions. 
We have a risk-based information/cybersecurity program dedicated to protecting our data and solutions. We employ a defensive in-depth strategy, utilizing the concept of security layers and the CIA (confidential, integrity and availability) triad model. Our information security program is led by our Chief Information Security Officer and the Information Security department, which establishes the policies, standards and strategies to manage security risk. 
We have an Enterprise Risk Management Steering Committee led by our Assurance and Risk Advisory Services group, our Chief Financial Officer and our Chief Administrative Officer, with participation from our executive leadership team and senior-level staff, including our Chief Information Officer, our Chief Strategy Officer, our Chief Compliance Officer, our Chief Information Security Officer and the Division Presidents. This committee assesses and monitors our top enterprise risks, including cybersecurity, and provides quarterly updates to our board of directors. Our Chief Information Security Officer also provides periodic updates to our board of directors.
In the event a cybersecurity incident is identified, we have a Cyber Security Incident Response team and an Incident and Crisis Response Program to ensure communication to our executive leadership team and to coordinate the response to any incident. Our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel, Chief Information Security Officer and Chief Compliance Officer are responsible for assessing such incidents for materiality, ensuring that any required notification or communication occurs and determining whether any prohibition on the trading of our common stock by insiders should be imposed prior to the disclosure of information about a material cybersecurity event.
For more information on risks related to data security, see Item 1A, "Operational Risks – Security breaches, computer malware or other cyber attacks involving the confidential information of our customers, employees or business partners could substantially damage our reputation, subject us to litigation and enforcement actions, and substantially harm our business and results of operations."

OUR MATERIALS, SUPPLIES AND SERVICE PROVIDERS

The principal materials used in producing our main products are paper, plastics, ink, corrugated packaging and printing plate material, which we purchase from various sources. We also purchase stock business forms and promotional apparel produced by third parties. We believe that we will be able to obtain an adequate supply of materials from current or alternative suppliers.
We have entered into agreements with third-party providers for delivery services and information technology services, including telecommunications, network server and transaction processing services. We also rely upon third parties to provide a portion of the data used to maintain our proprietary and non-proprietary databases, including credit and non-credit data from the national credit bureaus and other data brokers. We believe we would be able to obtain an alternative source of supply if one or more of our service providers failed to perform.

OUR HUMAN CAPITAL

Our most valuable asset is our employee-owners. As of December 31, 2020, we had 6,185 employees. Approximately 98% of our team is full-time employees, with 65% representing non-exempt roles working in production, processing or call center functions. We employ 5,487 employees in the United States, 586 employees in Canada and 112 employees in Australia and Europe. We are proud of our strong history of positive, productive employee relations. None of our employees are currently represented by labor unions. 
The foundation of our continuing success as a Trusted Business TechnologyTM company is our ability to attract and retain diverse, exceptional and motivated talent. We accomplish this by providing a culture of inclusion, diversity, equity, development, opportunity and empowerment. 
Results-Driven, Community-Focused, Collaborative Culture
We focus on creating an environment where our employee-owners, also known as Deluxers, feel respected and valued, and where they can contribute to their full potential. To this end, an important component of our One Deluxe strategy is that all North American employees own company stock. The heritage of the company also reflects deep-seated roots in community support and volunteerism, which is reflected in our purpose statement: “Champions for business so communities thrive.” Additionally, our values focus on delivering results:
•We put customers first.
•We earn trust.
•We create what’s next.
•We deliver for shareholders.
•We are a get-it-done team.
In an effort to continue to improve our culture and and engagement, we provide learning and development at all levels of the organization on a variety of topics, including inclusion, diversity and equity (ID&E), leadership development and mentoring. We also strive to ensure that we are consistently receiving real-time feedback and that we continue to focus on transparent communication channels through change pulse checks, surveys, senior leadership forums and employee resource groups. During 2020, we received certification as a Great Place to Work from The Great Place to Work Institute.
Inclusion, Diversity and Equity
We embrace ID&E in our workforce, customers, partners and shareholders, valuing their unique backgrounds, experiences, thoughts and talents. Our mission is to empower all employees to bring their full authentic selves to work as One Deluxe and to foster an environment that reflects the diverse communities we serve. We strive to cultivate a culture and vision that supports and enhances our ability to recruit, develop and retain diverse talent at every level. We provide our customers, partners, and shareholders information about our ID&E program and our activities supporting social justice within the communities we serve. In addition, we are focused on furthering our ID&E initiatives throughout our business and have, among other things, created an ID&E council that is sponsored by our Chief Communications and Human Resources Officer and our Chief Revenue Officer. This council is comprised of employee-owners across multiple functions and business segments. Its top priorities for the next two years include implementing a comprehensive ID&E learning and development plan to build awareness and drive inclusive behaviors, further developing our diversity pipeline through hiring, mentoring and coaching, and establishing goals and metrics to ensure progress.
As of December 31, 2020, our total workforce was approximately 55% female and 43% male. Our team members located in the United States were comprised of approximately 58% white, 14% Black or African American, 10% Asian American and 10% Hispanic or Latino.
Health, Wellness and Safety
Creating a culture where all employee-owners feel supported and valued is paramount to our One Deluxe strategy. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to unique challenges, and we continue to evolve our programs to support Deluxers’ health, safety and general well-being. 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes to our operating environment to help our employee-owners remain productive and safe. Among other things, nearly half of our employee-owners continue to work from home, and we have implemented additional safety measures for employees continuing essential on-site work. We also reconfigured our factory floors and other personnel areas to ensure sufficient distancing in high density areas of our facilities, and we installed Plexiglas shields, implemented modified training programs to comply with distancing requirements, substantially limited visitor entry, increased virtual meetings and adjusted shifts to aid in physical distancing. Finally, we continue to provide a competitive benefits package focused on fostering work/life integration.
Community Engagement 
Our employee-owners believe in the power of connection, of activity and of giving back to the communities we serve. That is why we have created multiple initiatives that focus on supporting our communities, both financially and with time and talent. It is essential to be invested and involved to attract and retain employees of the highest caliber.

SEASONALITY

Historically, we have experienced seasonal trends with some of our products and services. For example, holiday card and retail packaging sales and revenues from search and email marketing services are typically stronger in the fourth quarter of the year due to the holiday season. Sales of tax forms are stronger in the first and fourth quarters of the year, and direct-to-consumer check sales have historically been stronger in the first quarter of the year. In addition, we may experience some fluctuations in revenue driven by our customers' marketing campaign cycles.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

We are subject to numerous international, federal, state and local laws and regulations that affect our business activities in several areas, including, but not limited to, labor, advertising, taxation, data privacy and security, digital content, consumer reports, consumer protection, online payment services, real estate, e-commerce, intellectual property, health care, environmental matters, and workplace health and safety. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, local, state, national and international governments and health authorities have established myriad new laws, rules, regulations and orders. These emergency enactments evolve rapidly, and sometimes become effective within a 24-hour period. The complexity of complying with existing and new laws and regulations is significant, and regulators may adopt new laws or regulations at any time.
We believe that our business is operated in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. For more specific information about the effects of government regulation on our business, see Item 1A, "Legal and Compliance Risks – Governmental regulation is continuously evolving and could limit or harm our business." We believe that the impact on our capital expenditures and earnings of complying with government regulations will not be materially different in the upcoming year than it was in 2020.
