Item 1.           Business
Except as otherwise indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, all references to "Black Knight," the "Company," "we," "us" or "our" are to Black Knight, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries ("BKI").
Overview
Black Knight is a premier provider of integrated, innovative, mission-critical, high-performance software solutions, data and analytics to the U.S. mortgage and real estate markets. Our mission is to transform the markets we serve by delivering innovative solutions that are integrated across the homeownership lifecycle and that result in realized efficiencies, reduced risk and new opportunities for our clients to help them achieve greater levels of success. 
We believe our clients leverage our robust, integrated solutions across the entire homeownership lifecycle to help retain existing customers, gain new customers, mitigate risk and operate more efficiently. Our clients rely on our proven, comprehensive and scalable solutions and our unwavering commitment to delivering exceptional client support to achieve their strategic goals and better serve their customers.
We have a focused strategy of continuous innovation across our business, which is supported by acquisitions, and even more importantly, the integration of those acquisitions and our innovations into our broader ecosystem. Our ability to effectively manage our business and maintain a strong client base allows us to continually invest in our business, both to meet ever-changing industry requirements and to maintain our position as a leading provider of platforms for the mortgage and real estate markets.
Deep business and regulatory expertise along with a holistic view of the markets we serve allow us the privilege of being a trusted advisor to our clients, who range from the nation’s largest lenders and mortgage servicers to institutional portfolio managers and government entities, to individual real estate agents and mortgage brokers. Clients leverage our software ecosystem across a range of real estate and housing finance verticals through multiple digital channels, using our offerings to drive more business, reduce risk and deliver a best-in-class customer experience, all while operating more efficiently and cost-effectively.
We have long-standing relationships with our clients, a majority of whom enter into long-term contracts that include multiple, integrated products embedded into mission-critical processes. This speaks to the confidence our clients have in our solutions and our commitment to serve them. The contractual nature of our revenues and our client relationships make our revenues both highly visible and recurring in nature. Our scale and integrated ecosystem of solutions drive significant operating leverage and cross-sell opportunities, enabling our clients to continually benefit from new and greater operational efficiencies.
Overview of the Markets We Serve
The Black Knight ecosystem stretches across four core “pillar” verticals: mortgage loan servicing, mortgage loan origination, real estate and capital markets; with our data and analytics flowing throughout the interconnected ecosystem of solutions. As we integrate our innovations and acquired technologies, we are committed to continually improving the end consumer experience, driving further efficiencies for our clients and helping them to win new customers and retain existing customers.
Mortgage Loan Servicing
Once mortgage loans have been originated, the loans are onboarded to a servicing platform where servicers manage the loan and can provide borrowers and investors with information about those loans. Mortgage servicers (and sub-servicers) operate within a highly regulated industry segment and are responsible for overseeing the ongoing loan maintenance, payment collection, application process, escrow management, investor management, tax and insurance payments, etc. for approximately 66 million active first and second lien mortgage loans and lines of credit in the U.S.

Mortgage servicing is typically a long-term relationship between the customer and the servicer; and, the customer’s servicing experience can have a direct impact on the servicer’s ability to retain loans in its portfolios.
The number of first lien mortgage loans being serviced in the U.S. remains relatively consistent even through housing and economic downturns and changes in interest rates. The number of second lien mortgage loans being serviced can fluctuate according to factors such as available, or “tappable,” equity levels, interest rates and individual portfolio appetite for such loans. Refer to the Business Trends and Conditions section of Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for market data estimates for active first and second lien mortgage loans.
In times of economic stress, a servicer’s ability to manage their workload is often tested by distressed mortgages, defaults, foreclosure and bankruptcy actions. In such periods, loss mitigation, default processing, bankruptcy and more must be contended with, along with an ever-changing slate of regulatory requirements. The mortgage default process is long and complex and involves multiple parties, a significant exchange of data and documentation and extensive regulatory requirements. Innovative and trusted technology is essential in navigating this process efficiently and effectively.
Mortgage Origination
Mortgage origination is a complex process with multiple stages involving various parties, all of which are under high levels of regulatory scrutiny. Historically, many aspects of this process have been managed manually by lenders and other parties involved in the process, increasing the cost and complexity to originate a loan. The shift of consumer expectations and demands in recent years, which was accelerated by the pandemic, has created an increased demand for innovative solutions and the acceptance of digital technologies to meet the needs of market participants.
The U.S. mortgage origination market consists of both purchase and refinance loans, including cash-out refinances, and, to a lesser extent, second lien, equity-centric products such as home equity lines of credit (“HELOCs”). Participants in this market range from the largest U.S. banks, nonbanks and credit-union lenders; to independent and mid-sized banks; to wholesale and correspondent lenders; to mortgage brokerages and even the individual mortgage broker. Refer to the Business Trends and Conditions section of Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for market data estimates for the number of mortgage loans originated. 
Real Estate
The consumer journey to homeownership starts with identifying a property to purchase. The marketing, sales and purchase of real estate in the U.S. involves many participants. Needs exist for digital workflow, seamless data transfer between multiple sources and parties, and marketing and communication tools at the agent, broker and multiple listing service (“MLS”) levels.
Black Knight supports all participants in this process with technology to increase efficiencies, create new opportunities and manage complex workflows for all involved.
Capital Markets
The mortgage capital markets, both primary and secondary, play a critical role as providers of funding and liquidity that enable lenders to make home loans to borrowers. Mortgage loans are made possible in large part by market participants buying, selling or holding mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”) and loan portfolios.
Preeminent among capital market participants are the government-sponsored enterprises (“GSEs”), the Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”), who, along with the Government National Mortgage Association (“GNMA” or “Ginnie Mae”), the Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”) and the Veterans Administration (“VA”), provide back-stop guarantees to support market stability and help minimize systemic risk.
Market oversight is performed by federal and state regulators with the Federal Reserve, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the Federal Finance Housing Agency (“FHFA”), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency

(“OCC”) and the Consumer Financial Protection Board (“CFPB”) all playing major roles in ensuring market transparency, financial institution safety and soundness and consumer protection.
The informed investment in and trading of mortgage loans and MBS is dependent upon reliable, quality data at both the pool and loan level, plus robust analytics and the tools to use them effectively. An incredible amount of information gathering and assessing goes into making these investment decisions. Dealing with pools or portfolios of real estate or mortgage-related assets requires even more information. Loan-level mortgage performance, real estate price trends and credit-risk data are valuable and necessary insights needed by capital market participants to make informed decisions.
In the age of “big data,” this level of detailed information equates to many terabytes of data points, which can be an overwhelming amount of data to sift through and analyze without the right tools and solutions; however, that data can provide critical insights for those who can effectively decipher it.
Market Trends
Market trends that have spurred lenders and servicers to seek software, data and analytics solutions are as follows:
Lenders increasingly focused on core operations. As a result of a decline in origination volumes and the increasing cost to originate a mortgage loan, we believe lenders have become more focused on their core operations, including ways to reduce or eliminate certain costs. According to the MBA Quarterly Performance Report as of November 21, 2022, the cost to originate a loan has more than doubled since 2008 and increased 22% in 2022 compared to 2021. We believe lenders are increasingly shifting from in-house solutions to third-party solutions that provide a more comprehensive and efficient solution. Lenders require these providers to deliver best-in-class solutions and deep domain expertise and to assist them in maintaining regulatory compliance.
Integral role of technology in the U.S. mortgage market. Over the past decade, homebuyers’ processes have become more digital, and banks and other lenders and servicers have become increasingly focused on automation and workflow management to operate more efficiently and meet their regulatory requirements as well as using technology to enhance the consumer experience during the mortgage loan origination, closing, and servicing processes. Technology providers must be able to support the complexity and dynamic nature of the market, display extensive industry knowledge and possess the financial resources to make the necessary investments in technology and software to support lenders and servicers. This includes an enhanced digital experience along with the application of artificial intelligence, robotic process automation and adaptive learning.
Heightened demand for enhanced transparency and analytic insight. As the U.S. mortgage loan market participants work to minimize risk in lending, servicing and capital markets, they rely on the integration of data and analytics with solutions that enhance the decision-making process. These industry participants are eager for timely data and insights to help them plan and react to the changing environment.
Regulatory changes and oversight. Most U.S. mortgage loan market participants are subject to a high level of regulatory oversight and regulatory requirements as federal and state governments have enacted various new laws, rules and regulations. It is our experience that mortgage lenders and servicers have become more focused on minimizing the risk of non-compliance with regulatory requirements and look for solutions that assist them in complying with their regulatory requirements. We expect this trend to continue as additional governmental programs and regulations have been enacted to address the economic concerns resulting from the pandemic, and our clients have had to adapt their systems and processes in record time to the shifting landscape. In addition, our clients and our clients’ regulators have elevated their focus on privacy and data security in light of an increased level of cybersecurity incidents. We expect the industry focus on privacy and data security to continue to increase.
Solutions for the Markets We Serve
Our business is organized into two segments: Software Solutions and Data and Analytics. Together they represent an integrated ecosystem that spans the entirety of the real estate and mortgage continuum, from homebuying and selling to loan origination, through loan servicing and capital markets and back again.

5



The Black Knight ecosystem lets clients access a comprehensive, integrated software and workflow management solution set via multiple segment-specific digital channels. Enhanced by large mortgage-specific datasets and robust proprietary analytics, our ecosystem helps our clients achieve greater levels of success from a trusted provider that continually delivers innovative technologies across our ecosystem.

Software Solutions
Our Software Solutions segment includes proven and trusted platforms that facilitate, automate and enhance many mission-critical business processes across the mortgage loan lifecycle continuum. Our offerings help clients in this segment, primarily mortgage lenders, servicers and investors, reduce costs, improve operations and provide an exceptional customer experience. Our software solutions are developed to meet the current and future needs of the markets we serve. In developing and delivering our products and solutions, we leverage a combination of private cloud, public cloud, application programming interfaces (“APIs”) and a host of other technology-forward approaches to best meet the needs of our vast and strong client base. 
As a result of our leadership, combined with our extensive knowledge of the mortgage industry and technology, we are uniquely positioned to drive innovation in this space and bring the digital revolution to mortgage servicing for both borrowers and servicers alike. While we relentlessly pursue the enhancement of the consumer experience throughout the real estate and mortgage continuum, we are equally focused on innovating on the back end for servicers as well. 
Servicing Software Solutions
MSP® is a SaaS solution that supports first lien mortgages and home equity loans and lines of credit, on a single platform. This complete, scalable, end-to-end system is used by servicers and sub-servicers to manage all servicing processes, including loan setup and maintenance, escrow administration, investor reporting, regulatory requirements and more. MSP® helps servicers increase efficiency, reduce operating costs and improve risk mitigation for approximately 36 million active loans currently serviced on the system.
MSP® serves as the core system of record and is enhanced with innovative digital solutions, all of which were developed using the most appropriate, forward-leaning technologies and are seamlessly integrated into the system of record. Servicing DigitalSM has seen tremendous adoption since its launch in 2018, with the majority of MSP® clients now offering the white-labeled, consumer facing application to their customers.
Servicing DigitalSM is an interactive, user-friendly web and mobile solution for consumers that provides easy access to customized, timely information about their mortgages. This powerful application supports deeper customer relationships for our clients and engagement by enabling their customers to make mortgage payments and explore opportunities for refinancing and more, all from the convenience of the web or a mobile device. By providing value-added services and information to borrowers, Servicing DigitalSM helps improve customer retention and serves as a direct communication channel between servicer and borrower.

Servicing DigitalSM is integrated with our Customer ServiceSM solution, which allows our clients’ customer service representatives to have access to the same information and layout a customer sees to better facilitate successful interactions and outcomes, which is key to increasing borrower retention. We launched Developer PortalSM in January 2023, which provides clients, third-party providers and their developers access to our growing catalog of APIs across the mortgage life cycle. APIs expose business functionality and data that are packaged into reusable services that follow industry standard protocols and conventions to allow ease of integration. Clients can use our APIs to rapidly embed additional functionality within their applications, driving intuitive and frictionless experiences.
Our default servicing solutions help simplify the complex process for loans that move into default, while supporting servicers with their compliance requirements. As part of this suite, we offer an advanced Loss MitigationSM solution to facilitate more efficient loss mitigation processes. This feature-rich, web-based solution supports industry-standard retention and liquidation workouts to streamline the loss mitigation process and reduce risk. It is also available to consumers through Servicing DigitalSM and uses advanced rules and logic to guide users through processes step-by-step, including validation points throughout the workflow, to reduce missed steps and overlooked information. When loans move through the loss-mitigation process and become non-performing loans, our suite of innovative default servicing solutions help servicers reduce cycle times, decrease operating costs and improve efficiencies throughout the bankruptcy, foreclosure and claims stages.
We also offer advanced technology to support the bankruptcy and foreclosure process, and more efficiently manage claims related to properties in foreclosure, as well as tools to support loss analysis, helping servicers make the right decisions at the right time.
Origination Software Solutions
Our Empower® loan origination system (“LOS”) was developed to be hosted in a public or private cloud. The platform’s advanced automation capabilities, lights-out processing and seamless integrations with our other and third-party services help fulfill, streamline and improve upon the many pieces of the origination process. Integrated pipeline analytics, AI-powered underwriter efficiency tools, fee services, settlement services fulfillment, an advanced eClosing platform and more all combine to create a frictionless process that benefits both borrower and lender alike. In recognition of the dynamic nature of mortgage markets, Empower® offers maximum flexibility by giving lenders the ability to originate first lien mortgages, second lien mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit, and supporting retail, consumer‐direct, home equity, correspondent, wholesale and assumption channels on a single, unified platform.
We also offer product, pricing and eligibility (PPE) engines for brokers and lenders that allow lenders and brokers to provide borrowers with loan product and pricing options to meet the consumer’s needs. Our Optimal Blue PPE serves the retail market by providing lenders with access to hundreds of investors and the mortgage products they offer.
Our Borrower DigitalSM solution enables lenders to offer our AI-enhanced digital point of sale to walk their loan applicants through a friendly and intuitive prequalification/qualification Q&A, with seamless data transfer to lender systems. Customer engagement is active, immediate and targeted, and presents a smooth front end to a process that will carry the loan applicant, and a single source/repository of their data, all the way through to closing and beyond. We also drive the full origination and underwriting workflow for lenders of all sizes via our Empower® LOS.
Additionally, our digital loan officer technology makes the day-to-day lives of loan officers more productive through vastly simplified workflows while also helping them provide an exceptional level of service to loan applicants. With the same anytime, anywhere convenience provided by all of our consumer-facing digital products, Loan Officer DigitalSM facilitates seamless interaction between the loan officer and loan applicant throughout the entire process, from application to close. With the loan applicant engaged via the Borrower DigitalSM interface, Loan Officer DigitalSM enables loan officers to remain connected with their customers, providing timely updates and assistance when needed. Again, all data is captured and can be shared with our Empower® LOS.
After loan approval, loan applicants can view their loan status, review their closing package and eSign documents using our Expedite® Close solution. Loan applicants can also leverage our DocVerify® remote online notarization solution, making fully digital closings possible where legally permissible, with all activity tracked and logged for audit purposes.

Recent trends show that consumers have been turning to mortgage brokers more often than before. Our LoanCatcher® cloud-based LOS, designed specifically for the needs of brokers, is both innovative and easy-to-use. It gives brokers affordable access to a robust software solution, integrated with the data and customer support solutions they need to provide exceptional levels of service to their customers. 
In support of our focus on integration, LoanCatcher® is integrated with our LoanSifter® PPE and is also designed to meet the very specific needs of the broker community by providing access to hundreds of investors and thousands of loan products. All of this combined with system-agnostic delivery to whatever LOS their wholesale lender partners are using provides brokers with a truly end-to-end solution to manage and grow their businesses.
Generating and fostering new leads is critical to growing a lender’s business. Creating customers for life is equally as important and becomes increasingly more important as interest rates rise. To help create long-term customers and earn repeat business, we offer lenders the SurefireSM solution, which helps lenders close more loans by providing communications the lenders can send through an automated system to their customers throughout the mortgage process. The SurefireSM system distributes leads, nurtures them to application, educates and informs borrowers throughout the application and funding process, and provides omni-channel outreach post-close designed to capture repeat business. We believe the key to cultivating lifelong clients is keeping in touch, and SurefireSM’s milestone tracking allows users to reach customers with personalized, relevant content.
Our CompassEdge hedging and trading platform supports originators of every size by providing sophisticated pipeline risk management tools and analytics, as well as dynamic loan sale and mortgage servicing rights valuation functionality. 
Data and Analytics
Our Data and Analytics segment is comprised of our extensive data offerings, proven credit and prepayment models, custom and proprietary analytics, valuation and MLS solutions and much more. In addition, the integration of data and insights from solutions in this segment informs, supports and enhances our other software solutions to help lenders and servicers make more informed decisions, improve performance, identify and predict risk and generate more qualified leads. 
We have aggregated one of the largest residential real estate data sets currently available in the U.S. This data set is derived from both proprietary and public record sources. From nationwide MLS listings to our industry-leading McDash® loan-level mortgage loan performance data, to public property records covering more than 99.9% of the U.S. population, our datasets are indispensable for those working with housing assets.
Leveraging this data, subject to any applicable restrictions, alongside our long history and deep understanding of the housing market, we have created detailed data solutions that assist in portfolio management, valuations, property records, lead generation and improved risk analysis for all aspects of servicing, origination, real estate and capital markets. In addition, we deliver data and analytics to clients in real estate, title insurance, MLS and other verticals that rely on property data-centric solutions to make informed decisions and run their businesses.
We also offer a highly accurate behavioral model built on our datasets and other third-party sources that forecasts prepayments, default, delinquencies and losses on residential mortgage loans and securities. Used for portfolio analysis, our AFTSM solution can serve as a powerful risk mitigation tool as well as a key component of any data-driven retention efforts.
Accurate valuations are critical to any real-estate transaction. Our automated valuation models (“AVMs”) are built on the foundation of our property data, proprietary information, proven methodologies and advanced user and performance testing and deliver exceptionally reliable automated property valuations. 
To better understand the housing market, we also leverage MLS and property data to provide near-real-time daily data views of the housing market, looking at home prices, inventory levels, days on market and other key indicators at the state, core based statistical areas and zip code levels.

We also provide data solutions that enable our clients to analyze big data sets through the synergistic convenience of a single data science workspace. Our cloud-based enterprise data and analytics solution, RAP®, is an interactive data science platform that allows clients to quickly aggregate data from our extensive mortgage and housing data marketplace with their own data sources to execute both custom and proprietary queries. 
Our real estate focused clients leverage our market-leading software solution for regional MLS associations to manage property listings. The platform also enables membership management, provides tools for collaboration with loan officers and other affiliates and marketing tools to effectively meet dynamic market challenges.
Focus on Value-Driven Innovation
The value our clients place on innovation can be seen in the adoption rates of the next-gen products we have delivered. When developing and delivering our products, we leverage a combination of private cloud, public cloud, APIs and a host of other technology-forward options that allow us to deliver innovative solutions to market quickly in response to address our clients’ biggest challenges.
Our solutions are designed to be scalable, secure, flexible, standards-based and web-connected for easy use. Further, we have a proven history of bringing solutions to market quickly due to investments we have made in integrating and streamlining our software and development processes.

Market leadership with comprehensive and integrated solutions. We are a leading provider of comprehensive and integrated solutions for the markets we serve. This leadership position is the result of strong client relationships, our knowledgeable employees who are focused on delivering superior solutions and support and delivering innovative solutions. 
We have used this insight to develop a comprehensive, integrated ecosystem of proprietary software, data and analytics solutions to automate many of the mortgage and real estate markets’ mission-critical business processes. These integrated solutions reduce manual processes, help improve organizational compliance and mitigate risk, and ultimately deliver significant cost savings to our clients.
Broad and deep client relationships with significant recurring revenues. We have long-standing, relationships with many of our clients. We frequently enter into long-term contracts with our software solutions clients that contain a base subscription fee with additional fees that are activity-based. Our products are typically embedded within our clients’ mission-critical workflow and decision-making processes across various parts of their organizations.
Extensive data assets and analytics capabilities. We develop and maintain large, accurate and comprehensive data sets on the real estate and mortgage markets that we believe are competitively differentiated. Our unique data sets provide a combination of public and proprietary data, and each of our data records features many attributes. Our data scientists bring comprehensive analytical capabilities to bear against these data sets, subject to any applicable use restrictions, to create highly customized reports. These reports include models of customer behavior for originators and servicers, portfolio analytics for capital markets and government agencies and proprietary market insights for real estate market participants.

Our Strategy
Our comprehensive integrated solutions ecosystem; unique, robust data and analytic capabilities; differentiated business model; broad and deep client relationships; and other competitive strengths put us in a very strong position to pursue multiple avenues for growth opportunities. We intend to continue to expand and grow our business through the following key strategies:
Win new clients. We intend to attract new clients by demonstrating the value proposition provided by our software and comprehensive solutions offering. In addition to top tier mortgage loan originators and servicers, where we have had and continue to have success, we believe there continues to be a significant opportunity to penetrate the mid-tier mortgage loan originators and servicers, as well as mortgage broker, markets. We believe these institutions can benefit from our proven solutions suite to address complex regulatory requirements and compete more effectively in the evolving mortgage loan market. We intend to continue to pursue all of these channels and benefit from the low incremental cost of adding new clients to our scalable applications and infrastructure.
Cross-sell existing products. The Black Knight ecosystem offers a wide variety of opportunities for existing clients to reap further benefits when they increase their use of our solutions across the real estate and mortgage continuum through integrations and seamless data sharing. It therefore also represents a substantial opportunity for growth as we seek to assist our clients in realizing the value of additional offerings and the benefits they provide. We intend to broaden and deepen existing client relationships through cross sales of solutions, data and analytics that reveal opportunity for client-side improvement of one form or another. We aim to help our clients see the true benefit of our fully integrated solutions ecosystem and the compound value of leveraging multiple solutions simultaneously. Helping our clients better focus on their core businesses and customers will put us in a better position to expand those existing relationships while adding value.
Solution development and innovation. Our long-term vision is to continue to lead through innovation and to maintain our leadership role in providing software, data and analytics to the mortgage and real estate markets. We intend to continue to innovate with urgency and integrate new solutions with our platforms in ways that bring the most value to our clients and their customers. We have a strong track record of introducing and developing new solutions that are tailored to specific industry trends and enhance our clients’ core operating functions. By working in partnership with key clients, we have been able to develop and market new and advanced solutions that meet the evolving demands of the mortgage and consumer loan, real estate and capital markets verticals. In addition, we will continue to develop and leverage insights from our large public and proprietary data assets to further improve our client value proposition.
Selectively pursue acquisitions. The core focus of our strategy is to grow organically. However, we may selectively evaluate acquisition opportunities that would allow us to expand our footprint, broaden our client base and deepen our product and service offerings. We believe there are meaningful benefits that result from acquiring companies that provide best-in-class single point solutions. Integrating and cross selling these point solutions into our broader client base and integrating acquisitions into our efficient operating environment would potentially result in revenues and cost synergies. Additionally, new directions for product development often materialize when acquired companies are integrated into the wider ecosystem.
Our Clients
We provide solutions to financial institutions, mortgage lenders and servicers, mortgage brokers, investors, attorneys, trustees and real estate professionals.
The U.S. mortgage loan industry is concentrated among the top 25 institutions, and our most significant and long-term relationships tend to follow the industry landscape. The number of solutions being used by each client in this category continues to grow, as the compounded value of multiple of our products becomes clearer over time. Because of the depth of these relationships, we derive a significant portion of our revenues from our largest clients.
For the year ended December 31, 2022, our five largest clients accounted for approximately 23% of our consolidated revenues and approximately 25% of our Software Solutions segment revenues. However, the revenues in each case are 

10



spread across a range of services and are subject to multiple, separate contracts. Although the diversity of the services we provide to each of these clients reduces the risk that we would lose all of the revenues associated with any of these clients, a significant deterioration in our relationships with or the loss of any one or more of these clients could have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition. See Item 1A. Risk Factors of Part I of this Report.
Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing efforts are focused on generating new leads to both securing new clients in our target markets, as well as cross sell our integrated solutions ecosystem to existing clients.
Regardless of the market we are serving, our sales and marketing strategy remains the same: communicate how our solutions address the challenges facing a specific market and deliver those messages where the companies we serve are engaging. We establish relationships, deliver proven solutions and continually build trust. Our experienced sales personnel are subject matter experts in our services, the needs of our clients and the markets we serve.
We are able to effectively communicate the value of our ecosystem by developing and delivering solutions that move the needle by helping our clients achieve greater levels of success. We know that references from colleagues in the industry are one of the top reasons a provider is selected, so we remain committed to delivering powerful solutions that cultivate those references.
Our relationships with so many different companies across the real estate and mortgage sectors provide us with a unique opportunity to gain insight into trends and challenges facing the industry. We couple that with thoughtful analysis of our vast data assets to develop solutions and provide industry insights others cannot. We are also focused on sharing that thought leadership with our clients, the media, the public and our entire industry.
To understand what will help our various and disparate market segments succeed, we also conduct market research through conversations with clients and prospects, market surveys, industry reports and discussions with other industry leaders. Likewise, we also host client user groups and participate in user forums to understand the needs and concerns of the everyday users of our solutions.
We deliver our messages where the companies we serve are congregating, through tradeshows, events, publications, digital channels, etc., and engage them in conversations that highlight the many differentiators/competitive advantages we provide through our continual innovations. We engage with existing clients on a regular basis and continually focus on engaging with prospective clients. Given the broad range of solutions we offer, we have significant opportunity to expand our sales to our existing client base through cross-selling efforts.
We have a core team of account managers who cross-sell solutions to existing clients at the top-tier and mid-tier U.S. mortgage loan originators and servicers, as well as a number of other financial institutions, investors and real estate professionals. We engage in strategic account reviews, during which our executives share their knowledge of clients and the market to determine the best sales approach on a client-by-client basis. As a result, we believe we have created an effective cross-selling culture within our organization.
Research and Development
Our research and development activities are core to our corporate mission of transforming the industry through innovation. As such, they relate to the design, development, integration and enhancement of the software applications that make up our solution ecosystem. We expect to continue our practice of investing an appropriate level of resources to maintain, enhance and extend the functionality of our existing proprietary systems and software applications; to develop new and innovative systems and software applications in response to the needs of our clients as well as market and regulatory conditions and to enhance the capabilities of the ecosystem infrastructure. We work with our clients to determine the appropriate timing and approach to introducing technology or infrastructure changes to our applications and services.

11



Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of contractual restrictions, internal security practices and copyright and trade secret laws to establish and protect our software, technology, data and expertise. Further, we have developed strong brand recognition, which has helped us accumulate goodwill in the marketplace, and we rely on the above to protect our rights in that area. We intend to continue our policy of taking all measures we deem necessary to protect our copyright, trade secret and trademark rights.
Competition
The multiple business verticals in which we engage are highly competitive. We believe that compounded benefits of our integrated ecosystem of software and data and analytics solutions represent a value proposition that is strong and wholly unique to us. Our economies of scale in the mortgage loan origination and servicing markets also provide us with a distinct competitive advantage in each of these categories. Based on our knowledge of the industry and competitors, we believe that no single competitor is capable of delivering the depth and breadth of solutions we are able to offer.
Competitive factors in processing businesses include the quality of the technology-based application or service, application features and functions, ease of delivery and integration, ability of the provider to maintain, enhance and support the applications or services and pricing. 
Software Solutions. Our Software Solutions segment competes with our clients’ internal technology departments and other third-party providers of similar systems. Competitive factors include the quality of the technology-based application or service, application features and functions, ease of delivery and integration, ability of the provider to maintain, enhance and support the applications or services, client support and pricing. We believe that our ability to deliver proven and integrated software solutions, the adoption rate of our solutions, our focus on supporting our clients on a daily basis and the economies of scale we offer in the mortgage loan processing business provide us with a competitive advantage in each of these categories.
Data and Analytics. In our Data and Analytics segment, we compete primarily with third-party providers of similar data assets, including certain niche providers, and in-house capabilities. We compete based on the breadth and depth of our data; the exclusive nature of some of our key data sets; robust proprietary analytics and the capabilities to produce highly customized reports. We believe that the quality of the data we offer is distinguished by the broad range of our data sources, including non-public sources; the volume of records we maintain; our ability to integrate our data and analytics across our ecosystem; and the ability to leverage our market leading position in the mortgage loan origination and servicing industries.
Government Regulations
Various aspects of our businesses are subject to federal and state regulations. Our failure to comply with any applicable laws and regulations could result in restrictions on our ability to provide certain services, as well as the possible imposition of civil fines and criminal penalties.
As a provider of electronic data processing to financial institutions, such as banks and credit unions, we are subject to regulatory oversight and examination by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council ("FFIEC"), an interagency body of the Federal Reserve Board ("FRB"), the CFPB, the federal banking agencies and various other federal and state regulatory authorities. We also may be subject to possible review by state agencies that regulate banks in each state in which we conduct our electronic processing activities.
Our financial institution clients are required to comply with various privacy laws and regulations under state and federal law, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. These laws and regulations place restrictions on the use of non-public personal information. All financial institutions must disclose detailed privacy policies to their customers and offer them the opportunity to direct the financial institution not to share information with third parties. The regulations, however, permit financial institutions to share information with non-affiliated parties who perform services for the financial institutions. As a provider of services to financial institutions, we are required to comply with the same privacy regulations 

12



and are generally bound by the same limitations on disclosure of the information received from our clients as those that apply to the financial institutions themselves.
Many consumer advocates, privacy advocates and government regulators believe that existing laws and regulations do not adequately protect privacy or ensure the accuracy of consumer-related data. As a result, multiple consumer privacy laws have been implemented at the state level which regulate the acquisition, dissemination, and commercial use of personal information. These consumer privacy laws include the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), as modified by the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) which was effective January 1, 2023; the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (“VCDPA”) which was effective January 1, 2023; the Colorado Privacy Act (“CPA”) which will be effective July 1, 2023; the Connecticut Data Privacy Act (“CTDPA”) which will be effective July 1, 2023; and the Utah Consumer Privacy Act (“UCPA”) which will be effective December 31, 2023. Generally, these laws seek to implement further restrictions on the acquisition, dissemination, and commercial use of personal information and also contemplate requirements relative to data accuracy, the ability of consumers to opt out of certain processing of personal information, the right to access personal information and to obtain a copy, and the right to delete personal information in certain circumstances. These laws are directly applicable to our clients as well as to us in certain circumstances and are applicable to us in a reduced capacity when we act as service providers to our clients. 
 Laws such as the Vermont Act Relating to Data Brokers and Consumer Protection (the “Vermont Data Broker Law”) also place restrictions and requirements on the use of publicly available data, and laws such as the New York Department of Financial Services Cybersecurity Requirements for Financial Services Companies (“NY DFS Cybersecurity Regulation”) provide for certain security requirements surrounding the collection and maintenance of certain business and consumer nonpublic personal information. 
Increased scrutiny of all parties involved in the mortgage loan industry by governmental authorities has included federal and state government review of all aspects of the mortgage lending business, including an increased legislative and regulatory focus on consumer protection practices. Future legislative or regulatory changes are difficult to predict and new laws or regulations that may be implemented by the CFPB or other regulatory bodies may require us to change our business practices or cause us to incur increased costs to comply.
Information Technology and Security
We are highly dependent on information technology networks and systems to securely process, transmit and store electronic information. Attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency, complexity and sophistication and we expect this trend to continue. Such attacks have become a point of focus for individuals, businesses and governmental entities. These attacks can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, including non-public personal information of consumers and proprietary business information. Refer to the "Risks Related to Information Security" section of Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information.
We protect our data assets by providing centralized security solutions and enforcing a defense-in-depth, centralized model that includes deterring, detecting, preventing, analyzing and containing security incidents. We focus on all areas of cybersecurity including threat and vulnerability management, security monitoring, identity and access management, phishing awareness, risk oversight, third-party risk management, disaster recovery and continuity management. We make strategic investments in information security to protect our clients and our information systems. This includes both capital expenditures and operating expenses for hardware, software, personnel and consulting services.
As our primary solutions and services evolve, we apply a comprehensive approach to the mitigation of identified security risks. We have established policies, including those related to privacy, information security and cybersecurity, and we employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques.

The Risk Committee of our Board of Directors oversees the ERM and Compliance programs through regular reports from our Chief Risk Officer, Chief Information Security Officer and Chief Compliance Officer, and reports on these matters to our board of directors.
