Sales, Marketing and Distribution
We sell our products directly to OEMs, distributors and end-users. We have multiple business units that promote our brands across their respective sales organizations. These sales organizations consist of varying combinations of our own internal direct sales people as well as exclusive and non-exclusive manufacturers' representative organizations.
We operate large distribution facilities in Plainfield, Indiana; El Paso and McAllen, Texas; LaVergne, Tennessee; Florence, Kentucky; and Monterrey, Mexico which serve as hubs for our North American distribution and logistics operations. Products are shipped from these facilities to our customers utilizing common carriers. We also operate numerous warehouse and distribution facilities in our global markets to service the needs of our customers. In addition, we have many manufacturer representatives' warehouses located in specific geographic areas to serve local customers.
We derive a significant portion of revenue from our OEM customers. In our HVAC business, a large portion of our sales are to key OEM customers which makes our relationship with each of these customers important to our business. We have long standing relationships with these customers and we expect these customer relationships will continue for the foreseeable future. Despite this relative concentration, we had no customer that accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2020, fiscal 2019 or fiscal 2018.
Many of our motors are incorporated into residential applications that OEMs sell to end users. The number of installations of new and replacement HVAC systems, pool pumps and related components is higher during the spring and summer seasons due to the increased use of air conditioning and swimming pools during warmer months. As a result, our revenues tend to be higher in the second and third quarters.

We have developed and acquired global operations in locations such as China, Europe, India, Mexico and Thailand so that we can sell our products in these markets, follow our multinational customers, take advantage of global talent and complement our flexible, rapid response operations in the US, Canada and Europe. Our vertically integrated manufacturing operations, including our own aluminum die casting and steel stamping operations, are an important element of our rapid response capabilities. In addition, we have an extensive internal logistics operation and a network of distribution facilities with the capability to modify stock products to quickly meet specific customer requirements. This gives us the ability to efficiently and promptly deliver a customer's unique product to the desired location.
We manufacture a majority of the products that we sell, but also strategically source components and finished goods from an established global network of suppliers. We aggressively pursue global sourcing to reduce our overall costs and lead-time. We generally maintain a dual sourcing capability to ensure a reliable supply source for our customers, although we do depend on a limited number of single source suppliers for certain materials and components. We regularly invest in machinery and equipment to improve and maintain our facilities. Additionally, we have typically obtained significant amounts of quality capital equipment as part of our acquisitions, often increasing overall capacity and capability. Base materials for our products consist primarily of steel, copper and aluminum. Additionally, significant components of our product costs consist of bearings, electronic assemblies, permanent magnets and ferrous and non-ferrous castings.
The Regal Business System is our enterprise-wide framework for continuous improvement. With our corporate values as its foundation, the Regal Business System enables effective goal alignment, collaborative problem solving and sharing of best practices, tools, skills and expertise to achieve our objectives. Through the relentless commitment to continuous improvement, we strive to elevate safety, quality, delivery, cost and growth performance of the business with the goal of exceeding the expectations of our customers, our associates and our shareholders. 
Facilities 
We have manufacturing, sales and service facilities in the US, Mexico, China, Europe, India, Thailand, and Australia, as well as a number of other locations throughout the world. Our Commercial Systems segment currently includes 46 manufacturing, service, office and distribution facilities of which 14 are principal manufacturing facilities and 3 are principal warehouse facilities.

As of January 2, 2021, our backlog was $444.8 million, as compared to $415.9 million on December 28, 2019. We believe that virtually all of our backlog will be shipped in fiscal 2021.
Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
We own a number of US patents and foreign patents relating to our businesses. While we believe that our patents provide certain competitive advantages, we do not consider any one patent or group of patents essential to our business as a whole. We also use various registered and unregistered trademarks, and we believe these trademarks are significant in the marketing of most of our products. However, we believe the successful manufacture and sale of our products generally depends more upon our technological, manufacturing and marketing skills.
Human Capital Management
At the end of fiscal 2020, we employed approximately 23,000 full-time associates worldwide. Of those associates, approximately 11,000 were located in Mexico; approximately 3,700 in the US; approximately 3,000 in China; approximately 2,200 in India; and approximately 3,100 in the rest of the world. 
We feel that our associates are our most valuable assets, and consider our associate relations to be very good. Our objective is to create a high-performing organization by attracting and retaining high-quality, diverse talent and creating an environment in which all associates have the opportunity to reach their full potential. 
The core goal of our performance management process is to develop and maintain a high-performing organization that is positioned to meet our business objectives. Creating a high-performing organization requires associates and managers to exhibit transparency in their day-to-day interactions, and use data to drive decision-making and accountability. Our performance management process focuses on enabling associates and managers to gain alignment through:
•a structured annual goal-setting process where managers and associates work collaboratively to develop specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time bound (SMART) goals that align with our overarching business objectives and our company values;
•clear, organization-wide expectations that managers and associates monitor progress toward completion of their SMART goals with regular coaching sessions and periodic evaluations; and
•an annual performance assessment that provides a direct link between the associate’s pay and performance.
In addition to our focus on performance, we also have a strong commitment to our company values of integrity, responsibility, diversity and inclusion, customer success, innovation with purpose, continuous improvement, performance, and a passion to win, all with a sense of urgency. We regularly promote these values from the top down. In 2020, both our executive leadership team and some of our associates participated in a series of videos that communicated the importance our values to our global workforce. In addition to instilling our corporate values as a key part of associate life, we promote a commitment to ethics and compliance among our workforce through our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. In 2020, 98.6% of our global workforce completed training on the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. 
As mentioned above, diversity and inclusion are rooted in our company values. We believe that we are at our best when we bring to bear the unique perspectives, experiences, backgrounds and ideas of our associates. We seek a workforce that reflects the communities in which we operate, and strive to create diverse, equal and inclusive workplaces where all of our associates have the opportunity to achieve their full potential.
We are also committed to improving the health and well-being of our associates. Regal’s US wellness program was established in 2008 and is continuously evolving to better educate, motivate and reward our associates for maintaining and achieving healthy measures. During our wellness plan year running from October 1, 2019 through September 30, 2020, 35% of our US associates participated in on-site biometric screening that provides them with key metrics such as BMI, blood pressure, and triglyceride, cholesterol and blood glucose levels. 
As a company, we believe that our value of responsibility requires community engagement, and we encourage our associates to share in our commitment to the communities where we operate. We have an established charitable foundation, which is governed by an advisory board comprised of our associates. The Regal Charitable Foundation focuses on supporting the United Way and other 501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations in the areas of health and human services, education and the arts, and civic and disaster relief, and prioritizes requests that are submitted by our associates. In fiscal 2020, the Regal Charitable Foundation provided $570,481 of support to organizations in the communities where our associates live and work.
