See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation" for additional information regarding reportable segments.
 
Manufacturing, Sourcing, and Distribution
 
The vast majority of our products are manufactured or sewn in facilities that we own or lease and operate to support both the Delta Group and Salt Life Group. To a lesser extent, we also use third-party contractors and suppliers to supplement our requirements. Our vertically-integrated manufacturing operations include a textile facility and multiple sew and decoration facilities.
 
Our manufacturing operations begin with the purchase of yarn and other raw materials from third-party suppliers. We have operated with a supply agreement with Parkdale Mills, Inc. and Parkdale America, LLC (collectively "Parkdale") to supply our yarn requirements since 2005, with our existing agreement running through December 31, 2021. Under the supply agreement, we purchase all of our yarn requirements for use in our manufacturing operations from Parkdale, excluding yarns that Parkdale does not manufacture or cannot manufacture due to temporary capacity constraints. The purchase price of yarn is based upon the cost of cotton, as reported by the New York Cotton Exchange, plus a fixed conversion cost. We set future cotton prices with purchase commitments as a component of the purchase price in advance of the shipment of finished yarn from Parkdale. While we expect to negotiate an extension to the supply agreement with Parkdale, the terms of the new agreement may not be as favorable as the current agreement.

We manufacture fabrics in our leased textile facility located near San Pedro Sula, Honduras. We also purchase fabric sourced in Mexico for use in our Campeche, Mexico sew facility, purchase specialized fabrics that we currently do not have the capacity or capability to produce, and may purchase other fabrics when it is cost-effective to do so. In 2021 and 2020, we manufactured approximately 80% of fabrics used in our internally-produced garments. The manufacturing process continues at one of our six apparel manufacturing facilities where fabric is cut and sewn into finished garments. These owned or leased facilities are located domestically (two in North Carolina) and internationally (two in Honduras, one in El Salvador and one in Mexico). In  2021 and 2020, approximately 95% or more of our manufactured products were sewn in our owned or leased manufacturing facilities. The remaining products were sewn by third-party contractors located primarily in the Caribbean Basin. To supplement our internal manufacturing platform, we purchase products from third-party global suppliers. In 2021 and 2020, we sourced less than 10% of our total products from third parties.
 
Many of the garments will be decorated using screen printing or digital printing technology, and will be retail-packaged, including ticketing, hang tags, and hangers.  These services can be performed domestically for quick-turn service or internationally in our facilities in El Salvador and Mexico. We offer digital fulfillment services, powered by DTG2Go, at nine domestic facilities, including five such facilities that are integrated with Delta Group distribution centers. These facilities support our strategy of establishing integrated fulfillment locations that combine our DTG2Go state-of-the-art digital platform with our Delta Activewear supply of fashion and core basic garments. Furthermore, these facilities create a seamless nationwide footprint allowing us to reach approximately 65% of all U.S. consumers with one-day shipping.
 
  We operate  eight distribution facilities strategically located throughout the United States that carry in-stock inventory for shipment to customers, with most shipments made via third-party carriers. To better serve customers, we allow products to be ordered by the piece, dozen, or full case quantity, and we aggressively leverage our strengths and efficiencies to meet the quick-turn needs of our customers. Because a significant portion of our business consists of at-once replenishment, we believe that backlog order levels do not provide a general indication of future sales. 
 
 See Item 2. Properties for more information about each of our primary manufacturing and distribution facilities. 


Sales & Marketing
 
Our sales and marketing functions consist of both employed and independent sales representatives and agencies located throughout the country. Our sales teams service specialty and resort shops, department, mid-tier and mass retailers, sporting goods stores, e-retailers and the U.S. military. Our brands leverage both in-house and outsourced marketing communication professionals to amplify their lifestyle statements.
 
The majority of our apparel products are produced based on forecasts to permit quick shipments to our customers; however, our custom programs are generally made only to order. During 2021, we shipped our products to approximately 8,800 customers, many of whom have numerous retail doors.  No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our sales in 2021 or 2020, and our strategy is to not become dependent on any single customer. Revenues attributable to sales of our products in foreign countries represented less than 1% of consolidated net sales in both 2021 and 2020.
 
Trademarks and License Agreements
 
We own several well-recognized trademarks that are important to our business. Salt Life® is an authentic, aspirational lifestyle brand that embraces those who love the ocean and everything associated with living the "Salt Life". Soffe® has stood for quality and value in the athletic and activewear market for more than sixty years. Our other registered trademarks include Intensity Athletics®, Kudzu®, Pro Weight®, Magnum Weight®, and the Delta Design. Our trademarks are valuable assets that differentiate the marketing of our products. We vigorously protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights against infringement. While our strategy is to own the intellectual property we use within our business, we are an official licensee for branches of the United States military which is used within the Soffe brand. We believe these license agreements are important given the military heritage of Soffe.
Environmental, Sustainability, and Governance
 
We aim to disclose and communicate transparently any material risks that could affect our stakeholders, and we strive to implement policies and practices that continuously improve the transparency and sustainability of our supply chain. The Environmental, Sustainability, and Governance (“ESG”) disclosures within this Annual Report and our definitive Proxy Statement align with the standards issued by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”) for the Apparel, Accessories, and Footwear industry and with regulations and guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The indicators in the Annual Report and definitive Proxy Statement have been carefully selected to show the most relevant aspects of our performance in the areas of environmental impact, health and safety, responsible raw material sourcing, safe chemical management, and responsible corporate governance.

Conserving the Environment
 
We believe that efficiently and sustainably managing natural resources is a smart business move and a responsible decision for the planet. By effectively and safely managing the materials used to manufacture our apparel products, we also protect the health and safety of our customers and employees. Our commitment to environmental sustainability includes compliance with safe chemistry practices and implementing technology and processes that reduce energy and water consumption, reuse and effectively treat wastewater, and reduce and recycle waste. In addition, we are committed to full compliance with local, regional, and national environmental laws and regulations.
Reducing our Environmental Impact
 
Environmental problems such as climate change and resource depletion are escalating worldwide and understanding and managing greenhouse gas emissions is important to effectively mitigate our impact to the environment. We are committed to monitoring our greenhouse gas emissions and adopting innovative technologies to improve the energy efficiency of our facilities and reduce our overall energy intensity.
 
The focus on reducing our overall energy intensity is driven by our goal to establish an energy efficient operation and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which will contribute to lowering our operating costs as well as our carbon footprint. In 2020 we installed a heat exchanger at our Ceiba Textiles facility in Honduras that plays an essential role in reducing the environmental impact of manufacturing processes by recovering and reusing energy. Modifications have also been made to the cooling systems in our textile plant which further reduce energy consumption.  We also implemented several energy efficiency projects in recent years such as replacing compact florescent light bulbs with LED lighting, which emits less heat and uses less energy than conventional bulbs, decreases the temperature on factory floors, and thus raises productivity, particularly on hot days. We also improved the performance of our sewing machines by installing new motors that use much less energy due to advanced technology.
 
In 2021 alone, these specific energy saving initiatives reduced our electricity usage by 875,800 kilowatt hours across all our manufacturing locations and avoided approximately 621 metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, which is comparable to the carbon sequestered by 760 acres of forest in one full year. In addition, compared to our 2018 baseline year, we produced 7.1% more finished fabric in 2021 while using 14% less fuel and 7% less electricity. Overall, this has improved our fuel intensity by approximately 20% and electricity intensity by approximately 13% compared to the 2018 baseline year.
 
The operations at our Ceiba Textiles facility account for a significant portion of the fuel and electricity used in our manufacturing network and, as such, are our largest contributors of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Compared to the 2018 baseline year we have reduced our total greenhouse gas emissions by 7.5% and reduced our emissions intensity by approximately 14% in 2021. These reductions avoid the equivalent of 3,600 metric tons of CO2 emissions, which is comparable to the energy used by approximately 434 homes for one year or the carbon sequestered by 4,411 acres of U.S. forests in one year.
 
We recently redesigned our shipping carton dimensions to maximize the storage space available inside shipping containers. This initiative increased our container utilization from 84% in 2019 to 93% in 2021 and resulted in using 153 fewer shipping containers this year. This reduction in shipping container usage avoids 223 metric tons of CO2 emissions, which is comparable to the carbon sequestered by 273 acres of forest in one full year.
 
Energy saving initiatives at Ceiba Textiles in 2022 include the purchase of a new steam textile dryer that will replace two existing thermal oil dryers. The steam dryer is capable of drying 66% more pounds of fabric per week than the thermal dryers and the installation is expected to reduce fuel consumption by approximately 19% per year.
 
Managing Water
 
Water is one of the world’s most precious and vital resources. Access to water is essential to Delta Apparel’s manufacturing operations, and we are committed to managing our water use in an efficient and responsible manner.
 
Treating textile wastewater is necessary not only to protect the local ecosystems but also to make the recycled water available to reuse in manufacturing processes or irrigation. To properly treat problematic substances before the water is discharged, our vertically-integrated manufacturing facilities, as well as our third-party fabric suppliers, comply with wastewater discharge requirements through currently active licenses and permits issued by local governments. In each of the last four years, none of these wastewater treatment facilities have received a compliance citation or violation.
 
During manufacturing, the most significant amount of water consumption occurs during the fabric washing, dyeing, and rinsing processes. To reduce our water consumption at Ceiba Textiles, in 2018 we implemented a system that reuses the leftover dye water for use in future batches of similar-colored fabric. This system saves approximately 4 million gallons or 15,000 cubic meters of water per year while maintaining the quality of our dyed fabrics. We also improved our dye formulas to further reduce water consumption and reduce the amount of contaminates remaining in the wastewater. During 2021, our water intensity was reduced by approximately 9% as compared to our 2018 baseline.

Wastewater from Ceiba Textiles is transferred to the Green Valley water treatment facility, which operates on an environmental license issued by the Honduras Ministry of Energy, Natural Resources, Environment, and Mines. Over 86% of our water consumption at Ceiba Textiles in 2021 was safely and effectively treated and recycled. The Green Valley wastewater treatment facility uses the industry standard primary, secondary, and tertiary water treatment methods based on the types of effluents being discharged as well as regulatory and environmental standards. Treatment procedures are also in place to neutralize and remove additional substances that may potentially be harmful, but are not necessarily regulated. The following information describes the primary, secondary, and tertiary water treatment methods.
 

● | Primary – Primary treatment methods include screening, sedimentation, homogenization, pH neutralization, and mechanical and chemical flocculation, which is a chemical added to the water that binds suspended solids into heavier particles that are easier to remove. Nano and cross-flow nano filtration techniques are also used to reduce the vast majority of sodium chloride and dyes.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Secondary – Secondary treatment is designed to substantially degrade the biological content of the wastewater by using a combination of physical and aerobic biological processes. Secondary treatment methods include various types of filtration along with an activated sludge process, which stabilizes and converts potentially toxic contaminates into less harmful forms such as carbon dioxide and water, which are safe for the environment.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Tertiary – Tertiary treatment is the final cleaning process that purifies wastewater before it is reused, recycled, or discharged into the environment. Treatment methods include a combination of physical and chemical techniques to decontaminate and purify the water.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Managing Waste
 
Our waste management strategy is to reduce, reuse, and recycle, which increases the likelihood that the waste materials we generate during the manufacturing process never reach landfills, lakes, rivers, streams, or municipal water systems. We are committed to full compliance with local, regional, and national environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate as it relates to responsible recycling and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste.
 
Pre-consumer textile waste is created during the cutting and sewing processes and includes small pieces of fabric trimmed away and other fabric scraps. We have modified sewing patterns to significantly reduce fabric waste during cutting. We also invested in sewing machines capable of folding excess fabric inside the bottom and sleeve hems to eliminate trimming. This initiative not only reduces textile waste but also lowers fabric production needs, which saves water, electricity, and fuel usage. We are committed to full compliance with local, regional, and national environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate as it relates to responsible recycling and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste.
 
We have multiple reuse and recycle programs that help limit the waste that would otherwise be disposed in landfills:
 

● | We partner with several companies that collect our fabric waste and sell it to manufacturers in the automotive industry, among others, that can mix the fabric with other materials to create alternate applications for the fabric, such as for automotive seats and windshield wipers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our screen-printing facilities recycle colors of inks that remain at the end of a production project for use in future production. In one year, this recycling program can recover as much as 75% of the plastisol ink and 50% of the water-based ink that otherwise would have been discarded.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | All of our manufacturing, sewing, and distribution facilities participate in cardboard recycling programs. Each facility flattens and places all cardboard in an outside container for recycling companies to then collect the cardboard on a regular schedule.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using Safe Chemistry
 
Textile operations use various chemicals, cleaners, dyes, and inks throughout the manufacturing, finishing, and decorating processes. We strive to use non-hazardous, bio-eliminable ingredients in our apparel products and throughout our manufacturing processes to protect the safety of our customers and employees as well as reduce negative impacts on the environment. For example, our DTG2Go digital printing facilities use water-based biodegradable inks that are 100 percent non-hazardous and adhere to the strictest human health and environmental standards.
 
    6 

  

We have a robust, hazard-based chemicals management system throughout our manufacturing processes. Our commitment to safe chemistry begins in the design and development stage of our products, which are conceived from the latest fashion trends and are fully compliant with statutory, industry, and customer-specific safety requirements. We are proud that the chemicals we use comply with the restricted substance list (“RSL”) published by the American Apparel & Footwear Association (“AAFA”). AAFA is the industry’s leading resource for maintaining and publishing banned and restricted substances lists for finished apparel products around the world. We continuously monitor our RSL, which includes additional substances that may be harmful, but are not necessarily regulated. We also control against the procurement of restricted substances through our purchase approval processes and arrangements with dye and chemical vendors.
 
The dyes and chemicals used in our manufacturing facilities are tested annually by a third-party laboratory that uses a scoring system to determine the level of compliance. Since 2017, we have maintained a “Green” status, which is the highest level of compliance. Annual tests are also conducted by a third-party laboratory to ensure our compliance with The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (“CPSIA”) of 2008, The Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (“Proposition 65 of California State Law”), and we adhere to any customer-supplied RSL. Our manufacturing employees are provided training on compliance with our RSL as well as training on how to safely handle potentially hazardous substances throughout the manufacturing process.
 
It is also important to us that all our significant third-party yarn and fabric suppliers share our high compliance standards and operate in a legal and responsible manner. We require these suppliers to provide, at least annually, certification or self-declaration documents that demonstrate compliance with industry standard parameters for safe chemistry. We take immediate corrective actions in instances where non-compliance may be identified.
 
Responsible Sourcing
 
As a vertically integrated apparel company, we believe it is important to have a high degree of oversight into all aspects of sourcing, manufacturing, and distribution. To that end, the lifecycle of a Delta Apparel garment begins with high quality, sustainable cotton, which is the primary ingredient for the majority of apparel products across our brand portfolio. Over 90% of our garments are created with U.S. cotton, which is known for both the quality of its fibers as well as the sustainability practices of the cotton farmers who harvest it. Cotton is not considered a water-intensive crop and more than 60% of the cotton grown in the U.S. is produced without irrigation. Cotton is also highly tolerant of soil and water salinity levels, so it can be grown with water and soil resources unsuitable for most other crops. We do not source cotton from regions with water stress, and we do not source conflict minerals in the production of our products.
 
Delta Apparel is a member of the Cotton LEADS program, which is committed to sustainable and traceable cotton production. This partnership enables us to broaden our support of the cotton farmers who supply our Company with high-quality cotton, allowing us to continue transforming sustainably-sourced cotton into high quality, responsible apparel products for our customers. We serve as a supply chain partner for many customers who expect high quality raw materials and require the ability to trace those raw materials back to the source. With cotton traceability, we are now able to trace the fiber used in our garments all the way back to harvest.
 
The vast majority of the yarn we use in our textile operations is sourced from Parkdale, whose products are independently certified to Standard 100 by OEKO-TEX. In addition, our significant suppliers of external fabric are certified to Standard 100 by OEKO-TEX.
 
Monitoring Progress
 
We use the Sustainable Apparel Coalition’s Higg Index to measure the environmental impact of all our offshore manufacturing facilities and the facilities of our key external fabric suppliers. The Higg Index tool provides transparency of our efforts to reduce our environmental impact, and it identifies areas for continued improvement. Our Ceiba Textile facility has been using this tool for several years, and our 2020 self-assessment resulted in a total score in the upper quartile as compared to our industry competitors. Our most recent self-assessment was completed in July of 2021 and the results will be available in March 2022. We retain the services of an external consultant to verify our assessments for a sample of facilities and to provide guidance for any areas of improvement.
Social Responsibility and Human Capital Management
 Our employees are our most important and valuable asset. Our diverse and talented workforce helps drive our culture of high performance, close teamwork, and deep caring for each other across geographies and functions. We have an impact on the lives of the approximately 8,500 employees across the globe as well as their families and communities. We support the livelihoods of our people through competitive wages and benefits, providing them with a safe and healthy workspace, supporting the communities in which they live, and, most importantly, treating all employees with dignity and respect.

Approximately 80% of the employees at two of our facilities in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, are party to multi-year collective bargaining agreements. We have historically conducted our operations without significant labor disruptions and believe that our relations with our employees are positive.
 
The table below provides an overview of the approximate percentage of employees by gender and region as of September 2021:
 

Region | Male | Female
--------------+------+-------
Offshore | 48% | 52% 
United States | 36% | 64% 
Total | 46% | 54% 

Diversity and Inclusion
 
We are committed to fostering an inclusive culture where every employee is treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their gender, age, race, abilities, or sexual orientation. We believe that our employees’ contributions are richer because of their diverse backgrounds and experiences, which strengthens the collaboration of our cross-functional, global teams and leads to improved performance.
Wages and Benefits
 Investing in our people is critical for their personal and professional success, and we believe this investment enhances engagement and performance levels. Our compensation philosophy is to provide a fair living wage that is also scalable to the performance of the business. We provide our employees with at least the legal minimum wage or the prevailing industry wage in the countries where we operate, whichever is higher, complying with all legal wage requirements. We also provide fringe benefits, some of which are required by law, contract, or as per established collective bargaining agreements, while others are more favorable than required.
 
In recognition of the importance of raising the standard of living in certain communities in which we operate, we provide additional benefits, such as free onsite medical care from fully licensed physicians and nurses that encompass clinics and wellness programs. In these locations, we also provide subsidized meal assistance as well as free transportation to and from our facilities.
 
We invest in the professional development of our employees through various training programs. In 2021, we provided more than 217,000 hours of professional development and safety training for our employees, which is a 76% increase from the previous year.
 Health and Safety
 Our responsibility is to provide our employees with a safe and healthy work environment that meets or exceeds the applicable environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. All our manufacturing facilities in El Salvador, Honduras, and Mexico are Worldwide Responsible Accredited Production (“WRAP”) certified. We are a Category C affiliate with the Fair Labor Association (“FLA”), an organization that supports human rights compliance monitoring for our plants and our third-party contractors.

Because textile manufacturing can contain various hazards and risks to workers, we have proactive programs in place to promote workplace safety, personal health, and employee wellness. Our culture promotes and rewards safety-first in all aspects of manufacturing, materials handling, and distribution of our apparel products. Safety training and awareness is embedded in employee orientation and onboarding, job performance and evaluation, and ongoing training based on a set safety training calendar by topic. We standardize, document, and improve our manufacturing and distribution safety procedures that require activities to be performed in the safest manner possible.
 
We are proud that our safety records are consistently better than OSHA’s benchmarks for the apparel manufacturing sector. For example, Delta Apparel’s 2021 incident rate for total recordable cases dropped to 0.3% compared to OSHA’s average incident rate of 3.4%. In addition, Delta Apparel had no cases involving lost time from work in 2021.
 
Our production and distribution processes incorporate ergonomic material handling equipment to reduce physical risks, protect employee health, and optimize productivity. In our cut and sew facilities, we use ergonomically-friendly chairs and floor mats in addition to facilitating frequent group stretching and movement exercises. In several of our manufacturing and distribution facilities we provide lightweight slip sheet material handling equipment, which has the dual benefit of reducing manual labor and potential back strain on employees.
 
At the onset of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, we quickly implemented a comprehensive series of protocols and safety measures across all our facilities to protect the health and safety of our employees and contractors. We also created our own COVID-19 safety videos to promote healthy behaviors at home and in the workplace. Today, these safety measures are still in place such as checking each person’s temperature prior to entering a facility, maintaining plexiglass partitions to separate hand-washing stations, work areas, and cafeteria seating areas, sanitizing the interior of vehicles that are used to transport employees to and from work, and requiring all employees to observe safe distancing. We also continue to provide all employees with personal protective equipment, sanitizing products, and COVID-19 informational materials. Our COVID-19 safety protocols have been recognized by local governments and our customers as best-in-class and serve as a model for other manufacturing operations in the regions in which we operate.
 Monitoring
 We conduct annual audits of all our internal manufacturing facilities as well as our significant third-party fabric suppliers to evaluate compliance with the FLA Workplace Code of Conduct. These audits cover labor topics, such as forced or child labor, compensation policies, and nondiscrimination, as well as environmental health and safety topics, such as fire safety, processes for safe chemistry, and environmental permits. These audits are important in identifying and preventing human rights and environmental health and safety violations.
 
The annual audits are conducted by Delta Apparel employees in our human resources or compliance departments, and they follow predefined audit programs and checklists that involve a mix of in-person site visits and walkthroughs of the facility, observations of processes, interviews with employees, and inspection of records and applicable permits. The audit results are documented with supporting photographs for any non-conformance findings. The internal auditors then report the findings to management, including the recommended corrective actions, and the date by which the corrective actions must be complete. The audits performed in 2021 resulted in no priority non-conformance findings, defined as severe violations of code of conduct in the areas of labor or environmental health and safety. For minor violations identified, we put corrective action plans in place to remediate the findings.
 
Community Outreach
 
Delta Apparel is committed to giving back to the communities where our employees live and work through volunteer service and community outreach. During 2021, employees were involved in programs to promote environmental responsibility and improve the way of life for nearby communities.

● | Between November 3 and November 17, 2020, two category five hurricanes, Eta and Iota, made landfall within a 15-mile area of northern Honduras bringing persistent rains and heavy winds that resulted in flooding and dozens of catastrophic landslides and mudflows. Delta Apparel worked quickly to purchase and deliver construction materials that helped rebuild the homes of its affected employees. Employees at other locations activated an internal emergency relief fund that raised $20,000, which Delta Apparel matched 100% resulting in a total of $40,000 in aid for those employees most affected. This effort provided desperately needed items such as groceries, personal hygiene items, and 1,800 Coleman inflatable mattresses and airbeds.

● | In Mexico, Delta Campeche and Campeche Sportswear employees were active in the following community outreach activities: - Employees participated in the Campeche Turtle Project to help save the critically endangered Hawksbill sea turtle by cleaning the plastic waste from beaches in Sebaplaya where the turtles come to lay their eggs for six months per year. On average, a sea turtle lays around 100 eggs; however, only 1% of the hatchlings actually makes its way out into the ocean and survives, making it critical to remove any obstacles that would prevent the hatchling from reaching the water. The beach cleanup resulted in one full trash bag for approximately every five yards of beach. - Employees joined with the “Together We Will Win” civil association to collect and donate thousands of plastic bottle caps that were recycled to provide financial assistance to families of children with cancer. - In celebration of Mexico’s 2021 National Children’s Day, employees collected and donated toys for approximately 450 children living in an orphanage and in surrounding communities. - To help surrounding communities in the fight against Covid-19, employees in Mexico provided face masks and sanitizing gel to surrounding communities.

● | Employees from the Honduras sewing facilities participated in several important community projects: - Employees cleaned up plastic waste and other floating debris across a four-kilometer beach in Omoa, Cortes, Honduras, which is a coastal municipality just west of Puerto Cortes and adjacent to the Guatemala border. Removing the large volume of debris along the beaches surrounding Omoa is important to the survival of nesting sea turtles and other ocean wildlife. - Employees restored El Plan Park, a family-oriented park in Brisas del Plan, which is a community in Villanueva, Cortes where approximately 6% of our employees live. - Employees helped to reforest approximately 400 square meters of land in La Mina, which is an environmentally protected area in Villanueva, Cortes. - To help surrounding communities in the fight against Covid-19, employees donated face masks and sanitizing gel to the Red Cross of Trinidad. - Employees at Ceiba Textiles participated once again in the annual “United for a Greener Honduras” campaign in conjunction with representatives from the Quimistán Municipal Environmental Unit to help restore the forest and environmental conditions in an important rain water collection area of western Honduras. Reforestation is a critical factor in increasing this region’s water retention capacity as it reduces the impact to nearby communities when rivers overflow during the region’s rain and hurricane season.

Competition
 
As a vertically-integrated apparel company, we have numerous competitors in both domestic and international markets, many of which are larger and have more brand recognition and greater marketing budgets. Some of these competitors may benefit from lower production costs that can result from greater operational scale, a differing supply chain footprint, or trade-related agreements and other macroeconomic factors that may enable them to compete more effectively.
 
Competition in our Delta Group segment is generally based upon price, service, delivery time, and quality with the relative importance of each factor dependent upon the needs of the particular customer and the specific product offering. Our Delta Direct products generally are highly price competitive, and competitor actions can greatly influence pricing and demand for our products. While price is still important in the custom market, quality and service are generally more important factors for customer choice. Our ability to consistently service the needs of our Global Brand customers greatly impacts future business with these customers. We believe our Western Hemisphere-centered manufacturing platform enables us to compete with our competitors by providing an outlet for customers to diversify their sourcing footprints and reduce time to market. Furthermore, as an integrated entity with design, manufacturing, sourcing, and marketing capabilities, we believe the interdependencies within our portfolio provide cost, quality, and speed to market advantages that enable us to be more competitive.
 
We believe that competition within our Salt Life Group segment is based primarily upon brand recognition, design, and consumer preference. We focus on sustaining the strong reputation of our lifestyle brands by adapting our product offerings to changes in fashion trends and consumer preferences.  We aim to keep our merchandise offerings fresh with unique artwork and new designs and support the integrated lifestyle statement of our products through effective consumer marketing. We believe that our favorable competitive position stems from strong consumer recognition and brand loyalty, the high quality of our products, and our flexibility and process control, which drive product consistency. We believe that our ability to remain competitive in the areas of quality, price, design, marketing, product development, manufacturing, technology and distribution will, in large part, determine our future success.

Seasonality
 
Although our various product lines are sold on a year-round basis, the demand for specific products or styles reflects some seasonality. By diversifying our product lines over the years, we have reduced the overall seasonality of our business. Sales in our third fiscal quarter (quarter ended in June) are typically the highest and represented 27% of 2021 net sales. Our first fiscal quarter (quarter ended in December) typically is the lowest and represented 22% of 2021 net sales. Consumer demand for apparel is cyclical and dependent upon the overall level of demand for soft goods, which may or may not coincide with the overall level of discretionary consumer spending. These levels of demand change as regional, domestic and international economic conditions change. Therefore, the distribution of sales by quarter in 2021 may not be indicative of the distribution in future years.
Environmental and Other Regulatory Matters
 
We are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, wastewater discharges, storm water flows, air emissions and solid waste disposal. The labeling, distribution, importation, marketing, and sale of our products are subject to extensive regulation by various federal agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Product Safety Commission and state attorneys general in the United States. Our international operations are also subject to compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) and other anti-bribery laws applicable to our operations.
 
The environmental and other regulations applicable to our business are becoming increasingly stringent, and we incur capital and other expenditures annually to achieve compliance with these environmental standards and regulations. We currently do not expect that the amount of expenditures required to comply with these environmental standards or other regulatory matters will have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition or liquidity. There can be no assurance, however, that future changes in federal, state, or local regulations, interpretations of existing regulations or the discovery of currently unknown problems or conditions will not require substantial additional expenditures. Similarly, while we believe that we are currently in compliance with all applicable environmental and other regulatory requirements, the extent of our liability, if any, for past failures to comply with laws, regulations and permits applicable to our operations cannot be determined and could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and liquidity.
