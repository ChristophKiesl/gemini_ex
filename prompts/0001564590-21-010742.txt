ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Our Business
 Ranpak is a leading provider of environmentally sustainable, systems-based, product protection solutions and end-of-line automation solutions for e-commerce and industrial supply chains. Since its inception in 1972, Ranpak has delivered high quality protective packaging solutions, while maintaining its commitment to environmental sustainability. We differentiate ourselves by our: 

• | Distinct Business Model. Our paper-based protective packaging business utilizes a razor/razor-blade model designed to generate attractive margins that are recurring in nature through the sale of our value-added paper consumables for use exclusively in our installed base of protective packaging systems. Our business is global, with a strong presence in the U.S. and Europe along with an expanding footprint in Asia, serving end-users in approximately 50 countries across 6 continents. End-users rely on our paper consumables for use exclusively with our installed base of systems.

• | Environmentally Sustainable Product Portfolio. Through our proprietary protective packaging systems and value-added kraft paper consumables, we offer a reliable, fast, and effective suite of protective packaging solutions. Our paper packaging consumables are fiber-based, biodegradable, renewable, and curb-side recyclable to customers. Our paper packaging materials contain little or no plastic or other resin-based inputs. Additionally, a majority of our paper packaging materials are manufactured from entirely or partially recycled content and all are sourced from suppliers that are Sustainable Forestry Initiative (“SFI”) and/or Forest Stewardship Council (“FSC”) certified. We believe that preference for environmentally sustainable packaging solutions will be a key driver of growth moving forward, particularly to the extent plastics and other resin-based solutions come under increasing public scrutiny.

• | Attractive Financial Profile. We historically have benefited from consistently strong growth in net revenue and our installed base, net revenue that is recurring in nature, attractive profit margins, and substantial free cash flow conversion. We have modest working capital requirements, which also contributes to our ability to generate strong free cash flow and further invest in the business by expanding our fleet of installed systems. Our capital expenditures per protective system and each system’s long protective useful life result in attractive payback periods and returns on invested capital. Our sales are geographically diverse, with 42.7% of our 2020 net revenue generated from end-users in North America, 47.0% generated from end-users in Europe, and 10.3% generated from end-users in Asia and other locations. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Diversified End-User Base. Through our extensive distributor network and select direct sales, we have over 117,400 installed systems serving over 33,000 end-users across diversified and growing end-user markets, as of December 31, 2020. We have a full suite of paper-based protective packaging solutions to meet the needs of a variety of end-users, from small businesses to global corporations. These end-users include leading e-Commerce companies, as well as suppliers and sellers of automotive after-market parts, information technology (“IT”)/electronics, machinery, home goods, industrial, warehousing/transport services, healthcare, and other products. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Well Established, Long-Term Distributor Relationships. We have arrangements with over 250 distributors globally, which enable us to reach thousands of small and medium-sized end-users while maintaining an asset-light capital base and a lean sales force. We have long-term, established relationships with our distributors, as demonstrated by an average relationship of greater than 20 years with our top ten global distributors. The continuity of these relationships evidences the strength of our business model, as well as the value proposition we provide for our distributors and end-users. Furthermore, the depth and longevity of these relationships have created a distributor network that is highly knowledgeable and well versed in conveying the benefits of our systems to new and existing end-users. Moreover, substantially all of our net revenue from distributors is generated by those who have agreed to sell our products exclusively and not to sell or promote our competitors’ paper-based solutions. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reputation as a Reliable Leader in Comprehensive Fiber-Based Solutions. We believe our protective packaging systems are known for their reliability, speed, and total cost effectiveness. We work hand-in-hand with our distributors or, on a selective basis, directly with some end-users to ensure that end-users obtain a solution that meets their specific needs, whether that be a single unit for a low volume end-user or a highly-customized base of hundreds of units across multiple facilities for a high-volume end-user. Furthermore, through our distributors, we strive to ensure that our end-users are consistently supplied with our paper consumables on-time and that their protective packaging systems are running with minimal downtime. Most importantly, we, either directly or with our distributors, work with end-users to examine their end-of-line operations to maximize throughput, minimize cost and reduce breakage. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Unique Approach to Automation. We provide end-of-line automation systems that solve two distinct challenges facing end-users of our products: 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


i. | Customization to place the right amount of voidfill, wrapping or cushioning in the box to reduce the total cost of ownership by reducing labor and paper costs; and
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


ii. | We also provide several automated box-sizing solutions and corrugated case erectors to tailor the corrugated box to the highest product to reduce voidfill needs and optimize logistics with smaller boxes.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These solutions offer numerous benefits including the reduction of shipping costs, waste, and labor, resulting in improved efficiency.
  
• | Multiple Drivers of Growth. We believe that our business benefits from multiple factors that will drive our future growth: 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


i. | Growth of E-commerce. E-commerce is a significant growth driver in our business. Approximately 34.9% of our net revenue is derived from sales to e-commerce end-users, and the overall e-commerce market demonstrated compound annual growth in the high teens from 2015 to 2019. We believe that continued global growth in e-commerce provides a significant tailwind for us. We also believe that e-commerce activity will remain at high levels following the growth experienced during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


ii. | Focus on Sustainability. Additionally, we believe both our end-users and consumers, generally, are demonstrating an increasing preference for environmentally sustainable solutions. We believe that these increasing preferences in 
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 3


 
favor of environmental sustainability will also be a significant driver of our continued growth. We believe our investments into paper innovations help close the price gap for sustainable solutions, an important tailwind for continued growth. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


iii. | Demand for Automated Solutions. Our Ranpak Automation product line provides significant improvements to end-of-line packaging speed and lower labor costs for many high-volume businesses. As businesses become more sophisticated, we believe many will look for ways to improve production efficiencies driving further demand for automated solutions.
-----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


iv. | Expansion into Retail Channel. We believe the retail channel provides a great opportunity for our existing Wrapping product line, as well as the potential to sell environmentally friendly packaging alternatives directly to consumers.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


v. | Continued Product Development and Innovation. We believe our ability to consistently innovate and introduce new products will provide us with additional growth opportunities.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


vi. | Geographic Expansion. Historically, geographic expansion has fueled our growth, and we believe further geographic expansion will continue to drive our future growth.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Keen Focus on Innovation. We believe we are a leading innovator in packaging material, packaging systems and manufacturing technologies. Our solutions deliver automation, productivity and sustainability enhancements to our end-users’ operations. Through our robust research and development (“R&D”) pipeline, we plan to continue to improve our value proposition by rolling-out next generation products to improve performance and efficiency as well as expanding product lines adapted to continuously evolving consumer and business preferences. In 2020, we launched an enhanced model of our FillPak Trident™ solution in our Void-Fill products. Further, we launched a new Cushioning product, PadPak® Guardian™, in North America. We work to respond to customer needs and develop innovative products and solutions that improve supply chain performance, reduce costs and environmental impact, and deliver value. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Intellectual Property. We have a long history of continuous systems innovation and product development supported by our comprehensive patent portfolio. We have maintained an extensive patenting program since our inception for our protective packaging systems and accessories, processes and paper packaging materials. We maintain substantial trade secret knowledge regarding the utilization of our paper consumables in each model of our protective packaging systems product lines, which, together with the distributor contractual arrangements described above, prevent third-party paper from being used on our protective packaging systems. We hold over 645 U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications directed to various innovations related to our business, as well as more than 180 U.S. and foreign trademark registrations and trademark applications that protect our branding. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Focus on Talent and Leadership: We have assembled a strong international team of talented, motivated inclusive and diverse employees to maintain our leadership in the industry, drive our growth and to achieve our strategic objectives. We have implemented a focused talent acquisition and development strategy to ensure our teams continue to have the right skills to execute our strategy on a global basis. We are committed to adding exceptional talent to Ranpak and have hired strong personnel in our finance, accounting, sales, and marketing groups throughout 2020.

Our Product Lines
 Our protective packaging systems are designed to be flexible and responsive to the needs of our end-users. The flexibility and breadth of our full range of systems allows us to provide our end-users with the optimal protective solution to meet their specific needs. These protective packaging solutions, which include the accompanying paper consumables, fall into four broad categories:

• | Void-Fill. Our Void-Fill protective systems quickly and efficiently convert paper to fill empty spaces in secondary packages and protect objects, reducing object movement during shipping and potential damage sustained in transit. Our Void-Fill products accounted for 41.9% of our net revenue in 2020. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cushioning. Our Cushioning protective systems convert paper into cushioning pads by crimping paper to trap air between the layers so that objects are protected from external shocks and vibrations during shipping as well as to prevent movement of objects as they travel through the global supply chain. Our Cushioning products accounted for 42.2% of our net revenue in 2020. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Wrapping. Our Wrapping protective systems create pads or paper mesh to securely wrap and protect fragile items from shock and surface damage sustained during the shipping and handling process. In addition to securely wrapping and protecting fragile items, our Wrapping systems are used to line boxes and provide separation when shipping multiple objects. Some of our Wrapping systems may also be used to provide insulation for goods that require temperatures to be controlled during transport. Our Wrapping products accounted for 13.0% of our net revenue in 2020. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Automation. Our Ranpak Automation product line is focused on highly automated, integrated systems for high-volume end-users. These systems are designed to help optimize the use of in-the-box packaging for these end-users, while fully 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

automating their end-of-line packaging operations to improve speed and efficiency of operations. Our Ranpak Automation line enables end-users to optimize carton size to fit contents, apply glued lids to the box, and automatically place cushioning liners within boxes. Additionally, we also offer automated systems that can be used with our paper converters, which are able to identify contents of a shipment and optimize the dunnage required to safely protect items being shipped, reducing potential waste and improving protection for items being shipped. Our Automation products accounted for 2.9% of our net revenue in 2020. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Moreover, unlike many competitive products (e.g., foam, air pillows, bubble wrap, loose fill, etc.), our paper packaging materials are fiber-based, renewable and environmentally sustainable. Our paper consumables do not include plastic or other resin-based components. Instead, they are paper-based and biodegradable, renewable, and curb-side recyclable. Additionally, all of our paper consumables sold to end-users are created from entirely or partially recycled content and the vast majority are sourced from suppliers that are SFI and/or FSC certified. Finally, our consumables ship in bulk which is efficient for customers in shipping and require less storage space than many competing products.
 Our Distribution Model
 We sell our paper consumable products to an established network of approximately 250 distributors worldwide who, in turn, store, market and sell our products to end-users. Moreover, substantially all of our net revenue from distributors is generated by those who have agreed to exclusivity with our products and not to sell or promote competitors’ paper-based solutions. Our sales and marketing teams, as well as our highly skilled engineers, work closely with distributors and ultimate end-users, on-site or remotely, to optimize the custom configuration and installation of our protective packaging systems at the end-user’s facility. Sales through our global distributor network accounted for 85.5% of our net revenue in 2020.
 In addition, we sell our products directly to certain select end-users. In some cases, these end-users operate some of the largest, most complex and sophisticated warehouse operations into which our protective packaging systems are integrated. Our engineering and other teams also assist our direct-sale end-users in ensuring the optimal customized installation of our products at their facilities. Direct sales to end-users accounted for 14.5% of our net revenue in 2020.
 Through our distributor network and our direct sales, we serve greater than 33,000 end-users including participants in e-commerce, the auto after-market, electronics, machinery, home goods, industrial, warehousing/transport services, healthcare, and other markets. Our universe of end-users is diverse, with greater than 80.0% of distributor-serviced end-users generating less than $10,000 in net revenue in 2020.
 Our Performance
 In 2020, we generated net revenue of $298.2 million and $11.7 million of income from operations. Our revenues are geographically diverse, with 42.7% of our 2020 net revenue generated from end-users in North America, 47.0% generated from end-users in Europe, and 10.3% generated from end-users in Asia and other locations. In addition, approximately 61.0% of our net revenue in 2020 was generated from outside the United States.
 We also believe, based on our performance during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its macroeconomic impact, as well as the global financial crisis from 2007 to 2010, that our business is relatively resilient to economic recessions due in part to the nature of our input costs, including paper, and our ability to adjust our operations.  During the global financial crisis, declining paper costs and a reduction in our growth capital expenditures enabled us to protect profit margins and grow free cash flow despite reduced sales volume.  So far, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the world economy’s growing emphasis on e-commerce and we have experienced growth in revenues and EBITDA.
 Our Strategy
 Our strategy for adding to our customer base includes investing in innovation, our sales force and distributor relationships across all end markets as well as expanding geographically. Beyond our leading position in paper-based Void-Fill and Cushioning protective packaging systems, we expect to also focus on other emerging applications, such as Wrapping, Automation, Cold Chain, and retail consumables, for continued growth. While still relatively small, representing 13.0% of our net revenue in 2020, our Wrapping product line expanded in 2014 through the acquisition of Geami, which provides a highly effective and environmentally friendly alternative to plastic bubble wrap, as well as an opportunity to expand our distribution channels into the retail and retail shipping segments. Although our initiative to expand into the retail channel has been delayed due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we expect to have the opportunity to increase our product line in the future to include environmentally friendly packaging materials directly for sale to customers. Our Automation solution represented only 2.9% of our net revenue in 2020, however, following its development through acquisitions and organic growth to date, we believe it will serve as a platform for expansion to better serve end-users with higher volume requirements and more sophisticated end-of-line needs. Moreover, we seek to increase our penetration with existing customers 
 5


and broaden our customer base to include business segments that we have not historically served. We will also continue to identify additional product and service opportunities for our current and future end-user markets.
As the world economy works to recover from the impact of COVID-19, we look to solidify our gains in e-commerce and Void-Fill products, as well as be an integral partner in facilitating the industrial sectors return to normal operations.  We believe these factors contribute to the significant tailwinds for our growth expansion.  
 We are pursuing this strategy of expanding our customer base in several ways. We have a global sales organization that works hand-in-hand with the sales representatives of our approximately 250 distributors to introduce all of our products and services to potential accounts in all end markets. Our full range of products allows our organization to serve any type of business with protective packaging needs. We will also seek to broaden our customer base through geographic expansion by enhancing our regional capabilities in sales and marketing and expanding sales of our existing product lines in growth regions, such as Asia-Pacific, South America, and Central and Eastern Europe.
 We seek to enhance our position as a leading global provider of innovative sustainable packaging solutions that our customers rely on to improve performance, cost competitiveness and automation to enhance productivity within their operations. In order to achieve these goals, we are focused on the following strategic priorities.
  
• | Grow organically. We will continue to focus on offering innovative solutions that enable our end-users to meet their sustainability needs while growing their business, reducing their costs and mitigating the risks associated with ineffective and/or unreliable end-of-line systems. We will also continue to provide distributors with the tools to win new accounts through training programs such as our Ranpak Academy and collaboration with our sales and engineering teams. We plan on leveraging our position as a trusted provider of sustainable packaging solutions to leading e-commerce end-users and industrial business to business end-users and further align ourselves with these market leaders as they expand to new locations and geographies, as well as continue to serve small, high growth platforms. We also believe there are significant opportunities to increase penetration across end markets. We aim to grow beyond our current core applications (primarily Void-Fill and Cushioning) by expanding our existing Wrapping, Automation and retail consumable offerings into new end-markets. Finally, we believe our fiber-based wrapping systems offer a cost-competitive, environmentally friendly, and compelling alternative to plastic-based wrap and we expect them to gain share as the focus on environmental sustainability becomes increasingly ingrained in commerce. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Drive innovation. We intend to maintain and extend our technological leadership, expertise and our environmentally sustainable value proposition through continuous improvement of our product and service offerings to bolster speed, improve efficacy, and decrease packing footprint, as well as by introducing new products that deliver the environmentally friendly solutions customers require for their business needs. In 2020, we launched an enhanced model of our FillPak Trident™ solution in our Void-Fill products. Further, we launched a new Cushioning product, PadPak® Guardian™, in North America. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursue targeted growth opportunities. We have identified a number of potential growth opportunities, including market expansion for existing products, such as Wrapping, as well as in additional areas of focus, such as cold chain/thermal packaging, sales through the retail channel, and automation. We intend to further build out our regional capabilities and combine our local market knowledge in new or currently under-served geographies with our broad portfolio and strengths in innovation and customer service to take advantage of the burgeoning growth opportunities across the globe. For example, the Asia-Pacific region has a large, well-developed parcel shipping business, but currently represents only 10.3% of our net revenue in 2020. We believe that growing environmental awareness world-wide, combined with an increasing regulatory trend to limit the use of polymer-based foams and plastic films in many jurisdictions, present an opportunity for our paper-based protective packaging solutions in an ever-expanding number of geographies. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Grow via partnerships and acquisitions. We believe that we are well-positioned to execute a growth strategy, targeting acquisitions or partnerships in our key areas of focus and adjacent business lines. We will continue to focus on growing the company through appropriate business acquisition opportunities as well as developing partnerships to expand the scope of our technologies, geographic presence and product offerings. We expect to focus on identifying opportunities and executing an accretive merger and acquisition (“M&A”) strategy to further solidify our position as a leader in environmentally sustainable solutions by enhancing growth in our key areas of focus and/or acquiring adjacent businesses to our product offering.

Our Products and Services
 Our Business Model
 We have a full suite of paper-based protective packaging solutions for end-users. These solutions are designed to ensure that our end-users’ products reach their shipping destination in a cost-effective manner with minimal breakage. Our protective packaging solutions fall into four broad categories: Void-Fill, Cushioning, Wrapping, and Automation.
 We employ a “razor/razor-blade” business model with respect to the sale of our Void-Fill, Cushioning, and Wrapping solutions. Under this model, we provide our proprietary protective packaging systems to our distributors for a nominal user fee, charged on a per-unit basis. We also provide our systems directly to certain select end-users. We derive substantially all of our net revenue (over 90% in each period presented) through the sale of high-margin paper consumables that work exclusively with our protective systems. Our paper consumables are converted from raw paper through our paper conversion processes, using paper sourced and subsequently converted to our specifications as to a number of factors, including basis weight, tensile strength, directional strength, and moisture content. As our protective systems are designed to use paper consumables that meet these exacting requirements, any end-user that attempted to use another supplier’s paper on our protective systems would encounter substantial negative consequences, such as significant jamming, ineffective yield, and/or other performance deficiencies. We sell these paper consumables under the Void-Fill, Wrapping and Cushioning product lines. We also derive net revenue from user fees, charged on a per unit basis, with respect to those product lines, and from the sale of products under our Automation product line.
 We retain ownership of most of our Void-Fill, Cushioning and Wrapping protective systems (other than, e.g., certain disposable Wrapping systems and FillPak® Manual). This model allows distributors and end-users access to our proprietary systems at little or no capital expense and enables us or our distributors to reclaim un- or under-utilized units for refurbishment and redeployment, which benefits us, our distributors and our end-users through increased efficiency and cost savings. As of December 31, 2020, we had an installed base of approximately 117,400 protective packaging systems.
 Each protective system offered under our Void-Fill, Cushioning and Wrapping product lines is distinguished by its level of automation, the speed at which it dispenses paper consumables, the type and form of paper it consumes, and the type of protective paper or pad it produces. We believe we offer the widest variety of paper-based protective packaging systems in the industry. In contrast to some more limited product offerings of our competitors, we have numerous Void-Fill, Cushioning and Wrapping systems, and extensive options to create custom variations.
 We convert the vast majority of raw paper at four U.S. and two European production facilities to create rolls and bundles of paper that integrate with our protective packaging systems and into direct or consumable products. Our systems predominantly use kraft paper of varying weights, sizes and configurations. In 2020, 53.8% of our raw paper supply consisted of 100% recycled sheet, 42.2% consisted of 100% virgin sheet, and 4.0% consisted of a blended sheet incorporating both virgin and recycled fiber. We believe we offer the widest variety of bundle, roll sizes and formats in the industry.
 For the vast majority of end-users, we work with our distributors to place our protective packaging systems at end-user sites. We sell bundles and rolls to our distributors who, in turn, sell bundles and rolls to end-users for use with our protective packaging systems. In select cases, we place systems with and sell paper directly to end-users.
 For each unit, we set targets for minimum annual paper consumption in order to justify the capital deployed to that account. Accordingly, our sales team, in conjunction with our distributors, help our end-users select which unit or units meet their specific needs, based on their own volume requirements and business objectives.
 In addition, we have a customized Automation suite of products, which we market under the Ranpak Automation brand, that provides higher volume customers with a highly automated box sizing system, accurate dispensing, labor-free packing, and optimization consulting services.  Ranpak Automation customer’s purchase directly from us the automated box-sizing machines and equipment they need to optimize their end-of-line capabilities.  Often, with respect to our Automation product line, we do not retain ownership of the machines, nor do we customarily have maintenance or support obligations beyond an initial warranty period. However, the automation market is rapidly evolving and we have expanded Automation services to offer extended service within and beyond the initial warranty period, packaging line design solutions, as well as the sale of spare parts. We see this as a potential growth position as the Automation installed base expands.  To service this growth potential, Ranpak Automation opened a dedicated facility in 2020 where our equipment is manufactured and assembled in-house.
 Void-Fill
 We sell our Void-Fill products under the brand name FillPak®. We offer a variety of FillPak® units, each of which is designed to convert paper to fill empty spaces in secondary packages and limit object movement during the shipping process. We introduced our 
 7


FillPak® family of products in 2003 to provide an environmentally friendly solution to the growing void-fill market that arose with the explosion of e-commerce. We believe our FillPak® systems are known in the marketplace for their efficacy, speed, efficiency and reliability.
 We have an installed base of approximately 68,000 FillPak® units as of December 31, 2020. In 2020, our FillPak® products generated $125.0 million in net revenue, which accounted for 41.9% of our net revenue.
 The primary competitors to our Void-Fill product line are plastic air pillows and foam peanuts or loose fill. We believe our Void-Fill product line is superior to each of these competitors for a number of reasons. First, the packaging material is sustainable and environmentally friendly. Our Void-Fill paper packaging material is paper-based, renewable, biodegradable and curb-side recyclable for end consumers. Second, unlike air pillows, our packaging product can more easily fit into void spaces within smaller shipping boxes due to the inherent flexibility of paper. Third, when air pillows are punctured from pressure damages, they lose 100% of their protective packaging properties, whereas paper packaging retains protective properties even when subject to substantial pressure. Fourth, our products provide a better box opening experience, which is important to many e-commerce retailers.
 Cushioning
 We sell our Cushioning products under the brand name “PadPak®.” We offer a variety of PadPak® units, each of which provide protection for fragile objects from shocks and vibrations experienced during the shipping process. These proprietary systems convert paper into cushioning pads by crimping the paper to trap air between the layers and/or winding paper into dense discs for use in cushioning particularly heavy objects for shipping. Our PadPak® family of products was the original product offering from when our company was founded in 1972. We believe our PadPak® systems are known in the marketplace for their high level of breakage protection, low in-the-box cost, high-speed throughput and operational reliability.
 We have an installed base of approximately 34,000 PadPak® units as of December 31, 2020. In 2020, our PadPak® products generated $125.7 million in net revenue, which accounted for 42.2% of our net revenue.  
 The primary competitors to our Cushioning product line are foam-in-place, plastic bubble on demand and other competing paper systems. We believe our PadPak® products are superior to these products for a number of reasons. First, our PadPak® product line is more environmentally friendly than foam and plastic bubble wrap, as the paper packaging material is entirely paper-based, biodegradable and curb-side recyclable for end consumers, whereas foam products are chemical- and petroleum-based. As a result, foams are not biodegradable and, in production, foam-in-place can release harmful byproducts. Also, foam-in-place, EPE/EPS foams and plastic bubble wrap are of limited recyclability. Second, we believe our PadPak® cushioning solutions absorb shocks and maintain their shape better than other packaging media, such as plastic bubble wrap, which is not well-suited for sharp or heavy products and can transmit shock to lighter weight products. Third, within an end-user’s facility, we believe our PadPak® systems require less physical space and less maintenance and are easier to handle than the toxic elements required by packaging systems like polymer-based foam-in-place. Moreover, our PadPak® systems can be deployed in greater number of configurations, at a higher level of automation, and require less facility space for material storage than bubble wrap applications, and safe storage versus hazardous chemicals like foam-in-place chemicals.
 Wrapping
 We sell our Wrapping products under the brand names WrapPak®, Geami®, and “ReadyRoll.” We manufacture a variety of WrapPak® and Geami® converter units. Our WrapPak® protective packaging systems crimp kraft paper into flat pads that, we believe, are highly effective in wrapping, interleaving, box-lining and cold chain applications.
 Our Geami® product line is a high-end wrapping system that combines tissue paper and kraft paper which is dispensed simultaneously by Geami® converting machines. The kraft paper is die-cut at our production facilities using a proprietary process, so that when it is dispensed on-site by an end-user the paper expands into a two-dimensional ridged honeycomb. The tissue paper provides surface protection for the wrapped item and separates layers of the honeycomb to maximize its cushioning properties. The resulting Geami construction is ideal for securely wrapping household goods and other fragile items.
 We have an installed base of approximately 16,000 WrapPak® units, which were predominantly Geami® converter units, as of December 31, 2020. In 2020, Wrapping products generated $38.8 million in net revenue, which accounted for 13.0% of our net revenue.  Geami® net revenue includes sale of tissue rolls in addition to kraft paper.
 We offer both motorized Geami® dispensing systems and manual systems, where the operator simply pulls the paired sheets against tension to expand the die-cut kraft paper. We also offer the Geami® combination of die-cut and tissue in a disposable cardboard dispenser as well as in a Geami®-based offering to be sold directly to consumers without a dispenser in retail stores under the brand

name “Ranpak ReadyRoll.” We do not set minimum annual paper consumption targets for the disposable units, as the full production cost and margin associated with the dispenser is covered with each sale.
 The primary competitor to our Wrapping product lines is plastic bubble wrap. We believe our Wrapping products are superior to plastic bubble wrap for a number of reasons. First, we believe our Wrapping products are more environmentally friendly, as the paper packaging material is paper-based, curb-side recyclable and biodegradable, whereas plastic film-based wrapping products, like plastic bubble wrap, are often difficult for consumers to recycle if they are recyclable at all. Second, we believe our Wrapping solutions absorb shocks and maintain their shape better than bubble wrap, which is not well-suited for sharp or heavy products and can transmit shock to lighter weight products. Third, our Wrapping systems can be deployed in greater number of configurations, at a higher level of automation, and require less facility space for material storage than bubble wrap applications. Finally, we believe that Geami® and Ranpak ReadyRoll provide a much more elegant unboxing experience for our end-users’ customers, particularly when compared to that of plastic bubble wrap.  
 Automation
 We sell a highly customized Automation solution under the brand name “Ranpak Automation.” Our Ranpak Automation product line is focused on designing, manufacturing, and selling highly automated, turn-key integrated box-sizing systems to high-volume end-users. We are in the process of expanding Ranpak Automation’s offering to grow the ongoing spare parts design and service business. The systems are designed to help minimize the use of in-the-box packaging for these end-users while fully automating their end-of-line operations. We acquired our Ranpak Automation product line through our acquisition of Neopack Solutions S.A.S. in 2017 (“e3neo”).
 Our highly automated Ranpak Automation systems integrate devices that determine the optimal box height for the items to be shipped with a mechanism that automatically sizes the height of the box to fit the item. These systems are designed to give end-users the flexibility to make various box heights along a single production line. Moreover, our Automation systems consist of linked modular units that can easily be expanded with additional modules to meet an end-user’s changing needs.
 In 2020, Ranpak Automation generated $8.7 million in net revenue, which accounted for 2.9% of our net revenue.
 Unlike our Void-Fill, Cushioning and Wrapping systems, we currently design and sell our Automation systems outright to our customers, and derive net revenue from our Automation products by designing, manufacturing, installing and servicing Automation systems at end-user facilities. Accordingly, our current business model for our Automation product line involves the direct or indirect sale of highly customized systems, designed on the basis of our consultancy and product engineering expertise.
 We believe the growing operational, through-put requirements and a tight labor market experienced by medium- and large-scale e-commerce retailers will increase the demand for highly automated end-of-line systems. Accordingly, we expect our Automation business model and product offerings, as well as those of our competitors, to evolve rapidly within the next several years as the market continues to develop and we address the growing needs of our end-users.
 We believe our Automation product line is superior to its competition for a number of reasons. First, in our view, our Automation systems can typically operate at a higher speed than comparable products, resulting in a higher through-put for end-users. Second, our Automation systems typically require less floor space for installation and operation in an end-user’s facility. Third, we believe our Automation systems provide end-users with greater flexibility than our competitors’ products, in terms of the high level of customization and the ease of expansion through the addition of new modules.  Finally, we believe that we provide customers with a comprehensive and optimal end-of-line automated packaging solution, rather than just selling a product.  
 Industry
 Although the macroeconomic effects of COVID-19 are not yet fully known, our relevant addressable market of the broader global protective packaging industry is an estimated $8.8 billion in 2021 and growing. The global protective packaging industry is fragmented and competitive with market leaders accounting for a relatively small share of the market. This fragmentation is due primarily to the variety of product types and the myriad of applications in which they are used around the world.
 Protective packaging is used to store and protect goods during shipping and handling from shock, vibration, abrasion and other damages. It is mainly used to fill the empty space between the product/merchandise and exterior carton or container (often referred to as dunnage), or to protect goods during shipment. As a general matter, the value of the goods being shipped, as well as the potential cost of breakage, far outweigh the cost of in-the-box protective packaging, which drives the demand for effective protective packaging solutions like ours. Protective packaging comes in various forms such as foam, air pillows, bubble wrap, cushion products, loose fill (e.g., Styrofoam packing peanuts), paperboard protectors and protective mailers, as well as non-engineered solutions such as newsprint, tissue paper, shredded corrugated cardboard and other materials.

The protective packaging industry is characterized by a diversity of applications and end markets, within both the industrial and consumer segments. Historically, growth in the protective packaging industry has been positively impacted by trends such as expedited delivery of individualized packages, globalization of the supply chain, and increased focus on efficiency and reduced shipping costs. We believe more recent and future growth drivers include further expansion of e-commerce activity, increased customization of protective packaging systems in markets such as electronics, and increased demand for environmentally friendly protective packaging. Moreover, in our view, those markets most closely linked to e-commerce and/or sustainable packaging are those best positioned for growth in the future.
 Our Market
 Our end-user market consists of any business that sells and ships products requiring random packaging. Accordingly, these end-users are highly dependent on their ability to obtain a cost-effective and efficient in-the-box packaging solution. Our end-users operate in a variety of businesses, including e-commerce, the automotive after-market, electronics, machinery/manufacturing, home goods, pharmaceuticals, retail and others.
 We primarily sell our products to our distributors which, in turn, market and sell our products to our end-users. We also sell products directly to select end-users. In 2020, 85.5% of our net revenue was derived from sales to our distributors and approximately 14.5% of our net revenue was derived from sales directly to end-users.
 Distributors.  We primarily sell our products to our network of over 250 distributors worldwide. These distributors vary in size and, generally, offer a broad suite of packaging and other warehousing products and services to the end-users they serve, including other protective packaging systems, such as plastic bubble wrap and air pillows. Substantially all of our net revenue from distributors is generated by those who have agreed to exclusivity with our products and not to sell or promote competitors’ paper-based solutions.  We believe that our distributors agree to these restrictions due to the exceptional value proposition our products provide to the end-users they serve.
 Additionally, our distributors benefit from the collaborative approach we foster with our internal sales, engineering and marketing organization. We work with our distributors to win additional end-users of our paper-based products that the distributor, in turn, can service on an on-going basis with a broad suite of packaging equipment and supplies. Our distributors also typically address the needs of our end-users directly with respect to any ongoing protective system service needs. In order to facilitate the collaborative process, we meet with our distributors to discuss end-user needs and potential solutions, provide training programs (including through our Ranpak Academy program) for distributors that are designed to cultivate their knowledge of, and loyalty to, our brands, as well as provide the tools they need to successfully market and place our systems.
 As a result of these and other efforts, we have built and maintained a well-established distributor network that is comprised primarily of long-term business relationships, as demonstrated by an average relationship greater than 20 years with our top ten global distributors. The continuity of these relationships evidences the strength of our business model, as well as the value proposition for our distributors and end-users. Furthermore, the depth and longevity of these relationships result in a distributor network that is highly knowledgeable and well versed in conveying the benefits of our systems to end-users.
 We believe that our distributor-based distribution model is particularly well suited to the highly fragmented nature of the protective packaging solution end-user market we seek to serve by enabling us to reach a broad range of end users across size, industry and geography while maintaining a lean internal salesforce and capital base.
 We charge our distributors for the paper consumables they purchase from us to provide to end-users, as well as a user fee for each protective packaging system they obtain from us for installation with an end-user. Our distributors take possession of our systems and paper consumables at our facilities and are responsible for any transit costs incurred to ship our products to their own inventory warehouses or an end-user’s location. Moreover, distributors take responsibility to ensure that the converters are, and remain, a highly valuable asset to all the players along the value chain.
 End-Users.  We have greater than 33,000 end-users located across North America, Europe, Asia, Oceania, South America, and Africa. These end-users operate in wide variety of businesses and rely on our systems for a cost-effective and efficient paper-based protective packaging solution that meets their operational and shipping needs. Our universe of end-users is diverse and historically stable, with greater than 80.0% of distributor-serviced accounts generating less than $10,000 in annual net revenue in 2020. Our end-users vary in size from extremely small specialty manufacturers or retailers to some of the largest global e-commerce companies. While most of our end-users purchase our products from our distributors, we also sell our products directly to select end-users. Direct sales to end-users accounted for approximately 14.5% of our net revenue in 2020.
 E-commerce.  We believe changing consumer preferences and buying habits will drive continued e-commerce growth, both among pure-play e-commerce companies, as well as among historical brick-and-mortar companies seeking to expand their e-commerce 
 10


presence. We further believe the critical necessity of brand owners to optimize supply chains and reduce capital spend drives the important trend in concentration of logistics through third-party logistics providers that in turn drives increasing needs for efficient packaging end-of-line solutions. The availability of a broader product selection on-line, faster delivery times, and increased in-store pickup options all drive significant growth in on-line sales. This expansion of e-commerce is a worldwide trend that we believe will continue to accelerate as on-line penetration grows in developed and emerging markets. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the growing macroeconomic emphasis on e-commerce in the global economy.  Although some of our e-commerce end-users are focused on the responsible reduction of their need for void-fill material more broadly, they generally require protective packaging solutions that can be integrated into their existing supply and distribution infrastructures on a low-cost and efficient basis. Most commonly, our e-commerce end-users purchase our Void-Fill solutions, but many also use our Automation, Wrapping and/or Cushioning systems. Sales to our e-commerce end-users, directly and through distributors accounted for approximately 34.9% of our net revenue in 2020.
 Industrial Manufacturing.  Our industrial manufacturing end market includes end users manufacturing products utilized for tools, construction supplies, energy and utilities, chemicals, paints, and metals. We believe demand in these sectors will increase as growing populations and expanding middle classes in developing countries generate more disposable income. Higher demand for advanced machines spurs increased spending on tools and robotics while higher demand for housing, infrastructure and commercial buildings benefits the tools and construction supplies sectors.  Sales to industrial manufacturing end-users accounted for approximately 12.6% of our net revenue in 2020.
 Automotive Aftermarket.  The automotive after-market is driven by the need for replacement parts as automobiles age, as well as by the desire of consumers to customize vehicles to enhance performance and improve aesthetics. Increasing average age of vehicles and digitalization of component delivery sales and services, along with the advent of on-line portals distributing after-market components is expected to contribute to the continued growth of the automotive after-market industry. Our automotive after-market end-users require protective packaging solutions that have strong protective qualities, as the products they ship are often heavy, require greater care in handling, and have a higher individual per-unit value. Accordingly, these end-users most commonly purchase our Cushioning solutions. Our packaging solutions are typically designed to integrate into these end-users’ existing industrial processes for the production and distribution of automotive parts. Sales to our automotive after-market end-users accounted for approximately 9.9% of our net revenue in 2020.  
 Electronics.  Widespread product innovation combined with an expanding working population, a corresponding growth in household formation and disposable incomes are key factors contributing to the growth of the global consumer electronics market. Thriving demand for smartphones across the globe and the miniaturization of electronic devices are additional factors boosting growth in the global consumer electronics market. We believe this demand for electronics will continue to grow as innovation, such as the Internet-of-Things and voice-connected devices, drives increased demand for the latest electronics hardware. Our electronics end-users customarily sell products such as computer hardware and electronics that are often already securely packaged in primary packages by the manufacturer and, as a result, require less robust protective packaging systems from us. Sales to our electronics end-users accounted for approximately 7.6% of our net revenue in 2020.
 Industrial Machinery.  We believe demand for industrial machinery and equipment used in sectors such as agriculture, construction, mining, packaging, and food processing will increase as economies expand, thus requiring additional infrastructure spend as well as increasing the need to feed growing middle-class populations across the globe. Sales to our machinery end-users accounted for approximately 6.1% of our net revenue in 2020.
 Other.  Our end-users also operate in many other industries, including Warehousing (5.2% of net revenue in 2020), Home Furnishings (4.2%), Printing and Business Services (3.1%), and other various industries (16.4%).
 Our Sales, Marketing, and Distribution
 Our sales and marketing efforts are focused on developing and expanding distributor relationships, cultivating large accounts, co-selling with distributor sales representatives, educating end-users on the advantages of our product offerings and capturing customer requirements to drive our product innovation efforts. Our flexible go-to-market strategy consists of sales and marketing efforts aimed at distributors and end-users to drive demand through distribution. This sales, marketing and distribution organization allows us to reach end-users across industries and around the globe.
 Our internal sales and marketing team partners with distributors to proactively target new accounts and pull sales through the distribution network. We intend to continue investing in our distributor partners and sales force to optimize their market focus, enter new vertical segments, and provide our distributor partners with training, marketing programs and technical support, including through our Ranpak Academy, a training and product education program we offer frequently to new and existing distributors. Our training programs are designed to cultivate distributor knowledge and loyalty to our brands and to provide distributors with the tools necessary to successfully place our systems with the end-users they serve.

Our internal sales teams, marketing operations, and customer service operations are organized geographically with sales and support operations aligned under North American, European and Asia-Pacific geographies. Each geography is managed through a structure of regional general sales managers and national account managers, as well as individual account managers who cover specific states, countries or industries within a region.
 As of December 31, 2020, we employed 80 sales, marketing and customer service personnel in the United States; 94 sales, marketing and customer service personnel in Europe; and 23 sales, marketing and customer service personnel in Asia.
 Our Manufacturing and Assembly Processes
 We manufacture and assemble proprietary protective systems that convert kraft paper into a broad range of packaging and cushioning products to address our customers’ needs. Our objective is to leverage our scale to achieve purchasing efficiencies and reduce our total delivered cost across our regions. We do this while adhering to strategic performance metrics and stringent purchasing practices. All four of our U.S. sites and both of our European sites renewed their certification under ISO 9001:2015 standards in 2019.  The certification expires in 2021, however, is anticipated to be renewed.
 We purchase the components for our protective packaging systems, as well as certain assembled systems, from a variety of well-established international design and manufacturing partners. We then assemble certain proprietary protective systems at our in-house facilities, employing highly skilled machine assembly teams. We also outsource the manufacture and assembly of a number of our proprietary protective systems to third-party manufacturing partners to be built in accordance with our design specifications, with a majority originating from China. We hold our suppliers to strict quality standards, and periodically conduct in-person audits of their facilities. With respect to our Ranpak Automation product line, the products are designed and manufactured at our in-house facilities or external contractors before installation at a customer’s facility. In 2020, we completed a facility dedicated solely to Ranpak Automation in Kerkrade, the Netherlands, located approximately three miles from our Heerlen location, to enhance our production capacity in our Automation business. We believe this state-of-the-art facility substantially increases our manufacturing and R&D capabilities, as well as provides a showroom for potential customers to see our extensive Automation product line.  As our Automation business expands globally, we believe the Kerkrade facility can serve as a blueprint for adding other potential Automation facilities, including in North America.
 We believe our design and manufacturing partners provide an important complement to our in-house design and manufacturing expertise. These partnerships give us great flexibility in choosing the optimal design and manufacturing solution for any product, whether that be entirely out-sourced, entirely in-sourced, or a blend of out-sourcing and in-sourcing. Accordingly, this network allows us to make design and manufacturing decisions on the basis of numerous factors, including cost, efficiency, level of intellectual property protection and reliability.
 Our Paper Suppliers
 We purchase both 100% virgin and 100% recycled kraft paper, as well as blends of materials recycled from post-consumer waste, from various suppliers for conversion into the paper consumables we sell. Before we determine to purchase paper from any supplier, the supplier must undergo a qualification process to ensure that its product meets our exacting requirements. This qualification process involves an evaluation of the physical specifications of the potential supply source, as well as extensive testing for the paper’s convertibility – on the fan-folding, rewinding and die-cutting raw paper converters in our facilities – and in the protective packaging systems we place with our end-users. All of our paper is sourced from suppliers that are SFI and/or FSC certified. Once a supplier is qualified, we purchase large rolls of kraft paper from that supplier for integration into our existing supply and production chain. The paper rolls are converted at our facilities before sale to our distributors and direct end-users for use with our Void-Fill, Cushioning and Wrapping protective systems.
 In 2020, we purchased paper from approximately 22 paper suppliers and our largest single source of paper supplies sold us approximately 44.9% of the paper supplies purchased in North America. While the cost of paper supplies is our largest input cost, we negotiate supply and pricing arrangements with most of our paper suppliers annually, many of which we have long-standing relationships with, which helps us mitigate shorter term fluctuations in paper cost.
 Our Competition
 The markets in which we operate are highly competitive and fragmented due to the large number of participants and the variety of product types and applications in which they are used around the world. Industry participants include specialized firms that focus on protective packaging, packaging companies that offer protective products among other product lines, and packaging material producers that supply packaging materials to end-users. Other competitors focus on narrow market segments (such as thermal), provide a limited range of products, or operate in a discrete geography. Finally, some competitors offer commoditized products, such as protective mailers or non-systems-based solutions that can be used for less sophisticated protective packaging needs.

Companies in the protective packaging industry employ a variety of strategies to gain market share and compete. We are one of the few suppliers offering a full suite of fiber-based renewable protective packaging solutions to a diversified set of end markets on a global basis. Our “in-the-box” protective packaging solutions serve to minimize movement of products in a box and provide cushioning or bracing, which minimize damage. Most frequent competing products are air pillows, bubble wrap, foam-in-place, loose-fill and other fiber-based solutions. We believe fiber-based solutions are the most versatile option used for a wide variety of products in various end markets (electronics, automotive, e-commerce) and is the preferred environmentally friendly solution. Competition for most of our packaging products is based primarily on packaging product quality (reliability and durability), breakage protection, service, price, speed/throughput, environmental sustainability, and company reputation. Since competition is also based upon innovations in packaging technology, we maintain ongoing R&D programs to enable us to maintain technological leadership. We protect our investments in improving technology through maintaining a comprehensive patenting program and aggressively pursue infringers of our patented technology, features, and processes.
 We compete with companies producing competing products that are well-established, have significant scale, and have a broad product offering. There are other manufacturers of protective packaging products, some of which are companies offering similar products that operate across regions and others that operate in a single region or single country. Our primary competitors include Sealed Air Product Care Division, Pregis (FP International/Easypack), Intertape Polymer Group (IPG), Storopack and Sprick. Most competing manufacturers offer multi-substrate solutions including foam, loose-fill, plastic air pillows, and plastic bubble wrap in addition to a fiber-based offering. We believe we are the only major “in-the-box” protective packaging specialist that has a focus on a single environmentally friendly substrate (i.e., fiber) which enables us to have a best in class product offering as well as the credibility with customers that we are truly devoted to seeking environmentally sustainable solutions. We believe that we are one of the leading suppliers of fiber-based packaging materials and related systems in the principal geographic areas in which we offer those products. Additionally, due to internal technology development investments and the acquisition of the Ranpak Automation product line in 2017, we believe we are a leader in automated void reduction systems technology. Our Automation segment designs, manufactures, and sells automated box sizing equipment and provides turn-key end-of-line solutions to our customers.
 Human Capital Resources
 As of December 31, 2020, we had 645 employees worldwide, 264 of whom were located in the United States.  We have 153 of our employees located in Europe who are covered by collective bargaining agreements.
 We are proud to count men and women of all races and ethnicities as members of our Board of Directors, management team, and employee workforce.  In 2020, we joined The Board Challenge as a Charter Pledge Partner.  The Board Challenge is an initiative to improve diverse representation in corporate U.S. boardrooms.  As a Charter Pledge Partner, we acknowledge that we already have diversity in our boardroom and pledge to use our resources to accelerate change within other companies.  We are a global organization that values life experiences, ideas, and cultures that each of our employees bring to Ranpak, striving to create an atmosphere of acceptance and respect, facilitating an encouraging environment, and helping employees attain professional and educational goals.  We strive to maintain an active dialogue with our employees and provide employees a comprehensive benefits package including competitive wages, medical, life, and accident insurance, incentive bonus programs, and a 401(k) plan with an employer matching contribution.  We have departmental budgets set aside for training and also provide a tuition reimbursement program for employees seeking bachelors or masters degrees.  Certain employees are also eligible for stock-based compensation programs that are designed to encourage long-term performance aligned with Company objectives.  
 Our Intellectual Property
 Our intellectual property provides a strong competitive advantage. We own or license over 645 U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications directed to various innovations related to packaging machines, stock material, packaging processes, and packaging products, as well as more than 180 U.S. and foreign trademark registrations and trademark applications that protect our branding of our packaging products, services, and equipment. We continue to innovate and advance that competitive advantage. We have filed an average of approximately 25 U.S. and foreign patent applications per year over the past 10 years. We are also vigilant in protecting our intellectual property, by monitoring competitor activity, providing notice to potential infringers, and bringing litigation whenever and wherever necessary and appropriate.
Seasonality
 Ranpak estimates that approximately 34.9% of its net revenue in 2020, either directly or to distributors, was destined for end-users in the e-commerce sectors, whose businesses frequently follow traditional retail seasonal trends, including a concentration of sales in the holiday period in the fourth quarter.  Ranpak’s results tend to follow similar patterns, with the highest net revenue typically recorded in its fourth fiscal quarter and the slowest sales in its first fiscal quarter of each fiscal year.  Ranpak expects this seasonality to continue in the future, as a result of which its results of operations between fiscal quarters in a given year may not be directly comparable.

Governmental Regulation
 Federal, State, Local, and International Regulations
 We are required to comply with numerous laws and regulations covering areas such as workplace health and safety, data privacy and protection, labor and employment. We monitor changes in these laws to maintain compliance with applicable requirements.  Compliance with, or liability under, these laws and regulations may require us to incur significant costs and have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, and competitive position.  
Environmental Matters
 We are subject to a number of federal, state, local and international environmental-related health and safety laws and regulations that govern, among other things, the manufacture and assembly of our products; the discharge or pollutants into the air, soil and water; the use, handling, transportation, storage and disposals of hazardous materials; and environmental remediation or reclamation activities. We are required to hold various permits to conduct our operations. Compliance with, or liability under, these laws, regulations and permits can require us to incur significant costs and have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, and competitive position.
Legal Proceedings
 From time to time, we have and may again become party to intellectual property litigation or other legal proceedings that we consider to be a part of the ordinary course of our business. Historically, one category of legal proceeding to which we have been a party has involved claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement. While we are judicious in initiating litigation to those circumstances justified by legal and business considerations, we have initiated and will continue to initiate affirmative action to protect our intellectual property. This litigation includes defending counterclaims brought by the counterparty against whom we have initiated a claim of infringement as part of their infringement-defense strategy.
