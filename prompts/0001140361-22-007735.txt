ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview
 
We develop and commercialize point-of-care diagnostic tests used for the rapid detection and diagnosis of infectious diseases, including sexually transmitted disease, insect vector and tropical disease, COVID-19 and other viral and bacterial infections, enabling expedited treatment.
 Our product portfolio is based upon our proprietary DPP technology, a diagnostic platform that provides high-quality, cost-effective results in 15 to 20 minutes using fingertip blood, nasal swabs and other sample types. The DPP technology platform addresses the rapid diagnostic test market, which includes infectious diseases such as STI’s and HIV, Gastroenterology and Women’s Health. Compared with traditional lateral flow technology, the DPP technology platform can provide:
 
 
• | Enhanced sensitivity and specificity: This is achieved via our patented approach to separating the sample path from the buffer path, together with other patented and proprietary strategies, that differ significantly from traditional lateral flow test. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Advanced multiplexing capabilities: Through advanced multiplexing, the DPP platform can detect and differentiate up to eight distinct test results from a single patient sample, which can deliver greater clinical value than other rapid tests currently on the market. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Objective results: For some diagnostic applications, our easy-to-use, highly portable, battery-operated DPP Micro Reader optical analyzers can report accurate results in approximately 15 seconds, making it well-suited for decentralized testing where real-time results enable patients to be clinically assessed while they are still onsite. Objective results produced by the DPP Micro Reader can reduce the possibility of the types of human error that can be experienced in the visual interpretations required by many rapid tests. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We target the market for rapid diagnostic test solutions for infectious diseases, which is driven by the high prevalence of infectious diseases globally, an increase in the elderly population, growing demand for rapid test results, and advancements in multiplexing. We have a broad portfolio of infectious disease products, which prior to 2020 were focused principally on sexually transmitted disease and fever and tropical disease. In February 2020 we began the process of shifting substantially all of our resources to seek to leverage the DPP technology platform to address the acute and escalating need for diagnostic testing for COVID-19. We are continuing to pursue:
 
 
• | an emergency use authorization, or EUA, from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, as well as 510(k) clearance from the FDA, for the DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen test system;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an EUA from the FDA for the DPP Respiratory Antigen Panel; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment, or CLIA, waiver from the FDA for the DPP HIV-Syphilis test system.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



For additional information about our existing and proposed product offerings, please see “—Products” below. Our products are sold globally, directly and through distributors, to medical laboratories and hospitals, governmental and public health entities, nongovernmental organizations, medical professionals, and retail establishments. We continue to seek to expand our commercial distribution channels.



 
The extensive economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, exacerbated by the market and regulatory complications we faced in seeking to develop and commercialize a portfolio of COVID-19 test systems, was reflected in our operating results for 2021, as total revenues were $47.8 million, an increase of 47.3% from 2020, and net product sales were $34.8 million, an increase of 40.3% from 2020. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Consolidated Results of Operations.”
  In 2021 we continued to invest in automating our test manufacturing processes, all of which are now based in the United States. Among other actions, we expanded our manufacturing capabilities by validating and implementing automated lines. Our transition from manual to automated assembly is intended to add capacity, reduce variable costs and improve product margins. In order to address challenging economic conditions and implement our business strategy, we continued to execute a program to reduce operating expenses and better align our costs with revenues by eliminating positions that were no longer aligned with our strategy. Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $28.8 million at December 31, 2021, compared to $23.1 million at December 31, 2020.
 
The Company’s future working capital needs will depend on many factors, including the rate of its business and revenue growth, the availability and cost of human, material and other resources required to build and deliver products in accordance with its existing or future product orders, the timing of its continuing automation of manufacturing, and the timing of its investment in research and development as well as sales and marketing. If the Company is unable to increase its revenues and manage its expenses in accordance with its operating plan, it may need to reduce the level or slow the timing of the growth plans contemplated by its operating plan, which would likely curtail or delay the growth in its business contemplated by its operating plan and could impair or defer its ability to achieve profitability and generate cash flow, or to seek to raise additional funds through debt or equity financings, strategic relationships, or other arrangements. All DPP tests are developed and manufactured in the United States and are the subject of a range of domestic and global patents and patents pending.
 
Going Concern Considerations
 
Revenues during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 did not meet the Company’s expectations. The Company’s increase in cash and cash equivalents over the year reflected its issuance of common stock in at-the-market offerings for net proceeds of $38.8 million (see Note 9 - Stockholder’s Equity). The Company continued to experience market, clinical trial and regulatory complications in seeking to develop and commercialize a portfolio of COVID-19 test systems during the continuing, but evolving, uncertainty of the COVID‑19 pandemic. In the year ending on December 31, 2021, the Company continued to incur significant expenses in connection with pending legal matters (see Note 12 – Commitments, Contingencies, and Concentrations: Litigation), delayed achievement of milestones associated with government grant income, investments in inventory, and the continuing automation of manufacturing.
 
The Company performed an assessment to determine whether there were conditions or events that, considered in the aggregate, raised substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the accompanying consolidated financial statements are being issued. Initially, this assessment did not consider the potential mitigating effect of management’s plans that had not been fully implemented. Because, as described below, substantial doubt was determined to exist as the result of this initial assessment, management then assessed the mitigating effect of its plans to determine if it is probable that the plans (1) would be effectively implemented within one year after the date the accompanying consolidated financial statements are issued and (2) when implemented, would mitigate the relevant conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern.
 
During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, the Company undertook measures to increase its total revenues and improve its liquidity position. In particular, the Company received significant purchase orders from two customers (the “July Purchase Orders”). The Company had pursued the July Purchase Orders for an extended period of time. The July Purchase Orders consist of the following:
 
 
• | On July 20, 2021, the Company received a $28.3 million purchase order from Bio-Manguinhos for the purchase of DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen tests for delivery during 2021 to support the urgent needs of Brazil’s Ministry of Health in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. Bio-Manguinhos, is responsible for the development and production of vaccines, diagnostics and biopharmaceuticals, primarily to meet the demand of Brazil’s national public health system. As of December 31, 2021 $16.8 million was recognized in connection with this order. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | On July 22, 2021, the Company received a $4 million purchase order from the Partnership for Supply Chain Management, supported by The Global Fund, for the purchase of HIV 1/2 STAT-PAK Assays for shipment to Ethiopia into early 2022. As of December 31, 2021 $1.2 million was recognized in connection with this order. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



These measures and other plans and initiatives have been designed to provide the Company with adequate liquidity to meet its obligations for at least the twelve-month period following the date the accompanying consolidated financial statements are being issued. The Company’s execution of those measures and its other plans and initiatives continue to depend, however, on factors and uncertainties that are beyond the Company’s control, or that may not be addressable on terms acceptable to the Company or at all. The Company considered in particular how:
 
 
• | The ongoing healthcare and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global customer base for the Company’s non‑COVID-19 products continue to negatively affect the timing and rate of recovery of the Company’s revenues from those products by, for example, decreasing the allocation of funding for HIV testing, thereby continuing to adversely affect the Company’s liquidity. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Although the Company has entered into agreements to distribute third-party COVID-19 products in the United States, its ability to sell those products could be constrained because of staffing and supply chain limitations affecting the suppliers of those products. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 The Company further considered how these factors and uncertainties could impact its ability over the next year to meet the obligations specified in the Credit Agreement with the Lender (each as defined in Note 13 – Long-Term Debt). Those obligations include covenants requiring: 1) minimum cash balance of $3.0 million and ii) minimum total revenue amounts for the twelve months preceding each quarter end. For the next year, the minimum total revenue requirements range from $42.0 million for the twelve months ending March 31, 2022 to $47.4 million for the twelve months ending December 31, 2022. Upon an event of default under the Credit Agreement, the Lender could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. In such an event, there can be no assurance that the Company would have sufficient liquidity to fund payment of the amounts that would be due under the Credit Agreement or that, if such liquidity were not available, the Company would be successful in raising additional capital on acceptable terms, or at all, or in completing any other endeavor to continue to be financially viable and continue as a going concern. The Company’s inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms in the near future, whether for purposes of funding payments required under the Credit Agreement or providing additional liquidity needed for its operations, could have a material adverse effect on its business, prospects, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.


Accordingly, management determined the Company could not be certain that the Company’s plans and initiatives would be effectively implemented within one year after the date on which the accompanying consolidated financial statements are being issued. Without giving effect to the prospect of raising additional capital pursuant to the ATM Agreement (as defined in Note 9 – Stockholders’ Equity: Common Stock), increasing product revenue in the near future or executing other mitigating plans, many of which are beyond the Company’s control, it is unlikely that the Company will be able to generate sufficient cash flows to meet its required financial obligations, including its debt service and other obligations due to third parties. The existence of these conditions raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for the twelve-month period following the date on which the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements are being issued.
 


 
The accompanying audited consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business for the twelve-month period following the date the accompanying consolidated financial statements are issued. As such, the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets and their carrying amounts, or the amount and classification of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

Products
 
COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems
 
Prior to 2020, our broad portfolio of infectious disease products was focused principally on sexually transmitted disease and fever and tropical disease. In 2020 we shifted substantially all of our resources to leverage the DPP technology platform to address the acute and escalating need for diagnostic testing for COVID-19.
  COVID-19 Antibody Test System
In January 2021 we announced the CE mark for both the DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen test system and the DPP SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG test system, providing regulatory approval to register and market the test systems in the European Union and other geographies that accept the CE mark.
  COVID-19 Antigen Test System
In mid-2020 we began to focus on the development of a COVID-19 antigen test system based on DPP technology. In July 2020 we received a $628,071 grant from BARDA to assist us in developing, submitting and obtaining an EUA application for a COVID-19 point-of-care antigen system. In October 2020, with BARDA’s support in accordance with its grant, we submitted to the FDA an EUA application for the DPP SARS‑CoV‑2 Antigen System, a test system that consists of a DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen test cartridge, a DPP Micro Reader optical analyzer and a minimally invasive nasal swab.
 


 
In November 2020 ANVISA approved the DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen test system for use in Brazil. In January 2021 we announced the CE mark for the DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen test system, providing regulatory approval to register and market the test systems in the European Union and other geographies that accept the CE mark.
 
In December 2020 we received a $12.7 million grant from BARDA, in part to support preparation of a submission in pursuit of FDA 510(k) clearance for the DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen System.
 
In January 2021 the FDA notified us that it was declining to review the DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen System based on its updated prioritization guidance, under which review of the system was not a priority. The FDA has supplementally advised us of the type and nature of information it would need to receive in a subsequent EUA application in order for the DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen System to be prioritized for review, and we are engaged in testing and development in order to submit a new EUA application for a COVID-19 antigen test system.
 
During the year ending December 31, 2021 we performed the clinical trials and on December 2, 2021 we submitted the DPP SARS‑CoV‑2 Antigen test system to the FDA, as a de Novo submission.
 
COVID-19 and Influenza Respiratory Antigen Panel Test System
 
In the fourth quarter of 2020 we began developing a rapid, multiplex respiratory antigen panel point-of-care test system using DPP technology. BARDA designated a portion of its $12.7 million grant in December 2020 for use to support our development, submission and receipt of an EUA for this system.
 
During 2021, we developed and conducted clinical trials of the DPP Respiratory Antigen Panel, a test system being designed to provide simultaneous, discrete and differential detection of Influenza A, Influenza B and SARS-CoV-2 antigens from a single patient respiratory specimen, such as a nasal swab. The system is intended to enable appropriate clinical management of patients with suspected respiratory infections and to assist in the containment of COVID-19 cases during the flu season. This test system provides results in approximately 20 minutes and is run on the DPP Micro Reader. As of December 31, 2021, we have submitted a request for the EUA approval by the FDA which is currently under review. In addition, as of December 31, 2021, we submitted a request for approval to ANVISA in Brazil and CE in Europe, which has been approved as of the date of this filing.
 
As a result, we earned $12.5 million of the $12.7 million available under the BARDA Agreement, dated December 2, 2020 with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA (part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response) with the remaining $0.2 million having not been earned because it was contingent on our receiving an emergency use authorization for the DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen by December 2, 2021.
 
HIV-Syphilis Diagnostic Test Systems
 
On December 1, 2021, we received notice from the FDA that it would require additional data related to our Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment, or CLIA, waiver submission for the DPP HIV-Syphilis test system. We are in active discussions with the FDA in connection with the FDA’s review of our submission and we intend to comply with the FDA’s request for additional data. The process of seeking additional data will extend, for a currently undeterminable period, our process for seeking a CLIA waiver for the DPP HIV-Syphilis test system.

• | advances in our product pipeline in infectious disease with key products including tests for COVID-19, a multiplex test for HIV and syphilis in the U.S. market and tests for dengue, zika and chikungunya. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



We market and sell both stand-alone and multiplex tests for sexually transmitted infectious diseases, such as HIV and syphilis which continue to be major global public health issues. According to WHO estimates:
 
 
• | HIV has claimed more than 36 million lives, including 680,000 in 2020. Approximately 37.7 million people were living with HIV at the end of 2020, and 1.5 million were newly infected during 2020.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | There were 18.0 million prevalent cases of syphilis as of 2012, and 5.6 million new infections were estimated to occur annually.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Elimination of mother-to-child transmission, or MTCT, of both HIV and syphilis is a global health priority. In 2013, 1.9 million pregnant women were infected with syphilis worldwide. Congenital syphilis contributes significantly to infant mortality, accounting for 305,000 annual perinatal deaths worldwide in 2013. Globally, more than 1.4 million pregnant women were infected with HIV as of 2015, and MTCT of HIV is estimated to have resulted in over 150,000 infant cases in 2015. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------





 
We are seeking to address the global concerns related to HIV and syphilis co-infection through the development of a novel, multiplex test for both HIV and syphilis. We have developed a DPP HIV-Syphilis multiplex test and received regulatory approvals in the United States and a number of international markets, including Brazil, Europe, Africa, Malaysia and Mexico. We are pursuing a CLIA waiver for the DPP HIV-Syphilis test in the United States.
 
We also market and sell tests for selected fever and tropical diseases such as Chagas, ebola, leishmaniasis and Zika. The market for lateral flow mosquito-borne diseases includes established markets for disease such as dengue and malaria, which WHO estimates together account for more than 600 million annual infections worldwide. There are also a number of emerging markets for rapid point of care tests for infectious diseases such as burkholderia, chikungunya, lassa, leptospirosis, Marburg, rickettsia and Zika.
 
Since 2015 we have received over $25.1 million of funding from some of the world’s leading health organizations, which has helped us accelerate the expansion of our pipeline of infectious disease tests. Our collaborators have included Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, The Paul G. Allen Family Foundation, The Oswaldo Cruz Foundation or FIOCRUZ, and the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics, or FIND, as well as U.S. government agencies such as Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or BARDA, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or USDA.
 
Several tests in our infectious disease pipeline are approaching commercialization, and several have received initial regulatory approvals:

Sales Channels
 
Our products are sold globally, both directly and through distributors, to hospitals and clinics, physician offices, clinical laboratories, public health organizations, government agencies and consumers. Historically we marketed and sold our products only into a handful of countries and regions. During 2021, we expanded our U.S.-based sales, customer service, and marketing team to focus on the COVID-19, HIV-Syphilis, and future DPP platform product opportunities. With sales growth as an underlying objective, we are focused on increasing sales in geographies that support higher average selling prices. From lead generation through technical inquiries, Chembio has the internal resources to support customers through the commercial process including marketing, sales, sales support, order entry and product support.
 
Automation of U.S. Manufacturing
 
We are automating our U.S. manufacturing processes and expanding our manufacturing capacity. Over the past three years, we have taken delivery of and completed validation of most of our automated manufacturing lines. These use vision-guided, robotic operation to improve inspection and quality control. As we transition from manual to automated assembly, we believe the reduced variable costs will improve product gross margins.
 
DPP Technology & Development
 
Our commercially available products employ either our patented DPP technology or traditional lateral flow technology. We believe products developed using our DPP technology can provide superior diagnostic performance compared with products that utilize traditional lateral flow technology.
 
Chembio’s history of collaborations have proven the strength and capabilities of the DPP platform to address a diverse range of biomarkers. We are now focusing our R&D resources on delivering products to build a portfolio of COVID-19 tests and developing Chembio’s new and expanded product portfolio focused on high average selling price, developed markets, established sales channels, and clinically accepted use cases, where the differentiated capabilities of DPP provide a competitive advantage.
 
Competition
 
Many of our competitors are significantly larger and have greater financial, research, manufacturing, and marketing resources. Important competitive factors include product quality, analytical performance, ease of use, price, customer service and reputation. Industry competition is based on these and the following additional factors:

• | patent protection;
--+-------------------


• | scientific expertise;
--+----------------------


• | ability to develop and market products and processes;
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | ability to obtain required regulatory approvals;
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | ability to manufacture cost-effective products that meet applicable regulatory requirements;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | access to adequate capital; and,
--+---------------------------------


• | ability to attract and retain qualified personnel.
--+---------------------------------------------------



We believe our scientific capabilities and proprietary know-how relating to our patented DPP technology and lateral flow technology are very strong, particularly for the development and manufacture of tests for the detection of  infectious and other diseases.
 


 
Although we have no specific knowledge of any other competitors’ products that could render our products obsolete, if we fail to maintain and enhance our competitive position or fail to introduce new products and product features, our customers may decide to use the products developed by our competitors, which could result in a loss of revenues and cash flow.
 
Human Capital
 
As of December 31, 2021, we had 337 full-time equivalent employees, of whom 46 were in administration, 241 were in manufacturing, 28 were in research and development, and 22 were in sales and marketing and customer service. Of these employees, approximately 297 were located in the United States, 22 were located in Germany and 18 were located in Brazil. We have never had a work stoppage, and none of our employees are represented by a labor organization or subject to any collective bargaining arrangements. We consider our employee relations to be good.
 
Our employees are one of our most important assets and set the foundation for our ability to achieve our strategic objectives, drive operational execution, deliver strong financial performance, advance innovation and maintain our quality and compliance programs. The success and growth of our business depends in large part on our ability to attract, retain and develop a diverse population of talented and high-performing employees at all levels of our organization.
 
Health, Wellness and Safety
 
The health, wellness and safety of our employees is a priority embedded at every level of our business.  We provide our employees upfront and ongoing safety training to ensure that safety policies and procedures are effectively communicated and implemented.  Personal protective equipment is provided to those employees where needed for the employee to safely perform their job function.
 
Since 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented safety protocols and new procedures to protect our employees, including more frequent deep cleaning of the facilities, social distancing and onsite COVID-19 testing.
 
Workforce Stability
 
Retaining and developing our employees is an important factor in our continued success and growth. We regularly evaluate our employee retention and turnover rates. With the contraction of the labor force as a result of the global pandemic, we have also experienced the effects of the labor shortage in our staffing. We expect the labor shortage to continue in 2022 and will continue to monitor and analyze retention closely to identify any areas of concern.
Compensation and Benefits
 
To succeed in a competitive labor market, we have recruitment and retention strategies that we focus on as part of the overall management of our business, including designing our compensation and benefits programs to be competitive and align with our strategic and stockholders’ interests. Some of our key employee benefits include eligibility for health insurance, vacation time, a retirement plan, an employee assistance program, life and disability coverage. We also have procedures and processes focused on providing employees equitable compensation, regardless of race or gender or other personal characteristics.
 
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
 
The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted nearly every aspect of the global supply chain, including the manufacturing of some of the key supplies used in our tests. Many suppliers are experiencing shortages of required personnel as the result of the tight labor market and underlying raw material commodities. To fulfil our obligations, we have had to identify sources of supplies on a short timeframe and in a markedly increased quantity and have been required to seek to identify new sources of materials to replace or augment our past sources. Moreover, scarcity has caused increases in the cost of some supplies.
 


 
Governmental Regulation
 
Certain of our activities are subject to regulatory oversight by the FDA under provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and regulations thereunder, including regulations governing the development, marketing, labeling, promotion, manufacturing, and export of diagnostic products. Our clinical laboratory customers are subject to oversight by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, pursuant to CLIA, as well as agencies in various states. Failure to comply with applicable requirements can lead to sanctions, including withdrawal of products from the market, recalls, refusal to authorize government contracts, product seizures, civil money penalties, injunctions, and criminal prosecution.
 
FDA Approval/Clearance Requirements
 
Unless an exemption applies, each medical device that we market or wish to market in the United States must receive 510(k) clearance or Premarket Approval, or PMA. Medical devices that receive 510(k) clearance are “cleared” by the FDA to market, distribute, and sell in the United States. Medical devices that obtain a PMA by the FDA are “approved” to market, distribute and sell in the United States. We cannot be certain that 510(k) clearance or PMA approval will ever be obtained for any products that have not already obtained 510(k) clearance or PMA approval. Descriptions of the PMA and 510(k) clearance processes are provided below.
 
The FDA decides whether a device line must undergo either the 510(k) clearance or PMA based on statutory criteria that utilize a risk-based classification system. PMA is the FDA process of scientific and regulatory review to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Class III medical devices and, in many cases, Class II medical devices. Class III devices are those that support or sustain human life, are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury. The FDA uses these criteria to decide whether a PMA or a 510(k) is appropriate, including the level of risk that the agency perceives is associated with the device and a determination by the agency of whether the product is a type of device that is similar to devices that are already legally marketed. Devices deemed to pose relatively less risk are placed in either Class I or II. In many cases, the FDA requires the manufacturer to submit a 510(k) requesting clearance (also referred to as a premarket notification), unless an exemption applies. The 510(k) must demonstrate that the manufacturer’s proposed device is “substantially equivalent” in intended use and in safety and effectiveness to a legally marketed predicate device. A “predicate device” is a pre-existing medical device to which equivalence can be drawn, that is either in Class I or Class II or is a Class III device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, for which the FDA has not yet called for submission of a PMA application.
 
Device classification depends on the device’s intended use and its indications for use. In addition, classification is risk-based, that is, the risk the device poses to the patient and/or the user is a major factor in determining the class to which it is assigned. Class I includes devices with the lowest risk and Class III includes those with the greatest risk.
 
Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA’s general regulatory controls for medical devices, or the General Controls, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA’s quality system regulations, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Some Class I devices also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) process described below.
 
Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s General Controls, and any other special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) process. Pursuant to the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002, unless a specific exemption applies, 510(k) submissions are subject to user fees. Certain Class II devices are exempt from this premarket review process.
 
Class III includes devices with the greatest risk. Devices in this class must meet all of the requirements in Classes I and II. In addition, Class III devices cannot be marketed until they receive Premarket Approval.
 
The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be assured solely by the General Controls and the other requirements described above. These devices require formal clinical studies to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Under the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002, PMA applications (and supplemental premarket approval applications) are subject to significantly higher user fees than 510(k) applications, and they also require considerably more time and resources.
 


 
Rapid HIV tests intended for diagnostic use are regulated as Class III devices. Responsibility for assuring the safety and effectiveness of these tests lies within the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research’s Office of Blood Research and Review, with oversight by the Blood Products Advisory Committee. Approved rapid HIV tests must meet the regulations in the 21 CFR 800 series subparts, under the investigational device exemption, or IDE and PMA pathways.
 
Premarket Approval Pathway
 
We manufacture, market and distribute three rapid HIV tests in the United States. Our HIV 1/2 STAT-PAK Assay, SURE CHECK HIV 1/2 Assay, and DPP HIV 1/2 Assay all have received FDA PMA approval. A PMA application must be supported by extensive data including, but not limited to, analytical, preclinical, clinical trials, manufacturing, statutory preapproval inspections, and labeling to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. Before a PMA is submitted, a manufacturer must apply for an Investigational Device Exemption (“IDE”). If the device presents a “significant risk,” as defined by the FDA, to human health, the FDA requires the device sponsor to file an IDE application with the FDA and obtain IDE approval prior to initiation of enrollment of human subjects for clinical trials. The IDE provides the manufacturer with a legal pathway to perform clinical trials on human subjects where without the IDE, only approved medical devices may be used on human subjects.
 
The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as analytical, animal and laboratory testing results, manufacturing information, and an Investigational Review Board, or IRB approved protocol showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. If the clinical trial design is deemed to have “non-significant risk,” the clinical trial may be eligible for “abbreviated” IDE requirements. In some instances, clinical trials for in vitro diagnostic medical devices may be exempt from the more burdensome IDE requirements if certain labeling requirements are met.
 
A clinical trial may be suspended by either the FDA or the Investigational Review Board at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to the study participants outweigh the benefits of participation in the study. Even if a study is completed, clinical testing results may not demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the device, or they may be equivocal or otherwise insufficient to obtain approval of the product being tested. After the clinical trials have been completed, if at all, and the clinical trial data and results are collected and organized, a manufacturer may complete a PMA application.
 
After a PMA application is sufficiently complete, the FDA will accept the application and begin an in-depth review of the submitted information. By statute, the FDA has 180 days to review the “accepted application,” although, generally, review of the application can take between one and three years, but it may take significantly longer. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. Also, during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The preapproval inspections conducted by the FDA include an evaluation of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the FDA’s quality systems regulations or QSR, as well as inspections of the clinical trial sites by the Bioresearch Monitoring group to evaluate compliance with good clinical practice and human subject protections. New PMA applications or PMA supplements are required for modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, including, for example, certain types of modifications to the device’s indication for use, manufacturing process, labeling and design. Significant changes to an approved PMA require a 180-day supplement, whereas less substantive changes may utilize a 30-day notice, or a 135-day supplement. Premarket approval supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a premarket approval application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original premarket approval application, and it may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel.
 
Our HIV 1/2 STAT-PAK Assay PMA application number BP050009/0 and our SURE CHECK 1/2 HIV Assay PMA application number BP050010/0 were approved by the FDA in May 2006. Our DPP HIV 1/2 Assay PMA application number BP120032/0 was approved by the FDA in December 2012.  Our DPP HIV Syphilis Assay PMA application number BP180191/0 was approved by the FDA in October 2020.
 


 
510(k) Clearance Pathway
 
We are currently developing products that either will or are likely to require an FDA 510(k) clearance. We anticipate submitting a 510(k) for each such product to demonstrate that such proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of a 510(k).  The FDA’s 510(k) clearance pathway usually takes from three to twelve months but could take longer. In some cases the FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence.
 
If a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, a PMA. The FDA requires each device manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a new 510(k) or a PMA, but the FDA can review any such decision and, if it disagrees with the manufacturer’s determination, can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA of the modified device is obtained.
 
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988
 
A manufacturer of a test categorized as moderately complex may request that categorization of the test be waived through a CLIA Waiver by Application, or CW, submission to the FDA. When a test is categorized as waived, it may be performed by laboratories with a Certificate of Waiver, such as a physician’s office outreach setting. In a CW submission, the manufacturer provides evidence to the FDA that a test meets the CLIA statutory criteria for waiver CLIA, a walk-in clinic or an emergency room provides CMS authority over all laboratory testing, except research that is performed on humans in the United States. The Division of Laboratory Services, within the Survey and Certification Group under the CMS, has the responsibility for implementing the CLIA program.
 
The CLIA program is designed to establish quality laboratory testing by ensuring the accuracy, reliability and timeliness of patient test results. Under CLIA, a laboratory is a facility that does laboratory testing on specimens derived from humans and used to provide information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease, or impairment of, or assessment of health. Under the CLIA program, unless waived, laboratories must be certified by the government, satisfy governmental quality and personnel standards, undergo proficiency testing, be subject to inspections and pay fees. We have received a CLIA waiver for all of our lateral flow rapid HIV tests that we market in the United States. Specifically, the CLIA waiver was granted by the FDA for HIV 1/2 STAT-PAK in November 2006, for SURE CHECK HIV 1/2 in October 2007, and for DPP HIV 1/2 in October 2014.
 
Emergency Use Authorizations (EUA)
 
A formal request to issue an EUA generally should not be submitted until the Secretary of HHS has issued an EUA declaration under section 564(b)(1). In particular, although section 564 allows FDA to issue an EUA for preparedness purposes, in such cases the HHS Secretary must first declare that circumstances exist justifying such an authorization in advance of an actual emergency based on a formal determination of a significant potential for emergency or a material threat determination. During the effective period of the HHS Secretary’s EUA declaration, FDA may authorize the introduction of a medical product into interstate commerce when the product is intended for use during an actual or potential emergency. EUA candidate products include medical products and uses that are not approved, cleared, or licensed under sections 505, 510(k), and 515 of the FD&C Act or section 351 of the PHS Act.
 
After the requisite determination and declaration have been issued, and after feasible and appropriate consultations, FDA may issue an EUA only if FDA concludes that the following four statutory criteria for issuance have been met for 1) Serious or Life-Threatening Disease or conditions, 2) evidence of effectiveness, 2) Risk –Benefit Analysis, 4) No Alternatives.  A sponsor seeking an EUA can submit its formal request in the form of an EUA submission, which includes data for clinical studies, non-clinical laboratory studies to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product as well as the discussion of Risks and Benefits of the product.
 
FDA will specify the effective date of an EUA issued under section 564. In general, an EUA will remain in effect for the duration of the EUA declaration under which it was issued which describes termination of an EUA declaration and its impact on existing EUAs.
 


 
Pervasive and Continuing FDA Regulation
 
A host of regulatory requirements apply to our approved devices, including: the quality system regulation, which requires manufacturers to follow elaborate design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures; the Medical Reporting Regulations, which require manufacturers to report to the FDA specified types of adverse events involving their products; labeling regulations; and the FDA’s general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or “off-label” uses. Some Class II devices are subject to special controls-such as performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient registries, and FDA guidelines-that do not apply to Class I devices.
 
The regulatory requirements that apply to our approved products classified as medical devices include:
 
 
• | product listing and establishment registration, which helps facilitate FDA inspections and other regulatory action;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Medford, New York facility is currently registered as an establishment with the FDA. We and any third-party manufacturers are subject to announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA to determine our compliance with QSR and other regulations.
 
Government Regulation of Medical Devices for Animal Subjects
 
We currently offer two veterinary devices in the United States: DPP VetTB Assay for Cervids and DPP VetTB Assay for Elephants. Diagnostic tests for animal health infectious diseases, including our veterinary devices for the prevention and/or treatment of animal disease, are regulated in the U.S. by the Center for Veterinary Biologics within the U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, or APHIS, under the Virus, Serum, and Toxin Act of 1913. As a requirement, our veterinary devices were approved by APHIS before they could be sold in the U.S.
 


 
The APHIS regulatory approval process involves the submission of product performance data and manufacturing documentation. Following regulatory approval to market a product, APHIS requires that each lot of product be submitted for review before release to customers. In addition, APHIS requires special approval to market products where test results are used in part for government-mandated disease management programs.
 
Climate Change and Environmental Laws
 
The medical device industry is increasingly becoming subject of scrutiny, stringent regulation and the demand for green, sustainable products. We are focused on monitoring these increasing requirements for efficient and accurate processes for hazardous substance handling, supplier disclosures, and regulatory reporting in order to comply with numerous global health and environmental regulatory requirements and restrictions.
 
We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all foreign, federal, state, and local environmental regulations applicable to our manufacturing facilities. The cost of ongoing compliance with such regulations does not have a material effect on our operations.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Intellectual Property Strategy
 
Our intellectual property strategy is to:  (1) build our own intellectual property portfolio around our DPP technology and optical analyzers; (2) pursue licenses, trade secrets and know-how within the area of rapid point-of-care testing; and, (3) develop and acquire proprietary positions to certain reagents.
DPP Intellectual Property
 
We have obtained patent coverage on our DPP technology, including numerous patents in the United States, and one or more patents in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Columbia, Eurasia (Russia), European Union (fourteen European countries), Hong Kong, Israel, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Poland, Singapore, South Africa, Thailand, and the United Kingdom. Additional patent applications on our DPP technology are pending in the United States, as well as in  foreign countries such as Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Singapore and Thailand.
 
DPP technology provides us with freedom to operate and enables us to develop tests with better performance and capabilities compared with tests built on traditional lateral flow platforms.  These advantages have allowed us to enter into multiple technology collaborations based upon DPP technology, which we believe will provide new manufacturing and marketing opportunities. We have filed additional patent applications that we believe will strengthen the DPP intellectual property and have also filed for patent protection for certain other point-of-care technologies or applications thereof.
 
We have also obtained patent coverage on our optical-based analyzer technology in the United States as well as in several EU countries.
 
Trademarks
 
We have filed and obtained trademarks for our company name CHEMBIO and CHEMBIO DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEMS, INC. as well as for many of our products, including DPP, SURE CHECK, STAT-VIEW, STAT-PAK, and NEXT GENERATION DPP, as well as for the SampleTainer and DPP Micro Reader, which are used with certain DPP products.  Our trademarks have been registered in the United States and certain other countries around the world.
 
Trade Secrets and Know-How
 
We have developed a substantial body of trade secrets and know-how relating to the development and manufacture of lateral flow and DPP-based diagnostic tests, including the sourcing and optimization of materials for such tests, and methods to maximize sensitivity, speed-to-result, specificity, stability and reproducibility of our tests.  We possess proprietary know-how to develop tests for multiple conditions using colored particles.  Our formulations enable long shelf lives of our rapid HIV and other tests, providing us with an important competitive advantage.
 


 
Rapid Diagnostic Technology and Reagent Licenses
 
We seek licenses and/or redesigns of products that we believe to be in our best interests. Because of the costs and other negative consequences of time consuming patent litigation, we often attempt to obtain a license on reasonable terms. The peptides used in our rapid HIV tests were licensed to us by one or more third parties. We also have licensed the antigens used in other tests including our Syphilis, Tuberculosis, Leptospirosis, Leishmaniasis and Chagas tests, and we may enter into other license agreements. In prior years, we concluded license agreements related to intellectual property rights owned by the United States associated with HIV-1 and a sub-license agreement for HIV-2 with Bio-Rad Laboratories N.A., the exclusive licensee of the Pasteur Institute’s HIV-2 intellectual property estate.
