Item 1. Business
General
 
AuraSource, Inc. (“AuraSource” or “Company”) was incorporated on March 15, 1990 and is focused on the development and production of environmentally friendly and cost effective industrial energy and feedstock used for industrial applications. AuraCoal, AuraSource’s core technology, includes ultrafine grinding and impurities removal. Initial industrial applications of AuraSource technology are ultra-fine coal water mixture for heavy oil substitution, and low grade iron ore fine and slimes beneficiation. AuraSource formed AuraSource Qinzhou Co. Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary in China (“Qinzhou”), to acquire these types of Hydrocarbon Clean Fuel (“HCF”) technologies, performing research and development related to the reduction of harmful emission and energy costs for HCF technology and products based on this technology, licensing HCF technology to third parties and selling services and products derived from this technology. We have developed seven patented technologies: 1) ultrafine grinding and 2) ultrafine separation.
 
On February 15, 2012, we entered into an agreement with Gulf Coast Holdings, LLC (“GCH”) to reserve export ready one million tons of 64% Fe higher content iron ore and 13 million of 45% grade lower content iron ore, and two million tons of manganese ore. We agreed to issue 16 million shares of our common stock to GCH or its assigns (“Mineral Deposit Shares”). The Mineral Deposit Shares shall vest and be delivered as follows; five million immediately, 11 million upon the successful completion of the first customer order of total revenue over $5 million. Success shall be defined as customer acceptance of order and final payment. To the extent a successful order does not occur, the unvested Mineral Deposit Shares shall be returned to our treasury and cancelled. Additionally, we entered into an agreement with Gulf Coast Mining Group, LLC (“GCM”) to purchase (i) higher content iron ore, lower content iron ore and manganese ore (collectively, the “Minerals”) which will be delivered loose in bulk modified FOB. We entered into an agreement with GCH appointing GCH as the exclusive North American licensee for use and exploitation of our technology as it relates to applications involving precious metals in exchange for royalty payments of 5% of gross revenues.

AuraSource’s Key Technology
 We believe our AuraCoalTM technology is a next generation of hydrocarbon clean fuel technology. It involves grinding coal into very fine particles, mixing it with water and selected additives to make slurry mixture and using a proprietary biological treatment of the coal slurry to reduce heavy minerals, such as sulfur.  We believe such fuel will have sufficient fluidity to move through pipelines, process delivery piping and burner injection nozzles. Our goal is to demonstrate to power plants, coal-gasification plants and similar users that our AuraCoal technology can convert their plants to use the technology at a lower cost than any current alternative.  Given sufficient capital and development of our AuraCoal technology, we plan to market it to plants in China and the United States (“US”) with the objective of having a beta demonstration site in each country.
 Given sufficient capital, development and protection of our AuraCoal technology, among other factors, AuraSource plans to utilize the AuraCoal technology as follows:
 

- | license AuraCoal technology to international clients in applicable industries, such as coal producers, power plants and coal-gasification plants; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- | develop strategic partnerships to deliver consulting services with respect to design, engineering, procurement and construction for AuraCoal applications; 
- | enter into joint ventures with coal producers to supply AuraCoal treated coal to power plants; 
- | process coal using AuraCoal technology and sell such coal to end users at a marked-up price; 
- | assist customers to convert their plants to AuraCoal rather than oil, gas or other natural resources in order to save energy costs; and 
- | establish centers for processing coal with our HCF technology to supply power plants, coal-gasification plants, and other customers. 

AuraCoalTM Clean Coal Technology
 AuraCoal is patented technology designed to remove sulfur and ash from coal pre-combustion. This reduces energy costs and helps to eliminate harmful emissions. This proprietary clean coal technology produces a coal water mixture, which contains only trace amounts of sulfur and ash and constitutes an alternative to oil or natural gas. AuraCoal can be delivered via pipeline in a non-volatile state. AuraSource’s intellectual property portfolio includes ultrafine grinding and ultrafine separation processes, which will enable us to produce a high purity, cleaner burning fuel and to reduce the cost for several industrial applications.
Ultrafine Grinding
 
Ultrafine grinding utilizes a fluid shock wave to grind slurry materials into ultrafine scale. The shock wave is generated when pressurized slurry (5-30 magapascal (Mpa)) goes through the grinding chamber. The shock wave carries energy and creates shear, collision and cavitation effects which cause particles in the slurry to reduce to an ultrafine size. As a result, when used in coal water slurry grinding, the coal water slurry can be pulverized and its fluidity improved.
Ultrafine Separation
 
Ultrafine separation separates different size particles with different densities in the slurry. The minimum particle size for conventional jigging and heavy media cycloning is 0.2 mm which makes it difficult to remove inorganic minerals. The settling velocity of particles in the slurry becomes very low under normal gravity when particles are fine. Particles settling may even stop due to interaction between particles and disturbance caused by other ultrafine particles in the slurry. Therefore, conventional separation equipment based on gravity is not effective. Our technology enables particles separation by applying 10-100 gravity which allows impurities and unwanted substances to be removed.

The conversion to an AuraCoal system is designed to deliver immediate and substantive reductions in harmful particle emissions as well as savings in transportation, processing and safety costs. With the adoption of our proprietary AuraCoal Clean Coal technology, we believe we will be able to convert old coal systems into power generating systems that produce emissions containing only trace amounts of sulfur and ash.  
 We believe AuraCoal technology can:
 
- | reduce harmful emissions and energy costs; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- | reduce and/or eliminate the need for scrubbers; 
- | reduce a power plant’s need for related precipitators and/or sulfur acceptors; and 
- | enable a power plant to effectively manage its carbon emissions. 

 
There can be no assurance we will be able to carry out our plans for our HCF technology. Our ability to pursue this strategy is subject to the availability of additional capital and further development of our HCF technology.  We will also need to finance the cost of effectively protecting our intellectual property rights in the US and abroad where we intend to market our technology and products.
 
HCF Overview 
 
We believe our HCF technology will provide an emerging type of energy saving and emission reducing fuel substitute for oil. The HCF coal product appears to exhibit fuel economy, liquidity and stability, ease of loading and unloading, storage and transportation without precipitation of the product. It seems to be conducive to pumping over long-distance pipelines, transport by railway and truck tankers and maritime shipping.
 HCF atomization performance depends on the energy value of coal preparation and concentration, which we believe is generally the equivalent of half the energy value of heavy oil, industrial boilers, industrial kilns, power generation boiler oil and coal combustion generation.
 We believe HCF has a broad range of industrial applications. Our initial objective will be to pursue applications related to power plants and industrial boilers, including steam and hot water boilers.
 First Generation Coal-Water Slurry (Slurry Generation)
 The first generation of HCF occurred at the US Black Mesa coal slurry pipeline, which is the only operating long-distance coal-water slurry pipeline in the world. See www.informaworld.com/index/778734328.pdf. This pipeline traverses 273 miles, with an annual capacity of 4,800,000 tons. See http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/68053/Black-Mesa-pipeline. The purpose of liquefying the coal was to transport the coal economically.
The Second Generation Hydrocarbon Clean Fuel (Mixture Generation)
 In the second generation process, coal is a coal-water slurry processed with new products, consisting of 65% to 70% coal and 30% to 35% water and trace chemical additives prepared in a paste, commonly known as high concentration coal-water slurry, or water coal slurry.

The Third Generation Hydrocarbon Clean Fuel (The Ultra-Fine Coal-Water Fuel Generation)
 We believe our technology will be the third generation of HCF technology. We believe the third generation HCF will be a lower-cost and more efficient technology that can be used in greater depth and in a wider array of applications, and may be an alternative to oil resource applications. We expect the third generation HCF technology will contain only trace amounts of sulfur and ash, in fine particle sizes, which allows burning of the mixture to cause minor wear and tear on equipment. Additionally, we believe the use of ultra-fine grinding machines allows preparation of an ultra-fine paste for a new type of fuel. We believe the HCF technology may yield potential environmental advantages relative to heavy oil.
Competition
 
HCF Technology
 
We face competition from companies like Arch Coal, Peabody Massey Energy Company, CONSOL Energy, Foster-Wheeler, GreatPoint Energy, Evergreen Energy, Inc., CoalTek, Inc., Babcock & Wilcox Company, and Yanzhou Coal Mining Company as well as numerous universities and government agencies which have greater financial, marketing, distribution and technological resources than we have, and  may have more well-known brand names.  They may also seek to enter and compete with us in our market.
 
More indirect competition comes from alternative low-pollution energy sources, including: wind, bio-fuels and solar; all of which need additional technological advancements to be able to produce power at the scale of coal-fueled plants.
 
Patent and Trademarks
 
The Company currently relies on patents, unregistered trademarks, and confidentiality of trade secrets.  Our ability to compete effectively will depend on our success in protecting the HCF proprietary technology, both in the US and abroad.  There are numerous patents or patent applications relating to HCF technology. We have filed for patent protection and taken the steps required to obtain international patent protection. Currently, we have received seven patents for our proprietary clean coal technology, AuraCoal™, from the State Intellectual Property Office of the People's Republic of China. The AuraCoal™ patent covers a methodology for preparing an ultra-low ash coal-water-slurry that can significantly improve the yield of coal and improve the granularity of coal slurry fuel by improving the fluidity and increasing fuel particle concentration.
 
No assurance can be given that any patents relating to the HCF technology will be issued by the US or any foreign patent offices.  Further, no assurance can be given that we will receive any patents in the future based on the continued development of the HCF technology, or that the HCF technology patent protection within and/or outside of the US will be sufficient to deter others, legally or otherwise, from developing or marketing competitive products utilizing our HCF technology.  If patent protection is not available for the HCF technology, we plan to treat it as a trade secret.  There can be no assurance we will be successful in this regard.
 
In addition to seeking patent protection, we will rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological advancement to seek to achieve and thereafter maintain a competitive advantage in the HCF market.  Although we have entered into or intend to enter into confidentiality and invention agreements with our employees, consultants and advisors, no assurance can be given that such agreements will be honored or that we will be able to effectively protect our rights to our unpatented trade secrets and know-how.  Moreover, no assurance can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and know-how.

Government Regulations
 
United States
 
We believe that existing and proposed legislation and regulations could impact fossil fuel-fired, and specifically coal-fired, power generating facilities nationally and internationally. 
 
The following briefly describes the most significant existing national laws and regulations affecting the potential market for coal processed using our technology. State and regional policies may also impact our market.
 
The Clean Air Act and Acid Rain Program. The Clean Air Act of 1970, as amended, is currently the primary mechanism for regulating emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide from coal-fired power generating facilities. A key component of the act regulates sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions. Specifically, title IV set a goal of reducing sulfur dioxide emissions by 10 million tons below 1980 levels and imposed a two-phased tightening of restrictions on fossil fuel-fired power plants. Phase I began in 1995 and focused primarily on coal-burning electric utility plants in the east and midwest. In 2000, Phase II began and this phase tightened the annual emissions' limits on larger higher emitting plants and set restrictions on smaller, cleaner plants fired by coal, oil, and gas. The Acid Rain Program calls for a two million ton reduction in nitrogen oxide emission and focuses on one set of sources that emit nitrogen oxide: coal-fired electric utility boilers. Beginning in January 2000, nitrogen oxide emissions are to be reduced 900,000 tons per year beyond the 1.2 million per year reduction set by the EPA in 1995.
 
Clean Air Interstate Rule. The Clean Air Interstate Rule was finalized by the EPA in March 2005. Once fully implemented, this rule will reduce sulfur dioxide emissions in 28 states and the District of Columbia by more than 70% and nitrogen oxide emissions by more than 60% from the 2003 levels. Through the use of a cap-and-trade approach, the rule promises to achieve substantial reduction of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions. Reductions of nitrogen oxide emissions began in January 2009, followed by reductions of sulfur dioxide emissions in January 2010. The program will be fully implemented by January 2015.
 
Clean Air Mercury Rule. The US Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, finalized the Clean Air Mercury Rule, or CAMR, on March 15, 2005 to reduce mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. Phase 1 of CAMR was set to go into effect on January 1, 2010. However, on February 8, 2008, the US Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia vacated the rule, requiring EPA to draft a new regulation. As a result of this ruling, it is likely that individual coal-fired boilers and power plants will be held to stringent levels of mercury emission reductions instead of averaging mercury emissions across multiple plants and across the country.
 
China
 
The Environmental Protection Law (“EPL”) of the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) governs us and our HCF products.  The EPL, promulgated by the National People’s Congress on December 26, 1989, is the cardinal law for environmental protection in China. The law establishes the basic principle for coordinated advancement of economic growth, social progress and environmental protection, and defines the rights and duties of governments at all levels. Local environmental protection bureaus may set stricter local standards than the national standards and enterprises are required to comply with the stricter of the two sets of standards. The EPL requires any entity operating a facility that produces pollutants or other hazards to incorporate environmental protection measures into its operations and to establish an environmental protection responsibility system, which must adopt effective measures to control and properly dispose of waste gases, waste water, waste residue, dust or other waste materials.
 
Violators of the EPL and various environmental regulations may be subject to warnings, payment of damages and fines. Any entity undertaking construction work or manufacturing activities before the pollution and waste control and processing facilities are inspected and approved by the relevant environmental protection bureau may be ordered to suspend production or operations and may be fined. The violators of relevant environment protection laws and regulations may be exposed to criminal liability if violations result in severe loss of property, personal injuries or death.

In addition, China is a signatory to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which are intended to limit emissions of greenhouse gases.  Efforts to control greenhouse gas emission in China could result in reduced use of coal if power generators switch to sources of fuel with lower carbon dioxide emissions, which in turn could reduce the revenues of our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
 
 The Company endeavors to ensure the safe and lawful operation of its facilities in manufacturing and distribution of HCF and believes it is in compliance in all material respects with applicable PRC laws and regulations.
 
No enterprise may start production at its facilities until it receives approval from the Ministry of Commerce to begin operations.
 
Other
 
Any international plants will also be subject to various permitting and operational regulations specific to each country. International initiatives, such as the Kyoto Protocol, are expected to create increasing pressures on the electric power generation industry on a world-wide basis to reduce emissions of various pollutants, which management expects will create additional demand for our technology.
Employees
 
The Company currently has 4 full and part time employees and consultants. The Company engages the services of independent consultants to assist it with management and business development.  We plan to engage additional full-time employees as our business expands.
