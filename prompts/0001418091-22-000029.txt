Item 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Twitter is what’s happening in the world and what people are talking about right now. 
Our primary product, Twitter, is a global platform for public self-expression and conversation in real time. We have democratized content creation and distribution so people can consume, create, distribute and discover content about the topics and events they care about most. Through Topics, Interests, and Trends, we help people discover what’s happening through text, images, on demand and live video, and audio from people, content partners, media organizations, advertisers and others. Media outlets, websites, and other partners extend the reach of Twitter content by distributing Tweets beyond our app and website.
In 2021, we continued our work to serve the public conversation by helping people find trusted sources of information and by better organizing and surfacing the many topics and interests that bring people to Twitter, with a focus on personalization and selection. We launched products to continue helping people stay informed and discuss what matters to them such as Twitter Spaces, a new way to have live audio conversations on Twitter, and Communities, a new way to easily find and connect with people who have similar interests. We also worked to help people and businesses get paid on Twitter by introducing Ticketed Spaces, Super Follows, and Tips, which give people the ability to pay creators using a variety of payment methods to send currency or Bitcoin to creators. We also introduced Twitter Blue, Twitter’s first-ever consumer subscription offering. Twitter Blue allows our most passionate and engaged accounts to pay for exclusive features and perks that enhance and complement their existing Twitter experience.
We are making it easier to follow and participate in healthier conversations by rolling out new conversation settings globally, and giving people everywhere more control over the conversations they start on Twitter. We have furthered our efforts to improve the health of the platform, as we work to make sure that people and advertisers feel safe being a part of the conversation and can find credible information on our service. Major areas of focus within health include reducing abuse, providing more context around misinformation, and protecting the integrity of civic-related conversations.
In addition, we have made significant progress on our brand and direct response offerings with updated ad formats, improved targeting, and better measurement. We have also continued to refine our Mobile Application Promotion (MAP) and Website Traffic offerings.
On January 1, 2022, we closed the sale of our MoPub business to AppLovin Corporation. The sale of MoPub enables us to concentrate more of our efforts on the significant opportunity for performance-based advertising, small and medium-sized business (SMB) offerings, and commerce initiatives on Twitter.
Products and Services for Advertisers
Our Promoted Products enable advertisers to promote their brands, and products and services. We enable advertisers to target an audience based on a variety of factors, including who an account follows and actions taken on our platform, such as Tweets created and engagement with Tweets. We believe this data produces a clear and real-time signal of what is relevant to that account, greatly enhancing the performance of the ads we can serve on behalf of advertisers. Our Promoted Products are incorporated into our platform as native advertising and are designed to be as compelling and useful as organic content on our platform.
Currently, our Promoted Products consist of:
•Promoted Ads and Twitter Amplify. Promoted Ads (previously branded as Promoted Tweets), which are labeled as “promoted,” appear within a timeline, search results, profile pages, and Tweet conversations. Using our proprietary algorithms and understanding what is relevant to each account, we can deliver Promoted Ads that are intended to achieve the outcome that the advertiser is seeking. We enable our advertisers to target an audience based on many criteria. Our Promoted Ads are pay-for-performance or pay-for-impression delivered advertising that are priced through an auction. Our Promoted Ads include objective-based features that allow advertisers to optimize for the goal selected by the advertisers, such as Tweet engagements (e.g., Retweets, replies and likes), website traffic, mobile application installs or engagements, obtaining new followers, or video views.
•Follower Ads. Follower Ads (previously branded as Promoted Accounts), which are labeled as “promoted,” provide a way for our advertisers to build and grow an audience that is interested in their business, product or service. Our Follower Ads are pay-for-performance advertising priced through an auction.
•Twitter Takeover. Twitter Takeover (previously branded as Promoted Trends), which are labeled as “promoted,” appear at the top of the list of trending topics or timeline for an entire day in a particular country. We sell our Twitter Takeover on a fixed-fee-per-day basis.
Advertisers can also run short video ads either before or around premium video content, such as before live premium video content from publishing partners or clips from a variety of interest categories such as news, sports and entertainment. Our technology dynamically inserts those advertisers' ads into the relevant videos and delivers the ads to the audience targeted by those advertisers. We may pay content partners a portion of our advertising revenue for the right to use and distribute their content on our platform. In addition, Amplify Sponsorships allow advertisers to build brand association by sponsoring premium video content from a single publishing partner. 
We recently redesigned our Amplify pre-roll video ads, designed to drive better brand lift with more ways to match content with ads. We continue to focus our investment on features that differentiate Twitter and capitalize on our value proposition for advertisers. We have made progress on our brand and direct response offerings, with updated ad formats, improved targeting, and better measurement for both MAP and website traffic (formerly named website clicks).
Our platform enables us to provide targeting capabilities based on audience attributes like geography, interests, keyword, conversation, content, and events that make it possible for advertisers to promote their brands, products and services, amplify their visibility and reach, and complement and extend the conversation around their advertising campaigns.
Our platform also enables customers to advertise across the mobile ecosystem, both on Twitter's owned and operated properties as well as off Twitter on third-party publishers’ websites, applications and other offerings. We enable advertisers to extend their reach beyond Twitter through the Twitter Audience Platform, an advertising offering that enables advertisers to extend their advertising campaigns with Twitter Promoted Products to audiences off Twitter while retaining access to Twitter's measurement, targeting and creative tools.
Content Partnerships
Video is an important way to stay informed, enabling people on Twitter and our premium content partners to better share experiences, engage in events, and converse with broader audiences. We continue to improve the conversation around global events and to increase reach, engagement, and monetization for content partners and advertisers around the world through brand safe live-streaming, highlight video clips, and video-on-demand agreements designed to complement the content from people on Twitter across a number of verticals including sports, news, gaming and entertainment. These partnerships enable content publishers and advertisers to reach fans where it all happens, when it’s happening.
Creator Monetization
Creators drive conversations, shape culture, and are some of the most engaging voices on Twitter. By helping them make money, we provide a clear and direct incentive for them to invest more of their time and money into our platform. To that end, in 2021 we launched three new monetization products for creators:
•Tips. Tips are a way to directly send small one-time payments to anyone on Twitter using a variety of payment methods, including bitcoin.
•Super Follows. Super Follows is a paid monthly subscription that offers bonus content, exclusive previews, and perks as a way to support and connect with creators on Twitter.
•Ticketed Spaces. Ticketed Spaces is a way to support creators on Twitter for their time and effort in hosting, speaking, and moderating the public conversation on Twitter Spaces. Creators can earn a share of revenue from tickets purchased to their Ticketed Spaces.
We've also built an earnings dashboard for creators to see a unified view of what they're making over their monetized products and for customers to see their purchase history.
Products for Developers and Data Partners
The Twitter Developer Platform (formerly Developer and Enterprise Solutions) empowers developers around the world to build tools for people and businesses using our public application programming interface (API), or in simpler terms, it gives people more ways to interact with what’s happening on Twitter. This includes data and insights from Tweets, Spaces, polls, and other features that help make Twitter more useful to more people in more places. The Twitter Developer Platform serves commercial and non-commercial developers including businesses, academics, and consumer developers, among others. We believe this work has the potential to help us with our efforts to improve the health of and participation in the public conversation. Developers use Twitter’s platform to build apps and websites that integrate with our publicly available APIs to improve people’s experience on Twitter by connecting them with the conversations they care about. They also help brands and publishers engage with what’s happening and gain insights from the public conversation.
We also offer paid access to Twitter data for partners with commercial use cases and those who wish to access more data beyond what is available for free through our public APIs. Paying developers typically sign subscriptions, or enterprise agreements, based on the type and volume of usage. Our commercial data products and services offer sophisticated APIs and other services to support developers. Our customer-centric approach positions both Twitter and our key partners for greater growth and monetization, and we are investing in deeper partnerships with select solution providers to help businesses and organizations realize greater value from our platform. A goal of our platform is to make it easy for developers to integrate seamlessly with Twitter, while protecting the privacy and safety of the people who use Twitter.
Competition
Our business is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent product innovation and the continuously evolving preferences and expectations of people on Twitter, advertisers, content partners, platform partners and developers. We face significant competition in every aspect of our business, including from companies that provide tools to facilitate communications and the sharing of information, companies that enable marketers to display advertising, and other online ad networks, exchanges and platforms. We also compete to attract, engage, and retain people who use our products, and to attract and retain marketers, content and platform partners, and developers. We have seen escalating competition for digital ad spending and expect this trend to continue. We also compete to attract and retain employees, especially software engineers, designers, and product managers.
We compete with the following companies for people’s attention and for advertisers’ budgets:
•Companies that offer products that enable people to create and share ideas, videos, and other content and information. These offerings include, for example, Meta (including Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp), Alphabet (including Google and YouTube), Microsoft (including LinkedIn), Snapchat, TikTok, Pinterest, and Yahoo, as well as largely regional social media and messaging companies that have strong positions in particular countries (including WeChat, Kakao, and Line). Although we often seek differentiated content from other licensors, we face competition for live premium video content rights from other digital distributors and traditional television providers, which may limit our ability to secure such content on economic and other terms that are acceptable to us in the future.
•Companies that offer advertising inventory and opportunities to advertisers.
•Companies that develop applications, particularly mobile applications, that create, syndicate and distribute content across internet properties.
•Traditional, online, and mobile businesses and media companies that enable people to consume content or marketers to reach their audiences and/or develop tools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns.
As we introduce new products, as our existing products evolve, or as other companies introduce new products and services, we may become subject to additional competition.
Our industry is evolving rapidly and is highly competitive. See the sections titled “Risk Factors—If we are unable to compete effectively for people to use our platform, and for content and data partners, our business and operating results could be harmed.”, “Risk Factors—If we are unable to compete effectively for advertising spend, our business and operating results could be harmed.” and “Risk Factors—We depend on highly skilled personnel to grow and operate our business. If we are unable to hire, retain and motivate our personnel, we may not be able to grow effectively."
Technology, Research and Development
Twitter is composed of a set of core, scalable and distributed services that are built from proprietary and open source technologies. These systems are capable of delivering billions of messages, including images and video, to hundreds of millions of people a day in an efficient and reliable way. We continue to invest in our existing products and services as well as develop new products and services through research and product development. We also continue to invest in protecting the safety, security and integrity of our platform by investing in both people and technology, including machine learning.
Sales and Marketing
We have a global sales force and sales support staff that is focused on attracting and retaining advertisers while certain advertisers use our self-serve advertising platform to launch and manage their advertising campaigns. Our sales force and sales support staff assist advertisers throughout the advertising campaign cycle, from pre-purchase decision making to real-time optimizations as they utilize our campaign management tools, and to post-campaign analytics reports to assess the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns.
We use marketing campaigns to help drive audiences to our platform. In 2021, we continued to deliver marketing campaigns focused on celebrating and highlighting the voices of the people who make Twitter unique. We also continued to highlight our value proposition for advertisers, including how brands turn to Twitter to launch something new, and connect with what’s happening. 
Intellectual Property
We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state and common law rights in the United States and other countries, as well as contractual restrictions. We generally enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with other third parties, in order to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our confidential information and proprietary technology. In addition to these contractual arrangements, we also rely on a combination of trademarks, trade dress, domain names, copyrights, trade secrets and patents to help protect our brand and our other intellectual property.
Government Regulation
We are subject to a number of U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that involve matters central to our business. These laws and regulations may involve privacy, data protection, cybersecurity, rights of publicity, content regulation, data localization, intellectual property, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, credit card processing, taxation or other subjects. Many laws and regulations impacting our business are being proposed, are still evolving or are being tested in courts and could be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from country to country and inconsistent with our current policies and practices and in ways that could harm our business. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations often are uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate.
With regard to privacy, data protection and cybersecurity, we are subject to a variety of federal, state and foreign laws and regulations. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) requires covered companies to, among other things, provide disclosures to California consumers, and afford such consumers the ability to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. Similar legislation has been proposed or adopted in other states. Additionally, the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) created obligations relating to consumer data beginning on January 1, 2022, with implementing regulations expected on or before July 1, 2022, and enforcement beginning July 1, 2023. Aspects of the CCPA, the CPRA and these other state laws and regulations, as well as their interpretation and enforcement, remain unclear, and we may be required to modify our practices in an effort to comply with them. Foreign data protection, privacy, cybersecurity, consumer protection, content regulation and other laws and regulations are often more restrictive or burdensome than those in the United States. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, imposes stringent operational requirements for entities processing personal information and significant penalties for non-compliance. There are also a number of legislative proposals pending before the U.S. Congress, various state legislative bodies and foreign governments concerning content regulation and data protection that could affect us.
In March 2011, to resolve an investigation into various incidents, we entered into a settlement agreement with the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, that, among other things, requires us to establish an information security program designed to protect non-public consumer information and requires that we obtain biennial independent security assessments. The obligations under the settlement agreement remain in effect until the later of March 2, 2031, or the date 20 years after the date, if any, on which the U.S. government or the FTC files a complaint in federal court alleging any violation of the order. On July 28, 2020, we received a draft complaint from the FTC alleging violation of the order and the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act). The allegations relate to our use of phone number and/or email address data provided for safety and security purposes for targeted advertising during periods between 2013 and 2019. The matter remains unresolved, and there can be no assurance as to the timing or the terms of any final outcome. Violation of other existing or future regulatory orders, settlements, or consent decrees could subject us to substantial monetary fines and other penalties that could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.
People may be restricted from accessing Twitter from certain countries, and other countries have intermittently restricted access to Twitter. For example, Twitter is not directly accessible in China and has been intermittently blocked in the past in Turkey. It is possible that other governments may seek to restrict access to or block our website or mobile applications, censor content available through our products or impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility or usability of Twitter for an extended period of time or indefinitely, including because of our decisions with respect to the enforcement of our rules. For instance, some countries have enacted laws that allow websites to be blocked for hosting certain types of content.
For additional information, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Our business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could result in claims, changes to our business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost of operations or declines in mDAU growth, mDAU engagement or ad engagement, or otherwise harm our business.”
Seasonality
Advertising spending is traditionally strongest in the fourth quarter of each year. Historically, this seasonality in advertising spending has affected our quarterly results, with higher sequential advertising revenue growth from the third quarter to the fourth quarter compared to sequential advertising revenue from the fourth quarter to the subsequent first quarter.
Human Capital
We believe the strength of our workforce is critical to our success as we strive to become a more inclusive, diverse, and accessible technology company. Our key human capital management objectives are to attract, retain, and develop the talent we need to deliver on our commitment to serve the public conversation in a safe and responsible way by offering exceptional products and services. Examples of our key programs and initiatives that are focused to achieve these objectives include:
Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Accessibility (IDEA). People come to Twitter to freely express themselves. Just as inclusion lives on our platform, we are working to ensure our workplace reflects our service. In 2020, we introduced our vision for our workforce representation: an objective that by 2025, we aspire to have at least half of our global workforce represented by women and at least a quarter of our U.S. workforce represented by historically-excluded and/or under-represented communities. We accompanied our vision with a strategy to help drive progress, including:
•A company-wide three-year objective focused on diversity and decentralization;
•Clearly-defined targets for workforce representation and inclusion metrics across every executive leader;
•An internal dashboard accessible to all employees to track progress against our objective;
•An expanded team of Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Accessibility leaders across our business;
•Refreshing our hiring practices to require diverse slates for all open roles and put inclusive hiring principles at the forefront;
•A Consistency & Fairness Taskforce to review our employee promotions process;
•Investing in our employee Business Resource Group leaders, who foster a culture of inclusivity and belonging within our company, including introducing a formal compensation program.
We have made significant progress towards our inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility objectives through leadership, transparency and accountability. In 2021, we focused on equity across every stage of our employee lifecycle: recruitment and hiring, onboarding, compensation and pay transparency, learning and development, and our work cultivating an inclusive environment across teams and regional geographies with our Business Resource Groups at the center. As we continue to learn, we also evolved our vision to more impactfully integrate accessibility and equity into our work and merged the Inclusion and Diversity (I&D) and Accessibility teams into a new Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, & Accessibility team to reflect this commitment.
Flexibility and Decentralization. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic drove a shift to remote work, we recognized the need to evolve our workforce to achieve our purpose. We designed a workplace strategy to provide more flexible work options and to build more distributed teams who work effectively without the need to be co-located. In 2020 we announced that most employees will be able to work where they feel most productive, whether that is working full-time from home, from a Twitter office or splitting their time between their home and a Twitter office. Recent employee surveys show that the future of work at Twitter is hybrid, with a substantial majority of our workforce planning to work from home full time or a combination of home and a Twitter office.
Pay. Our primary compensation strategy is to promote a pay-for-performance culture. Our guiding principles are anchored on the goals of being able to attract, incentivize, and retain talented employees who can develop, implement, and deliver on long-term value creation strategies; promote a healthy approach to risk by reinforcing our values which serve to motivate our employees; and provide competitive compensation that is aligned with the market and fair relative to our peers. We are committed to both pay equity and transparency. 
Health and Wellness. Beyond the fundamental needs of health, welfare and retirement programs, we are focused on the specific needs of our individual employees. Over the past two years, our employees adapted to an unprecedented amount of change and uncertainty driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, including an abrupt shift to working from home, rescheduled work priorities, and closure of schools and daycare facilities. We continued to provide resources and ongoing support to employees facing these challenges throughout 2021, such as a wellness reimbursement, home office setup allowance, expanded health coverage, and flexible work schedules.
As of December 31, 2021, we employed over 7,500 full-time employees.
