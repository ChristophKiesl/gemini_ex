Overview
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company leveraging our proprietary technology platform to design and develop a pipeline of novel oral biologic product candidates to treat autoimmune, inflammatory, metabolic, and other diseases. Our proprietary technology platform allows us to exploit existing natural cellular trafficking pathways to facilitate the active transport of diverse therapeutic payloads across the intestinal epithelium (IE) barrier. Active transport is an efficient mechanism that uses the cell’s own machinery to transport materials across the IE barrier. We believe that our ability to exploit this mechanism is a key differentiator of our approach. We are developing oral biologic product candidates in patient-friendly dosage forms that are designed for either targeting local gastrointestinal (GI) tissue or entering systemic circulation to precisely address the relevant biology of a disease. We are building a portfolio of oral product candidates based on our technology platform including our most advanced product candidate, AMT-101, a GI-selective oral fusion of interleukin 10 (IL-10) and our proprietary carrier molecule that has completed a Phase 1b clinical trial in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). We have initiated Phase 2 clinical trials of AMT-101 in UC and related inflammatory indications. Our second product candidate, AMT-126, is a GI-selective oral fusion of interleukin 22 (IL-22) and our proprietary carrier molecule currently in development for diseases related to IE barrier function defects driven by activation of the innate immune system. We submitted a clinical trial application (CTA) for AMT-126 in December 2020 and began dosing healthy volunteers in a Phase 1a clinical trial for AMT-126 in February 2021. Our technology platform enables us to design and develop various oral biologic therapeutic modalities, such as peptides, proteins, full-length antibodies, antibody fragments, and ribonucleic acid (RNA) therapeutics, with potentially significant advantages over existing marketed and development-stage drugs.
 Our most advanced product candidate, AMT-101, is a GI-selective, oral fusion of recombinant human (rh) IL-10 and our proprietary carrier molecule that has been designed for active transport across the IE barrier into local GI tissue. IL-10 is a potent immunomodulatory cytokine that is known to be the master regulator of immune homeostasis, including within GI mucosal tissue. While previous clinical trials conducted by others in the field with systemic IL-10 demonstrated efficacy in UC and Crohn’s disease, significant toxicities associated with systemic administration prevented further development. We have designed AMT-101 to cross the IE barrier, but not enter the bloodstream, which we believe may offer significant efficacy and safety benefits compared to systemic IL-10 administration. We have observed in preclinical studies, a Phase 1a clinical trial in healthy volunteers, and a Phase 1b clinical trial in patients with UC that oral AMT-101 acts on the local immunological pathways along the GI tissue. In our Phase 1b clinical trial, after 14 days of treatment, UC patients treated with AMT-101 showed trends of improvement in objective disease markers such as fecal calprotectin and histopathologic scores. We also observed that, in addition to impacting local disease markers, AMT-101 was also able to show trends to improvement in systemic markers of inflammation, such as C-reactive protein (CRP).  Importantly, in our Phase 1a clinical trial in healthy volunteers and our Phase 1b clinical trial in patients with UC, no serious adverse events were observed with only negligible levels of AMT-101 detected in systemic circulation. 
 As a locally-targeted, GI-selective biologic therapeutic, oral AMT-101 has the potential to be used, as a monotherapy or in combination with other therapeutic agents, in biologic-naïve moderate-to-severe UC patients in addition to UC patients who have failed prior biologic therapy, and in a variety of GI indications beyond UC. There is a heightened medical need for oral non-systemic, locally-acting immunomodulators that are distinct from systemic immuno-suppressive drugs. Therefore, we have initiated a broad Phase 2 clinical program for AMT-101 including having dosed patients in our LOMBARD Phase 2 clinical trial as a monotherapy for moderate to severe UC patients. Recent evidence is emerging that UC patients who respond poorly or are no longer responding to anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFα) therapy have low levels of endogenous tissue levels of IL-10. Based on the safety profile of AMT-101 observed to date, we have initiated the MARKET Phase 2 clinical trial as we believe it may be used in combination with other therapies that are both approved and in development. We have also initiated and dosed patients in the FILLMORE Phase 2 clinical trial as a monotherapy in patients with chronic pouchitis. Finally, based on the observation that AMT-101 can impact systemic markers of inflammation, we have initiated and dosed patients in the CASTRO Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the combination of AMT-101 and anti-TNFα therapy in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have had an inadequate response to anti-TNFα monotherapy.

Our second product candidate, AMT-126, is a GI-selective oral fusion of IL-22 and our proprietary carrier molecule currently in development for diseases related to IE barrier function defects driven by activation of the innate immune system. IL-22 is a cytokine that repairs functional and structural defects of the IE barrier and induces microbial defense. AMT-126 is designed to act locally on the epithelial cells of the intestinal tissue, thereby repairing the IE barrier and supporting mucosal healing, potentially translating into clinically meaningful improvements in a broad range of GI-focused, peripheral inflammatory and other diseases. While previous clinical trials conducted by others in the field with systemic rhIL-22 demonstrated efficacy in UC, significant toxicities associated with systemic administration have been observed. We have designed AMT-126 to cross the IE barrier, but not enter the bloodstream, which we believe may offer significant efficacy and safety benefits compared to systemic rhIL-22 administration. We submitted a CTA for AMT-126 in December 2020 and began dosing healthy volunteers in a Phase 1a clinical trial in February 2021.
 The global biologic therapeutics market has been estimated to be approximately $230.0 billion per year across numerous indications and targets. While our initial focus is on developing novel, oral biologic therapeutics to treat severe autoimmune, inflammatory, and metabolic diseases, any disease that can be treated with a biologic therapeutic is conceivably a candidate for our technology. In many diseases, oral administration of GI-selective biologics may confer inherent advantages over systemic dosing based on the premise that the gut is the primary site of convergence of several core biology axes. At least 70% of the body’s immune system resides in the gut so oral administration provides direct access to key pathways of mucosal immunology. Furthermore, the oral route provides access to the gut-brain and gut-endocrine axes. Our objective is to maximize the value of the technology by continuing to develop a pipeline of novel, differentiated products against well-established and clinically-validated targets in sizable markets where our technology can improve safety and efficacy in addition to offering a patient-friendly oral form.

AMT-101
 AMT-101 is a GI-selective oral fusion of rhIL-10 and our proprietary carrier molecule. We have completed a Phase 1b clinical trial of AMT-101 in UC. IL-10 is an immunomodulatory cytokine that is known to be the master regulator of GI mucosal homeostasis. While previous clinical trials conducted by others in the field with systemic rhIL-10 demonstrated efficacy in Crohn’s disease, significant toxicities associated with systemic administration prevented further development. We have designed AMT-101 to cross the IE barrier while not entering the bloodstream, thereby focusing the drug directly at the site of action of the underlying biology of the disease in the GI tissue and, therefore, potentially avoiding the side effects observed with systemic administration. 
 In a Phase 1a clinical trial in healthy volunteers, AMT-101 was well tolerated without the previous toxicities typically associated with IL-10 systemic administration. In a Phase 1b clinical trial in patients with UC, after 14 days of treatment, reductions in objective disease markers of intestinal inflammation such as fecal calprotectin and histopathologic scores were observed, suggesting that the patients experienced a rapid clinical response. The localization of AMT-101 in the gut has been further demonstrated in non-human primate (NHP) studies where oral AMT-101 administration was shown to induce a systemic pharmacodynamic response with only negligible levels of AMT-101 detected in systemic circulation. 
 By design, AMT-101 is actively transported through the IE barrier into the GI tissue, the primary site of inflammation in UC, a disease with approximately 2.2 to 2.4 million patients in the United States and Europe according to a 2014 report. As a locally-targeted, GI-selective biologic therapeutic, oral AMT-101 has the potential to be used in biologic naive, moderate-to-severe UC patients in addition to UC patients who have failed prior biologic therapy, and in a variety of GI indications beyond UC. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has cleared our investigational new drug (IND) application for oral AMT-101 for the treatment of patients with moderate to severely active UC. We have initiated a broad Phase 2 global clinical program for AMT-101 including having dosed patients in our LOMBARD Phase 2 clinical trial as a monotherapy for moderate to severe UC patients. In addition, since AMT-101 is a non-systemic, non-immunosuppressive immunomodulator, we believe AMT-101 could provide benefit when used in combination with existing marketed products to improve clinical response and induction of clinical remission. Therefore, we have initiated the MARKET Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the combination of AMT-101 and anti-TNFα therapy in patients with moderately to severely active UC. We have also initiated and dosed patients in our FILLMORE Phase 2 clinical trial as a monotherapy in patients with chronic pouchitis. Finally, based on the observation that AMT-101 can impact systemic markers of inflammation, we have initiated and dosed patients in our CASTRO Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the combination of AMT-101 and anti-TNFα therapy in patients with active RA who have had an inadequate response to anti-TNFα monotherapy. We anticipate top-line data readouts for our Phase 2 clinical trials beginning in the second half of 2021 and into 2022.
 AMT-126
 AMT-126 is a GI-selective oral fusion of rhIL-22 and our proprietary carrier molecule currently in development for diseases related to IE barrier function defects driven by activation of the innate immune system. IL-22 is a cytokine that repairs functional and structural defects of the IE barrier and induces microbial defense. AMT-126 is designed to act locally on the epithelial cells of the intestinal tissue, thereby repairing the IE barrier and supporting mucosal healing, potentially translating into clinically meaningful improvements in a broad range of GI-focused, peripheral inflammatory and other diseases. We believe that our GI-selective AMT-126 may be safer than systemically administered treatments, because AMT-126 is designed to not enter a patient’s bloodstream, therefore avoiding the potential side effects observed with other previously systemically administered rhIL-22 candidates. 
 In preclinical development, AMT-126 demonstrated activity in animal models of intestinal inflammation, as well as the induction of markers associated with the repair of IE barrier function defects. The localization of AMT-126 in GI tissue has been further demonstrated in several preclinical studies.  Despite being localized to the GI tissue, we have observed in animal models that AMT-126 can also impact systemic markers of inflammation.
 By targeting AMT-126 to the IE barrier, we believe our therapy may translate to clinically meaningful reductions in disease activity. As a locally targeted, GI-selective biologic therapeutic, AMT-126 has the potential to address IE barrier function defects linked to a wide array of diseases, including celiac disease, a disease with no approved therapies, UC, Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD), and a number of peripheral diseases secondary to GI dysfunction, 
 5

such as psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and other spondyloarthropathies (SpA). We submitted a CTA for AMT-126 and are conducting a Phase 1 clinical program similar to that which we conducted with AMT-101 including a Phase 1a single ascending dose in healthy volunteers, which we began dosing in February 2021, followed by a Phase 1b clinical trial in patients with a certain disease associated with intestinal barrier defects. Topline oral AMT-126 Phase 1a/b data in healthy volunteers and patients are anticipated in 2022.
 Research Programs
 Our technology platform is enabling the generation of a pipeline of earlier-stage product candidates spanning multiple therapeutic areas that can either be targeted to GI tissue or released into blood for broader systemic exposure. While our most advanced product candidates, AMT-101 and AMT-126, are novel, oral biologic therapeutics to treat autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, any disease which can be treated with a biologic therapeutic is conceivably a candidate for our technology. Our research programs are focused on expanding into indications with high unmet medical need and sizable potential, including other gastroenterological and metabolic diseases. We believe these programs demonstrate the applicability of our technology platform across a wide range of biological therapeutics and diseases. 
 We are working on several, and what we believe are promising, research-stage peptides, proteins, and antibodies including: an oral GI-selective construct of glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2) for gastroenterological indications, such as short bowel syndrome (SBS); an oral glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) for local GI and systemic exposure to treat metabolic diseases and other disorders; oral antibody constructs for multiple indications; and an oral human growth hormone (hGH) for growth hormone deficiency and related indications.
 Our Strategy
 Our goal is to transform the biopharmaceuticals landscape by developing novel, targeted oral biologic product candidates that have enhanced efficacy and safety profiles and are more patient-friendly compared to current injection or IV infusion therapies. We believe that our technology platform has the ability to generate products with differentiated product profiles that have significant potential to treat acute and chronic diseases with substantial unmet medical need. We have prioritized our development efforts based on our assessment of the probability of clinical and regulatory success, unmet medical need, and potential market opportunity.
 The key tenets of our business strategy to achieve our goal are as follows:
  
• | Advance oral AMT-101 through clinical development across multiple indications. We have observed in preclinical studies, a Phase 1a clinical trial in healthy volunteers, and a Phase 1b clinical trial in patients with UC that oral AMT-101 acts on the local immunological pathways along the GI tissue and has been undetected in blood, by design. We have observed a pharmacodynamic response in the GI tissue and importantly, no serious adverse events. In addition to the local tissue response, we have also observed clinical response in blood, suggesting that AMT-101 has the potential to be used for local and peripheral inflammatory and immune disorders. We have initiated Phase 2 clinical trials with AMT-101 in UC as well as other inflammatory diseases.

• | Advance our second product candidate, oral AMT-126, through clinical development. Oral AMT-126 is designed to act in local GI tissue and repair defects in the IE barrier caused by the activation of the innate immune system. In preclinical studies, oral AMT-126 has shown activity in relevant animal models of diseases arising from IE barrier function defects. We submitted a CTA for AMT-126 and initiated a Phase 1a clinical trial for AMT-126 in February 2021.

• | Continue to expand our pipeline of novel, differentiated, oral biologic product candidates to maximize the full potential of our technology platform. We plan to expand our pipeline of novel, differentiated, oral biologic therapeutics. We believe our technology platform has the potential to target therapeutics to local GI tissue or to enter into systemic circulation, to precisely address the underlying disease biology. To this end, we have designed and continue to develop oral biologic product candidates that leverage the multitude of diverse biological targets expressed in the GI tissue. These therapeutic targets have broad impact across multiple therapeutic areas such as immunology, metabolic, and central nervous system diseases. A current example of programs targeted to GI tissue includes GLP-2 and we

continue to evaluate other new product opportunities. In addition, we are also developing product candidates where we engineer therapeutic proteins and peptides such as hGH and GLP-1 to enter into systemic circulation. By continuing to strengthen and expand our pipeline of oral biologic product candidates, we believe we can potentially address unmet medical need in ways the current generation of therapeutic modalities cannot.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand technology platform capabilities. Based on our fundamental understanding of epithelial biology and protein engineering, we are able to build on our existing core technology platform to broaden its applications. For example, we are developing novel approaches to engineer constructs that comprise our proprietary carrier system and oligonucleotides (e.g., RNA therapeutics) for intracellular targeting. We are also expanding our capabilities in broad antibody engineering formats, including antigen-binding fragment (Fab) and single-chain variable fragment (scFv) constructs, where antagonist strategies are required. In addition, our pharmaceutical engineering expertise enables the rapid development of advanced dosage forms, including tablets that release drugs along specific segments of the intestinal tract to target certain disease pathologies. We are investing to further innovate and expand our technology platform and development capabilities into new areas of epithelial biology transport and establish new avenues for therapeutics.

• | Evaluate and selectively enter into strategic partnerships to maximize the potential of our pipeline and our technology platform. Although we hold worldwide rights to all of our product candidates, given our technology platform’s potential to generate novel oral biologic product candidates addressing a wide variety of therapeutic areas, we may opportunistically enter into strategic partnerships around certain targets, product candidates, or disease areas. These collaborations could help expand and accelerate our programs to maximize their worldwide market potential and expand our technology platform’s capabilities.

Our Proprietary Oral Biologics Technology Platform 
 Shortcomings of Current Biologic Therapeutics 
 Biologic therapeutics provide enormous therapeutic potential because of their high specificity, potency, and ability to target disease-modifying pathways. However, since the IE is a robust natural barrier for the absorption of proteins and peptides, it is difficult to deliver biologic therapeutics orally. Therefore, the systemic, injection or infusion, route is the primary route of administration for biologic therapeutics. The IE barrier represents a significant challenge for drug developers. 
 7

The gut is the primary site of convergence of several core biology axes that impact virtually every organ system, including immunological, endocrine and neural. At any given time, over 70% of an individual’s immune system resides in the lamina propria, which is the target-rich tissue of the intestinal tract. However, the currently marketed biologic therapeutics are only able to efficiently access these key biological pathways if the therapeutics are delivered in high doses systemically. Large doses of systemically injected therapeutics could lead to toxicities because they will reach not only the targeted tissue, but also other tissues in the body. 
 Our Technology Platform 
 We have identified a series of trafficking pathways that are used by microbes to actively transfer proteins across the IE barrier. By leveraging the natural pathways and proteins, we have demonstrated that it is possible to actively transport biologic therapeutics across the IE barrier by oral administration in animals and humans. 
 Cholix is a protein secreted by Vibrio cholerae that translocates across the IE barrier of the intestine. We have identified the protein sequences along the cholix molecule responsible for trafficking across the IE barrier and targeting immune cells in the GI tissue. This mechanism is based on active, receptor-mediated processes that naturally transport proteins. Our proprietary technology platform creates a fusion protein containing engineered protein translocation sequences of cholix (the AMT carrier) and any protein of interest, which we refer to as the therapeutic payload, to create a novel biologic that can be transported across the IE barrier. Trafficking across IE cells is an active transport process involving uptake at the luminal surface, movement of vesicles through the cells, and release at the basal surface, that utilize dynamic interactions with endogenous elements of the cell. 
 Figure 2 illustrates the distinction between our proprietary active transport approach and that of traditional passive diffusion approaches. 
 Figure 2. Distinction between our proprietary active transport approach and passive diffusion
 

Figure 3 illustrates our ability to leverage the translocation mechanism of cholix and either actively target the biologic therapeutics to the GI tissue or enter into systemic circulation to precisely address the relevant biology of a disease.

Advantages of our Technology Platform 
 Our technology platform establishes a new paradigm to orally deliver biologic therapeutics. We believe that AMT-101 has demonstrated clinical PoC for our technology platform by enabling the active transport and rapid absorption of an orally-administered biologic therapeutic. We believe that our technology offers several advantages: 
 

 
• | Active transport across the IE barrier: Most strategies that have tried to deliver biologic therapeutics orally have focused on passive diffusion across the IE barrier or the use of permeation enhancers to open tight junctions in order to increase permeability through paracellular spaces. In contrast, our technology actively transports the payload through the cell in a receptor and vesicular-mediated process which is beneficial because of the higher transport efficiency and ability to apply our technology to a wide range of therapeutic modalities. All of our product candidates, including AMT-101 and AMT-126, are actively transported.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Flexibility of therapeutic modalities: We have demonstrated our ability to deliver peptides, proteins, full-length antibodies, antibody fragments, and RNA therapeutics using our technology platform. This diversity of payloads increases the number of therapeutic opportunities where our technology can be deployed. Our current programs capitalize on the breadth of our technology which includes proteins (AMT-101, AMT-126 and hGH), peptides (GLP-1 and GLP-2), and full-length antibodies.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Targeting local GI tissue or entering into systemic circulation: When designing our product candidates, we can target the therapeutic payload to the lamina propria of the local GI tissue. This is particularly beneficial for immunology and GI disorders because the intestinal tissue is the largest immune organ in the body, housing greater than 70% of the body’s immune cells. Our most advanced product candidates, AMT-101 and AMT-126, are designed to target the local GI tissue. Alternatively, we can design our product candidates to enter into the bloodstream for systemic exposure after crossing the IE barrier. For example, we have designed our research-stage hGH program for systemic exposure and have demonstrated in multiple preclinical models that hGH can enter systemic circulation using our technology platform. The flexibility of our technology platform allows us to target diseases localized to the GI tissue or diseases where having the product circulating systemically is critical.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Rapid uptake in the intestinal tract: We have demonstrated in vivo that the translocation of a biologic therapeutic coupled to the AMT carrier can occur rapidly and the protein can be localized in the submucosal space within 20 minutes. All of our product candidates are rapidly absorbed by the intestinal tract within 10 to 30 minutes after exposure to the epithelial surface.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ease of biologic therapeutic production: Our product candidates are conveniently synthesized recombinantly using standard bacterial or mammalian manufacturing processes. This allows us to employ traditional expression and optimization strategies to produce the therapeutic protein. Alternatively, if a product candidate contains a payload with non-natural amino acids and/or chemical modifications, we can produce the AMT carrier recombinantly and chemically conjugate the modified payload to create the product candidate.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Beyond the active transport capabilities of our proprietary technology platform, we also utilize several other technologies to ensure our products are protected in the GI environment and released at the appropriate location of the intestine. We have employed enteric coating techniques using off the shelf polymers and excipients that are considered safe for use by regulatory authorities. Our product candidates can be released at various points in the intestine for optimal uptake such as at the terminal ileum, which is part of the small bowel, or along the colon. In a scintigraphy trial in human subjects, we evaluated the release profile of various formulations using capsules of our enteric-coated formulations where we used a radiolabeled tracer instead of active drug product. As shown in Figure 4, the formulated capsule remained intact until it reached the terminal ileum, where it began to dissolve and release its contents. We have developed other formulations that allow our product candidates to be released at various other regions along the GI tract. 
 Figure 4. Human intestinal tract scintigraphy images demonstrating GI transit and location-specific release of our proprietary formulated capsule
 
The outlined regions in the two images to the left (2.3 and 2.5 hours) represent the stomach, whereas the outlined regions in the two images to the right (3.5 and 5.5 hours) represent the colon. This demonstrates in the clinic our ability to target drug to a desired location along the GI tract.

Our ability to deliver biologic therapeutics with our oral technology platform provides several potential advantages over systemically administered biologics and oral products that are also GI-selective. These attributes are designed to achieve the following benefits: 
  
• | Improving Efficacy: Our oral biologic therapeutics provide significant therapeutic potential because of their high potency and ability to locally target the GI tract and access key biological pathways. In contrast to our oral technology platform, systemically administered biologics often cannot achieve the appropriate therapeutic dose levels because of dose-limiting toxicities.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Improving Safety: GI-selective products may have safety advantages relative to systemically administered drugs because the biologic payload has minimal exposure to systemic circulation. In contrast, systemically administered drugs result in undesirably high levels of drugs in tissues which were not intended to be targeted. By minimizing off-target safety liabilities, our product candidates have the potential to be used in a more versatile manner, either as a single agent or in combination with other therapies. We believe that in light of current events caused by pandemic infection, there is a heightened need for non-systemic, locally-acting immunomodulators that are distinct from immuno-suppressive drugs.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | More Patient-Friendly: When compared to systemically administered biologics delivered by injection or infusion, we expect oral dosage forms to enhance compliance and quality of life of patients and caregivers.

Our Product Candidates: AMT-101 and AMT-126 
 We have leveraged our proprietary technology platform to design and develop a pipeline of oral biologic product candidates with differentiated profiles designed to address autoimmune, inflammatory, metabolic, and other diseases. AMT-101 is a GI-selective oral fusion of rhIL-10 that has completed a Phase 1b clinical trial in UC patients and is currently being evaluated in Phase 2 clinical trials in UC and related inflammatory indications. AMT-126 is a GI-selective oral fusion of rhIL-22 that is currently in a Phase 1 clinical trial for diseases arising from IE barrier function defects. We submitted a CTA for AMT-126 in December 2020 and began dosing healthy volunteers in a Phase 1a clinical trial in February 2021.
AMT-101: Our Oral GI-Selective IL-10 Fusion Protein 
 Our most advanced product candidate, AMT-101, is a recombinant fusion of rhIL-10 and the engineered protein translocation sequences of cholix. We have initiated and dosed patients in our LOMBARD Phase 2 clinical trial as a monotherapy for moderate to severe UC patients. In addition, since AMT-101 is a non-systemic, non-immunosuppressive immunomodulator, we believe AMT-101 could provide benefit when used in combination with existing marketed products to improve clinical response and induction of clinical remission. Therefore, we have initiated the MARKET Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the combination of AMT-101 and anti-TNFα therapy in patients with moderately to severely active UC.  We have also initiated and dosed patients in the FILLMORE Phase 2 clinical trial as a monotherapy in patients with chronic pouchitis. Finally, based on the observation that AMT-101 can impact systemic markers of inflammation, we have initiated and dosed patients in the CASTRO Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the combination of AMT-101 and anti-TNFα therapy in patients with active RA who have had an inadequate response to anti-TNFα monotherapy. Oral AMT-101 is designed to act locally in the intestinal lamina propria tissue to modulate immune pathways along GI tissue and control inflammation, resulting in clinical and symptomatic improvement. We believe oral AMT-101 may have safety advantages compared to systemically administered IBD treatments, including prior clinical evaluation of rhIL-10, because AMT-101 is designed to not enter a patient’s bloodstream. Targeted localization of AMT-101 to the GI tissue lamina propria is expected to translate into clinically meaningful reductions in inflammation and disease activity. We plan to initially develop AMT-101 to treat UC and other IBD indications such as pouchitis and Crohn’s disease, as well as peripheral inflammatory indications such as RA. Figure 5 below shows the molecular structure of AMT-101.

Overview of IL-10 Biology 
 IL-10 is a potent immunomodulatory cytokine that is known to be the master regulator of GI mucosal tissue immune homeostasis. IL-10 regulates the activation and effector function of multiple innate and adaptive immune cells and upregulates cytokine inhibitors (e.g., soluble TNF-receptor and IL-1Ra). The binding of IL-10 to its receptor activates the IL-10/JAK1/STAT3 cascade, a key pathway in modulating inflammation, where phosphorylated STAT3 homodimers translocate to the nucleus to activate the expression of target genes to promote cellular protection, survival, and proliferation. 
 Preclinical and Translational Science Support for Treatment of IBD with IL-10 
 Support for the use of rhIL-10 in the treatment of IBD has been reinforced by the studies in IL-10 knockout mice in which the absence of IL-10 leads to spontaneous signs of intestinal inflammation as early as three weeks of age. The symptoms progress into chronic transmural inflammation of the large and small bowels that resemble Crohn’s disease, which can be alleviated with IL-10 treatment. 
 IL-10 has been identified in human genome wide-association studies as being associated with risk factors for IBD, further demonstrating the genetic contribution to disease pathogenesis. Moreover, polymorphisms in the IL-10 receptor and loss-of-function mutations in IL-10 or the IL-10 receptor are associated with early onset of disease for UC and Crohn’s disease, respectively. 
 Clinical Support for Treatment of IBD with IL-10 
 rhIL-10 has been evaluated as a systemically administered agent in clinical trials in healthy volunteers and patients with IBD. Prior clinical trials with rhIL-10 in Crohn’s disease demonstrated a trend towards clinical improvement. However, systemically administered rhIL-10 treatment was associated with adverse events and loss of response at higher doses. Certain clinical trials exhibited induction of severe anemia and thrombocytopenia believed to have been caused by broad systemic exposure of rhIL-10. In addition to the observed toxicities, systemically administered rhIL-10 is thought to have resulted in intestinal IL-10 concentrations that were insufficient to down-regulate inflammation. We believe that IL-10 targeted to the local site of inflammation may offer optimal therapeutic benefit and avoid the safety issues observed in systemic administration. 
 Potential Benefits and Positioning of AMT-101, Our IL-10 Program 
 We believe AMT-101 has the potential to offer clinical benefits in GI diseases, as well as in peripheral inflammatory indications such as RA. We have initially developed AMT-101 for UC and will further explore the potential clinical benefits of AMT-101 for other GI diseases. Within UC, AMT-101 has the potential to be used in biologic naive, moderate-to-severe UC patients in addition to UC patients who have failed prior biologic therapy, and in a variety of GI indications beyond UC. We have initiated a broad Phase 2 program for AMT-101 including having dosed patients in a Phase 2 clinical trial as a monotherapy in moderate to severe UC patients as a combination therapy to approved anti-TNFα monoclonal antibody therapies in biologic-naïve patients with moderate to severe UC, as a monotherapy for pouchitis, and an orphan GI inflammatory disease with no approved therapies.

IL-10 is a potent immunomodulator that has shown preliminary efficacy in Crohn’s disease patients when administered systemically, though with serious adverse events caused by the systemic exposure of rhIL-10. Oral AMT-101 has the potential to unlock the full therapeutic potential of rhIL-10 therapy because it is actively transported to immunomodulatory pathways in the local GI tissue and is designed to not enter a patient’s bloodstream, so it is not expected to have the safety issues of previous systemic rhIL-10 therapies. 
 Due to its potentially attractive safety profile and immunomodulatory mechanism, AMT-101 has an opportunity to potentially be used as a single agent or in combination with other therapies for IBD and other inflammatory diseases. Furthermore, we have initiated a Phase 2 clinical study in patients with RA as the evidence of immunomodulatory effects observed in the peripheral circulation in our Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers and patients with active UC suggests that AMT-101 has the potential to be used beyond GI disorders in peripheral inflammatory indications. 
 AMT-101 is formulated to be available in a convenient, oral, once-a-day tablet. 
 Market Opportunity—Ulcerative Colitis 
 UC is a chronic inflammatory condition that causes mucosal inflammation of the colon. It affects the entire colon and is characterized by relapses and remissions. UC affects an estimated 700,000 to 900,000 people in the United States and up to 1.5 million people in Europe according to a 2014 report. 
Symptoms and Diagnosis 
 UC is diagnosed based on clinical, laboratory, endoscopy, and histopathology findings. Symptoms are dependent upon the extent and severity of the disease and can include bloody diarrhea, rectal bleeding, urgency, fecal incontinence, and fatigue. As remission is achieved, rectal bleeding disappears, stools normalize, and signs of active inflammation are no longer observed on endoscopy. The current treatment strategy for UC depends on the severity, distribution, and pattern of disease. 
Standard of Care and Unmet Medical Needs and Opportunities 
 Mesalamine is used for first-line treatment and maintenance of remission in mild or moderately active UC and is supplemented with oral corticosteroids for disease flares. Patients who are moderate to severe or refractory to mesalamine and oral corticosteroids may be treated with IV steroids, or biologics, including anti-TNF, anti-integrin a4b7, anti-IL-23, or small molecule inhibitors of JAK. 
 
Despite multiple therapeutic options, clinical management of UC remains unsatisfactory. Approximately half of UC patients will relapse in any given year and, based on current clinical trial outcomes, greater than 80% of moderate to severe patients do not remain in remission after one year of biologic therapy. As a result of the loss of biologic response, there are a considerable number of patients on anti-TNFα therapy who are considered partial responders but not yet prepared to switch to a new agent. These patients would be candidates for add-on therapy with an additional, safe agent, with the goal to return them to remission while still on anti-TNFα therapy. While there have been considerable advances in the understanding of UC, significant unmet medical need remains and current therapies remain limited, due to inadequate clinical response/remission, loss of response, tolerability, speed of action, and lack of oral options. 
 Market Opportunity—Chronic Pouchitis 
 In patients who have had a colectomy for refractory UC disease, ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) is a common procedure to create a pouch for patients’ stool. Patients who have an IPAA typically have four to eight bowel movements per day, but the most common complication among patients who have undergone an IPAA is pouchitis, an idiopathic chronic inflammatory condition. It is estimated that approximately 50-60% of patients who have undergone IPAA surgery for UC will develop at least one episode of pouchitis. Pouchitis leads to increased stool frequency and liquidity, cramping, urgency, fecal incontinence, and occasional rectal bleeding. It has been estimated that approximately 30,000 to 45,000 patients have pouchitis in the United States. 
 13

While the majority of patients with acute pouchitis respond well to a short course of antibiotics, some patients develop chronic and refractory disease that requires long-term non-antibiotic therapy. Currently, there are no therapies approved for pouchitis and chronic refractory patients will be treated with budesonide, anti-inflammatory drugs (mesalamine, sulfasalazine), or immunosuppressive drugs (other steroids or anti-TNFα). There is a significant unmet medical need to develop products for patients who develop severe pouchitis. 
 Summary of Our AMT-101 Data 
 AMT-101 has completed a Phase 1b clinical trial in UC patients. We have observed in preclinical studies, a Phase 1a clinical trial in healthy volunteers, and a Phase 1b clinical trial in patients with UC that oral AMT-101 acts on the local immunological pathways along the GI tissue. Importantly, AMT-101 did not enter the bloodstream and no serious adverse events were observed. We believe that AMT-101 has demonstrated PoC for our technology platform by enabling the active transport and rapid absorption of an orally-administered biologic therapeutic. 
Summary of Our AMT-101 Preclinical Data 
 AMT-101 Demonstrates In Vivo Active Transport and Localization 
 We examined the localization of AMT-101 in the intestine in a rat model by immunofluorescence microscopy which demonstrated that AMT-101 successfully transported across the IE barrier and localized along the GI tissue in vivo. Figure 6 shows a representative image of the cross-section of an intestinal villus. Each of the components (human IL-10 and cholix carrier) was observed separately and their co-localization in the GI tissue is evidenced in the composite image. 
 
Figure 6. In vivo localization of AMT-101 in GI lamina propria tissue
 

The transport of AMT-101 (yellow label) across an IE cell was visualized by the co-localization of IL-10 (green label) and cholix-based carrier (red label). Cell nuclei were labeled in blue. AMT-101 was seen to transport efficiently and localize within the immune-rich lamina propria of the intestinal tissue. We believe the ability to locally access and target the immune cells on the other side of the IE barrier drives the immunomodulatory response to IL-10. 
 In Vivo Pharmacology: AMT-101 Demonstrates Efficacy in a Murine Model of UC 
 We have observed that oral AMT-101 treatment in an oxazolone-induced murine model of chronic UC improved colonic histopathology in vivo. As shown in Figure 7, colonic tissue architecture as observed in histological staining in oral AMT-101 treated animals at day seven resembled that of healthy, non-inflamed tissue whereas the placebo treated group did not demonstrate any benefit. Furthermore, treatment with AMT-101 also showed significant improvement in objective measures of local disease including colon weight, colon weight/length ratio, and histopathology severity score.

Local GI-selective AMT-101 Induces Systemic Anti-Inflammatory Activity 
 In an oxazolone-induced murine model of chronic UC, treatment with oral AMT-101 resulted in a consistent trend of reduced levels of pro-inflammatory markers in systemic circulation as measured in the blood, as shown in Figure 8. The decrease in levels of these markers is consistent with our hypothesis that AMT-101 can induce a broad immunomodulatory response including effects that are consistent with IL-10 biology. These initial efficacy data support AMT-101’s potential to correct systemic immune dysregulation and inflammation by targeting the local immunological pathways along the GI tissue. 
 Figure 8. Oral GI-selective AMT-101 decreased systemic markers of inflammation and immune dysregulation
 
 
* | P < 0.05
--+---------

 In addition to IL-17A, IL-6, and MIP1a, oral GI-selective AMT-101 resulted in broadly and systemically decreased markers of inflammation, including: IL-1ß, IL-4, IL-13, IL-15/15R, IL-28, GCSF, LIX, and MCSF. 
 We also investigated AMT-101 dosing in NHP. As shown in Figure 9, we observed higher ratios of colonic tissue pSTAT3/STAT3 at all doses, demonstrating colonic STAT3 activation following AMT-101 treatment. The colonic STAT3 activation observed in our studies is an indicator of IL-10 receptor activation and demonstrates AMT-101 target engagement. In addition to activation of pSTAT3, IL-10 receptor engagement can also be measured by systemic levels of IL-1Ra, a well-established anti-inflammatory protein, as IL-10 stimulates the downstream production of IL-1Ra. As shown in Figure 10, the induction of systemic IL-1Ra in NHPs demonstrates that AMT-
 15

101 not only replicates IL-10 function in the gut but also produces a systemic immunomodulatory effect with negligible levels of AMT-101 detected in blood.

 Oral AMT-101 Generates Robust Systemic Pharmacodynamic Response with Negligible Systemic Exposure 
 AMT-101 was administered by oral capsules, subcutaneous (SC) injection, and IV infusion in a non-disease NHP model. Despite greater than 1,000-fold lower levels of systemic IL-10 observed in blood via oral administration, systemic levels of induced IL-1Ra by oral AMT-101 were equivalent to, if not even slightly greater than, systemic levels of IL-Ra induced by SC injection and IV infusion (Figure 11). This effect demonstrates the ability of oral GI-selective AMT-101 to induce immunomodulatory effects along GI tissue that impact both local and systemic biology, but without meaningful systemic exposure. We believe oral AMT-101 will have the same, if not greater, efficacy as systemic IL-10, but will not exhibit the toxicity and safety issues posed by high levels of systemic IL-10 exposure. Furthermore, induction of IL-1Ra is indicative of the immunomodulatory potential of local IL-10 and we believe suggests a broader role for oral GI-selective AMT-101 in peripheral inflammatory and autoimmune indications.

Summary of Our AMT-101 Clinical Data 
 AMT-101 Phase 1a/b Clinical Trials 
 We designed the Phase 1a portion of our Phase 1a/b clinical trial to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of increasing single ascending doses (SAD) of oral AMT-101 in healthy volunteers. In the Phase 1b portion of the trial, we sought to gather early data on the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and initial clinical response following a multiple ascending dose (MAD) of AMT-101 in adult patients with active UC over 14 days of treatment. The results of the Phase 1b clinical trial are intended to inform the design and dose selection of future PoC trials. 
 Other objectives of the Phase 1a/b clinical trial were to: (i) assess the incidence of anti-drug antibodies against AMT-101; (ii) evaluate potential pharmacodynamic markers of AMT-101 in plasma and tissue; and (iii) assess clinical activity of AMT-101 after two weeks of daily treatment in patients with active UC. 
 Phase 1a Clinical Trial Design 
 As shown in Figure 12, the Phase 1a clinical trial consisted of a SAD escalation in six cohorts of healthy volunteers. At each dose level, six subjects were randomized 4:2 to receive AMT-101 or a single dose of placebo. The doses tested were 1 mg, 3 mg, 10 mg, 30 mg, 60 mg, and 120 mg. 

17

Figure 12. Phase 1a trial design of AMT-101
 
Preliminary Phase 1a Data Has Demonstrated the Tolerability of Oral AMT-101 Treatment 
 The results of the Phase 1a clinical trial demonstrated that oral AMT-101 was observed to be well tolerated by healthy volunteers. In Figure 13 below, shows that a total of three treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were observed—one in the twelve placebo patients, and two out of the total of twenty-four active AMT-101 patients. All adverse events were mild and self-limiting. 
 Results of the pharmacokinetic analyses from all doses (1-120 mg) confirmed that AMT-101 was GI-selective as it was not detected in the blood.

Figure 14. Phase 1b trial design of AMT-101
 
Phase 1b Clinical Trial Design 
 As shown in Figure 14, the Phase 1b clinical trial consisted of a MAD escalation in adult patients with evidence of active UC (as assessed by stool frequency and rectal bleeding) and moderate severity in nature. A total of four cohorts 
 18

were dosed with either 1 mg, 3 mg, 10 mg, or 30 mg AMT-101, randomized 3:1 to receive AMT-101 or a placebo administered once daily for fourteen days. The goal of the trial was to assess the safety of AMT-101 and any change in UC disease activity, through endoscopy, histology, biomarkers, and serum samples. Stool samples and colonic biopsies were obtained both at baseline and at day 14 of treatment to assess fecal calprotectin as well as histology based upon blinded central read of the Geboes scoring system. Fecal calprotectin is an objective and well-established marker of clinical response in UC studies and the Geboes scoring system is a standard measure of histological response which uses a 0-22-point histologic scoring system in which higher scores represent more severe disease. 
 Phase 1b Data Has Demonstrated that Oral AMT-101 is Well Tolerated 
 The results of the Phase 1b clinical trial demonstrated that oral AMT-101 was observed to be well tolerated by patients with UC. Figure 15 below, shows that a total of 23 TEAEs were observed including three in the four placebo patients, and 20 in the 12 active AMT-101 patients. The adverse events of the Phase 1b clinical trial included nasopharyngitis and adverse events associated with underlying UC symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and nausea. All adverse events were self-limiting and mild to moderate, with no adverse events warranting early discontinuation of treatment. Importantly, unlike what was observed in previous clinical trials studying systemically delivered IL-10, no treatment emergent AEs of anemia or thrombocytopenia were observed. Systemic levels of AMT-101 were either undetectable or <1 ng/mL, thereby confirming gut-selectivity. 
 
Figure 15: AMT-101 was well tolerated in active UC patients after 14 days of treatment with no meaningful differences in TEAEs observed among active subjects and placebo
 

Results of Clinical Response 
 Fecal calprotectin (FCP) is a well-established clinical marker of disease activity in patients with UC. FCP values greater than 150 µg/g correlate with active inflammation. As can be seen in Figure 16, dosing of 1 mg and 3 mg AMT-101 led to placebo-adjusted mean reductions of FCP of 44% and 27% after 14 days of dosing in UC patients with baseline FCP>150 µg/g. Previous clinical trials with systemically delivered IL-10 showed a diminution of activity at higher doses, which is also observed at higher doses of AMT-101. 
 19

Figure 16: AMT-101 reduced FCP after 14-days of treatment in UC patients with baseline FCP >150 µg/g
 
CRP is a well-established biomarker of systemic inflammation. At 1 mg, 3 mg, and 30 mgs, greater reductions in CRP levels were observed in UC patients with baseline CRP greater than 5mg/L when compared to placebo. By design, AMT-101 is a GI-selective protein and was not detected in systemic circulation. However, reduction in CRP levels suggests that treating UC patients with oral GI-selective AMT-101 resulted in local intestinal as well as systemic immunomodulatory activity, the latter of which indicates the potential to treat peripheral inflammatory indications. 
 
Figure 17: AMT-101 reduced CRP in systemic circulation after 14-days of treatment in UC patients with baseline CRP >5 mg/L
 

The Geboes histologic scoring system is a system that incorporates measurements of immune cell (lymphocyte and neutrophil) infiltration into the lamina propria and epithelium, crypt architecture and destruction, and the presence of 
 20

histologic ulcerations and erosions. When each component is added, the total score can range from 0 (normal) to 22 (severe inflammation and tissue destruction). To assess activity of AMT-101 on the GI mucosa, colonic biopsies were obtained at baseline and then after 14 days of dosing and Geboes scores were assessed by a blinded, central read GI pathologist. Patients that had valuable Day 0 and Day 14 biopsies were assessed by the central reader. 
 In Figure 18, AMT-101 reduced Geboes scores in 60% (6/10) active AMT-101 patients when compared to 0% (0/2) placebo patients. 
 Figure 18. AMT-101 reduced Geboes score over 14 days of treatment
 

Figure 19 shows pre-dose and post-treatment histological images from a UC patient in our Phase 1b clinical trial dosed with 10 mg of AMT-101 in which the Geboes score improved from a score of 15 to a score of three using a 22-point scale, with higher scores indicating more severe disease activity. The pre-dose image reveals the UC patient had crypt destruction and an inflammatory infiltrate in their colon at baseline which are resolved in the post-treatment image after 14 days of treatment with AMT-101.

AMT-101 Phase 2 Clinical Program 
 We have completed the Phase 1b clinical trial for AMT-101 in UC and analyzed additional data to assess safety and inform dose selection for Phase 2 clinical trials across multiple indications. We have initiated and dosed patients in our LOMBARD Phase 2 clinical trial. In addition, since AMT-101 is a non-systemic, non-immunosuppressive immunomodulator, we believe AMT-101 could provide benefit when used in combination with existing marketed products to improve clinical response and induction of clinical remission. Therefore, we have initiated the MARKET Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the combination of AMT-101 and anti-TNFα therapy in patients with moderately to severely active UC. We have also initiated and dosed patients in the FILLMORE Phase 2 clinical trial as a monotherapy in patients with chronic pouchitis. Finally, based on the observation that AMT-101 can impact systemic markers of inflammation, we have initiated and dosed patients in the CASTRO Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the combination of AMT-101 and anti-TNFα therapy in patients with active RA who have had an inadequate response to anti-TNFα monotherapy. We anticipate top-line data readouts for our Phase 2 clinical trials beginning in the second half of 2021 and into 2022.  
 Figure 20 presents the plan for Phase 2 clinical trials for AMT-101. 
 Figure 20. Phase 2 clinical trials for AMT-101


 AMT-126: Our Oral GI-Selective IL-22 Fusion Protein 
 Our second product candidate, AMT-126, is a GI-selective oral fusion of rhIL-22 and our proprietary carrier molecule currently in development for diseases related to GI tissue barrier function defects driven by activation of the innate immune system. IL-22 is a cytokine that repairs functional and structural defects of the IE barrier and induces microbial defense. AMT-126 is designed to act locally on the epithelial cells of the intestinal tissue, thereby repairing the IE barrier and supporting mucosal healing, potentially translating into clinically meaningful improvements in a broad range of GI-focused, peripheral inflammatory and other diseases. We believe AMT-126 may have safety advantages relative to systemically administered IBD treatments, including prior clinical evaluation of rhIL-22, because AMT-101 is designed to stay in the GI tissue and not enter a patient’s bloodstream. 
 In preclinical development, AMT-126 demonstrated activity in animal models of intestinal inflammation, as well as induction of local tissue and systemic effects associated with the repair of IE barrier function defects. The localization 
 22

of AMT-126 in GI tissue has been further demonstrated in NHP studies. As a locally targeted, GI-selective biologic therapeutic, AMT-126 has the potential to address IE barrier function defects linked to a wide array of diseases, including celiac disease, a disease with no approved medicines, UC, and a number of peripheral diseases secondary to GI dysfunction, such as psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and other spondyloarthropathies (SpA). We have initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial for AMT-126 similar to that which we conducted with AMT-101 including a Phase 1a single ascending dose in healthy volunteers followed by a Phase 1b multiple ascending dose in healthy patients with an indication associated with intestinal barrier defects. 
 Figure 21 shows the molecular structure of AMT-126. 
 
Figure 21. Molecular structure of AMT-126
 

The Role of IL-22 Biology in IE Barrier Function Defect Correction 
 IL-22 is a cytokine that repairs functional and structural defects of the IE barrier and induces microbial defense by counteracting inflammasome-driven IE barrier function defects. IL-22 also functions to promote cell proliferation, block apoptosis, and support wound healing. While IL-22 can have a variety of actions on the structural and functional properties of the intestine, the most critical action related to health and disease relates to maintenance of the IE barrier. For example, in celiac disease, gliadin-induced IE barrier function defects of the small intestine appear to be correlated with a reduction of IL-22 in a NHP model. In addition, depletion of IL-22-producing CD4+ cells is correlated with active disease in UC models. 
 Potential Benefits of AMT-126, Our IL-22 Program 
 We believe AMT-126 may have a profile that will make it compelling to develop for IE barrier function defects linked to a wide array of diseases including celiac disease, UC and others. IL-22 has a mechanism of action that is directed at disturbances in the IE barrier function, which is central to these diseases. There are currently no approved therapies focused on the repair of IE barrier function. 
 We have designed AMT-126 to act locally on the GI tissue while avoiding entering the patient’s bloodstream, which we believe will mitigate previously reported adverse effects associated with systemic IL-22 treatments. 
 Due to its potentially attractive safety profile and complementary mechanism of action with those of anti-inflammatory products, we believe AMT-126 has the potential to be used as a single agent or in combination with anti-inflammatory products. 
 AMT-126 will be formulated to be available in a convenient, once daily, oral dosage form.

Summary of Our AMT-126 Preclinical Data 
 Preclinical studies with AMT-126 in murine models of diseases arising from IE barrier function defects and in healthy NHP have demonstrated encouraging pharmacological outcomes consistent with IL-22 biology and disease modification. 
AMT-126 Shows Highly Comparable Bioactivity to rhIL-22 in Established Models of In Vitro Pharmacology 
 AMT-126 was evaluated to determine in vitro bioactivity. As shown in Figure 22, IL-22 receptor dimerization and STAT3 activation confirmed ligand-dependent activation of the IL-22 signaling pathway that was highly comparable to multiple sources of rhIL-22. Furthermore, the AMT carrier by itself demonstrated no bioactivity. 
 Figure 22. AMT-126 induced IL-22 receptor dimerization and STAT3 activation in vitro bioactivity assays
 
Oral AMT-126 Shows Efficacy in a Murine Dextran Sulphate Sodium (DSS) Induced Model of UC 
 In a murine DSS-induced UC model to assess the activity of oral AMT-126, oral dosing of AMT-126 reduced DSS-induced weight loss and fecal hemoccult, and improved stool consistency during the course of the trial. 
 Figure 23. Oral AMT-126 demonstrated efficacy in a murine model of disease (DSS)
 

Oral AMT-126 Shows Systemic Pharmacological Effects with Low Systemic Exposures
 AMT-126 was administered by oral capsules in a non-disease NHP model and, by design, showed minimal (pg/ml) levels in the systemic circulation.  Although AMT-126 is intended to stay in the GI tissue, we observed systemic induction of Reg3A and IL-1Ra (Figure 24). This effect demonstrates the ability of oral GI-selective AMT-126 to induce effects along GI tissue that impact both local and systemic biology, but without meaningful systemic exposure. 
 24

We believe oral AMT-126, as a gut selective therapy, could have the same, if not greater, efficacy as systemic IL-22, but may also have an enhanced safety profile due to minimal systemic levels of IL-22. Furthermore, the systemic induction of IL-1Ra suggests a broader role for oral GI-selective AMT-126 in peripheral diseases secondary to GI dysfunction. 
Figure 24. Oral AMT-126 Shows Systemic Pharmacological Effects with Low Systemic Exposures in Non-Human Primates

AMT-126 Phase 1 Clinical Programs 
 We submitted a CTA for AMT-126 and are conducting a Phase 1 clinical program similar to that which we conducted with AMT-101 including a Phase 1a single ascending dose in healthy volunteers, which we began dosing in February 2021, followed by a Phase 1b clinical trial in patients with a certain disease associated with intestinal barrier defects. Topline oral AMT-126 Phase 1a/b data in healthy volunteers and patients are anticipated in 2022. 
Research Programs 
 While our most advanced product candidates focus on developing novel, oral biologic therapeutics to treat autoimmune and inflammatory indications, any disease which can be treated with a biologic therapeutic is conceivably a candidate for our technology. Our research programs are focused on expanding into indications with high unmet medical need and sizable market potential, including other gastroenterological and metabolic diseases. We believe these programs demonstrate the applicability of our technology platform across a wide range of biological therapeutics and diseases. 
Immunology and Inflammation 
 Currently, AMT-101 and AMT-126 are our most advanced product candidates in autoimmune and inflammatory indications; however, we have started additional programs based on several other biologic therapeutics including full length antibodies. We are also expanding our capabilities in applying our proprietary carrier technology to broad antibody engineering formats, including Fab and scFv constructs, where antagonist strategies are required. 
Gastroenterology 
 The ability to selectively target proteins or peptide therapeutics to the intestinal tract makes gastroenterology a logical therapeutic area of interest for application of our product candidates and allows us to access biological pathways beyond immunology and inflammation. Our first research candidate is an oral GI-selective GLP-2 receptor agonist that is being designed to treat patients with SBS. Current treatment paradigms for patients with SBS include total parenteral nutrition and daily injections of GLP-2 analog peptide. There are several weekly-administered GLP-2 analog products in development, but none are focused on oral delivery. Our technology platform would allow the direct targeting of GLP-2 receptors located in the intestinal tissue with minimal systemic exposure. Our research programs may also develop product candidates with potential in other gastroenterology applications such as motility and neuro-gastroenterology. 
 25

Metabolic Diseases and Other Disorders
The intestinal tissue is a main site of action for multiple incretin peptides, such as GLP-1, gastric inhibitory peptide, and glucagon, which are core components of pathways involved in diabetes and obesity. Currently, the vast majority of these molecules are administered to patients via systemic injection. We believe that oral delivery of these molecules directly to the sites of incretin receptors expression along the GI tissue and in the hepatic portal system will allow us to improve upon standard of care by more favorably affecting metabolic pathways, including those that regulate glycemic function, minimize systemic exposures, and impact other linked pathologies, particularly if our product candidates also lower body fat levels. We are exploring diabetes, obesity, and possibly Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis for our oral GLP-1 analog research program. 
 We have also conducted research on metabolic diseases caused by growth hormone deficiency. Our research program in this area is an oral hGH. The primary site of action of hGH is in the liver, where it induces production of insulin-like growth factor-1. By virtue of our platform, our hGH program is targeted to the hepatic portal system and reaches the intended organ target (liver) prior to any systemic exposure. Similar to GLP-1 and GLP-2 analogs, there are several injectable hGH products in development; however, our oral hGH may uniquely minimize systemic exposure, reach the liver target more efficiently, and improve compliance. 
 Manufacturing 
 Currently, we rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third-party current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) manufacturers for the production of our product candidates for human clinical trials. In particular, we have established non-exclusive relationships with several contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs), including for the manufacturing of AMT-101 bulk drug intermediate, drug substance, manufacturing of AMT-101 capsules and tablets, and packaging and labeling of AMT-101 drug product. We have personnel with significant technical, manufacturing, analytical, quality, regulatory, including cGMP, and project management experience to oversee our third-party manufacturers and to manage manufacturing and quality data and information for regulatory compliance purposes. 
 We have also spent significant resources developing our current manufacturing processes and know-how. We have activated a new facility also located in South San Francisco where we manufacture clinical drug supply. We have successfully manufactured AMT-101 and AMT-126 clinical drug supply at our internal facility. From time to time and as capacity requires, we may use contract manufacturing organizations for specific programs. 
 We believe that developing our own manufacturing capacity and capability is important to limit reliance on contract manufacturers, protect our trade secrets and intellectual property, and improve our manufacturing processes. 
 Commercialization Plan 
 We do not currently have any approved drugs and we do not expect to have any approved drugs in the near term. Therefore, we have no sales, marketing, or commercial product distribution capabilities and have no experience as a company in marketing drugs. When, and if any of our product candidates are approved for commercialization, we intend to develop a commercialization infrastructure for those products in the United States, Europe, Asia, and potentially in certain other key markets. We may also rely on partnerships to provide commercialization infrastructure, including sales and marketing and commercial distribution. 
Competition 
 The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. We face potential competition from many different sources, including major multinational pharmaceutical companies, established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, universities and other academic institutions, government agencies, and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for the research, development, manufacturing, and commercialization of therapies aimed at treating autoimmune, inflammatory, metabolic, and other diseases. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with current therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
 26

In particular, with respect to our most advanced product candidates, AMT-101 and AMT-126, we compete against companies that produce injectable biologic therapeutics such as AbbVie Inc., Eli Lilly and Co., Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Roche Holding Ltd. and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd., as well as companies that produce oral products such as Abivax SA, Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Galapagos NV, Gilead Sciences, Inc., Gossamer Bio, Inc., Landos Biopharma, Inc., Pfizer Inc., Protagonist Therapeutics, Inc. and Theravance Biopharma, Inc. 
 
We are not aware of any other company or organization that has developed a FDA-approved oral biologic, other than peptides. However, we are aware of other companies developing oral biologic drug candidates using their own technology platform. 
 Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, and marketing approved drugs than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and enrolling subjects for our clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. 
 We could see a reduction or elimination of our commercial opportunity if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we or our collaborators may develop, including if competitors develop a safer and/or more effective oral biologic technology platform. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or foreign regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for product candidates, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we or our collaborators are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the effectiveness of companion diagnostics, if required, the level of biosimilar or generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates, technology and know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our strategy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, pursuing and obtaining patent protection in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, and product candidates that are important to the development and implementation of our business. Our patent portfolio is intended to cover our product candidates and related components, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, our proprietary reagents and assays, and any other inventions that are commercially important to our business. We also rely on trademarks as well as trade secret protection of our confidential information and know-how relating to our proprietary technology platform, and product candidates. We believe that we have substantial know-how and trade secrets relating to our technology and product candidates. 
 As of January 15, 2021, our patent portfolio includes patents and patent applications related to our technology platform and our product candidates. In total, our patent portfolio includes 36 U.S. and foreign issued patents and over 50 other pending patent applications. Foreign patents are granted in the following jurisdictions: Europe (validated in Germany, France, United Kingdom, Belgium, Switzerland, Spain, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Sweden, and Norway), Canada, China, Israel, Australia, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Russia, and South Africa. The technology platform filings include 29 issued patents and at least 15 pending applications. Certain platform filings are expected to expire as early as 2031. Other filings directed to platform technology are expected to expire as early as 2039. 
 In addition to platform filings, we have filings directed to specific product candidates. For our product candidates, we generally pursue multilayered patent protection covering the composition of matter including the sequence of the 
 27

product candidates, the formulations of the product candidates, and/or the functional characteristics of the product candidates. In addition to composition of matter coverage, we also generally pursue claims directed to methods of making, and methods of use of the product candidates. Filings specific to AMT-101 and AMT-126 are expected to expire in 2039 or 2040.
Government Regulation 
 The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting of biologics such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory authorities of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates. 
U.S. Biologics Regulation 
 The process required by the FDA before biologic product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
  
• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practices regulation;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent IRB or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is commenced;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended purpose;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation of and submission to the FDA of a biologics license application (BLA) after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s continued safety, purity and potency, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with current good clinical practices (cGCP); and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of a BLA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical and Clinical Development 
 Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol or protocols for preclinical studies and clinical trials. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product, chemistry, manufacturing and controls information, and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day period, raises safety concerns or questions about the 
 28

proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with cGCP, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site and must monitor the trial until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing preclinical studies and clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries. 
 For purposes of BLA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap. 
  
• | Phase 1. The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, to identify possible side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. We expect to conduct four Phase 2 clinical trials to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so-called Phase 4 trials may be made a condition to approval of the BLA. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested. Stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 As a result of the COVID-19 public health emergency, we may be required to develop and implement additional clinical trial policies and procedures designed to help protect subjects from the COVID-19 virus. For example, in March 2020, the FDA issued a guidance, which the FDA subsequently updated, on conducting clinical trials during the pandemic, which describes a number of considerations for sponsors of clinical trials impacted by the pandemic, including the requirement to include in the clinical trial report contingency measures implemented to manage the clinical trial, and any disruption of the clinical trial as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; a list of all subjects affected by the COVID-19-pandemic related trial disruption by unique subject identifier and by investigational site and a 
 29

description of how the individual’s participation was altered; and analyses and corresponding discussions that address the impact of implemented contingency measures (e.g., participant discontinuation from investigational product and/or trial, alternative procedures used to collect critical safety and/or efficacy data) on the safety and efficacy results reported for the clinical trial. In June 2020, FDA also issued a guidance on good manufacturing practice considerations for responding to COVID-19 infection in employees in drug products manufacturing, including recommendations for manufacturing controls to prevent contamination of drugs. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business operations is highly uncertain and subject to change and will depend on future developments, including new regulatory requirements and changes to existing regulations.
 BLA Submission and Review 
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to the FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies. 
 Once a BLA has been submitted, the FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. In both standard and priority reviews, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure, and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with cGCP. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 
 After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response letter will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the Complete Response letter without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the Complete Response letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product. 
 If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a product and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if 
 30

problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. 
 Expedited Development and Review Programs 
 The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. The fast track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new products are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat patients with a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a fast track product has opportunities for frequent interactions with the review team during product development and, once a BLA is submitted, the product may be eligible for priority review. A fast track product may also be eligible for rolling review, where the FDA may consider for review sections of the BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA. 
 A product intended to treat patients with a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product can receive breakthrough therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the fast track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product, including involvement of senior managers. 
 Any marketing application for a biologic submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with a fast track designation and/or breakthrough therapy designation, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite the FDA review and approval process, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition. For original BLAs, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date (as compared to ten months under standard review). 
 Additionally, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating patients with serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will generally require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. 
 
Fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and RMAT designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. 
 Orphan Drug Designation 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat patients with a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States for which there is no reasonable expectation that 
 31

the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process.
If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusive approval (or exclusivity), which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application fee. 
 A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. 
 Post-approval Requirements 
 Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to cGMP, quality controls, record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing user fee requirements, under which the FDA assesses an annual program fee for each product identified in an approved BLA. Biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. 
 
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of existing product approvals;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal of the FDA to permit the import or export of products;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 32

 
• | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising, potential civil and criminal penalties, government investigation, and/or debarment or exclusion from participation in federal health care programs. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine by physicians or their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, regulate manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. 
 Biosimilars and Reference Product Exclusivity 
 The ACA includes a subtitle called the BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-approved reference biological product. To date, a number of biosimilars have been licensed under the BPCIA, and numerous biosimilars have been approved in Europe. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars. 
 Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency and that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components, which can be demonstrated through comparative analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical trial or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient or that it can be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of a health care provider who prescribed the reference product, and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA. 
 Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law. 
 The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact and implementation of the BPCIA are subject to significant uncertainty. 
 33

Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Such laws include, without limitation: the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, the Sunshine Act, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and similar foreign, federal and state fraud and abuse, transparency, and health information privacy and security laws. 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase or recommendation of an item or service for which payment may be made under any federal healthcare program. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value, including stock options. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers, among others, on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, but they are drawn narrowly and require strict compliance in order to offer protection. Our activities, including our engagement of consultants, may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of an applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all relevant facts and circumstances. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, can result in a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act. 
 Civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal False Claims Act, which can be enforced through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, and civil monetary penalty laws prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to the federal government, including federal healthcare programs, that are false or fraudulent. For example, the federal False Claims Act prohibits any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly providing free products or other illegal kickbacks to customers to induce customers to refer or use the companies’ products over competitors’ products or alternative treatments that were billed to federal healthcare programs for reimbursement for the products. 
 The U.S. federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires applicable manufacturers of covered prescription drugs, devices, biologics or medical supplies subject to FDA approval or clearance for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to annually report to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) or teaching hospitals, including ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations will extend to include payments and transfers of value made during the previous year to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, anesthesiologist assistants, and certified nurse-midwives.
 HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, and making false statements relating to healthcare matters. In addition, HIPAA, as amended the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, impose certain requirements on HIPAA covered entities, which include certain healthcare providers, healthcare clearinghouses, and health plans, as well as individuals and entities, known as business associates, that provide services for or on behalf of the covered entities that involve individually identifiable health information, relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information. 
 34

We are also subject to additional similar U.S. state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, which, in some cases, differ from each other in significant ways, and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. For example, we may be subject to state and foreign anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third party payors, including private insurers, or that apply regardless of payor; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government; state and local laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; state laws that require the reporting of information related to drug pricing; state and local laws requiring the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 In the event of any actual or alleged failure to comply with any of these or other laws or regulations, we may face investigations and other proceedings by governmental authorities and claims and litigation by private parties in certain circumstances.  If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply, or if we settle any claims or proceedings relating to any such laws or regulations, we may be subject to fines, penalties or other liabilities, including, without limitation, significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participating in government-funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid or similar programs in other countries or jurisdictions, government investigations, consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance, disgorgement, imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and market share, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. 
 
Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any pharmaceutical or biological product for which we obtain regulatory approval. Sales of any product, if approved, depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state, and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement, if any, for such product by third-party payors. Decisions regarding whether to cover any of our product candidates, if approved, the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. Further, no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement exists in the United States, and coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage policy, formulary, and reimbursement rates, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific, clinical, and/or cost-effectiveness support for the use of our product candidates to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. 
 For products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs. Additionally, separate reimbursement for the product itself or the treatment or procedure in which the product is used may not be available, which may impact physician utilization. 
 In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical or biological products, medical devices and medical services, in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product that receives approval. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product.

Healthcare Reform
The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of reform proposals to change the healthcare system. There is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by federal and state legislative initiatives, including those designed to limit the pricing, coverage, and reimbursement of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, especially under government-funded health care programs, and increased governmental control of drug pricing. 
 The ACA, which was enacted in March 2010, substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States, and significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA contains a number of provisions of particular import to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including, but not limited to, those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, a new licensure framework for follow on biologic products, and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. There have been executive, legislative and judicial challenges to certain aspects of the ACA since its enactment. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Act) was enacted, which, among other things, removed penalties for not complying with ACA’s individual mandate to carry health insurance, effective January 1, 2019. On December 14, 2018, a Texas District Court Judge ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The United States Supreme Court is currently reviewing this case, but it is unknown when a decision will be reached. Although the U.S. Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the constitutionality of the ACA, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through May 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructs certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. We are continuing to monitor any changes to the ACA that, in turn, may potentially impact our business in the future. It is unclear how the Supreme Court ruling, other such litigation, and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA and our business. Complying with any new legislation or reversing changes implemented under the ACA could be time-intensive and expensive, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business.
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year and reduced payments to several types of Medicare providers. These reductions went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension implemented under various COVID-19 relief legislation from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021, unless additional action is taken by Congress. Congress recently introduced a bill to extend the moratorium on the 2% Medicare sequester cuts through the end of 2021. We are continuing to monitor the status of this bill.
 Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, the Trump administration used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives. In 2020, under the Trump administration, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and CMS issued various rules in November and December of 2020 that were expected to impact, among others, price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, manufacturer price reporting requirements under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including regulations that affect manufacturer-sponsored patient assistance programs subject to pharmacy benefit manager accumulator programs and Best Price reporting related to certain value-based purchasing arrangements. Multiple

lawsuits have been brought against the HHS challenging various aspects of the rules. Further, in January 2021, the Biden administration issued a “regulatory freeze” memorandum that directs department and agency heads to review new or pending rules of the Trump administration. The impact of such lawsuits as well as pending and future legislative, executive, and administrative actions of the Biden administration on us and the pharmaceutical industry as a whole is currently unknown. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. 
 We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, particularly in light of the new presidential administration. Further, it is possible that additional government action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Employees and Human Capital Resources
 As of December 31, 2020, we had 80 full-time employees, over 81% of whom were engaged in research and development activities. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered under a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. 
 Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based and cash-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.
 Facilities 
 Our corporate headquarters are currently located in South San Francisco, California, where we lease 18,748 square feet of office, and laboratory space pursuant to a lease agreement that expires in August 2024. 
 In order to accommodate our anticipated growth and requirements in connection with our future development and commercialization efforts, we entered into a sublease agreement for 11,471 square feet for office and laboratory space in South San Francisco, California. The sublease term expires in May 2022. 
 In February 2021, we entered into a new lease agreement. See Note 10. Subsequent Event in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report.
 We believe that these facilities will be adequate for our near-term needs. If required, we believe that suitable additional or alternative space would be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms.
