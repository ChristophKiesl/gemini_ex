Our Company
 PGT Innovations, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our,” “PGTI” or the “Company”) manufactures and supplies premium windows and doors. Its impact-resistant products can withstand some of the toughest weather conditions on earth and, with its Western Window Systems (“WWS”) product lines, unify indoor/outdoor living spaces. We strive to create value through deep customer relationships, understanding the needs of the markets we serve, and a drive to develop category-defining products. We believe we are one of the nation’s largest manufacturers of impact-resistant windows and doors and hold leadership positions in our primary markets. We manufacture diverse lines of products, intended to appeal to different segments of the market, at different price-points, including high-end, luxury, premium and mass-custom fully customizable aluminum and vinyl windows and doors and porch enclosure products, targeting both the residential repair and remodeling and new construction end markets. We market our impact-resistant products under four recognized brands: PGT® Custom Windows & Doors, CGI® Windows and Doors, WinDoor®, NewSouth Window Solutions®, and, following the completion of our acquisition of a 75% ownership stake in ECO effective February 1, 2021, the ECO brands as well. We believe all of these brands are positively associated with service, performance, quality, durability and energy efficiency. We also market a line of window and door products designed to unify indoor/outdoor living spaces under the Western Window Systems® brands, which we believe are associated with innovation, quality, durability and energy efficiency in the indoor/outdoor living space markets. Many of these brands have been added to our portfolio through the acquisitions described below.

region since 2009. ECO is headquartered in Medley, Florida, near Miami, and has three manufacturing locations in the region.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our impact-resistant products combine heavy-duty aluminum or vinyl frames with laminated glass to ensure structural integrity, which provides protection from wind-driven projectiles of all sizes and other debris during a storm. Our impact-resistant products substantially reduce the likelihood of penetration by impacting projectiles, protecting people and property, while providing expansive, unblocked exterior views that other forms of protection, such as shutters or wood coverings, do not provide. Our impact-resistant products also offer many other benefits, including: (1) abatement of sound to substantially decrease outside noise, including during hurricanes; (2) protection against the damaging effects of ultra-violet light; (3) reduction of energy loss due to changing external temperatures; and (4) energy efficiency that can significantly reduce cooling and heating costs, as evidenced by the energy ratings our products have received. These impact-resistant products satisfy the nation’s most stringent building codes in hurricane-prone coastal states and provide an attractive alternative to shutters and other “active” forms of hurricane protection that require installation and removal before and after each storm. We also manufacture vinyl porch and patio enclosure products that are designed to allow air flow while protecting against inclement weather, making outdoor spaces more inviting.
 The addition of Western Window Systems (“WWS”) to our family of brands expanded our portfolio of offerings and our geographical footprint and added award-winning and innovative products that combine performance and quality with clean, functional designs. Its products are designed for strength, easy integration into a variety of spaces, smooth operation and are tested for durability.
 The acquisition of NewSouth has supported our diversification into growing segments in the window and door industry, by enabling us to enter the direct-to-consumer channel, where NewSouth is a market leader in Florida. NewSouth's direct-to-consumer model is supported by its showrooms and in-home sales. With the addition of NewSouth, we continued our strategy of growing in geographic areas outside of our core markets, with showroom openings planned for northern Florida and coastal states in the South. NewSouth has recently opened new showrooms in Pensacola, Florida, Charleston, South Carolina and Houston, Texas, with plans to open a location in New Orleans, Louisiana in the near future.
 The acquisition of ECO is expected to extend our residential market footprint with what we believe will be minimal overlap with our existing network of dealers, as most of ECO’s dealer-customers have not historically been our customers. ECO’s product offerings in the commercial market are expected to provide us with added product and customer diversification in that space, which we believe will be a high-growth market in future periods. By adding ECO’s glass manufacturing capabilities to our operations, we will expand our glass production capabilities and capacity and expect to strengthen and gain more control of our supply chain for glass.
 We believe our leading market position for impact-resistant products is derived from our broad and high-quality product offerings, continuous innovation, well-recognized brands, strong customer relationships, technical capabilities, customer care and extensive knowledge of and involvement in developments regarding hurricane-protection building codes and testing protocols.
 With approximately 3,500 employees (as of January 2, 2021) at our various manufacturing facilities located in North Venice, Tampa and Hialeah and Medley, Florida, and Phoenix, Arizona, our vertically integrated manufacturing capabilities include in-house glass cutting, tempering, laminating and insulating capabilities, which provide us with a consistent source of specialized glass, shorter lead times, lower costs relative to third-party sourcing and an overall more efficient production process. Additionally, our manufacturing process relies on just-in-time delivery of raw materials and components as well as synchronous flow to promote labor efficiency and throughput, allowing us to more consistently fulfill orders on-time for our valued customers. 
 The geographic regions in which we currently conduct business include the Southeastern U.S., Western U.S., Gulf Coast, Coastal mid-Atlantic, the Caribbean, Central America and Canada. We distribute our products through multiple channels, including approximately 2,000  independently-owned dealers and distributors, national building supply distributors, the in-home sales/custom order divisions of major U.S. home building and improvement supply retailers and, with our acquisition of NewSouth, the direct-to-consumer channel. We believe this broad distribution network provides us with the flexibility to meet demand as it shifts between the repair and remodel and residential and commercial new construction end markets.
 History 
 PGT Innovations, Inc. is a Delaware corporation. We were formed on December 16, 2003 as PGT, Inc. and operate our business through our various subsidiaries, PGT Industries, Inc., a Florida corporation, which was founded in 1980 as Vinyl Tech, Inc. On June 27, 2006, we became a publicly listed company on the NASDAQ Global Market (NASDAQ) under the symbol “PGTI”. We changed our name to PGT Innovations, Inc. which we announced on December 14, 2016. Effective on December 28, 2016, the listing of the Company’s common stock was transferred to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and our common stock began trading on the NYSE under our existing ticker symbol of “PGTI”.

WinDoor’s thermally broken products provide the strength of aluminum with the energy ratings usually seen in only vinyl products. All of WinDoor’s thermally broken products are available in multiple shapes and sizes, have earned high performance ratings on impact and non-impact certifications, and meet or exceed ENERGY STAR® standards in all climate zones.
 Estate by WinDoor. Formerly part of CGI, our Estate Collection of windows and doors is one of WinDoor’s premium aluminum impact-resistant product line. These windows and doors can be found in high-end homes, resorts and hotels, and in schools and office buildings. Our Estate Collection combines protection against hurricane force damage with architectural-grade quality, handcrafted details and modern engineering. These windows and doors protect and insulate against hurricane winds and wind-driven debris, outside noise, and offer UV protection. Estate’s aluminum frames are thicker than many of our competitors’ frames, making it a preferable choice for consumers in coastal areas prone to hurricanes.
 Western Window Systems
 WWS’s products are non-impact products, and include both customized products for its custom sales channel, and standard products for its volume, production builder, sales channel, and carry the Western Windows Systems® brand under three product categories of the Classic Line, Performance Line, and the Simulated Steel Line.
 Classic Line. WWS’s Classic Line is a portfolio of high-quality, disappearing glass walls and windows that combine exceptional performance with clean design. The products of the Classic Line include fixed and operating windows, as well as sliding, folding and hinged doors. Sales of the Classic Line products are focused on the volume/production builder market in relatively temperate areas in the Western United States.
 Performance Line. The Performance Line by WWS is a family of moving glass walls and windows engineered to satisfy its customers’ energy and structural requirements, while promoting a contemporary, modern architectural design. The Performance Line has broad thermal capabilities that allow this luxury line of products to satisfy all energy codes throughout the United States.
 Simulated Steel Line. The Simulated Steel Line by WWS is a portfolio of thermally-broken, aluminum moving glass walls and windows that look like steel but are far more affordable. This portfolio of products embodies WWS’s nearly 60 years of advancements in door and window design, and we believe exhibits luxury and refinement. The Simulated Steel Line has clean, narrow profiles which gives the glass components of the products a prominent positioning, while maximizing natural light.
 NewSouth
 Windows and Doors. NewSouth manufactures a wide array of single-hung, double-hung, sliding, picture and visually appealing shaped vinyl windows which are durable and energy-efficient. NewSouth also manufactures durable and attractive patio and entry doors which we believe enhance safety and improve the appearance of entry spaces.
 Installation. NewSouth provides quality installation of its windows and doors through an experienced group of installation services companies who are subcontracted to install its products.
 ECO Window Systems
 ECO manufactures impact resistant windows and doors which are engineered to meet the toughest standards in the industry at the best price while ensuring the durability, elegance, and safety of all products for both the commercial and residential markets.
 Windows and Doors. ECO manufactures a wide array of aluminum single-hung, horizontal rolling, fixed, and casement windows which are all impact resistant. ECO also manufactures several varieties of aluminum, impact-resistant patio and entry doors such as French, sliding, garage, bi-fold, and pivot which we believe complement the existing product lines offered by PGT Custom Windows & Doors and CGI Windows and Doors.
 Glass production. ECO produces its own processed glass products, which supplies all of its window and door manufacturing operations’ requirements for glass. ECO also sells glass to third-party customers. We believe ECO’s glass production capacity will allow further incremental vertical integration of the production of certain of our other product lines, enabling us to strengthen and gain more control of our supply chain for glass.

Sales and Marketing 
 Our sales strategy primarily focuses on attracting and retaining distributors and dealers by striving to consistently provide exceptional customer service, leading product designs and quality, through our knowledge of building code requirements and technical expertise, and competitive pricing. We also market our products to national and regional homebuilders, who then purchase our products from dealers and distributors. With our acquisition of NewSouth in February 2020, our sales strategy also focuses on direct-to-consumer sales for the types of jobs and customers that our dealers historically have not targeted or serviced. We believe our acquisition of a controlling ownership stake in ECO will provide us with more product offerings and customer relationships in the commercial market, which we believe will be a high growth market in future periods. Starting in 2020, ECO launched an initiative to sell quality, impact-resistant window and door products to multi-unit residential and mixed-use commercial projects and has successfully secured a number of supply agreements for such projects.
 Our marketing strategy is designed to reinforce our views regarding the quality and benefits of our products and focuses on both coastal and inland markets. We support our customers through print and web-based advertising, consumer, dealer, and builder promotions, and selling and collateral materials. We also work with our dealers and distributors to educate architects, building officials, consumers and homebuilders on the advantages of using impact-resistant and energy-efficient products. We market our products based on our expectations of quality, building code compliance, outstanding service, shorter lead times, and on-time delivery using our fleet of trucks and trailers. 
 Our Customers 
 We have a highly diversified base of approximately 2,000 window distributors, building supply distributors, window replacement dealers and enclosure contractors. This number excludes the distributor network of ECO, which we believe has minimal overlap with our existing dealer network. ECO sells its broad selection of aluminum, impact-resistant windows and doors to a network of approximately 200 dealers and distributors.
 In 2020, our largest customer accounted for approximately 4% of net sales and our top ten customers accounted for approximately 20% of net sales. Our sales are driven by residential new construction and home repair and remodel end markets, which represented approximately 46% and 54% of our sales, respectively, during 2020. This compares to 49% and 51%, respectively, in 2019. The increase in the percentage of our sales made to the repair and remodel market in 2020 is driven by the addition of the sales of NewSouth in 2020, the substantial majority of whose sales are into the home repair and remodel end market.
 Before the NewSouth Acquisition, we did not supply our products directly to homebuilders but believe demand for our products is also a function of our strong relationships with certain national homebuilders. With the acquisition of NewSouth, we sell direct to the end customer.
 Although we do not sell our products directly to national homebuilders, we believe demand for our products is also a function of our strong relationships with certain national homebuilders, for both our impact resistant products, and also for our WWS products, which are designed to unify indoor-outdoor living spaces.
 Materials, Inventory and Supplier Relationships 
 Our primary manufacturing materials include aluminum and vinyl extrusions, glass, ionoplast, and polyvinyl butyral. Although in many instances we have agreements with our suppliers, these agreements are generally terminable by either party on limited notice. While most of our materials are typically available from other sources, transitioning to alternative sources would require us to complete testing and certifications related to impact-resistance and for the alternative source of supply to create the customized equipment and tooling necessary to provide the materials and components to us. Therefore, our goal is to develop and maintain lasting relationships with our material suppliers.
 Glass, which includes sheet glass and finished glass, which we sourced from three major national suppliers in 2020, represented approximately 43% of our material purchases during 2020. Aluminum and vinyl extrusions accounted for approximately 35% of our material purchases during 2020. Polyvinyl butyral and ionoplast, which are both used as inner layer in laminated glass, typically accounts for approximately 5% of our material purchases. The remainder of our material purchases in 2020 are primarily composed of hardware and indirect materials used in the manufacturing process.
 Our inventory consists principally of raw materials purchased for the manufacture of our products and limited finished goods inventory as the majority of our products are custom, made-to-order products. Our inventory levels are more closely aligned with our number of product offerings rather than our level of sales. We have maintained our inventory level to have (i) raw materials required to support new product launches; (ii) a sufficient level of safety stock on certain items to ensure an adequate supply of material in the event of a sudden increase in demand and given our short lead-times; and (iii) adequate lead times for raw materials purchased from overseas suppliers in bulk supply.

As discussed below in the section titled ‘Backlog”, at the end of 2020, as compared to the end of 2019, our backlog of sales orders has increased significantly. We define backlog as orders that we have received and have accepted from customers, but that have not yet shipped. The majority of this increase is a result of an increased level of order entry during the second half of 2020. However, during 2020, our ability to obtain adequate supplies of glass for our manufacturing processes was disrupted by what we think were the impacts of the Pandemic on our glass supply chain partners, which ultimately resulted in an increase in our lead times to our customers. Although we have good relations with our glass supply chain partners, because of this disruption we determined to gain more control over our supply chain for glass. ECO’s vertically integrated operations includes a glass manufacturing division which supplies all of the impact-resistant glass used in ECO’s window and door products. In addition, ECO’s glass division sells laminated glass products to other companies, including to us, as an additional source of revenue. We believe that our investment in ECO will secure a high-quality, dependable supply of glass for our operations, as ECO has historically been a significant source of our glass needs. 
 Backlog 
 Our backlog was $199.5 million as of January 2, 2021, and $67.0 million as of December 28, 2019. Our backlog as of January 2, 2021 included $45.0 million relating to NewSouth. Our backlog consists of orders that we have received from customers that have not yet shipped. The majority of this increase in backlog resulted from an increased level of order entries during the second half of 2020, but also due to disruptions in our supply chain for certain materials, primarily glass and aluminum extrusions, which slowed our production speed and increased our lead times. We believe that our acquisition of a 75% ownership stake in ECO, which was one of our glass suppliers before that acquisition, will help mitigate the unfavorable impacts of any future disruptions in our glass supply chain, by providing us with a high-quality, dependable supply of glass for a portion of our operations. In addition, we are in the process of evaluating possible relationships with additional suppliers to mitigate the unfavorable impacts of any future disruptions in our supply chain for those materials.
 We expect that a significant portion of our current backlog will be recognized as sales in the first quarter of 2021, due in part to our lead times, which typically range from one to five weeks, but which have increased as a result of heightened demand, especially in our Southeast markets, but also due to the previously discussed supply chain disruptions. As of the end of 2020, our lead times had increased to an average of approximately eight weeks.
 Intellectual Property 
 We own and have registered trademarks in the U.S. In addition, we own several patents and patent applications concerning various aspects of window assembly and related processes. We are not aware of any circumstances that would have a material adverse effect on our ability to use our trademarks and patents. If we continue to renew our trademarks when necessary, the trademark protection provided by them is perpetual. 
Manufacturing 
 Our manufacturing facilities are in Florida, where we produce customized impact-resistant and non-impact products, and in Arizona, where we produce customized non-impact products for the custom channel of our WWS brand, and standard products for its volume channel. The manufacturing process for our PGT Custom Windows & Doors products typically begins in our glass plant in North Venice, Florida, where we cut, temper, laminate, and insulate sheet glass to meet specific requirements of our customers, although our Hialeah (CGI), and Tampa (NewSouth), Florida facilities and our Phoenix, Arizona (WWS) facility primarily source their glass needs from external suppliers. As discussed in the section titled “Materials, Inventory and Supplier Relationships” above, we believe that our acquisition of a controlling ownership interest in ECO, which was one of our glass suppliers before that acquisition, will provide us with a high-quality, dependable supply of glass for a portion of our operations..
 Glass is transported to our window and door assembly lines in a make-to-order sequence where it is combined with an aluminum or vinyl frame. These frames are also fabricated to order. We start with a piece of extruded material which is cut and shaped into a frame that fits the customers’ specifications. Once complete, product is immediately staged for delivery and generally shipped on our trucking fleet or with contracted carriers within 48 hours of completion. 
 Competition 
 The window and door industry is highly fragmented, and the competitive landscape is based on geography. The competition falls into the following categories.
 Local and Regional Window and Door Manufacturers: This group of competitors consists of numerous local job shops and small manufacturing facilities that tend to focus on selling products to local or regional dealers and wholesalers. Competitors in this group typically lack marketing support and the service levels and quality controls demanded by larger customers, as well as the ability to offer a full complement of products. 

- 10 -



National Window and Door Manufacturers: This group of competitors tends to focus on selling branded products nationally to dealers and wholesalers and has multiple locations.
 International Window and Door Manufacturers: This group of competitors consists of non-U.S. companies that have created entities and established manufacturing operations within Florida and have an increasing presence in the South Florida region as suppliers of windows and doors, primarily for high-rise buildings. 
 Active Protection: This group of competitors consists of manufacturers that produce shutters and plywood, both of which are used to actively protect openings. Our impact-resistant windows and doors represent passive protection, meaning, once installed, no activity is required to protect a home from storm related hazards.
 The principal methods of competition in the window and door industry are the development of long-term relationships with window and door dealers and distributors, and the retention of customers by delivering a full range of high-quality products in a timely manner, while offering competitive pricing and flexibility in transaction processing. Trade professionals such as contractors, homebuilders, architects and engineers also engage in direct interaction with manufacturers and look to the manufacturer for training and education related to products and codes. We believe our position as one of the leaders in the U.S. impact-resistant window and door market, and the innovative designs and quality of our products, position us well to meet the needs of our customers. 
 Environmental Considerations 
 Although our business and facilities are subject to federal, state, and local environmental regulation, environmental regulation does not have a material impact on our operations, and we believe that our facilities are in material compliance with such laws and regulations. 
Human Capital Management 
 Employees. As of the end of 2020, we employed approximately 3,500 people, none of whom were represented by a collective bargaining unit. We believe we have good relations with our employees.
 Employee Safety. The safety of our team members is our top priority, and we have taken significant steps in recent years to drive improvements in this area. Some of these safety initiatives we have taken, include:
 ●
Increasing the size, experience and other qualifications of our environment, health and safety, or “E&HS”, staff;
  
● | Adopting an incident management system that records workplace injuries based on type and other classifications to provide the data to drive targeted corrective and preventative actions to address and mitigate actual and potential causes of injuries;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ●
Implementing a “Serious Six” OSHA compliance training program;
  
● | Implementing ergonomics-related safety improvements, using an experience and risk-based approach to prioritize those improvements;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Partnering with vendors to obtain high quality personal protective equipment and related training on how to appropriately utilize that equipment;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increasing virtual workplace safety training, in addition to in-person training, when feasible, in response to the COVID-19 Pandemic, designed to drive workplace safety awareness through all levels of the organization;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ●
Training team members to identify and quickly address potentially unsafe activities and practices;
 ●
Implementing a team member EH&S recognition and rewards program; and
  
● | Increasing the frequency, number and types of internal workplace safety audits, inspections and walk-throughs conducted by the Company’s EH&S staff.

Labor Practices and Human Rights. All of our employees earn more than the federal minimum wage and we believe our hourly wages are competitive with the local communities in which our facilities operate. The average hourly wage, excluding incentive compensation, of a full-time hourly employee of the Company was approximately $16.26 as of January 2, 2021, as compared to $15.58 as of December 28, 2019, with approximately one-half of those hourly employees earning an average hourly wage of $15 or more. The average total compensation, including incentive compensation and benefits, for a full-time hourly employee of our Company in 2020 was $39,000.
 We strive to help our employees maintain job stability, so they are encouraged to stay with the Company and positioned to grow their skills and knowledge on the job. The 2020 annualized voluntary turnover rate in our workforce generally was flat as compared to 2019. In an effort to reduce employee turnover, we engage in annual surveys with employees, we maintain an open-door policy that enables us to help identify any issues before they cause an employee to leave the Company, and we review exit interview data, hotline calls and root cause analysis to help deter turnover. We also assign dedicated Company human resources representatives to each department so that we can better monitor employee morale within each department. 
 Workforce Diversity and Inclusion. We believe in being an inclusive workplace for all of our employees and are committed to having a diverse workforce that is representative of the communities in which we operate and sell our products. A variety of perspectives enriches our culture, leads to innovative solutions for our business and enables us to better meet the needs of a diverse customer base and reflects the communities we serve. Our aim is to develop inclusive leaders and an inclusive culture, while also recruiting, developing, mentoring, training, and retaining a diverse workforce, including a diverse group of management-level employees. We have had or currently have female executives in several of our senior leadership roles, including the positions of Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President of Human Resources, and Chief Marketing Officer for our Southeastern Business Unit. Our diversity and inclusion initiatives include:

● | PGT Innovations Leading Ladies, a program designed to identify, develop and mentor female employees who have demonstrated potential for serving as leaders within our organization;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Annual Diversity & Inclusion Training; and
--+-------------------------------------------


● | Dale Carnegie, a program that helps our managers understand how to appreciate, respect and value individual differences and behaviors.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
