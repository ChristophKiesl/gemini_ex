ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company History and Overview
 
History of Edge Data Solutions, Inc., a Delaware corporation
 
EDGE DATA SOLUTIONS, INC. (the “Company”), formerly Blockchain Holdings Capital Ventures, Inc. (formerly Southeastern Holdings, Inc., formerly Safe Lane Systems, Inc.) was incorporated in the State of Colorado on September 10, 2013. Safe Lane Systems, Inc. redomiciled to become a Delaware holding corporation in September of 2016. On September 22, 2016, Safe Lane Systems, Inc. formed two wholly owned subsidiaries, SLS Industrial, Inc and Southeastern Holdings, Inc. (both Delaware corporations) and on September 30, 2016 completed a merger and reorganization in which Southeastern Holdings, Inc. (now Edge Data Solutions, Inc.) became the holding company. On December 1, 2016, the Company spun off its wholly owned subsidiary, SLS Industrial, Inc., along with its assets and liabilities, leaving Southeastern Holdings, Inc. as the only surviving entity.
 
On August 23, 2018, the Company entered into a Bill of Sale and Assignment and Assumption Agreement with Blockchain Holdings, LLC (“Blockchain”) pursuant to which the Company purchased all of the assets of Blockchain which are used in the business of sourcing of blockchain mining equipment from various suppliers for their customers and also providing management of the equipment hosted, mining pools and tech work on such equipment. The Company issued 300,000,000 shares of its common stock, par value $.0001 valued at $300,000 to the members of Blockchain in exchange for the assets of Blockchain.
 
The Company has accounted for this transaction as a reverse recapitalization under ASC 805, under which the operating entity, Blockchain Holdings, LLC, adopted the assets, liabilities and equity structure of Edge Data Solutions, Inc. on August 23, 2018, while retaining its historical activity. The financial statements therefore present activity beginning with Blockchain Holdings, LLC’s inception date of February 5, 2018 through September 30, 2018.
 
On August 30, 2018 the Company changed its name to Blockchain Holdings Capital Ventures, Inc.
 
On January 13, 2020, the Company changed its name to Edge Data Solutions, Inc.
 
Edge Data Solutions, Inc is poised to be an industry-leading infrastructure provider. In an increasingly data-driven world, GPU computing is changing the way we create, learn, and play. Through strategic partners, the Company has assembled a full-stack solution to help businesses realize the potential of CPU/GPU computing, backed by a rapidly growing network of high-density modular data centers that place compute directly at the point of data collection, reducing latency, improving performance and security.
 
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. However, the above conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to do so. New business opportunities may never emerge, and we may not be able to sufficiently fund the pursuit of new business opportunities should they arise.
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $80,368 in cash on hand. Our current monthly cash burn rate is approximately $35,000, and it is expected that burn rate will continue and is not expected to increase until significant additional capital is raised, and our marketing plan is executed. Our trade creditors may call debts at any time, and our cash reserves would not be sufficient to satisfy all balances. We are currently dependent on loans, advances and other cash infusions from the Company’s Chairman and CEO Mr. Wannemacher, and President and Director, Daniel Wong. There is no guarantee that such cash infusions will continue to be made.

COMPANY BUSINESS OVERVIEW
 
Our Company, originally Safe Lane Systems, Inc., was formed to develop the marketing of, and contract the manufacturing of, certain products resulting from the development of IP in design and manufacturing by Superior Traffic Controls, Inc. We licensed certain IP under a Master License and a Sub License to capitalize the marketing and contract manufacturing of certain products.
 
After spinning off the assets and liabilities of our traffic safety division in December 2016, we no longer possess the aforementioned intellectual property or rights thereto and have implemented a new business model.
 
Edge Data Solutions, Inc. (EDSI) is poised to be an industry-leading edge data center and cloud infrastructure provider. EDSI’s proprietary Edge Performance Platform (EPP) allows us to deploy next-generation edge data centers where they are needed most. EDSI’s data centers provide next-generation immersion cooling technology that improves performance, reduces energy costs and latency. Key industries we serve more computing power are fintech, cloud gaming, telecom 5G, 3D/video/AI rendering, video streaming, remote desktop, IoT, autonomous vehicles. Centralized infrastructure facilities servicing multiple geographical areas encounter many issues with data latency, congestion and weak network connections. To address this, data processing is moving closer to the customer. EDSI offers green, low-cost, secure colocation and private data hosting to meet this demand for Edge data centers. EDSI plans to deploy to strategic locations based on demand for Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities outside the major metropolitans to underserved markets, supporting both edge customers and areas of projected growth. With the rise and proliferation of this technology adoption we plan to solidify our footprint by securing multiple locations across the US, while generating revenue from our operations. The modular design and ability to add additional data centers as needed, preserves up front capital allowing for rapid deployment and scalability as business demand increases.
 
Our Proposed Products:
 
GPU as a Service
 
This will be a steady and consistent revenue stream. It is a major growth area with companies choosing to rent processing power for high performance computing needs, including, artificial intelligence, rendering, data storage, cloud computing, data processing, and enterprise blockchain. EDSI will deploy and host servers, for customers looking to rent computing power or colocation for their own servers. EDSI will oversee real-time monitoring of these servers, with onsite IT and maintenance staff carrying out updates, preventative troubleshooting, and servicing to minimize any downtimes and ensure continuous processing power.
