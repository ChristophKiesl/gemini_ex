  Company Overview
  
 We are a blank check company formed pursuant to the laws of the State of Delaware on September 18, 2017 for the purpose of entering into a merger, stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities. On December 13, 2020, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended from time to time, the “Merger Agreement”) with NeuroRx, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“NeuroRx”) and Big Rock Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of ours (“Merger Sub”), providing for the merger of Merger Sub with and into NeuroRx (the “Merger”), with NeuroRx surviving the Merger and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of us. As a result of the Merger, and upon consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (“Transactions”), NeuroRx will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, with the stockholders of NeuroRx becoming stockholders of the Company. Upon approval of the Company’s stockholders and consummation of the Transactions, the Company will change its name to “NRX Pharmaceuticals, Inc.” The terms of the Merger Agreement are discussed in more detail below. Prior to executing the Merger Agreement, our activities were limited to organization activities, the completion of our initial public offering, and the evaluation of possible business combination candidates.
 Formation and Initial Public Offering
  
 In September 2017, the Company issued an aggregate of 1,437,500 shares of common stock to the Sponsor (the “founder’s shares”) for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000. On November 20, 2017, the Company effectuated a 1.2-for-1 stock dividend of its common stock resulting in an aggregate of 1,725,000 founder shares outstanding.
  
 On November 22, 2017, we consummated the initial public offering (the “Initial Public Offering”) of 6,000,000 units (“Units”), each Unit consisting of one share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Common Stock”), one right (“Right”) entitling the holder thereof to receive one-tenth (1/10) of one share of Common Stock upon the consummation of an initial business combination, and one-half of one warrant (“Warrant”), each whole Warrant exercisable to purchase one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, pursuant to the registration statements on Form S-1 (File Nos. 333-220947 and 333-221659) (the “Registration Statements”). The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $60,000,000. We refer to the shares of Common Stock underlying the Units as our “public shares.”
  
 Simultaneously with the consummation of the Initial Public Company, on November 22, 2017, we completed a private placement (the “Private Placement”) of 250,000 units (“Placement Units”) at a price of $10.00 per Placement Unit, generating total proceeds of $2,500,000. The securities issued in the Private Placement were issued in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or Regulation D thereunder, as a sale not involving any public offering.
  
 On November 28, 2017, the underwriters notified us of their exercise of their over-allotment option in full and on November 29, 2017, purchased 900,000 Units at $10.00 per Unit upon the closing of the over-allotment option, generating gross proceeds of $9,000,000. Simultaneously with the sale of such Units, we consummated the sale of an additional 22,500 Placement Units at $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $225,000. Placement Units were issued in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or Regulation D thereunder, as a sale not involving any public offering.

 A total of $69,000,000 of the net proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement was deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public stockholders. We incurred costs in the aggregate amount of $2,172,419 related to Initial Public Offering, including $1,725,000 of underwriting fees and $447,419 of other costs.
  
 Our Units began trading on November 20, 2017 on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol “BRPAU.” Commencing on December 1, 2017, the underlying shares of Common Stock, Warrants and Rights began trading on Nasdaq under the symbols “BRPA,” “BRPAW,” and “BRPAR,” respectively.
  
  Proposed Business Combination
  
 On December 13, 2020, the Company entered into the Merger Agreement with NeuroRx and Merger Sub. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into NeuroRx, with NeuroRx surviving the Merger. The Merger Agreement was subsequently amended on January 27, 2021 and March 19, 2021.
  
 NeuroRx is a clinical-stage small molecule pharmaceutical company which develops novel therapeutics for the treatment of central nervous system disorders and life-threatening pulmonary diseases. NeuroRx recently announced a commercial partnership with Relief Therapeutics Holding AG for global commercialization of RLF-100, or “ZYESAMI”, an application for COVID-related respiratory failure (the “NeuroRx COVID-19 Drug”). NeuroRx is also developing NRX-100/101, the first sequential drug regimen for bipolar depression in patients with acute suicidal ideation and behavior (the “NeuroRx Antidepressant Drug Regimen”).
  
 Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the aggregate consideration payable to the stockholders of NeuroRx at the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”) will equal 50,000,000 shares (“Closing Consideration”) of the Company’s Common Stock, plus the additional contingent right to receive the Earnout Shares and Earnout Cash (each as defined below). At the Effective Time, each outstanding share of NeuroRx common stock (including shares of NeuroRx common stock resulting from the conversion of NeuroRx preferred stock immediately prior to the Effective Time) will be converted into the right to receive a pro rata portion of the Closing Consideration and the contingent right to receive a pro rata portion of the Earnout Shares and Earnout Cash. Each option and warrant of NeuroRx that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time will be assumed by the Company and will represent the right to acquire an adjusted number of shares of the Company’s Common Stock at an adjusted exercise price, in each case, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement.
  
 As part of the aggregate consideration payable to NeuroRx’s securityholders pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, NeuroRx’s securityholders (including option holders and warrant holders) who own NeuroRx securities immediately prior to the closing will have the contingent right to receive their pro rata portion of (i) an aggregate of 25,000,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock (“Earnout Shares”) if, prior to December 31, 2022, the NeuroRx COVID-19 Drug receives emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and NeuroRx submits and the FDA files for review a new drug application for the NeuroRx COVID-19 Drug (the occurrence of the foregoing, the “Earnout Shares Milestone”), and (ii) an aggregate of $100,000,000 in cash (“Earnout Cash”) upon the earlier to occur of (x) FDA approval of the NeuroRx COVID-19 Drug and the listing of the NeuroRx COVID-19 Drug in the FDA’s “Orange Book” and (y) FDA approval of the NeuroRx Antidepressant Drug Regimen and the listing of the NeuroRx Antidepressant Drug Regimen in the FDA’s “Orange Book,” in each case prior to December 31, 2022 (the occurrence of either of clauses (x) or (y), the “Earnout Cash Milestone”).
  
 Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Company will enter into an agreement (the “Sponsor Agreement”) with the Sponsor and BRAC Lending Group LLC (“BRAC”) providing that (a) the Sponsor and BRAC will forfeit, and the Company will terminate and cancel: (x) an aggregate of 875,000 shares of Common Stock and (y) one share of Common Stock for each Public Share validly redeemed by public stockholders in connection with the business combination proposal, up to a maximum of 300,000 shares of Common Stock (clauses (x) and (y), collectively, the “Forfeited Shares”), and (b) 125,000 shares of Common Stock owned by the Sponsor will be subject to escrow (the “Sponsor Earnout Shares”), which Sponsor Earnout Shares will either be released from escrow to the Sponsor upon the achievement of the Earnout Shares Milestone or terminated and canceled by the Company on December 31, 2022, in the event that the Earnout Shares Milestone is not achieved.
  
 Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Company, Sponsor, BRAC, Graubard Miller, the Initial Stockholders and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company (“Continental”) will enter into an amendment to the existing stock escrow agreement (the “Stock Escrow Amendment”) providing: (a) for the forfeiture and cancellation of the Forfeited Shares, (b) that the Sponsor Earnout Shares will be subject to escrow pursuant to the Sponsor Agreement and in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, (c) that the 40,000 shares of Common Stock held by Graubard Miller will be released from escrow and (d) that all remaining shares of Common Stock held in escrow thereunder will be released from escrow on the earlier of (i) the six-month anniversary of the closing, (ii) with respect to 50% of the shares of Common Stock, the date on which the closing price of the Common Stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing after the closing, and (iii) the date after the closing on which the Company consummates a liquidation, merger, stock exchange or other similar transaction which results in all of the Company’s stockholders having the right to exchange their Common Stock for cash, securities or other property.

 Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, to the extent the sum of the amount remaining in the trust account after disbursements to the Company’s public stockholders who seek redemption of their public shares plus the amount raised in the PIPE (described below) and any other financing exceeds $5 million, the Company’s outstanding loans will be repaid at the closing of the Merger. Further, the Company, the Sponsor and the Company’s lenders will enter into an omnibus amendment to each outstanding promissory note or other borrowing with the Company as the maker providing that, to the extent not repaid in accordance with the Merger Agreement, the outstanding principal and accrued unpaid interest pursuant to such promissory notes, after any repayments permitted pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, will be converted into convertible notes of NRX Pharmaceuticals with an aggregate principal amount of no more than approximately $2.7 million, which will bear interest at three percent (3%) per annum, and may be converted from time to time, at the holder’s option, into shares of Common Stock at a price of $10.00 per share, and which will mature on the date that is twenty-four (24) months after the date of the Merger closing. Any other borrowings not repaid or converted into convertible notes pursuant to the Merger Agreement will be forgiven or discharged prior to closing.
  
 Immediately after the closing of the Merger, NeuroRx’s stockholders will hold approximately 93% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s Common Stock, the current stockholders of the Company will hold approximately 5% of the issued and outstanding Common Stock, and the PIPE Investors will hold approximately 2% of the issued and outstanding Common Stock, which pro forma ownership (i) takes into effect the forfeiture, termination and cancellation of 875,000 shares of Common Stock by the Sponsor and BRAC pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and the issuance to EBC of 200,000 shares of Common Stock in lieu of the cash fee owed to EBC under the existing Business Combination Marketing Agreement, (ii) takes into effect the exchange of each outstanding Right for one-tenth of one share of Common Stock pursuant to the terms of the Rights, (iii) assumes no holder of Public Shares exercises its conversion rights, (iv) includes the effect of the PIPE but does not include the effect of any other financing of the Company and (v) assumes the Earnout Shares Milestone is not satisfied immediately after the Closing.
  
 Consummation of the proposed business combination is subject to customary closing conditions and covenants of the respective parties, including approval of the Company’s stockholders. Further information regarding the proposed business combination, the proposed business of the combined company following the consummation of the Merger, and the risks relating to the proposed business of the combined company can be found in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on December 14, 2020, the Registration Statement on Form S-4 filed by the Company with the SEC on January 27, 2021, and the preliminary proxy statement/prospectus/consent solicitation statement included therein, and the definitive proxy statement/prospectus/consent solicitation statement to be filed by the Company with the SEC. Unless otherwise indicated, the information in this Form 10-K assumes we will not consummate the proposed business combination with NeuroRx, will secure a further extension to consummate an initial business combination, and then seek to find an alternative target with which to consummate an initial business combination.
  
  Private Placement
  
 In connection with the Merger, on March 12, 2021, the Company entered into subscription agreements (“Subscription Agreements”) with certain qualified institutional buyers and institutional accredited investors (collectively, the “PIPE Investors”), pursuant to which the Company will, substantially concurrently with, and contingent upon, the consummation of the Merger, issue an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock to the PIPE Investors at a price of $10.00 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of $10,000,000 (the “PIPE”).
 
 The closing of the PIPE is conditioned upon, among other things, (i) the substantially concurrent consummation of the Merger, (ii) the accuracy of all representations and warranties of the Company and the PIPE Investors in the Subscription Agreements, and the performance of all covenants of the Company and the PIPE Investors under the Subscription Agreements, (iii) the shares of Common Stock shall have been approved for listing on the Nasdaq, subject to official notice of issuance, and (iv) the Merger Agreement shall not have been terminated or rescinded, and no amendment, waiver or modification shall have occurred thereunder that would materially adversely affect the economic benefits that the PIPE Investor would reasonably expect to receive under the Subscription Agreement without having received the PIPE Investor’s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed).
 
 The Company has agreed that, as soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than 45 calendar days following the closing date of the Merger, it shall file a registration statement with the SEC covering the resale by the PIPE Investors of the shares of Common Stock issued to them in the PIPE and use its best efforts to have such registration statement declared effective as promptly as practicable thereafter, but in no event later than the earlier of 60 calendar days after filing (or 90 calendar days in the event the SEC issues written comments) or the 10th business day after the Company is notified that the registration statement will not be subject to review or further review.

  Extension Amendment
  
 On December 18, 2020, the Company received stockholder approval to amend its amended and restated certificate of incorporation (“charter”) to extend the date by which it must complete an initial business combination from December 23, 2020 to April 23, 2021. No stockholders exercised their right to convert their public shares into cash in connection with the Extension.
  
 On March 22, 2021, the Company filed a preliminary proxy statement seeking approval from its stockholders to further amend its charter to extend the date by which the Company is required to complete its initial business combination.
  
  Nasdaq Compliance
  
 On November 23, 2020, the Company received a notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC stating that, as of November 20, 2020, the Company was not in compliance with Listing Rule IM-5101-2, which requires that a special purpose acquisition company complete one or more business combinations within 36 months of the effectiveness of the registration statement filed in connection with its initial public offering. Since the Company’s registration statement became effective on November 20, 2017, it was required to complete an initial business combination by no later than November 20, 2020. The Rule also provides that failure to comply with this requirement will result in the Listing Qualifications Department issuing a Staff Delisting Determination under Rule 5810 to delist the Company’s securities. The Listing Qualifications Department had advised the Company that its securities would be subject to delisting unless it timely requested a hearing before an independent Hearings Panel. The Company appealed the ruling and Nasdaq scheduled the appeal for January 14, 2021 (the “Nasdaq Appeal”). On January 4, 2021, the Company received an additional notice from Nasdaq stating that the Company’s failure to hold an annual stockholder meeting for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 by December 31, 2020, as required by Nasdaq Listing Rule 5820, could serve as an additional basis for delisting the Company’s securities from Nasdaq, the Company requested that this issue be added to the Nasdaq Appeal.
  
 On January 14, 2021, the Company attended a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel with respect to the November 23, 2020 and January 2, 2021 delisting notices. During the hearing, the Company requested an extension through May 24, 2021 to regain compliance with the Nasdaq listing rules. On January 15, 2021, the Company received notice from Nasdaq that Nasdaq had granted the Company’s request to continue its listing on Nasdaq through May 24, 2021 (“Extended Date”). Nasdaq’s decision is subject to certain conditions, including that the Company will have completed the Merger with NeuroRx on or before the Extended Date and that NRX Pharmaceuticals will have demonstrated compliance with all requirements for initial listing on Nasdaq.
  
  Effecting a Business Combination
  
  General
  
 We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any substantive commercial business until after the consummation of our initial business combination. We currently have until April 23, 2021 to consummate our initial business combination. Our board has determined that there may not be enough time to consummate the proposed business combination with NeuroRx by April 23, 2021 and, accordingly, we have filed a proxy statement to solicit shareholder approval to extend the liquidation date to May 24, 2021. If we are unable to consummate our initial business combination within the applicable time period, we will, as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account and as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.
Our Acquisition Process
  
 We have evaluated a number of target businesses, including NeuroRx. When evaluating each prospective target business, we conducted a thorough due diligence review that encompassed, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, and a review of financial and other information that made available to us.
  
 We have engaged a professional firm that specializes in business acquisitions, and we may engage other firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. In no event, however, will our Sponsor, officers, directors or their respective affiliates be paid any finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate the consummation of an initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is) other than the monthly administrative services fee of up to $10,000 (effective through August 20, 2018), the repayment of loans from our Sponsor, officers and directors for working capital purposes and reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses, however such repayment and reimbursement may be limited in connection with our negotiations with a prospective target. We are not restricted from entering into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated with any of our officers, directors or Sponsor and may do so if (i) such transaction is approved by a majority of our disinterested independent directors and (ii) we obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we are seeking to acquire, that the business combination is fair to our unaffiliated stockholders from a financial point of view.

  Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of a Business Combination
  
 Subject to our officers’ and directors’ pre-existing fiduciary duties and the limitations that a target business have a fair market value of at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (excluding taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, as described below in more detail, and that we must acquire a controlling interest in the target business, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective target business. We have not established any specific attributes or criteria (financial or otherwise) for prospective target businesses. In evaluating a prospective target business, our management may consider a variety of factors, including one or more of the following:
  
   ●
 financial condition and results of operation;

   ●
 growth potential;

   ●
 brand recognition and potential;

   ●
 experience and skill of management and availability of additional personnel;

   ●
 capital requirements;

   ●
 competitive position;

   ●
 barriers to entry;

   ●
 stage of development of the products, processes or services;

   ●
 existing distribution and potential for expansion;

   ●
 degree of current or potential market acceptance of the products, processes or services

   ●
 proprietary aspects of products and the extent of intellectual property or other protection for products or formulas;

   ●
 impact of regulation on the business;

   ●
 regulatory environment of the industry;

   ●
 costs associated with effecting the business combination;

   ●
 industry leadership, sustainability of market share and attractiveness of market industries in which a target business participates; and

   ●
 macro competitive dynamics in the industry within which the company competes.

 
 These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular business combination will be based, to the extent relevant, on the above factors as well as other considerations deemed relevant by our management in effecting a business combination consistent with our business objective. In evaluating a prospective target business, we will conduct an extensive due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and inspection of facilities, as well as review of financial and other information which is made available to us. This due diligence review will be conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage.
  
 The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete the business combination can only be estimated at this time. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us and reduce the amount of capital available to otherwise complete a business combination.

  Fair Market Value of Target Business
  
 Nasdaq rules require that a target business or businesses that we acquire must collectively have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance of the funds in the trust account (excluding taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, although we may acquire a target business whose fair market value significantly exceeds 80% of the trust account balance.
  
 We are permitted to structure a business combination to acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses or to structure our initial business combination where we merge directly with the target business or where we acquire less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we could acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target; however, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of trust account balance test. In order to consummate such an acquisition, we may issue a significant amount of our debt or equity securities to the sellers of such businesses and/or seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities. Since we have no specific business combination under consideration, we have not entered into any such fund raising arrangement and have no current intention of doing so. The fair market value of the target will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). The proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents used by us in connection with any proposed transaction will provide public stockholders with our analysis of the fair market value of the target business, as well as the basis for our determinations. If our board is not able to independently determine that the target business has a sufficient fair market value, we will obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated, independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we are seeking to acquire, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria.
  
  We will not be required to obtain an opinion from an investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions, as to the fair market value if our board of directors independently determines that the target business complies with the 80% threshold.
  
  Lack of Business Diversification
  
 For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the performance of a single business.
  
 Unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations of entities operating in multiple industries or multiple areas of a single industry, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses. By consummating a business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:
  
   ●
 subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to a business combination, and

   ●
 result in our dependency upon the performance of a single operating business or the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services.

  Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target Business’s Management
  
 Although we have scrutinized the management of NeuroRx, we cannot assure you that our assessment of the target business’s management will prove to be correct. In addition, we cannot assure you that the future management will have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, our officers and directors are not expected to have any future role with NeuroRx following completion of the contemplated Merger. In the event that we do not complete a business combination with NeuroRx and instead seek an alternative business combination target, the future role of our officers and directors, if any, in the target business following a business combination cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that some of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with us following a business combination, it is possible that they will not devote their full time efforts to our affairs subsequent to a business combination. Moreover, they would only be able to remain with the company after the consummation of a business combination if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements in connection with the business combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the business combination and will likely provide for them to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services they would render to the company after the consummation of the business combination. While the personal and financial interests of our key personnel may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business, their ability to remain with the company after the consummation of a business combination will not be the determining factor in our decision as to whether or not we will proceed with any potential business combination. Additionally, we cannot assure you that our officers and directors will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.
  
 Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that any such additional managers we do recruit will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.
  
    Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve an Initial Business Combination
  
 In connection with any proposed business combination, we will either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein. If we determine to engage in a tender offer, such tender offer will be structured so that each stockholder may tender any or all of his, her or its shares rather than some pro rata portion of his, her or its shares. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek stockholder approval. Unlike other blank check companies which require stockholder votes and conduct proxy solicitations in conjunction with their initial business combinations and related conversions of public shares for cash upon consummation of such initial business combination even when a vote is not required by law, we will have the flexibility to avoid such stockholder vote and allow our stockholders to sell their shares pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act which regulate issuer tender offers. In that case, we will file tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules. We will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination.
  
 We chose our net tangible asset threshold of $5,000,001 to ensure that we would avoid being subject to Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. However, if we seek to consummate an initial business combination with a target business that imposes any type of working capital closing condition or requires us to have a minimum amount of funds available from the trust account upon consummation of such initial business combination, we may need to have more than $5,000,001 in net tangible assets upon consummation and this may force us to seek third party financing which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. As a result, we may not be able to consummate such initial business combination and we may not be able to locate another suitable target within the applicable time period, if at all.
  
 Our Sponsor, officers, directors and BRAC (as defined below) have agreed (1) to vote any shares of common stock owned by them in favor of any proposed business combination, including the founder’s shares, (2) not to convert any shares of common stock in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination and (3) not sell any shares of common stock in any tender in connection with a proposed initial business combination.
  
 None of our officers, directors, Sponsor or their affiliates has indicated any intention to purchase units or shares of common stock from persons in the open market or in private transactions. However, if we hold a meeting to approve a proposed business combination and a significant number of stockholders vote, or indicate an intention to vote, against such proposed business combination, our officers, directors, Sponsor or their affiliates could make such purchases in the open market or in private transactions in order to influence the vote. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our officers, directors, Sponsor and their affiliates will not make purchases of shares of common stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act, which are rules designed to stop potential manipulation of a company’s stock.

  Conversion Rights
  
 At any meeting called to approve an initial business combination, public stockholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, less any taxes then due but not yet paid (which taxes may be paid only from the interest earned on the funds in the trust account). Alternatively, we may provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares of our common stock to us through a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, less any taxes then due but not yet paid.
  
 We may require public stockholders seeking conversion, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in “street name,” to either (i) physically tender their certificates to our transfer agent or (ii) deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option, in each case prior to a date set forth in the proxy materials sent in connection with the proposal to approve the business combination.
  
 There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced delivery process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a nominal fee and it would be up to the broker whether to pass this cost on to the holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether we require holders seeking to exercise conversion rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising conversion rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. However, in the event we require stockholders seeking to exercise conversion rights to deliver their shares prior to the consummation of the proposed business combination and the proposed business combination is not consummated, this may result in an increased cost to stockholders.
  
 Any proxy solicitation materials we furnish to stockholders in connection with a vote for any proposed business combination will indicate whether we are requiring stockholders to satisfy such certification and delivery requirements. Accordingly, a stockholder will have from the time the stockholder received our proxy statement up until the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination to deliver his shares if he wishes to seek to exercise his conversion rights. This time period varies depending on the specific facts of each transaction. However, as the delivery process can be accomplished by the stockholder, whether or not he is a record holder or his shares are held in “street name,” in a matter of hours by simply contacting the transfer agent or his broker and requesting delivery of his shares through the DWAC System, we believe this time period is sufficient for an average investor. However, we cannot assure you of this fact. Please see the risk factor titled “In connection with any stockholder meeting called to approve a proposed initial business combination, we may require stockholders who wish to convert their shares in connection with a proposed business combination to comply with specific requirements for conversion that may make it more difficult for them to exercise their conversion rights prior to the deadline for exercising their rights.” for further information on the risks of failing to comply with these requirements.
  
 The foregoing is different from the procedures historically used by some blank check companies. Traditionally, in order to perfect conversion rights in connection with a blank check company’s business combination, the company would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders’ vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his conversion rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him to deliver his certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an “option window” after the consummation of the business combination during which he could monitor the price of the company’s stock in the market. If the price rose above the conversion price, he could sell his shares in the open market before actually delivering his shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the conversion rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would become a “continuing” right surviving past the consummation of the business combination until the holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a holder’s election to convert his shares is irrevocable once the business combination is approved.
  
 Any request to convert such shares once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the proposed business combination. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share of common stock delivered his certificate in connection with an election of their conversion and subsequently decides prior to the vote on the proposed business combination not to elect to exercise such rights, he may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically).
  
 If the initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their conversion rights would not be entitled to convert their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination. In such case, we will promptly return any shares delivered by public holders.

  Extensions to Complete Business Combination
  
 Our charter originally provided that we would have until November 22, 2018 to complete our initial business combination. On each of November 20, 2018, February 22, 2019, May 21, 2019, August 21, 2019, November 21, 2019, March 23, 2020, July 23, 2020, and December 18, 2020, our stockholders approved an amendment to our charter extending the amount of time that we have to consummate an initial business combination. As a result, our charter, as amended, currently provides that it will have until April 23, 2021 to complete a business combination. In connection with these amendments, we offered public stockholders the right to have their Public Shares converted into a pro rata portion of the trust account and holders of Public Shares representing approximately $63 million originally held in the trust account exercised such conversion rights. Accordingly, as of the date of this Form 10-K, the Company has approximately $6.0 million of cash in the trust account.
  
 We have received loans from affiliates of ours in connection with such amendments.
  
 On November 17, 2018, we entered into an agreement (the “Extension Funding Agreement”) with the Sponsor and BRAC. Pursuant to the Extension Funding Agreement, the Sponsor transferred an aggregate of 1,500,000 founder’s shares to BRAC in exchange for the agreements set forth below and aggregate cash consideration of $1.00. The Founder’s Shares transferred by the Sponsor to BRAC will remain in escrow in the name of BRAC, subject to the terms of the Stock Escrow Agreement, dated November 20, 2017, among us, the Sponsor and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company. Additionally, the Sponsor assigned the registration rights it was granted, pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, dated November 20, 2017 between us and the Sponsor, with respect to the Founder’s Shares to BRAC in connection with the transfer. Pursuant to the Extension Funding Agreement, the Sponsor agreed to take all actions reasonably necessary to extend the period of time the Company has to consummate a business combination up to two times for an aggregate of up to six months and BRAC agreed to loan us the funds necessary to obtain the extensions. BRAC loaned us an aggregate of $1,380,000 to obtain such extensions, which loans are evidenced by promissory notes. Further, pursuant to the Extension Funding Agreement, BRAC has also agreed to loan us all funds necessary to pay expenses incurred in connection with and in order to consummate a business combination (the “Business Combination Expenses”) and such loans will be added to the notes. Also, pursuant to the Extension Funding Agreement, the Sponsor has agreed to be responsible for all liabilities of the Company as of November 17, 2018, except for liabilities associated with the possible redemption of shares by the Company’s shareholders, as described in the charter.
  
 The Sponsor has also agreed to loan us the funds necessary to pay the expenses of the Company other than the Business Combination Expenses through the closing of a business combination when and as needed in order for the Company to continue in operation (the “Non-Business Combination Related Expenses”). Upon consummation of a business combination, up to $200,000 of the Non-Business Combination Related Expenses will be repaid by us to the Sponsor provided that the Company has funds available to it sufficient to repay such expenses (the “Cap”) as well as to pay for all stockholder redemptions, all Business Combination Expenses, repayment of the notes, and any funds necessary for the working capital requirements of the Company following closing of the business combination. Any remaining amounts in excess of the Cap will be forgiven. If the Company does not consummate a business combination, all outstanding loans made by the Sponsor to cover the Non-Business Combination Related Expenses will be forgiven. As of December 31, 2020, A/Z Property has loaned us an aggregate of approximately $862,148 in order to pay our Non-Business Combination Related Expenses and extension payments. We repaid $35,000 of such loans during the year ended December 31, 2020.
  
 As of December 31, 2020, BRAC has loaned us an aggregate of approximately $1,809,889 in order to fund extension payments and other expenses.
  
 On March 22, 2021, the Company filed a preliminary proxy statement seeking approval from its stockholders to further amend its charter to extend the date by which the Company is required to complete its initial business combination.

  Liquidation if No Business Combination
  
 If we have not completed an initial business combination by April 23, 2021, or such later date as may be approved by our stockholders through approval of an amendment to our charter, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account net of interest that may be used by us to pay our franchise and income taxes payable, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.
  
 Our Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would restrict our public stockholders from converting or selling their shares to us in connection with a business combination or affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete a business combination by April 23, 2021 unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to convert their shares of common stock upon such approval at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest not previously released to us but net of franchise and income taxes payable, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our Sponsor, any executive officer, director or director nominee, or any other person.
  
 Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our outstanding public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period may be considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the Delaware General Corporation Law intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution.
  
 Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period is not considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidation distribution. If we are unable to complete a business combination within the prescribed time frame, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account net of interest that may be used by us to pay our franchise and income taxes payable, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following the required time period to complete our initial business combination, and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.
  
 Because we will not be complying with Section 280 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, Section 281(b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent ten years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses.
  
  
11


 
 
 We are required to use our reasonable best efforts to have all third parties and any prospective target businesses enter into agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account. As a result, the claims that could be made against us will be limited, thereby lessening the likelihood that any claim would result in any liability extending to the trust. We therefore believe that any necessary provision for creditors will be reduced and should not have a significant impact on our ability to distribute the funds in the trust account to our public stockholders. Nevertheless, we cannot assure you of this fact as there is no guarantee that vendors, service providers and prospective target businesses will execute such agreements. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. Our underwriters and auditor are the only third parties we are currently aware of that may not execute a waiver. Nor is there any guarantee that, even if they execute such agreements with us, they will not seek recourse against the trust account. A/Z Property, an entity majority owned by Richard Ackerman, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, has agreed that it will be liable to ensure that the proceeds in the trust account are not reduced below $10.00 per share by the claims of target businesses or claims of vendors or other entities that are owed money by us for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to us. We believe A/Z Property has sufficient net worth to satisfy its indemnity obligation should it arise, however we cannot assure you that A/Z Property will have sufficient liquid assets to satisfy such obligations if it is required to do so. Additionally, the agreement entered into by A/Z Property specifically provides for two exceptions to the indemnity it has given: it will have no liability (1) as to any claimed amounts owed to a target business or vendor or other entity who has executed an agreement with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account, or (2) as to any claims for indemnification by the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. As a result, if we liquidate, the per-share distribution from the trust account could be less than $10.00 due to claims or potential claims of creditors. We will distribute to all of our public stockholders, in proportion to their respective equity interests, an aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account net of interest that may be used by us to pay our franchise and income taxes payable.
  
 We anticipate notifying the trustee of the trust account to begin liquidating such assets promptly after such date and anticipate it will take no more than 10 business days to effect such a distribution. Our Sponsor has waived its rights to participate in any liquidation distribution with respect to the founder’s shares and any shares, rights or warrants included in the private placement units. Additionally, any loans made by our officers, directors, Sponsors or their affiliates for working capital needs will be forgiven and not repaid if we are unable to complete an initial business combination. There will be no distribution from the trust account with respect to our rights or warrants, including the rights or warrants contained in the private placement units, which will expire worthless. We will pay the costs of any subsequent liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account. If such funds are insufficient, A/Z Property has agreed to pay the funds necessary to complete such liquidation (currently anticipated to be no more than approximately $15,000) and has agreed not to seek repayment for such expenses.
  
 If we are unable to complete an initial business combination and expend all of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the private placement units, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the initial per-share redemption price would be $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to claims of our creditors that are in preference to the claims of public stockholders.
  
 Our public stockholders shall be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only in the event of our failure to complete a business combination within the required time period or if the stockholders seek to have us convert or purchase their respective shares upon a business combination which is actually completed by us or upon certain amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation as described elsewhere herein. In no other circumstances shall a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.
  
 If we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return to our public stockholders at least $10.00 per share.
  
 If we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, because we intend to distribute the proceeds held in the trust account to our public stockholders promptly after the expiration of the time we have to complete an initial business combination, this may be viewed or interpreted as giving preference to our public stockholders over any potential creditors with respect to access to or distributions from our assets. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.

  Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
  
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains certain requirements and restrictions that will apply to us until the consummation of our initial business combination. These provisions cannot be amended without the approval of a majority of our stockholders. If we seek to amend any provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would restrict our public stockholders from converting or selling their shares to us in connection with a business combination or affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete a business combination by April 23, 2021 (or such later date as may be approved by our stockholders), we will provide public stockholders with the opportunity to convert their public shares in connection with any such vote. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our Sponsor, any executive officer, director or director nominee, or any other person. Our Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to waive any conversion rights with respect to any founder’s shares and any public shares they may hold in connection with any vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Specifically, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, among other things, that:
  
   ●
 we shall either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein;

   ●
 we will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination;

   ●
 if our initial business combination is not consummated by April 23, 2021, and such date is not further extended, then we will redeem all of the outstanding public shares and thereafter liquidate and dissolve our company;

   ●
 we may not consummate any other business combination, merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar transaction prior to our initial business combination; and

   ●
 prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional stock that participates in any manner in the proceeds of the trust account, or that votes as a class with the common stock sold in this offering on any matter.

 
  Competition
  
 In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we have encountered and may continue to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors.
  
 The following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses:
  
   ●
 our obligation to seek stockholder approval of a business combination or engage in a tender offer may delay the completion of a transaction;

   ●
 our obligation to convert or repurchase shares of common stock held by our public stockholders may reduce the resources available to us for a business combination; and

   ●
 our outstanding rights or warrants and unit purchase options, and the potential future dilution they represent.

 
 Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. Our management believes, however, that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately-held entities having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms.
  
 In recent years, and especially since the fourth quarter of 2020, the number of special purpose acquisition companies that have been formed has increased substantially. Many potential targets for special purpose acquisition companies have already entered into an initial business combination, and there are still many special purpose acquisition companies seeking targets for their initial business combination, as well as many such companies currently in registration. As a result, at times, fewer attractive targets may be available, and it may require more time, more effort and more resources to identify a suitable target and to consummate an initial business combination.
  
 If we succeed in effecting a business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the resources or ability to compete effectively.

  Employees
  
 We have two executive officers who receive no compensation from the Company. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. We do not have, and do not intend to have, any employees prior to the consummation of a business combination.
