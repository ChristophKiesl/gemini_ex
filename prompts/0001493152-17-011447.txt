ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Our Company
 
Boxlight Parent was incorporated in Nevada on September 18, 2014 for the purpose of becoming a technology company that sells interactive educational products.
 
Effective April 1, 2016, Boxlight Corporation acquired Mimio LLC. Mimio designs, produces and distributes the broadest range of Interactive Classroom Technology products primarily targeted at the global K-12 education market. Mimio’s core products include interactive projectors, interactive flat panel displays, interactive touch projectors, touchboards and MimioTeach, which can turn any whiteboard interactive in 30 seconds. Mimio’s product line also includes an accessory document camera, teacher pad for remote control and an assessment system. Mimio was founded on July 11, 2013 and maintains its headquarter in Boston, Massachusetts. Manufacturing is by ODM’s and OEM’s in Taiwan and China. Mimio products have been deployed in over 600,000 classrooms in dozens of countries. Mimio’s software is provided in over 30 languages.
 
Effective July 18, 2016, Boxlight Corporation acquired the Boxlight Group. The Boxlight Group sells and distributes a suite of patented, award-winning interactive projectors that offer a wide variety of features and specifications to suit the varying needs of instructors, teachers and presenters. With an interactive projector, any wall, whiteboard or other flat surface becomes interactive. A teacher, moderator or student can use the included pens or fingers as a mouse to write or draw images displayed on the surface. As with interactive whiteboards, interactive projectors accommodate multiple users simultaneously. Images that have been created through the projected interactive surface can be saved as computer files. The Boxlight Group’s new ProjectoWrite 12 series, launched in February 2016, allows the simultaneous use of up to ten simultaneous points of touch.
 
Combined, we are a leading technology company that focuses on the education and learning industry. We improve, produce and distribute products currently offered by Mimio, the Boxlight Group and Genesis, including interactive projectors, 70” and 84” hi-resolution interactive LED panels, and science, technology, engineering and math (“STEM”) data logging products, and develop new products utilizing a combination of technologies of the Boxlight Group and Mimio. The combined operation will integrate significant research and development, international manufacturing capabilities, and an established global reseller network. Our goal is to become a single source, world-leading innovator, manufacturer and integrator of interactive products for schools and universities, as well as for training and instruction for business and governmental agencies.
 
Integration Strategy
 
We have already taken substantial steps towards centralizing our business management through an enterprise resource planning system currently utilized by Boxlight Inc. that offers multi-language and multi-currency. We have streamlined the process to drive front-line sales forecasting to factory production. Through the enterprise resource planning system, we have synchronized five separate accounting and customer relationship management systems through a cloud-based interface to improve inter-company information sharing and allow management at BOXL to have immediate access to snapshots of the performance of all of our subsidiaries, their financial data and live currency impact on our combined financial results.
Research and Development
 
Our products are designed to enhance learning experiences in schools, government and business by bringing life to lessons, using interactive educational tools. Research suggests that interactive presentation tools can positively affect student engagement, motivation, understanding and review processes and accommodate students with different learning styles, including students who have special needs. A study in 100 classrooms per year conducted by Dr. Robert Marzano, a top United States researcher in the field of education, concluded that students who had been taught using interactive whiteboards and interactive devices improved their test scores on average by 16 percentile over a two-year period.
Logistics and Manufacturing
 
Logistics of the Company is currently provided by our Lawrenceville, Georgia facility. Manufacturing for Mimio’s products is by ODM’s and OEM’s in Taiwan and China.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Sales and marketing for Mimio and the Boxlight Group were combined on March 31, 2016. Our combined sales force has eleven regional account managers in the US, nine in Mexico, one Vice President of Sales and one National Sales Manager. Within nine months of our initial public offering we intend to expand the scope of our combined sales force by adding five additional sales persons, primarily to drive sales of interactive projectors and data logging products to school districts, corporations and governmental agencies throughout the United States and Europe, and sales of all of our products in Africa, Latin America and Asia. In addition, we will utilize traditional value-added resellers through Genesis and support them to become knowledgeable of the products, vendors and suppliers of the combined entity. Our combined companies currently have approximately 800 resellers.


We believe that the combined operation will represent a unique vertically integrated interactive-technology company capable of developing and improving products, manufacturing and distribution, and service and support to customers.

Our Markets
 
The global education industry is undergoing a significant transition, as primary and secondary school districts, colleges and universities, as well as governments, corporations and individuals around the world are increasingly recognizing the importance of using technology to more effectively provide information to educate students and other users.
 
“Smart education” denotes a range of technologies employed to enhance the delivery and administration of education across various segments such as K-12, higher education, enterprise, government and healthcare. This market is broadly segmented by four major parameters; namely, product type, application type, e-learning modes, and geography.
 
According to “All Global Market Education & Learning”, an industry publication, the market for hardware products is growing due to increases in the use of interactive white boards and simulation-based learning hardware. Education institutions have become more receptive to the implementation of hi-tech learning tools. The advent of technology in the classroom has enabled multi-modal training and varying curricula. In general, technology based tools help develop student performance when integrated with curriculum. The constant progression of technology in education has helped educators to create classroom experiences that are interactive, developed and collaborative.
 
According to market research report “Smart Education and Learning Market: Advanced Technologies, Digital Models, Adoption Trends and Worldwide Market Forecast (2012-2017),” the global smart education and learning market is expected to reach $220.0 billion by 2017 at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20.3% from 2012 to 2017. The market for education and learning software is estimated to reach $37.2 billion, and hardware is estimated to reach $12.1 billion, by 2017. In 2011, North America accounted for about 60% of global revenue and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 15.2% from 2012 to 2017.
 
In the United States, which will be our primary market upon consummation of our initial public offering where we will sell and distribute interactive educational products for K-12 to both public and private schools, the K-12 education sector represents one of the largest industry segments.
 
In addition to its size, the U.S. K-12 education market is highly decentralized and is characterized by complex content adoption processes. The sector is comprised of approximately 15,600 public school districts across the 50 states and 132,000 public and private elementary and secondary schools. We believe this market structure underscores the importance of scale and industry relationships and the need for broad, diverse coverage across states, districts and schools. Even while we believe certain initiatives in the education sector, such as the Common Core State Standards, a set of shared math and literacy standards benchmarked to international standards, have increased standardization in K-12 education content, we believe significant state standard specific customization still exists, and we believe the need to address customization provides an ongoing need for companies in the sector to maintain relationships with individual state and district policymakers and expertise in state-varying academic standards.
 
U.S. K-12 education has come under significant political scrutiny in recent years, due to the recognition of its importance to U.S. society at large and concern over the perceived decline in U.S. student competitiveness relative to international peers. An independent task force report published in March 2012 by the Council on Foreign Relations, a non-partisan membership organization and think tank, observed that American students rank far behind global leaders in international tests of literacy, math and science, concluding that the current state of U.S. education severely impairs the United States’ economic, military and diplomatic security as well as broader components of America’s global leadership. Also, the Executive Office of the President Council of Economic Advisors, in a report titled Unleashing the Potential of Educational Technology, stated that “many observers are concerned about declines in the relative quality of U.S. primary and secondary education, and improving performance of our schools has become a national priority.” We believe that the customization of learning programs could enhance innovative and growth strategies geared towards student performance in our nation’s schools.
 
Higher education is a large and well-established market, both in the United States and worldwide. In the United States alone, total revenue for all degree-granting postsecondary institutions was over $550 billion for the 2010-2011 academic year, according to a May 2013 report by the U.S. National Center for Education Statistics. The decade between 2000 and 2010 saw a 37% increase in enrollment in postsecondary degree granting institutions in the United States, from 15.3 million to 21.0 million, according to the U.S. Department of Education, and that number is expected to rise to 23.8 million by 2021, a further increase of 13%.
 
According to a November 2013 study by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, total global spending on the business and government e-learning market was $25.5 billion in 2012 and is expected to reach $32.1 billion by 2015 and $37.5 billion by 2017; an 8% CAGR between 2012 and 2017.

Our Opportunity
 
We believe that the existing patented product portfolios of Mimio and the Boxlight Group and software and products we intend to develop either alone or in collaboration with other technology companies positions us to be a leading manufacturer and provider of interactive educational products in the global educational and learning market. We believe that increased consumer spending driven by the close connection between levels of educational attainment, evolving standards in curriculum, personal career prospects and economic growth will increase the demand for our interactive educational products. Some of the factors that we believe will impact our opportunity include:
 
Growth in U.S. K-12 Market Expenditures
 
Significant resources are being devoted to primary and secondary education, both in the United States and abroad. As set forth in the Executive Office of the President, Council of Economic Advisers report, U.S. education expenditure has been estimated at approximately $1.3 trillion, with K-12 education accounting for close to half ($625 billion) of this spending. Global spending is roughly triple U.S. spending for K-12 education.
 
While the market has historically grown above the pace of inflation, averaging 7.2% growth annually since 1969, as expenditures by school districts and educational institutions are largely dependent upon state and local funding, the recent world-wide economic recession caused many states and school districts to defer spending on educational materials, which materially and adversely affected our historical revenues as well as those of many of our competitors. However, expenditures and growth in the U.S. K-12 market for educational content and services now appears to be rebounding in the wake of the U.S. economic recovery. Although, the economic recovery has been slower than anticipated, and there is no assurance that any further improvement will be significant, nonetheless, states such as Florida, California and Texas are all scheduled to adopt interactive educational materials for certain subjects, including reading and math, by 2016.
 
The NCES forecasts that the current expenditures in the U.S. K-12 market are expected to grow to approximately $665 billion by 2022. The instructional supplies and services market, which uses the types of educational materials and services that we will offer, represents approximately 4.8% of this expected market, or approximately $32 billion of these expenditures. There is no guarantee that spending will increase by the amount forecasted and, if it does, there is no guarantee that our sales will increase accordingly.
 
International Catalysts Driving Adoption of Learning Technology
 
According to Ambient Insights 2012 Snapshot of the Worldwide and US Academic Digital Learning Market, substantial growth in revenues for e-learning products in the academic market segment are anticipated throughout the world due to several convergent catalysts, including population demographics such as significant growth in numbers of 15-17 year old students and women in education in emerging markets; government-funded education policies mandating country-wide deployment of digital learning infrastructures; large scale digitization efforts in government and academic markets; significant increases in the amount of digital learning content; migration to digital formats by major educational publishers and content providers; mass purchases of personal learning devices and strong demand for learning platforms, content and technology services; and rapid growth of part-time and fulltime online student enrollments.

Rising Global Demand
 
We expect to profit from the rising global demand for technology based learning products by offering our interactive product hardware and software in the United States and expanding into foreign countries. In recent years, the global education sector has seen movement towards the adoption of interactive learning devices. As examples:

● | In 2010, the Peruvian government spent $3.0 billion for an education technology rollout to provide all teachers and students with individual tablet computers and network infrastructure and classroom displays; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | In August 2011, the Russian government announced a plan to deploy tablets, “on a massive scale” in the Russian educational system, to replace printed textbooks; 
● | In October 2011, the Indian government launched its heavily subsidized school-designed tablet called Aakash; and 
● | In July 2011, the Thailand government announced that it intends to give every child in grades 1-6 a tablet starting with first grade students in the 2012 school year. The multi-year program is expected to equip over 5.0 million primary students with handheld devices. 

 
Trends in Tech-Savvy Education
 
While industries from manufacturing to health care have adopted technology to improve their results, according to Stanford Business School, in its Trends in Tech-Savvy Education, the education field remains heavily reliant on “chalk and talk” instruction conducted in traditional settings; however, that is changing as schools and colleges adopt virtual classrooms, data analysis, online games, highly customized coursework, and other cutting-edge tools to help students learn.
 
Demand for Interactive Projectors is on the Rise
 
As a complete system, interactive projectors are considerably less expensive than interactive whiteboards or interactive flat panel displays, placing them at a distinct advantage in price sensitive markets. According to FutureSource, an industry publication, sales of interactive projectors are expected to grow steadily from 2014 to 2017 with a CAGR at 10.3% world-wide.
 
Additional Technologies
 
The delivery of digital education content is also driving a substantial shift in the education market. In addition to white boards, interactive projectors and interactive flat panels, other technologies are being adapted for educational uses on the Internet, mobile devices and through cloud-computing, which permits the sharing of digital files and programs among multiple computers or other devices at the same time through a virtual network. We intend to be a leader in the development and implementation of these additional technologies to create effective digital learning environments.
Handheld Device Adoption
 
Handheld devices, including smartphones, tablets, e-readers and digital video technologies, are now fundamental to the way students communicate. A 2010 FCC survey provides evidence that the rates of handheld use will increase dramatically. It reported that while 50% of respondents currently use handhelds for administrative purposes, 14% of schools and 24% of districts use such devices for academic or educational purposes. Furthermore, 45% of respondents plan to start using such devices for academic and educational purposes within the next 2 to 3 years. The survey stated that, “The use of digital video technologies to support curriculum is becoming increasingly popular as a way to improve student engagement.”

Natural User Interfaces (NUIs)
 
Tablets and the new class of “smart TVs” are part of a growing list of other devices built with natural user interfaces that accept input in the form of taps, swipes, and other ways of touching; hand and arm motions; body movement; and increasingly, natural language. Natural user interfaces allow users to engage in virtual activities with movements similar to what they would use in the real world, manipulating content intuitively. The idea of being able to have a completely natural interaction with a device is not new, but neither has its full potential been realized. For example, medical students increasingly rely on simulators employing natural user interfaces to practice precise manipulations, such as catheter insertions, that would be far less productive if they had to try to simulate sensitive movements with a mouse and keyboard. NUIs make devices seem easier to use and more accessible, and interactions are far more intuitive, which promotes exploration and engagement. (NMC Horizon Project Technology Outlook STEM+ Education 2012-2017).
The Business and Government Market
 
The business and government market for interactive displays represents an attractive growth opportunity for us because of the desire of organizations to improve the quality of training, development and collaboration.
 
In meeting rooms, our solutions help achieve the following:
 

● | Enhance brainstorming and collaboration by providing a real-time focal point upon which participants can share their ideas with the entire group of attendees, including those in remote locations; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Add a tangible, interactive dimension to conferencing that enables attendees to visualize a situation or concept and make decisions based on that visualization; 
● | Save time and enhance productivity by enabling users to save and distribute their collective work product from a meeting without the inconsistencies and subjectivity that may result from individual note taking; 
● | Realize cost savings not only by reducing travel needs, but also by improving internal communication and team building; and 
● | Enable participants to access digital files and use applications in real time. 

 
In training centers, we believe that our solutions help to enhance achievement levels with multi-modality (visual, auditory and kinesthetic) learning capabilities, improved interactivity and engagement and real time assessment and feedback. Our solutions may also help improve an enterprise’s return on investment by providing better trained employees reducing training time and getting employees back to their jobs, reduced travel expenses, improved customers service from well-trained employees and reduced employee turnover.
 
Competition
 
We are engaged in the interactive education industry. The combined operation will face substantial competition from developers, manufacturers and distributers of interactive learning products and solutions. The industry is highly competitive and characterized by frequent product introductions and rapid technological advances that have substantially increased the capabilities and use of interactive projectors and interactive whiteboards. We will face increased competition from companies with strong positions in certain markets we serve, and in new markets and regions we may enter. These companies manufacture and/or distribute new, disruptive or substitute products that compete for the pool of available funds that previously could have been spent on interactive displays and associated products. Our ability to integrate our technologies after the combination and remain innovative and develop new technologies desired by our current and potential new contract manufacturing customers will determine our ability to grow our contract manufacturing divisions.
Mimio’s Current Products
 
MimioStudio Interactive Instructional Software
 
MimioStudio Instructional Software enables the creation, editing, and presentation of interactive instructional lessons and activities. These can be presented and managed from the front of the classroom using any of Mimio’s display systems including MimioTeach + MimioProjector, MimioDisplay, MimioBoard Touch + MimioProjector, or MimioProjector Interactive in either pen or touch controlled versions. MimioStudio can also be operated using MimioPad as a full-featured remote control or a mobile device such as an iPad or tablet which includes a display screen that fully replicates the front-of-classroom display generated by MimioStudio. Operation with a mobile device is enabled via the three-user license for MimioMobile, see next, provided with the MimioStudio license that accompanies all front-of-classroom devices from Mimio.
 
MimioMobile Collaboration and Assessment Application
 
The introduction of MimioMobile, a software accessory for MimioStudio, in 2014 introduced a new era of fully interactive student activities that are able to be directly and immediately displayed on the front-of-classroom display through MimioStudio.
 
MimioMobile allows fully interactive activities to be pushed to student classroom devices. The students can manipulate objects within the activities, annotate “on top” of them, and even create completely new content on their own handheld devices. MimioMobile also enables assessment using the mobile devices. The teacher can create multiple choice, true\false, yes\no, and text entry assessment questions. The students can respond at their own speed and their answers are stored within MimioStudio from which the teacher can display graphs showing student results. This “continuous assessment” allows formative assessment that can help guide the teacher as to whether to re-teach the material if understanding is low or move forward in the lesson. We believe that this interactive and student dependent instructional model can dramatically enhance student outcomes.

Our driver comes in various versions depending on the model of interactive projector purchased. If used with Windows7 and above, users have the ability to toggle between ‘mouse’ and ‘touch’ mode. Mouse mode allows users to operate the mouse at the interactive screen like a traditional mouse. Touch mode will allow for up to 5 pens/users to interact on the touch screen surface. The latest TouchDriver on the ProjectorWrite 10 recognizes fingers (or nearly any other solid object) at the projection surface and will allow for up to 10 points of interactivity.
 
Our LightPen 5 software allows users to annotate in multiple colors and formats with our interactive projectors and is one of several annotation packages offered. Our SPDriver must be connected to a Boxlight Group interactive projector to function. The LightPen software defaults to overlay mode and allows the user to annotate over almost every program and image on the computer, including static images and/or full motion video. The tool bar is easily accessible and can be moved around the interactive screen for easy access and includes three default pen colors and a highlighter.

Pen line thickness and color can be changed, multi-user whiteboard mode allows for up to 5 points of interaction at a time, and a multi-page feature allows for extended note-taking. With included quick tools, such as on-screen keyboard quick tool, power point presentation mode, curtain reveal, and spot light modes, presenters’ needs are met at the tip of a pen or finger.
 
To date, all of the Boxlight Group’s software solutions are included with the purchase of its interactive products. However, approximately 15% of the Boxlight Group employees are engaged in software development. Subject to completion of our initial public offering and access to adequate liquidity, we intend to offer LightPen and other software products for sale directly to businesses and government agencies for use in learning applications and virtual remote desktop connectivity.

Boxlight Group Supplier
 
At the present time, the Company and its subsidiaries do not produce or manufacture any of their products. Most of the products sold and distributed by the Boxlight Group are manufactured by and purchased from Everest Display Technologies, Inc., a Taiwan corporation (“EDI”) and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. On July 18, 2016, Boxlight Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Boxlight Parent acquired 100% of the equity of the Boxlight Group from EDI, and EDI and/or its subsidiary received shares of Series C preferred stock. Such Series C preferred stock will automatically convert into 22.221% of our fully-diluted common stock as defined in the purchase agreement upon completion of our initial public offering.
 
If and for so long as we and the Boxlight Group comply with the agreed upon arrangements to settle and pay the accrued accounts payable, EDI and its affiliates have agreed to continue to supply products to us and provide payment terms to us which are no less favorable than those provided to other credit-worthy customers. In addition, EDI and its affiliates have orally agreed in principle to provide Boxlight Parent and all of our subsidiaries, including the Boxlight Group and Mimio with a 10% price reduction on all units of products sold by such suppler(s) to us and our subsidiaries.
 
Technical Support and Service
 
The Boxlight Group currently has its technical support and service located near Seattle, WA and Atlanta, GA. Additionally, the Boxlight Group’s technical support division is responsible for the repair and closing of the customer service cases, resulting in more than 60% of the Boxlight Group’s customer service calls ending in immediate closure of the applicable service case. The Boxlight Group accomplishes this as a result of the familiarity between the Boxlight Group’s products and the customer service technician.

Competition
 
The Boxlight Group is engaged in an industry that is highly competitive. The industry is evolving and characterized by technological change. The Boxlight Group faces increased competition from companies with strong positions in certain markets it currently serves and in new markets and regions it may enter. These companies manufacture and/or distribute new, disruptive or substitute products that compete for the pool of available funds that previously could have been spent on interactive displays and associated products. The Boxlight Group competes with other developers, manufacturers and distributors of interactive projectors and personal computer technologies, tablets, television screens, smart phones.
 
Interactive whiteboards, since first introduced, have evolved from a high-cost technology that involves multiple components, requiring professional installers, to a one-piece technology that is available at increasingly reduced price points and affords simple installations. With lowered technology entry barriers, the Boxlight Group faces heated competition from other interactive whiteboard developers, manufacturers and distributors. However, the market presents new opportunities in responding to demands to replace outdated and failing interactive whiteboards with more affordable and simpler solution interactive whiteboards. In addition, the Boxlight Group has begun to see expansion in the market to sales of complementary products that work in conjunction with the interactive technology, including software, audio solutions, data capture, and tablets.
