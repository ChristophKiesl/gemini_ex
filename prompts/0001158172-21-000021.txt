Overview
We are a global information and analytics company that measures advertising, content, and the consumer audiences of each, across media platforms. We create our products using a global data platform that combines information on digital platforms (connected (Smart) televisions, mobile devices, tablets and computers), television ("TV"), over the top devices ("OTT"), direct to consumer applications, and movie screens with demographics and other descriptive information. We have developed proprietary data science that enables measurement of person-level and household-level audiences, removing duplicated viewing across devices and over time. This combination of data and methods enables a common standard for buyers and sellers to transact on advertising. This helps companies across the media ecosystem better understand and monetize their audiences and develop marketing plans, content and products to more efficiently and effectively reach those audiences. Our ability to unify behavioral and other descriptive data enables us to provide audience ratings, advertising verification, and granular consumer segments that describe hundreds of millions of consumers. Our customers include digital publishers, television networks, movie studios, content owners, brand advertisers, agencies and technology providers.
The information we analyze crosses geographies, types of content and activities, including websites, mobile and OTT applications ("apps"), video games, television and movie programming, electronic commerce ("e-commerce") and advertising.
We are a Delaware corporation headquartered in Reston, Virginia with principal offices located at 11950 Democracy Drive, Suite 600, Reston, VA 20190. Our telephone number is 703-438-2000.
Recent Key Developments
Strategic Investment Transactions
On January 7, 2021, we entered into separate Securities Purchase Agreements with each of Charter Communications Holding Company, LLC ("Charter"), Qurate Retail, Inc. ("Qurate") and Pine Investor, LLC ("Pine"), pursuant to which, at the closing of the transactions contemplated thereby (the "Transactions"), we will issue and sell (a) to Charter, 27,509,203 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share, in exchange for $68.0 million, (b) to Qurate, 27,509,203 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock in exchange for $68.0 million and (c) to Pine, 27,509,203 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock in exchange for $68.0 million. The proceeds of the Transactions will be used to repay the $204.0 million of senior secured convertible notes due January 16, 2022 (the "Notes") issued to certain funds affiliated with or managed by Starboard Value LP ("Starboard"). Additionally, in connection with the closing, we expect to repay the $13.0 million secured promissory note due December 31, 2021 issued by a subsidiary of the Company (the "Secured Term Note") and certain transaction-related expenses with cash from our balance sheet. Refer to Footnote 4, Debt for additional information on the Notes and the Secured Term Note. The Transactions and related matters were approved by our stockholders on March 9, 2021 and are expected to be completed on or around March 10, 2021. Repayment of the Notes and the Secured Term Note will result in termination of the affirmative and negative covenants set forth in these instruments, including the Notes covenant requiring maintenance of certain minimum cash balances (currently $40.0 million), and is expected to improve our financial position and liquidity.
COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic and related government mandates and restrictions continue to have a significant impact on the media, advertising and entertainment industries in which we operate. To date, the COVID-19 pandemic has had some impact on our business, including with respect to the execution of new and renewal contracts, the impact of closed movie theaters on our customers, customer payment delays and requests to modify contractual payment terms. These conditions have negatively impacted our liquidity, net loss and cash flows and are expected to continue to have an impact in future periods. Although we cannot quantify the impact that the pandemic may have on our business in the future, we have taken actions to mitigate the near-term liquidity impact, including freezing hiring, exiting non-critical consultants and contractors, terminating or negotiating reductions in vendor agreements and leases, and

reducing certain travel, marketing, recruiting and other corporate activities not deemed critical to our business in the current environment.
On March 27, 2020, Congress enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act ("CARES Act"). The CARES Act, among other things, includes tax provisions for the deferral of certain employer payroll tax liabilities, refundable employee retention credits, rollbacks of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("TCJA") limitations on net operating losses, the acceleration of alternative minimum tax credit refunds, modifications to the net interest deduction limitations and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property. We have deferred certain payroll taxes as permitted by the CARES Act and have claimed the employee retention credit created by the CARES Act.
On December 27, 2020, Congress enacted the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 ("CAA"), which contains a number of additional COVID-19 relief tax provisions and extensions of temporary tax provisions, including an extension and significant expansion of the employee retention credit created by the CARES Act.
We continue to evaluate the impact on our business operations and financial results of the CARES Act, the CAA and additional legislation and government guidance related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Background and Market
We were founded in 1999 on the belief that digital technology would transform the interactions between people, media and brands in ways that would generate substantial demand for data and analytics about that interaction. The growing adoption of digital technologies also allowed measurement of the behavior of consumers' online activities. Based on this vision, we built a global opt-in panel of over two million individuals that provided insight into online activities. In 2002, we acquired Media Metrix, an internet ratings brand with its own panel of consumers. Anticipating that mobile would become a key digital platform in the future, we acquired mobile measurement specialist M:Metrics in 2008. In 2009, we introduced our proprietary Unified Digital Measurement ("UDM") methodology, which allowed us to unite consumer panel data with census-level data from tags that we implemented on websites and their content and later from software development kits on mobile apps. 
To expand our global presence in Latin America and Europe, we acquired Certifica in 2009 and NedStat in 2010, respectively. To enhance our product offerings and expand our presence in certain markets, we acquired ARS in 2010, M.Labs, LLC in 2014, Proximic, Inc. in 2015, and Compete, Inc. in 2016. As consumer media consumption and the availability of television and video programming expanded across a myriad of consumer devices, the ability to measure this dynamic cross-platform world became more important for buyers and sellers of advertising. In response, we pioneered a cross-platform measurement solution in 2015 with the launch of Xmedia. This cross-platform measurement strategy led to our 2015 strategic alliance with WPP plc (together with its affiliates, "WPP"), one of the largest communications services businesses in the world, and our 2016 merger with Rentrak Corporation ("Rentrak"), a global media measurement and advanced consumer targeting company serving the entertainment, television, video and advertising industries. Following the Rentrak merger, we have access to millions of television and video on demand ("VOD") screens and the ability to measure box office results from movie screens across the world. We also have an opt-in Total Home Panel, which enables measurement of household devices that use a home's internet connection, whether traditional mobile and computer devices, streaming media devices, gaming consoles or Internet of Things ("IOT") devices, which may include devices such as smart speakers, thermostats, and appliances.
Our Approach to Media Measurement
Our approach to measuring media consumption addresses the ubiquitous nature of media content and the fragmentation caused by the variety of platforms and technologies used to access such content. Advertising exposure and effectiveness is another rapidly changing and fragmented area where we apply scale for validation and campaign measurement across devices, platforms and ecosystem technology providers. We believe this fragmentation presents major challenges to using legacy measurement systems that are comprised of relatively small panels of cooperating consumers or limited to specific media platforms. Our products and services are built on measurement and analytic capabilities comprised of broad-based data collection, proprietary databases, internally developed software and a computational infrastructure to measure, analyze and report on digital, television and movie activity at the level of granularity that we believe the media and advertising industries need.
Data Collection 
The following collection methods illustrate our extensive data sourcing:
•We collect data from proprietary consumer panels that measure the use of computers, tablets and smartphones that access the internet. These panelists have agreed to install our passive metering software on their devices, home network or both.
•We collect data from our near-census digital network whereby content publishers implement our software code (referred to as "tagging") on their websites, in mobile applications and video players to provide us usage information. 
•We license certain demographic and behavioral mobile and panel data from third-party data providers.
Table of Contents

•We obtain television viewership information from satellite, telecommunications, connected (Smart) TV and cable operators covering millions of television and VOD screens.
•We measure gross receipts and attendance information from movie screens across the world.
•We integrate our digital and television viewership information with other third-party datasets that include consumer demographic characteristics, attitudes, lifestyles and purchase behavior.
•We integrate many of our services with ad serving platforms.
•We utilize knowledgeable in-house industry analysts that span verticals such as pharmaceuticals, media, finance, consumer packaged goods and political information to add value to our data.
•We have created an opt-in Total Home Panel, which can capture data that runs through a home's internet connection. This expands our intelligence to include such activity as game console and IOT device usage.
Data Science and Management
The ability to integrate, manage and transform massive amounts of data is core to our company. We continue to invest in technologies to enable large-scale measurement with protection of consumer privacy and attractive economics. Our systems contain multiple redundancies and advanced distributed processing technologies. We have created innovations such as:
•Our UDM methodology, which allows us to combine person-centric panel data with website server data. We believe this gives our customers greater accuracy, granularity and relevance in audience measurement. 
•Our TV measurement systems, underpinned by multiple patents, which enable us to provide a consistent measurement of TV audience sizes across national, local, and addressable television to customers evaluating programming as well as customers selling and buying TV advertising. 
•An ability to de-duplicate audiences across platforms, which is based on direct observations within our consumer panel and census data combined with proprietary data science. This de-duplication allows us to measure the reach and frequency of advertising and content exposure across platforms and over time.
•An ability to validate advertising delivery and detect fraud through our Invalid Traffic and Sophisticated Invalid Traffic filtration methods. These methods have been accredited by the Media Rating Council, which provides our customers with added assurances of validity and reliability.
•An ability to capture the full content of a website or app session, which allows us to measure activity beyond page views such as purchase transactions, application submissions and product configurations.
•An ability to intelligently categorize massive amounts of web and video content, which allows us to inform targeted and brand-safe advertising.

New Product Investments and Releases
Cookieless - Engineering Products in a Privacy Centric World
Our digital measurement is centered upon using first party panel data combined with additional information captured through census measurement and data partnerships. Historically, we have used cookies and mobile advertising IDs to provide additional context and scale to our digital audience measurement solutions, as well as to assist in more targeted measurement and reportability. The development of new opt-in permissions and enhanced focus on consent-based measurement provide the benefit of limiting the transfer of consumer personal information, but also mean changes to data collection and measurement processes. 
Table of Contents

We are adopting new methodologies to lead this transition to a more privacy-centric world. A key component is leveraging our capabilities in panels, which we believe give us a competitive advantage in digital and cross-platform management. In parallel, our work with existing and new partners to collaborate and test emerging solutions is intended to expand the reach of our census-level integrations. We are creating measurement innovations designed to produce stronger products engineered for privacy.
We are also engaged in industry initiatives that focus on the viability and success of the "free web," which is driven by advertising investment. One of these initiatives, championed by Google and Facebook, is a proposal from the World Federation of Advertisers ("WFA"). We are actively involved in WFA working sessions and are proposing a real-world test implementation to begin in the first half of 2021. Moreover, to counter the possibility of commoditization of digital measurement, we are developing two additional paths that are incremental to the WFA approach. One of these is to offer "WFA Plus" solutions, with enhanced features beyond the basic WFA methodology. The other is to offer an alternative, non-WFA measurement for those publishers who decline to participate in the WFA framework. We expect this alternative approach to be interoperable with WFA-based measurements.
Comscore Markets
In 2020, we developed and deployed our own market definitions (known as Comscore Markets) into our television, digital, and cross platform products. During this time, we worked with agencies, local stations, and third-party processors so that Comscore Markets would be supported in existing media transactional systems. We expect these market definitions to provide the flexibility needed for rapid innovation.
Comcast Integration
Also in 2020, we announced an agreement with Comcast to include de-identified Comcast set-top box data in our syndicated TV products. We completed the integration of the Comcast data into our TVE and SVE products in December 2020, and local and national clients will begin to receive TVE and SVE data that includes Comcast contributions beginning with broadcasts in January 2021.
Google Ads Data Hub
Throughout 2020, we partnered with Google to build the next generation of YouTube measurement without third-party pixels. In August, we announced the completion of our integration with Google's Ads Data Hub, or ADH. We were the first company to complete integration for Reach in ADH. During the remainder of 2020, we enhanced our ad-measurement services to include ADH, ensuring measurement continuity while enhancing reporting to include YouTube mobile applications utilizing our cross-platform panels.
Mobile Video into MMX MP
As part of our ongoing effort to provide solutions that measure digital audiences across all platforms, we introduced data enhancements to our Media Metrix Multi-Platform product in late 2020 that added video measurement from mobile smartphone and tablet devices. This product now provides digital reach and engagement that is de-duplicated across content consumption methods for desktop and mobile devices, giving clients a better understanding of how their digital properties perform.
Quick Score
Also in 2020, we introduced Comscore Quick Score, a television ratings report that provides viewership insights to local media within 48 hours of broadcast for faster, more efficient ad sales, programming and promotional decisions. Quick Score builds on the same data collection and processing backbone that powers TVE and SVE, while adding new algorithms and forecasting methods to generate estimates based on partial data. The footprint of the data informing Quick Score spans millions of TV households.
LiveRamp Data Plus Math Integration
In October 2020, we partnered with LiveRamp to launch the next generation of outcome-based measurement with the latest version of LiveRamp's Data Plus Math powered by Comscore. The expanded partnership and offering are designed to help advertisers, TV networks and multichannel video programming distributors ("MVPDs") maximize outcomes for advertising campaigns by allowing marketers to measure TV's impact on business outcomes at scale, across screens, and across formats. The enhanced Data Plus Math solution leverages our comprehensive cross-platform ad exposure information from both set-top boxes and automatic content recognition enabled TVs.

Government Regulation and Privacy 
U.S. and international data security and privacy laws apply to our various businesses. We have programs in place to detect, contain and respond to data security incidents; however, increasing technology risks or unauthorized users who successfully breach our network security could misappropriate or misuse our proprietary information or cause interruptions in our services. Many countries have data protection laws with different requirements than those in the U.S., and many states in the U.S. have or are developing their own data protection and privacy requirements. This may result in inconsistent requirements and differing interpretations across jurisdictions. Governments, privacy advocates and class action attorneys are increasingly scrutinizing how companies collect, process, use, store, share and transmit personal data. Laws such as the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"), Brazil's General Data Protection Law ("LGPD"), the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") in Europe and industry self-regulatory codes have been enacted, and more are being considered that will affect our ability (and our customers' ability) to reach current and prospective customers, to respond to individual customer requests under the laws, and to implement our business models effectively. The GDPR took effect in May 2018 and includes requirements regarding the collection and handling of individuals' personal data. The CCPA went into effect in January 2020, and the LGPD went into effect in September 2020. In addition, regulators in the European Union and elsewhere are increasingly focused on consent and the collection of data using tracking technologies, including recent guidance from the U.K.'s Information Commissioner's Office and other data protection agencies. Failure to meet the applicable GDPR, CCPA or LGPD requirements, or failure to comply with privacy, data collection or consent requirements in other jurisdictions, could result in substantial penalties.
We also monitor actions by the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission, including regulatory developments affecting Internet Service Providers and other industry participants.
Human Capital Management
Our management of human capital is essential to the success of our company, and our management team is actively engaged in developing a strong, engaged team to execute on our business plans. 
As of February 28, 2021, we had approximately 1,340 employees and 140 contingent providers/contractors. Our employee population, which is comprised 93% of full-time employees and 7% of part-time employees, is dispersed across the globe, as outlined below as of December 31, 2020.

Employee Engagement & Retention
The development, attraction and retention of talent is critical to the success of our business. We focus on building employee engagement; developing a positive culture of trust, transparency, learning, and involvement; and competitive pay and benefits structures to attract and retain employees and protect the intellectual capital that we have built. We regularly review our employee turnover and satisfaction rates, and develop strategies and tactics to improve employee engagement and retention. On average, employee tenure is over six years, and more than 20% of our employees have been employed by our company for more than ten years. 
We seek to attract and retain the best talent from a diverse group of sources around the world, in order to meet our current and future staffing needs. In addition to a robust employee referral practice and independent outreach, we have developed relationships with universities, professional associations, and industry alliances to further increase our outreach and talent pool. Our company conducted limited hiring in North America and Europe in 2020, but initiated a plan to increase staffing in our Pune, India and Santiago, Chile locations in order to meet staffing needs in a cost-effective manner. 
Where feasible within the countries in which we operate, we provide a competitive and varied portfolio of healthcare, wellness, financial, and other benefit offerings to suit the diverse needs and lifestyles of our employees. Within the United States, 88% of our employee population was enrolled in one of our healthcare plans as of December 31, 2020.
We provide virtual, on-demand learning opportunities to all employees, and we also develop and deliver custom learning programs to meet specific business needs and employee interests. In 2020, approximately 64% of our employees participated in learning activities through the on-demand portal. 
We believe we have strong labor practices and employee-friendly policies that enable a culture of trust, collaboration, and compliance. Our employment standards begin and end with respect for the dignity and worth of each person. Employees have multiple avenues through which to express opinions, ideas, and concerns, which enables an open culture of communication and inclusion; our policies require that complaints are investigated and any findings are addressed. Our employees are not represented by labor unions outside of those few countries where union representation is a customary practice of doing business. The Company operates a Compliance Management System, a key component of which is mandatory training for all employees in areas including workplace harassment and our code of business conduct.
Work Environment
We believe we have created a work environment, whether in person or virtually, that represents our commitment to safety and wellness. This was exemplified at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when we acted quickly and conservatively to ensure that employees could work effectively from their homes and protect their own health and that of their households. Over the course of the pandemic, we provided both system and technology capability as well as personal support, including wellness activities and resources, virtual social activities, support for working parents, and locational flexibility. Supporting the person, not just the "worker," allowed us to pivot quickly and maintain business operations without endangering employees or customers. We had no safety incidents or incidents of work-related COVID-19 infections reported in 2020. 
Diversity and Inclusion
We strive to build and develop a workforce that reflects diversity, equity, and inclusion at all levels of the organization. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 40% of our global workforce was female and approximately 36% of our executive leaders were female. Within the United States, approximately 36% of our employees identified as a person of color or as other than white. Our view is that our culture of involvement and appreciation of others enables us to more fully develop and leverage the strengths of our workforce to meet our business objectives. We place a high value on inclusion and employee-led opportunities across the Company, including the Employee Resource Groups ("ERGs") which are sponsored by senior leadership but are developed and maintained by diverse groups of employees who share or champion common interests, representations, or causes. We currently have ERGs in support of LGBTQ+ persons, people of color, women, young professionals, and remote workers. We have amplified our conversation and actions relating specifically to inclusion and diversity in the last year, taking a more active executive stance and implementing learning and development initiatives, additional ERGs, virtual employee gatherings and activities, and talent acquisition opportunities.
Locations and Geographic Areas
We are located around the globe with employees in 20 countries. Our primary geographic market is the United States, followed by Europe, Latin America, Canada and Asia. For information with respect to sales by geographic markets, refer to Footnote 3, Revenue Recognition, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
