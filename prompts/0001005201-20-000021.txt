ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Our Company 
Assertio Therapeutics, Inc. (Assertio or the Company) is a leading diversified, specialty pharmaceutical company focused on distinctive products that offer enhanced therapeutic options for patients in need, while maintaining the highest ethical standards in all our business practices. The Company’s current specialty pharmaceuticals business includes CAMBIA®(diclofenac potassium for oral solution), a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug for the acute treatment of migraine attacks, acquired by the Company in December 2013, and Zipsor® (diclofenac potassium liquid filled capsules), a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug for the treatment of mild to moderate acute pain, acquired by the Company in June 2012, both of which, are marketed in the United States (U.S.). 
Business Strategy 
In 2017, the Company announced that it was in the process of transforming into a leading diversified, specialty pharmaceutical company with a goal of rapidly deleveraging its balance sheet, growing its core business, and opportunistically building for the future via business development. The Company has completed the following transactions to advance toward achieving its stated goals: 

• | On December 4, 2017, the Company announced a commercialization agreement with Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc. (Collegium), pursuant to which the Company granted Collegium the right to commercialize the NUCYNTA franchise of products in the U.S. (the Commercialization Agreement). Pursuant to the Commercialization Agreement, Collegium assumed all commercialization responsibilities for the NUCYNTA franchise effective January 9, 2018, including sales and marketing, and the Company received royalty on all NUCYNTA revenues based on certain net sales thresholds.


• | On August 13, 2019, the Company entered into separate, privately negotiated exchange agreements (the Exchange Agreements) with a limited number of holders of Assertio’s 2.50% Convertible Notes due 2021 (the 2021 Notes). Pursuant to the Exchange Agreements, Assertio exchanged approximately $200 million aggregate principal amount of Exchanged Notes for a combination of (a) its new 5.00% Convertible Senior Notes due August 15, 2024 (the 2024 Notes), (b) a cash payment plus accrued but unpaid interest on the Exchanged Notes, and (c) an agreed number of shares of Assertio’s common stock.


• | On December 12, 2019, the Company announced it entered into an agreement with Golf Acquiror LLC, an affiliate to Alvogen, Inc. (Alvogen), a global privately held pharmaceutical company, under which Alvogen acquired and assumed all responsibilities associated with the product Gralise® (gabapentin). Under the terms of the agreement, Alvogen is expected to pay Assertio a total value of $127.5 million. This included $75.0 million in cash at closing on January 10, 2020, and the balance payable as 75% of Alvogen’s first $70.0 million of Gralise net sales after the closing. Alvogen also paid the Company for certain inventories relating to Gralise.


• | On February 6, 2020, the Company announced it entered into a definitive agreement with Collegium pursuant to which Collegium acquired the NUCYNTA franchise of products from the Company, and assumed certain contracts, liabilities and obligations of the Company relating to the NUCYNTA products, including those related to manufacturing and supply, post-market commitments and clinical development costs. Under the terms of the agreement, Collegium paid Assertio $375.0 million in cash at closing on February 13, 2020, less royalties paid to the Company in 2020. Collegium also paid the Company for certain inventories relating to the products.


• | On February 13, 2020, the Company repaid in full its outstanding aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes (Senior Notes) pursuant to a Note Purchase Agreement dated March 12, 2015 (Note Purchase Agreement) and all subsequent amendments to the Note Purchase Agreement.


• | On February 19, 2020, the Company announced it entered into separate, privately negotiated agreements with a limited number of holders of the Company’s 2021 Notes and 2024 Notes to repurchase approximately $188.0 million aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 2021 Notes and 2024 Notes.

As a result of the transformational impact of these transactions, the Company has positioned itself to actively pursue business development, strategic partnerships, and investment opportunities to build and grow for the future.

Our Business Operations

As of December 31, 2019, our business operations consisted of the following:

Products 

CAMBIA (Diclofenac Potassium for Oral Solution)

CAMBIA is a non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drug (NSAID) indicated for the acute treatment of migraine attacks with or without aura in adults 18 years of age or older. We acquired CAMBIA in December 2013 from Nautilus Neurosciences, Inc. (Nautilus). We began shipping and recognizing product sales on CAMBIA in December 2013.
Zipsor (Diclofenac Potassium Liquid‑Filled Capsules)

Zipsor is an NSAID indicated for relief of mild to moderate acute pain in adults. Zipsor uses proprietary ProSorb® delivery technology to deliver a finely dispersed, rapidly absorbed formulation of diclofenac. We acquired Zipsor in June 2012 from Xanodyne Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Xanodyne). We began shipping and recognizing product sales on Zipsor in June 2012.
Gralise (Gabapentin)

Gralise is a once‑daily formulation of gabapentin indicated for management of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), a persistent pain condition caused by nerve damage during a shingles, or herpes zoster, viral infection. We made Gralise commercially available in October 2011, following its U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in January 2011. Effective as of January 10, 2020, we divested our rights, title and interest in and to Gralise to Alvogen. 
NUCYNTA ER (Tapentadol Extended Release Tablets) and NUCYNTA IR (NUCYNTA) (Tapentadol)

NUCYNTA ER is an extended-release version of tapentadol that is indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around‑the‑clock, long-term opioid treatment, including neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) in adults, and for which alternate treatment options are inadequate. NUCYNTA is an immediate release version of tapentadol that is indicated for the management of moderate to severe acute pain in adults. We acquired the U.S. rights to NUCYNTA ER and NUCYNTA from Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Janssen Pharma) and began shipping and recognizing product sales on NUCYNTA ER and NUCYNTA in April 2015. We began commercial promotion of NUCYNTA ER and NUCYNTA in June 2015.

In December 2017, we entered into the Commercialization Agreement with Collegium, which we amended in November 2018. Pursuant to the Commercialization Agreement, we granted Collegium the right to commercialize the NUCYNTA franchise of products in the U.S. Collegium assumed all commercialization responsibilities for the NUCYNTA franchise effective January 9, 2018, including sales and marketing, and received royalties on all NUCYNTA revenues based on certain net sales thresholds, with a minimum royalty of $132.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Beginning in 2019, we received royalties based on certain annual NUCYNTA net sales thresholds for future years. Effective as of February 13, 2020, we divested our rights, title and interest in and to our NUCYNTA franchise to Collegium.

The following table shows sales for each of the above-described products over each of the past three fiscal years (in millions):

 | Year ended December 31,
 | 2019 | 2018 | 2017 
Gralise | $63.1 | $58.1 | $77.0 
CAMBIA | $32.5 | $35.8 | $31.6 
Zipsor | $12.5 | $16.4 | $16.7 
NUCYNTA ER and NUCYNTA | | | 
Product Sales (1) | $0.9 | $18.9 | $239.5
Commercialization Agreement (2) | $118.6 | $155.7 | $0 
Lazanda (3) | $(0.2) | $0.8 | $15.0 


(1) | NUCYNTA ER and NUCYNTA product sales reflect our sales between January 1, 2017 and January 8, 2018, prior to the Commercialization Agreement with Collegium. See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2. Revenue” for additional information. Subsequent to January 8, 2018, we continue to recognize sales reserve estimate adjustments related to sales recognized for NUCYNTA products in prior periods. 


(2) | NUCYNTA ER and NUCYNTA royalties from Collegium reflect royalties earned and inventory sold pursuant to the Commercialization Agreement after January 8, 2018. Variable royalty revenue became effective for sales beginning January 1, 2019, as recognition of such royalties are constrained by the sales-based royalty exception related to intellectual property. Other components of net revenue from the Commercialization Agreement include the amortization of revenue from contract liabilities arising from the warrants and prepayments received, amortization of the contract asset, and variable consideration revenue for reimbursement of certain shared costs. See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2. Revenue” for additional information.


(3) | In November 2017, we entered into agreements with Slán Medicinal Holdings Limited and certain of its affiliates (Slán) pursuant to which Slán acquired our rights to Lazanda. Lazanda nasal spray is an intranasal fentanyl drug used to manage breakthrough pain in adults (18 years of age and older) who are already routinely taking other opioid pain medicines around‑the‑clock for cancer pain. We acquired Lazanda in July 2013 from Archimedes Pharma US Inc. and its affiliated companies. We continue to recognize sales reserve estimate adjustments related to sales recognized for Lazanda in prior periods. 

Collaboration and License Agreements
Nuvo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nuvo) In November 2010, we entered into a license agreement with Tribute Pharmaceuticals Canada Ltd. (now Nuvo Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) granting them the rights to commercially market CAMBIA in Canada. Nuvo independently contracts with manufacturers to produce a specific CAMBIA formulation in Canada. We receive royalties on net sales on a quarterly basis as well as certain one-time contingent milestone payments upon the occurrence of certain events. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized $2.1 million of revenue related to CAMBIA in Canada. The revenue recognized in 2019 included a $0.3 million one-time amendment fee to support the continued collaboration with our partner in Canada following their acquisition and a $0.5 million milestone payment. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized $0.8 million of revenue related to CAMBIA in Canada. We will receive additional one-time contingent milestone payments upon the achievement of scaling twelve-month cumulative sales targets and certain development milestones in the future.
Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Ironwood) In July 2011, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Ironwood granting Ironwood a license for worldwide rights to certain patents and other intellectual property rights to our Acuform drug delivery technology for IW 3718, an Ironwood product candidate under evaluation for refractory gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). During the second quarter of 2018, we received a $5.0 million milestone payment related to the dosing of the first patient in a Phase 3 trial. We expect to receive additional contingent milestone payments upon the occurrence of certain development milestones and royalties on net sales of the product, if approved.
PDL BioPharma, Inc. (PDL) In October 2013, pursuant to the terms and conditions of a Royalty Purchase and Sale Agreement with PDL (Royalty Purchase Agreement), we sold to PDL our right to receive royalty, milestone and other specified payments arising on and after October 2013 under each of the following license agreements relating to our Acuform technology in the Type 2 diabetes therapeutic area: (i) the License and Services Agreement, effective as of March 4, 2011, with Boehringer Ingelheim International GMBH (BI), relating to potential future development milestones and sales of BI’s investigational fixed-dose combinations of drugs and extended-release metformin worldwide; (ii) the License Agreement, effective as of August 5, 2010, with Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V. (Janssen), relating to potential future development milestones and sales of Janssen’s investigational fixed-dose combination of Invokana® (canagliflozin) and extended-release metformin worldwide; (iii) the Non-Exclusive License, Covenant Not to Sue and Right of Reference Agreement, effective as of July 21, 2009, with Merck & Co., Inc., relating to sales of Janumet XR® (sitagliptin and metformin HCL extended-release) worldwide; (iv) the Commercialization Agreement, effective as of August 22, 2011, with Santarus, Inc. relating to sales of Glumetza® (metformin 
6

HCL extended-release tablets) in the U.S.; (v) the Amended License Agreement, effective as of January 9, 2007, with LG Life Sciences Ltd., relating to sales of extended-release metformin in Korea; and (vi) the Amended and Restated License Agreement (Extended Release Metformin Formulations — Canada), dated as of December 13, 2005, with Biovail Laboratories International SRL, relating to sales of extended-release metformin in Canada. Under the Royalty Purchase Agreement, PDL was entitled to receive all payments due under such license agreements until PDL received $481 million, after which all net payments received were to be shared evenly between us and PDL. In August 2018, we amended the Royalty Purchase Agreement and sold our remaining interest in such payments to PDL for $20.0 million.
Slán Medicinal Holdings Limited In November 2017, we entered into definitive agreements with Slán Medicinal Holdings Limited and certain of its affiliates (Slán) pursuant to which we acquired Slán’s rights to market the specialty drug long-acting cosyntropin (synthetic ACTH) in the U.S. and Canada. On February 6, 2020, the Company entered into an amended agreement with Eolas Pharma Teoranta (Eolas), an affiliate of Slán. Pursuant to the amendment, the license granted to the Company for the commercialization of long-acting cosyntropin was terminated. Additionally, the Company may receive up to $10.0 million in future payments based upon commercial sales of long-acting cosyntropin if Eolas successfully obtains regulatory approval for and commercializes the product.
Segment and Customer Information
We maintain one operating segment and have operations solely in the U.S. To date, substantially all of our revenues from product sales are related to sales in the U.S. 
The three large, national wholesale distributors represent the vast majority of our revenues and represented the following percentages of product shipments and consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 set forth below. Further, as described above, we entered into the Commercialization Agreement with Collegium pursuant to which we granted Collegium the right to commercialize the NUCYNTA franchise of products in the U.S., effective January 9, 2018. We received royalties on all NUCYNTA revenues based on certain net sales thresholds. These royalties represented the following percentage of consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. 

 | Consolidated Revenue | | Accounts Receivable related to product shipments
 | 2019 | | 2018 | | 2017 | 2019 | | 2018 | | 2017

Marketing and Sales 

We have developed capabilities in various aspects relating to the commercialization of our marketed products, including sales, marketing, manufacturing, quality assurance, wholesale distribution, managed market contracting, government price reporting, medical affairs, and compliance and regulatory affairs. Members of our commercial organization are also engaged in the commercial and marketing assessments of other potential product candidates.

Our neurology sales organization includes approximately 72 full time employees as of January 31, 2020. Our neurology sales force primarily calls on neurologists, pain specialists and primary care physicians, and their affiliated physician assistants and nurse practitioners, throughout most of the U.S. Our marketing and managed care organization is comprised of professionals who have developed a variety of strategies and tactics to promote our products, including promotional materials, market access programs, industry publications, advertising and other media.
Seasonality 
Our product revenues for Gralise, CAMBIA and Zipsor have historically been lower in the first quarter of the year as compared to the fourth quarter of the preceding year. This variation is influenced by both wholesaler buying patterns and the reset of annual limits on deductibles and out-of-pocket costs of many health insurance plans and government programs at the 
7

beginning of each calendar year. For additional information, please also refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Our product revenues have typically been lower in the first quarter of the year as compared to the fourth quarter of the preceding year.”
Manufacturing

Our facility is used for office purposes. No commercial manufacturing takes place at our facility.

We are responsible for the supply and distribution of our marketed products. We have manufacturing and supply agreements with sole commercial suppliers for each of our marketed products, as follows: for Gralise, with Patheon Puerto Rico Inc. (Patheon); for CAMBIA, with MiPharm, S.p.A. (MiPharm); for Zipsor, with Catalent Ontario Limited (Catalent); for NUCYTNA ER, with an affiliate of Janssen Pharma; and for NUCYNTA, with Halo Pharmaceutical, Inc. (dba Cambrex Whippany). Effective as of January 10, 2020, we divested our rights, title and interest in and to Gralise to Alvogen, including related manufacturing and supply agreements. Effective as of February 13, 2020 we divested our rights, title and interest in and to our NUCYNTA franchise to Collegium, including related manufacturing and supply agreements. 
We have one qualified supplier for the active pharmaceutical ingredient in each of our marketed products.  We have supply and manufacturing agreements with the suppliers of the active pharmaceutical ingredients in each of our marketed products. 
For additional information regarding our manufacturing, please also refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors - We depend on one qualified supplier for the active pharmaceutical ingredient in each of our products, and we depend on third parties that are single source suppliers to manufacture our products. Insufficient availability of our products or the active pharmaceutical ingredients and other raw materials necessary to manufacture our products, or the inability of our suppliers to manufacture and supply our products, will adversely impact our sales upon depletion of the active ingredient and product inventories.”

Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products and technologies. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary rights, by among other methods, filing patent applications in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions to cover certain aspects of our technology. In addition to those patents noted on the above table, we have one patent application pending in the U.S. Our pending patent application may lack priority over other applications or may not result in the issuance of a patent. Even if issued, our patents may not be sufficiently broad to provide protection against competitors with similar technologies and may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or may not provide us with competitive advantages against competing products. We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how, which are difficult to protect. We seek to protect such information, in part, through entering into confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, collaborative partners and others before such persons or entities have access to our proprietary trade secrets and know how. These confidentiality agreements may not be effective in certain cases. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors. For further information regarding risks associated with the protection of our intellectual property rights, please also refer to “Item 1A. “Risk Factors - We are not always able to protect our intellectual property and are subject to risks from liability for infringing the intellectual property of others.” For information regarding currently pending litigation related to intellectual property matters, please also refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 11. Commitments and Contingencies.”
Competition
General We believe that we compete favorably in our markets on the basis of the safety and efficacy of our products. However, competition in pharmaceutical products is intense, and we expect competition to increase through both branded and generic competitors. There may be other companies developing products competitive with ours of which we are unaware. 
9

Many of our principal competitors may have greater financial, sales, marketing, personnel and research and development resources than we do. Competing products developed in the future may prove superior to our products, either generally or in particular market segments. These developments could make our products noncompetitive or obsolete.

Gralise Gabapentin is currently sold by Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer) as Neurontin® and by several generic manufacturers for adjunctive therapy for partial onset seizures and for the management of PHN. In addition, Pfizer’s product Lyrica® (pregabalin) has been approved for marketing in the U.S. for the management of PHN, neuropathic pain associated with DPN (diabetic peripheral neuropathy), neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury, fibromyalgia, and adjunctive therapy in partial onset seizures. In January 2018, Pfizer began to sell Lyrica® CR, a controlled release formulation of Lyrica for neuropathic pain associated with DPN and for PHN. Gralise competes against these products and other neuropathic pain treatments, such as anti-depressants, anti-convulsants, local anesthetics used as regional nerve blockers, anti-arrhythmics and opioids. Arbor Pharmaceutical, LLC’s Horizant™ (gabapentin enacarbil extended-release tablets) product, a prodrug of gabapentin, is also marketed for the management of PHN in the U.S. as well as for Restless Leg Syndrome. Effective as of January 10, 2020, we divested our rights, title and interest in and to Gralise to Alvogen. 
CAMBIA Diclofenac potassium, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in CAMBIA, is an NSAID approved in the U.S. for the acute treatment of migraine in adults. CAMBIA competes with a number of triptans which are used to treat acute migraine and certain other headaches. Currently, seven triptans are available generically and sold in the U.S. (almotriptan, eletriptan, frovatriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan, sumatriptan and zolmitriptan). Branded competitors include Zomig® Nasal Spray, Onzetra®, Xsail®, Sumavel®, Zembrace® SymTouch® and Treximet®, which is a fixed dose combination product containing sumatriptan and naproxen. There are other products prescribed for or under development for the treatment or prevention of migraines that are now or may become competitive with CAMBIA, including calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) inhibitor products (CGRP brands include Aimovig, Ajovy and Emgality).
Zipsor Diclofenac potassium, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Zipsor, is an NSAID that is approved in the U.S. for relief of mild to moderate acute pain. Both branded and generic versions of diclofenac are marketed in the U.S. Zipsor competes against other drugs that are widely used to treat mild to moderate acute pain. In addition, a number of other companies are developing NSAIDs in a variety of dosage forms for the treatment of mild to moderate pain and related indications. Other drugs are in clinical development to treat acute pain.
NUCYNTA ER (tapentadol extended release tablets) NUCYNTA ER competes against other long‑acting opioid medications. Those include, among others: OxyContin® (oxycodone hydrochloride extended‑release tablets); Butrans® (buprenorphine); Belbuca™ (buprenorphine buccal film); Hysingla® ER (hydrocodone bitartrate); Xtampza® ER (oxycodone); Zohydro® ER (hydrocodone bitartrate); Embeda® (morphine sulfate and naltrexone hcl); Arymo® ER (morphine sulfate); MorphaBond™ ER (morphine sulfate); and numerous generically available long‑acting opioids. New products continue to be developed and approved, such as Pfizer’s Troxyca, Teva’s Vantrela and Daiichi-Sankyo’s RoxyBond. Effective as of February 13, 2020, we divested our rights, title and interest in and to our NUCYNTA franchise to Collegium.
NUCYNTA (tapentadol) NUCYNTA (tapentadol) competes primarily against other short‑acting opioids. There are numerous such medicines, including, among others: Oxaydo® (oxycodone hydrochloride (hcl)); generic oxycodone hcl; generic oxycodone acetaminophen; generic oxymorphone; generic hydrocodone acetaminophen; generic hydromorphone; generic morphine; generic tramadol hcl and generic tramadol acetaminophen. New short-acting opioids continue to be developed and approved. Effective as of February 13, 2020, we divested our rights, title and interest in and to our NUCYNTA franchise to Collegium.
Government Regulation 
In the U.S., pharmaceuticals are subject to regulation by federal and state authorities, including the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) governs the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, and marketing of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can, among other things, result in delays, injunctions, product seizure or detention, product recalls, total or partial suspension of production and civil suits. The FDA may revoke approved applications or deny approval of pending new drug applications, premarket approval applications or supplements to approved applications.
Preclinical and Clinical Studies
Governmental approval is required of all potential pharmaceutical products prior to the commercial use of those products. The regulatory process takes several years and requires substantial funds. 
10

In the work related to the development or marketing of new pharmaceutical products, the FDA may require pre-clinical tests that include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential efficacy and safety of the product. If preclinical testing is required, we must submit the results of the studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an Investigational New Drug Application (IND), which must become effective before beginning clinical testing in humans.
Some of the products we have developed have been submitted for approval under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, which was enacted as part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, otherwise known as the Hatch‑Waxman Act. Section 505(b)(2) permits the submission of a new drug application (NDA) where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with Current Good Clinical Practice (cGCP), which includes the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol intended to study an investigational new drug formulation must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Additionally, an independent Institutional Review Board (IRB) at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences.
Typically, human clinical evaluation involves a time‑consuming and costly three‑phase process:

• | In Phase 1, we conduct clinical trials with a small number of subjects to determine a drug’s early safety profile and its pharmacokinetic pattern.


• | In Phase 2, we conduct limited clinical trials with groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease in order to determine preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and further evidence of safety.


• | In Phase 3, we conduct large‑scale, multi‑center, comparative trials with patients afflicted with a target disease in order to provide enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product candidate, as required by the FDA.

The FDA closely monitors the progress of each phase of clinical testing. The FDA may, at its discretion, re‑evaluate, alter, suspend or terminate testing based upon the data accumulated and the FDA’s assessment of the risk/benefit ratio to patients. The FDA may require additional clinical trials after approvals, known as Phase 4 trials. 
Marketing Approval
FDA approval of an NDA is required before a product may be marketed in the U.S. Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. If the FDA determines that the application is not sufficiently complete to permit substantive review, it may request additional information and decline to accept the application for filing until the information is provided. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity. During the review process, the FDA also reviews the drug’s product labeling to ensure that appropriate information is communicated to healthcare professionals and consumers.
As part of an application, the FDA may require submission of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) plan to mitigate any identified or suspected serious risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 (PREA), certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain adequate data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or partial or full waivers from the pediatric data requirements. 
Before an NDA is approved, the FDA generally inspects one or more clinical sites and facilities at which the drug is manufactured to ensure they are in compliance with the FDA’s cGCPs and Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP), 
11

respectively. If the FDA determines the application, data or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, the FDA may note the deficiencies in the submission and request additional testing or information. 
After evaluating the NDA, including all related information and clinical and manufacturing inspection reports, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter (CRL). A CRL generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to obtain final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
The testing and approval process for an NDA requires substantial time, effort and financial resources. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval of an NDA on a timely basis, or at all. 
If approved, the FDA may still limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-marketing or Phase 4 clinical studies be conducted, require surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The results of post-marketing studies may cause the FDA to prevent or limit further marketing of a product. After approval, certain changes to the approved product, such as manufacturing changes, new labeling claim and new indications, are subject to additional requirements and FDA review and approval. 
Foreign regulatory approval of a product must also be obtained prior to marketing a product internationally. The clinical testing requirements and the time required to obtain foreign regulatory approvals may differ from that required for FDA approval and the time required for approval may delay or prevent marketing in certain countries.
Manufacturing Requirements
We, our suppliers, contract manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacturing and distribution of approved drugs are required to comply with certain post-approval requirements and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and state agencies to assess compliance with cGMP requirements. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Failure to achieve or maintain cGMP standards for our products would adversely impact their marketability.
We use third-party manufacturers to produce our products in clinical and commercial quantities, and we cannot be certain that future FDA inspections will not identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. Additionally, new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development. 
Reimbursement
Sales of pharmaceutical products in the U.S. depend in significant part on the extent of coverage and reimbursement from government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, as well as other third-party payers. Third-party payers are undertaking significant efforts to control the cost of pharmaceutical products, including by implementing cost containment measures to control, restrict access to or influence the purchase of drugs and other health care products and services.
Government programs may regulate reimbursement, pricing, and coverage of products in order to control costs or to affect levels of use of certain products. Private health insurance plans may exclude or restrict coverage of some products, such as by using payer formularies under which only selected drugs are covered, variable co‑payments that make drugs that are not preferred by the payer more expensive for patients, and utilization management controls, such as requirements for prior authorization or prior failure on another type of treatment.
Fraud and Abuse
Pharmaceutical companies that participate in federal healthcare programs are subject to various U.S. federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare “fraud and abuse,” including anti‑kickback and false claims laws. Violations of U.S. federal and state fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including fines, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid).
12

Federal statutes that apply to us include the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute, which prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration in exchange for or to generate business, including the purchase or prescription of a drug, that is reimbursable by a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the Federal False Claims Act (FCA), which generally prohibits knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to the federal government any false, fraudulent or medically unnecessary claims for reimbursed drugs or services. Government enforcement agencies and private whistleblowers have asserted liability under the FCA for claims submitted involving inadequate care, kickbacks, improper promotion of off‑label uses and misreporting of drug prices to federal agencies.
Similar state laws and regulations, such as state anti‑kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non‑governmental payers, including private insurers. These state laws may be broader in scope than their federal analogues, such as state false claims laws that apply where a claim is submitted to any third‑party payer, regardless of whether the payer is a private health insurer or a government healthcare program, and state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to certify compliance with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines.
Federal and state authorities have increased enforcement of fraud and abuse laws within the pharmaceutical industry, and private individuals have been active in alleging violations of the law and bringing suits on behalf of the government under the FCA and under state and local laws. These laws are broad in scope and there may not be regulations, guidance or court decisions that definitively interpret these laws and apply them to particular industry practices. In addition, these laws and their interpretations are subject to change.
Controlled Substances
Tapentadol (Federal and State). The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is the federal agency responsible for domestic enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (CSA). The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV and V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have high potential for abuse, no currently accepted medical use in the U.S and lack accepted safety for use under medical supervision and may not be marketed or sold in the U.S. Except for research and industrial purposes, a pharmaceutical product may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest risk of abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. Tapentadol, the active ingredient in NUCYNTA and NUCYNTA ER, is listed by the DEA as a Schedule II substance under the CSA. Consequently, its manufacture, shipment, storage, sale and use are subject to a high degree of regulation.
Registration with the DEA is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports a controlled substance. The registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule. For example, separate registrations are needed for import and manufacturing, and each registration will specify which schedules of controlled substances are authorized to be handled under that registration.
The availability and production of all Schedule II substances, including tapentadol, is limited by the DEA through a quota system that includes a national aggregate quota, production quotas for individual manufacturers and procurement quotas that authorize the procurement of specific quantities of Schedule II controlled substances for use in drug product manufacturing. The DEA annually establishes an aggregate quota for total tapentadol production in the U.S. based on the DEA’s estimate of the quantity needed to meet commercial and scientific need. The aggregate quota of tapentadol that the DEA allows to be produced in the U.S. is allocated among applicable individual drug manufacturers, which must submit applications at least annually to the DEA for individual production quotas. In turn, the manufacturers of NUCYNTA and NUCYNTA ER, which are third-party contract manufacturers, have to obtain a procurement quota to source tapentadol for the production of NUCYNTA and NUCYNTA ER. The DEA requires substantial evidence and documentation of expected legitimate medical and scientific needs before assigning quotas for these activities.
The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas and individual production and procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments. The DEA may also require drug manufactures to submit applications for individual production quotas on a rolling basis.
Individual states also regulate controlled substances, and we, as well as our third-party active pharmaceutical ingredient suppliers and manufacturers, are subject to such regulation by several states with respect to the manufacture and distribution of these products. Effective as of February 13, 2020, we divested our rights, title and interest in and to our NUCYNTA franchise to Collegium.
13

Gabapentin (State). There has been recent regulatory attention focused on gabapentin as a result of abuse potential. Although gabapentin is neither an opioid nor classified as a controlled substance by the DEA, as a result of the perceived risks relating to opioid abuse, several states (Alabama, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, North Dakota, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia) have scheduled gabapentin as a Schedule V substance. As a result, we, as well as our third-party active pharmaceutical ingredient suppliers and manufacturers, are subject to regulation by these states with respect to the manufacture and distribution of Gralise (gabapentin). Effective as of January 10, 2020, we divested our rights, title and interest in and to Gralise to Alvogen.
Prescription Limitations
Many states, including the Commonwealths of Massachusetts, and Virginia and the States of New York, Ohio, Arizona, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Rhode Island, Colorado, Wisconsin, Alabama, South Carolina, Washington and New Jersey, have either recently enacted, intend to enact or have pending legislation or regulations designed to, among other things, limit the duration and quantity of initial prescriptions of the immediate-release form of opiates (such as NUCYNTA), mandate the use by prescribers of prescription drug databases and mandate prescriber education. These and other state and local laws applicable to the pharmaceutical industry may affect our business and operations as well as those of our commercialization and development partners.
Other U.S. Healthcare Laws
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the ACA), contains provisions that have impacted or could potentially impact our business, including (a) an increase in the minimum Medicaid rebate to states participating in the Medicaid program on branded prescription drugs; (b) the extension of the Medicaid rebate to managed care organizations that dispense drugs to Medicaid beneficiaries; and (c) the expansion of the 340B Public Health Service Act drug pricing program (340B Program), which provides outpatient drugs at reduced rates, to include certain children’s hospitals, free standing cancer hospitals, critical access hospitals and rural referral centers.
Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act (the Sunshine Act) provisions, enacted in 2010 as part of the ACA, require pharmaceutical manufacturers, among others, to disclose annually to the federal government (for re‑disclosure to the public) certain payments made to physicians and certain other healthcare practitioners or teaching hospitals. State laws may also require disclosure of pharmaceutical pricing information and marketing expenditures and impose penalties for failures to disclose. Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements. As a result of the ambiguity in certain of these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent federal and state laws and regulations.
Our operations and business are subject to a number of other laws and regulations, including those relating to the workplace, privacy, laboratory practices and the purchase, storage, movement, import and export and use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances as well as controlled substances. In addition, state laws may also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances and may contain different or broader privacy protections than the federal provisions.
