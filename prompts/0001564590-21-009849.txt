Overview
 We are a clinical-stage precision oncology biopharmaceutical company designing and developing next-generation therapies that target genetic drivers of cancer to improve the lives of patients. We have developed a macrocycle platform from which we designed our current pipeline of proprietary small, compact tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) with rigid   structures that have the potential to bind to their targets with greater precision and affinity than other kinase inhibitors. Our drug discovery approach integrates tumor biology with structure-based drug design and we believe the TKIs generated from our drug discovery platform have the potential to be best-in-class to address unmet needs in TKI naïve and resistance settings. 
Repotrectinib 
 
Our lead drug candidate, repotrectinib, is being evaluated in an ongoing Phase 1/2 trial called TRIDENT-1 for the treatment of patients with ROS1+ advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and patients with NTRK+ advanced solid tumors. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted repotrectinib breakthrough therapy designation for the treatment of patients with ROS1+ metastatic NSCLC who have not been treated with a ROS1 TKI.  In addition, the FDA has granted orphan drug designation for the development of repotrectinib in patients with advanced NSCLC with adenocarcinoma histology; and three fast track designations for the treatment of (1) NTRK+ advanced solid tumor patients who have been previously treated with one prior line of chemotherapy and one or two prior TRK TKIs, (2) ROS1+ advanced NSCLC patients who have been previously treated with one prior line of platinum-based chemotherapy and one prior line of a ROS1 TKI and (3) ROS1+ advanced NSCLC patients who have not been previously treated with a ROS1 TKI.  
 
Our multi-cohort Phase 2 registrational portion of TRIDENT-1 is ongoing and we plan to conduct the trial in approximately 120 sites in North America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific regions, with additional sites within China.  The trial is designed to enroll a total of approximately 320 patients. The Phase 2 portion of TRIDENT-1 is a registrational trial for potential approval in ROS1+ advanced NSCLC and NTRK+ advanced solid tumors. Based on the breakthrough therapy designation for the treatment of patients with ROS1+ metastatic NSCLC who have not been treated with a ROS1 TKI, and the preliminary data in the ROS1+ TKI-naïve NSCLC population (EXP-1) we reported in January 2021, we plan to discuss the next steps towards potential registration of repotrectinib in this patient population at a Type B meeting with the FDA in the second quarter of 2021. We anticipate that enrollment in EXP-1 across the Phase 1 and Phase 2 portions of the study will reach 50 patients in the second quarter of 2021. We also anticipate providing clinical data and enrollment updates for other cohorts in the study in the second half of 2021. In addition to the TRIDENT-1 study, we are also conducting a Phase 1/2 study of repotrectinib in pediatric and young adult patients with ALK+, ROS1+ or NTRK+ advanced solid tumors, and plan to initiate the first cohort of a multi arm clinical combination study of repotrectinib in KRAS mutant advanced solid tumors in mid-2021.
 
TPX-0022
 
Our Phase 1 SHIELD-1 clinical trial of our MET/SRC/CSF1R inhibitor, TPX-0022, is ongoing in patients with advanced solid tumors harboring genetic alterations in MET. The Phase 1 trial is designed to evaluate the overall safety profile, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of TPX-0022 and includes a dose-finding portion followed by dose expansion in multiple cohorts of MET alterations and tumor types. We are currently evaluating multiple doses/schedules in the dose-finding portion of the study, with a goal of selecting the recommended Phase 2 dose in the second quarter of 2021.   Once the recommended Phase 2 dose is determined, we expect to initiate the Phase 1 dose expansion portion of the study. We plan to discuss the ongoing Phase 1 SHIELD-1 study with the FDA to potentially modify the study into a registrational Phase 1/2 design. We are targeting initiation of the Phase 2 portion of the study in the second half of 2021, pending FDA feedback. We anticipate reporting updated data from the dose finding portion of the SHIELD-1 study in the second half of 2021. In parallel, a combination study with TPX-0022 and an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeted therapy in patients with EGFR mutant MET-amplified NSCLC is also planned for initiation in the second half of 2021.
 
TPX-0046 
 
The Phase 1 dose-finding portion of our Phase 1/2 clinical trial of our RET inhibitor, TPX-0046 in patients with advanced solid tumors harboring RET genetic alterations is ongoing. The trial is designed to enroll TKI-naïve and TKI-pretreated patients with RET-altered non-small-cell lung, thyroid, and other advanced cancers in multiple cohorts to assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary clinical activity of TPX-0046, with a targeted enrollment of approximately 50 patients in the Phase 1 dose finding portion, and approximately 300 patients in the Phase 2 expansion

portion at sites in North America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific regions. We are currently evaluating multiple doses/schedules in the dose-finding portion of the study.  We anticipate reporting preliminary data from approximately 15 to 20 initial patients in the dose finding portion of this study in the second quarter of 2021.
 
TPX-0131
 
Our fourth drug candidate, TPX-0131, is a next-generation preclinical ALK inhibitor.  TPX-0131 has been designed with a compact macrocyclic structure and in preclinical studies has been shown to potently inhibit wildtype ALK and numerous ALK mutations, in particular the clinically observed G1202R solvent front mutation, L1196M gatekeeper mutation and G1202R/L1196M compound mutation.  Additionally, preclinical in vivo studies have shown that TPX-0131 has significant brain tissue penetration after repeat oral dosing supporting the potential to cross the blood-brain barrier. We plan to present additional preclinical data highlighting TPX-0131’s in vitro and in vivo profile at a medical conference in the second quarter of 2021. We plan to initiate the Phase 1/2 global study of TPX-0131 in TKI-pretreated patients with ALK+ advanced NSCLC, in the second quarter of 2021. The IND submission to the FDA is anticipated in the first quarter of 2021 and the Australian Ethics Committee has already approved the study design.

Discovery Platform
 
Our macrocycle platform is the foundation of our current drug candidate pipeline and we are applying novel small molecule design approaches integrating tumor biology and structure-based drug design to develop a new generation of orally available proprietary TKIs that we believe will have the ability to maintain or enhance inhibition of the targeted kinase in both TKI-naïve and TKI-pretreated patients. We anticipate our internal and external exploration of oncology candidates will continue to include kinome targets and other oncogenic signaling proteins and pathways that address high unmet medical needs. 
COVID-19 Pandemic
 
We have experienced disruptions to our business operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the continued evolving and uncertain global impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, we cannot precisely determine or quantify the impact this pandemic will have on our ongoing business, operations and financial performance. We have established a work-from-home policy for all employees, other than those performing or supporting business-critical activities, such as certain members of our laboratory and facilities staff. While the majority of employees continue to work from home, we continue to evaluate and update this policy based on guidance from federal, state and local government authorities. For our ongoing and planned clinical trials, while we anticipate and have experienced some temporary delays or disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular with respect to activation of additional clinical trial sites and patient enrollment we continue to work closely with our contract research organizations (CROs) and clinical sites as we navigate and seek to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on our clinical studies and current timelines. Measures we have taken in response to COVID-19, include where feasible, conducting remote clinical trial site activations and data monitoring, enabling patients to have routine tests conducted closer to home, allowing trial sites to evaluate certain patients remotely, in compliance with their local procedures, and direct-to-patient study drug shipping. In addition, we currently have sufficient supply or plans for supply to meet our anticipated clinical development needs for our drug candidates through 2021. However, depending on the length and ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, our suppliers could be adversely impacted, which may result in delays or disruptions in our current or future supply chain.  
 
We will continue to assess the duration, scope and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and the existing and potential impacts on our business, operations and financial performance, and we will continue to work closely with our third-party vendors, CROs, collaborators and other parties in order to seek to advance our drug candidate pipeline as quickly as possible, while making the health and safety of our employees and their families, healthcare providers, patients and communities a top priority. Please refer to our Risk Factors in Part I, Item IA of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Overview of Kinases and Current Limitations of Kinase Inhibitors
 Kinases are enzymes that respond to external stimuli to modulate numerous activities of cells, such as proliferation, survival and migration. ATP is utilized by kinases for phosphorylation, which triggers a signaling process. This phosphorylation process changes a kinase from an inactive conformation (unphosphorylated kinase) to an active conformation (phosphorylated kinase). A kinase often undergoes substitutions of its original amino acids by other amino acids, also known as a mutation. Kinases maintain a controlled equilibrium between the active and inactive conformations, but activating mutations shift the kinase to favor the active conformation, which can lead to aberrant cell proliferation and thus the development of certain cancers. Aberrant activation of a kinase can also occur if the kinase gene, such as ROS1, NTRK or ALK, undergoes a genomic rearrangement resulting in fusion to another gene, leading to the constitutive phosphorylation of the fusion kinase and the development of certain cancers. 
 Kinase inhibitors are designed to occupy the ATP binding site, thereby preventing the binding of ATP. Most conventional kinase inhibitors are much larger than ATP and have extra motifs that extend beyond the ATP pocket of the kinase in order to enable the kinase to have a stronger interaction with the compound than with ATP. During treatment with conventional TKIs, an acquired mutation in the kinase domain often occurs. These mutations change the surface of the kinase and block the occupancy of oversized TKIs at the ATP binding site without impacting the binding of ATP. Two or more mutations in the same protein are referred to as compound mutations.
 Based on the orientation of the extra motif, kinase inhibitors can be grouped into two types: 
  
• | Type I kinase inhibitors, such as Xalkori (crizotinib), which often have the extra motif extending to the kinase’s open solvent front area. The most common treatment acquired resistance to these inhibitors are solvent front mutations.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Type II kinase inhibitors, such as Gleevec (imatinib), which have the extra motif extending to the back pocket of the kinase. The most common treatment acquired resistance to these inhibitors are gatekeeper mutations.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 TKIs have become an important class of cancer therapies due to their ability to interrupt deregulated kinase signaling that leads to unchecked cell growth and tumor progression. Since 2001, the FDA has approved nearly 50 TKIs for the treatment of cancers. In 2019, TKIs represented approximately $25 billion in worldwide drug sales. Despite the success of this drug class, there remains a significant opportunity for a new generation of TKIs that address the shortcomings of current therapies. These shortcomings include the inability to achieve a response or limited durability of response caused by intrinsic or acquired resistance, and toxicities that limit dosage levels and duration of treatment. Many conventional kinase inhibitors are oversized, with bulky side groups and limited chemical structure diversity, and some are associated with safety issues such as QT prolongation (abnormal electrocardiography) and hepatotoxicity (liver damage). Further, the same class of kinase inhibitors often share many binding similarities and therefore often cannot be sequentially administered to effectively overcome common treatment resistant mutations. 
 

Our Approach
 5

Our macrocycle platform is the foundation of our current drug candidate pipeline and we are applying novel small molecule design approaches integrating tumor biology and structure-based drug design to develop a new generation of orally available proprietary TKIs that we believe will have the ability to maintain or enhance inhibition of the targeted kinase in both TKI-naïve and TKI-pretreated patients. Our strategy in developing our current pipeline was to design small (low molecular weight), compact TKIs with rigid macrocyclic structures that bind inside the ATP pocket of the target kinase. By binding completely inside the ATP pocket, our TKIs can bind to solvent front mutated kinases that sterically exclude conventional TKIs. In addition to potentially addressing resistance that has developed from prior lines of TKI therapy, we believe our TKIs may also prevent or delay the emergence of new resistant mutations. Furthermore, unlike conventional, flat, two-dimensional kinase inhibitor structures, we believe a rigid structure enables our TKIs to target the selected kinases in a highly potent, precise and efficient manner, which provides a base for a favorable kinase selectivity profile. Our approach to the discovery of potentially new and differentiated drug candidates is to use a methodology anchored by our structure-based drug design expertise, coupled with a disciplined chemistry approach and enabling biology. Our strategy is to study our current and future potential pipeline candidates as both single agents and in combinations that are supported by strong biologic rationale for synergy between the combined agents, while focusing on key areas of unmet medical need.
 As a precision oncology company, we seek to identify actionable targets from the molecular profiling of tumors and develop drug candidates with the potential to become best-in-class targeted therapies. Under this approach, well-documented or novel genomic alterations may be targeted to more precisely treat a range of solid tumors, including multiple variations of non-small cell lung cancer. Precision medicine is supported by advances in molecular diagnostic testing and next generation sequencing, which have enhanced the ability of physicians to identify patients who are more likely to benefit from targeted therapies. In addition, molecular targets have been shown to develop resistance over time, creating an opportunity for the development of new therapeutic options to evolve treatment paradigms. 
 Our Pipeline
 We are leveraging our macrocycle platform and applying our expertise in structure-based drug design to develop a pipeline of highly potent proprietary TKI drug candidates that are differentiated from existing kinase inhibitors and that we believe have the potential to be best-in-class. We currently have worldwide development and commercialization rights to all of our drug candidates, other than the rights licensed to Zai for repotrectinib and TPX-0022 in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.  The following chart summarizes our product pipeline.

 Repotrectinib 
 We are developing our lead drug candidate, repotrectinib, an orally administered TKI, for the treatment of both TKI-naïve and TKI-pretreated patients with ROS1+ advanced NSCLC and NTRK+ advanced solid tumors. Repotrectinib is being evaluated in an ongoing Phase 1/2 trial called TRIDENT-1 for the treatment of patients with ROS1+ advanced NSCLC and patients with NTRK+ advanced solid tumors. The FDA has granted repotrectinib breakthrough therapy designation for the treatment of patients with ROS1+ metastatic NSCLC who have not been treated with a ROS1 TKI. In addition, the FDA has granted orphan drug designation for the development of repotrectinib in patients with advanced NSCLC with adenocarcinoma histology; and three fast track designations for the treatment of (1) NTRK+ advanced solid tumor patients who have been previously treated with one prior line of chemotherapy and one or two prior TRK TKIs, (2) ROS1+ advanced NSCLC patients who have been previously treated with one prior line of platinum-based chemotherapy and one prior line of a ROS1 TKI and (3) ROS1+ advanced NSCLC patients who have not been previously treated with a ROS1 TKI. We currently have worldwide development and commercialization rights for repotrectinib, other than the rights licensed to Zai in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.
 The multi-cohort Phase 2 registrational portion of TRIDENT-1 is ongoing and we plan to conduct the Phase 2 portion of the trial in approximately 120 sites in North America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific regions, with additional sites within China. The trial is designed to enroll a total of approximately 320 patients.

There are currently two approved TKIs for each of the patient populations targeted by repotrectinib. Xalkori (crizotinib) and Rozlytrek (entrectinib) are approved for patients with metastatic ROS1+ NSCLC, and Vitrakvi (larotrectinib) and Rozlytrek (entrectinib) have received accelerated approval for patients with metastatic solid tumors that have an NTRK gene fusion (NTRK+ advanced solid tumors) without a known acquired resistant mutation.  Existing TKIs can show susceptibility to acquired mutations, and toxicities that can limit duration of treatment. In addition, crizotinib has limited activity within the CNS. There continues to be a high unmet medical need to develop novel therapies that can overcome intrinsic and acquired resistance, treat brain metastases, and prolong duration of response, with a more tolerable overall safety profile.
 Repotrectinib is a small (low molecular weight), macrocyclic TKI of ROS1, TRK, and ALK. Repotrectinib was designed to efficiently bind with the active kinase conformation and avoid steric interference from a variety of clinically resistant mutations, especially the solvent front and gatekeeper mutations of the ROS1 and TRK kinases. Repotrectinib has a rigid structure and is smaller than currently approved ROS1, TRK and ALK inhibitors. The rigid structure enables repotrectinib to precisely and efficiently bind to its oncogenic targets with a desirable selectivity profile. We believe the inhibition of JAK2, SRC and FAK may lead to a longer duration of response for patients treated with repotrectinib. 
TRIDENT-1 Phase 1/2 Trial 
 The Phase 1, dose escalation portion of TRIDENT-1, included three parts: Phase 1a (completed, n=44); Phase 1b (completed, n=28); and Phase 1c (completed, n=21). In June 2019, we initiated the Phase 2 registrational portion of TRIDENT-1, a single-arm clinical trial in approximately 320 total patients with ROS1+ advanced NSCLC and NTRK+ advanced solid tumors. The primary objective of the Phase 1 portion of TRIDENT-1 was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and a recommended Phase 2 dose of repotrectinib. The safety endpoints of the Phase 1 portion included evaluating the DLTs and adverse events. The secondary endpoint of the Phase 1 portion was confirmed objective response rate (ORR) by blinded independent radiology review (BICR), using RECIST v1.1. 
 Key inclusion criteria include: histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors, including non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (Stage IV, as classified by AJCC v.7) that harbor an ALK, ROS1, NTRK1, NTRK2, or NTRK3 gene fusion determined by local testing; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status 0-1 (able to conduct full (0) or light (1) daily activities); Age ≥ 18; prior chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy permitted; at least one measurable target lesion (including central nervous system only) according to RECIST v1.1. Key exclusion criteria include: symptomatic brain metastases; major cardiovascular history in the past six months; or history of prolonged QTc interval. 
 Solid tumors are measured by CT or MRI scan, as assessed according to RECIST v1.1, at baseline, at the end of the second cycle, after every two cycles up to cycle 18, and then every three cycles up to cycle 36. If an initial response is determined, confirmation of response requires a subsequent CT or MRI scan, generally four weeks later. 
 
Preliminary Clinical Data From TRIDENT-1 
 Phase 1 Data Reported in September 2019
 In September 2019, we reported preliminary safety, tolerability and efficacy data with repotrectinib in patients with ROS1+ advanced NSCLC, utilizing the July 22, 2019 data cutoff, with a median follow-up of 20.1 months (range: 5.3 to 24.9+). As of the July 22, 2019 data cut-off, a total of 93 patients had been dosed, 23 patients were still on treatment, and the MTD had not been reached. Of the 93 patients, 40 of 52 with ROS1+ advanced NSCLC and five of 10 with NTRK+ advanced solid tumors were evaluable by BICR. All patients received at least one dose of repotrectinib across nine dose cohorts ranging from 40 mg QD to 200 mg BID. 
 The median age of these 40 ROS1+ advanced NSCLC evaluable patients was 57.0 years (range, 30 to 79), 65% were female, and 53% were Asian. CNS metastases were reported in 20 (50%) at baseline. The median number of prior ROS1 TKIs in the 29 (73%) pretreated patients was one (range, one to three). Of the 29 patients, 18 were treated with one prior TKI (of which 12 were treated with crizotinib), seven were treated with two prior TKIs, and four were treated with three prior TKIs. There were 34 (85%) patients treated with at least one prior chemotherapy.

Also, repotrectinib showed a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 24.6 months (95% CI: 7.2–NR). The clinical benefit rate (CBR), including those who achieved stable disease for at least two cycles or a confirmed partial or complete response, was 100% (11/11) (95% CI, 72 to 100).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | three patients had measurable CNS metastases, and of the three patients, the confirmed IC-ORR was 100% (3/3) (95% CI, 29 to 100), with all three patients with measurable CNS metastases also achieving a confirmed extracranial response. Of these three patients, two remained in a response 14.8+ and 17.6+ months at the time of the data cut-off and one patient progressed at 23.1 months but remained on treatment for 25.7+ months at the time of the data cut-off.

• | TKI-pretreated ROS1+ advanced NSCLC evaluable population (n=29, which includes patients with up to three prior TKIs):
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | In ROS1+ advanced NSCLC patients treated with one prior TKI, the confirmed ORR was 39% (7/18) (95% CI, 17 to 64). At our Phase 2 dose of 160 mg QD or above, 55% (6/11) of patients previously treated with one prior ROS1 TKI achieved a confirmed PR. Additionally, 57% (4/7) of patients previously treated with one prior platinum-based chemotherapy regimen and one prior ROS1 TKI at our Phase 2 dose of 160 mg QD or above achieved a confirmed PR.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Of the seven patients treated with two prior TKIs, two (29%) (95% CI, 4 to 71) achieved a confirmed PR.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | At the time of the data cut-off, of the nine responders within the ROS1+ TKI pretreated patient population, two patients had DORs of 4.4 and 13.0 months and despite progression, remained on treatment for 21.2 and 22.0 months, respectively. Two patients were censored early despite remaining in response at the time of discontinuing treatment (one due to clinical progression and one due to withdrawal of consent). The remaining five patients have DORs ranging from 3.7+ months to 11.1 months and remained on treatment ranging from 5.5+ months to 19.3+ months.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Four out of five TKI-pretreated patients with measurable CNS disease at baseline were treated with one prior TKI and the confirmed IC-ORR in these patients was 75% (3/4) (95% CI, 19 to 99), with 80% (4/5) of patients treated with any number of prior TKIs showing tumor regressions.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Of the 40 evaluable patients with ROS1+ advanced NSCLC who received treatment with repotrectinib, 45% (18/40) remained on treatment as of the July 22, 2019 data cut-off. The primary reason for treatment discontinuation was radiologic or clinical disease progression (18 patients). Two patients discontinued repotrectinib due to an adverse event; one was a DLT of Grade 3 hypoxia and dyspnea at a dose of 160 mg BID and the other was a patient with ROS1+ NSCLC initially treated at 120 mg QD who escalated to 160 mg BID due to disease progression 30 days prior to the event of Grade 5 treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) of respiratory failure reported as related to disease progression and not treatment related.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Repotrectinib was generally well tolerated. The most frequent TEAEs were Grade 1 or 2. The TEAEs reported in >25% of patients were dizziness (58%), dysgeusia (48%), anemia (30%), fatigue (30%), constipation (30%), dyspnea (29%), and paresthesia (29%). There were few Grade 3 treatment-related AEs (anemia (n=3); dizziness (n=3); and dyspnea, hypophosphatemia, hypoxia, lymphopenia, pleural effusion, syncope and weight increase (all n=1)), and no Grade 4 treatment-related AEs or cases of dizziness leading to treatment discontinuation.

Interim Phase 2 Data and Updated Phase 1 Data, Reported in August 2020
 
On August 19, 2020, we reported early interim data from the Phase 2 portion of TRIDENT-1, utilizing a July 10, 2020 data cutoff, in the first 39 treated patients who had at least one post-baseline scan as of the data cutoff date. Responses were confirmed with a subsequent scan at least 28 days later per RECIST v1.1 and were determined by physician assessment. Patients were enrolled across six countries. Across all cohorts reported, median follow-up was 3.6 months (range:  0.4 – 7.4+), and median duration of treatment was 3.7 months (range:  0.7-8.2+).  

o | In the ROS1-positive TKI-naïve NSCLC population (EXP-1: n=7), six patients achieved a confirmed response for an ORR of 86%. The duration of response ranged from 0.9+ to 2.0+ months and all patients who achieved a response remained in a response at the time of the data cutoff. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

o | In the ROS1+ NSCLC population pretreated with one prior TKI with prior chemotherapy (EXP-2: n=5), two patients achieved a confirmed response for an ORR of 40%, including our first confirmed complete response, or cCR, in a patient with a documented G2032R solvent front mutation after prior treatment with entrectinib. The durations of response were 4.5 and 5.6+ months at the time of the data cutoff.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | In the ROS1+NSCLC population pretreated with one prior TKI without prior chemotherapy (EXP-4: n=6), four patients achieved a confirmed response for an ORR of 67%. The duration of response ranged from 1.0+ to 5.7+ months with all four patients remaining in a response at the time of the data cutoff.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | In the ROS1+NSCLC population pretreated with two prior TKIs without prior chemotherapy (patients enrolled under the initial protocol and analyzed for efficacy in a separate cohort, EXP-Other: n=5) two patients achieved a confirmed response for an ORR of 40%.

Repotrectinib Clinical Development Plan
 The ongoing Phase 2 portion of TRIDENT-1 is our single-arm clinical trial in approximately 320 total patients to support the registration of repotrectinib in patients with ROS1+ advanced NSCLC and NTRK+ advanced solid tumors. The trial is evaluating repotrectinib as a single agent at the recommended Phase 2 dose and is enrolling patients across six patient expansion cohorts with ROS1+ advanced NSCLC (EXP-1, EXP-2, EXP-3 and EXP-4), and NTRK+ advanced solid tumors (EXP-5 and EXP-6). The trial design for the Phase 2 portion of TRIDENT-1 is illustrated in the following figure. 
 

All patients in the Phase 2 portion of TRIDENT-1 receive repotrectinib orally at a starting dose of 160 mg QD for the first 14 days of treatment, after which the dose may be increased to 160 mg BID based on patient tolerability, for 28 consecutive days in repeated four-week cycles. The primary objective is to determine the confirmed ORR based on BICR as assessed by RECIST v1.1. Patients are evaluated by either CT or MRI every two cycles and responses will be confirmed approximately four weeks after initial response determination. A CT or MRI scan will be performed at the end of treatment. Patients are able to continue treatment after documented disease progression, provided the patient is deriving clinical benefit. Patients discontinuing study treatment will enter the survival follow-up period and remain on trial until death, loss of follow-up, or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurs first. The key secondary objectives of the trial include intracranial tumor response and duration of response. In December 2018, we completed an End of Phase 1 Meeting with the FDA during which we received feedback on TRIDENT-1 and guidance on the design of the Phase 2 portion: 
 
 
• | EXP-1. The current single-arm design could support either accelerated or standard approval. A minimum duration of follow up of at least 12 months from the onset of response for all responding patients would be required to support standard approval.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 13

 
• | EXP-2 and EXP-3. The current single-arm design could support accelerated approval in the context of available therapy at the time of submission.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | EXP-4. This cohort has been revised since the End of Phase 1 Meeting with the FDA.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | EXP-5 and EXP-6. The current single-arm design could support approval with a minimum of five distinct tumor types evaluated. A minimum duration of follow up of at least 12 months from the onset of response for all responding patients would be required.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential approval by the FDA will be based on the totality of the evidence related to ORR and duration of response, as well as overall risk-benefit assessment in the context of available therapy.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In August 2020, we reported additional feedback received from the FDA, and modifications we have since made to the TRIDENT-1 study design, that may provide a faster path to potential approval for repotrectinib. The FDA reiterated, among other points, that the adequacy of the data to support approval will depend upon the observed ORR and the duration of response assessed in the context of available therapy in a risk-benefit analysis during new drug application (NDA) review. Study design modifications and FDA feedback include the following:  
 
 
• | Phase 2 cohort sample sizes to support potential approval may include Phase 1 patients treated at the recommended Phase 2 dose.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In the EXP-2 Cohort (ROS1 TKI-Pretreated with one prior TKI and one platinum-based regimen), the sample size is decreased from previous target of 100 patients to 60 total patients with one formal interim analysis after approximately 30 patients. A minimum duration of follow up of 6 months from the last response may be sufficient to support approval.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In the EXP-4 Cohort (ROS1 TKI-Pretreated with one prior TKI and no prior chemotherapy), the sample size is increased to a target of 60 patients with one formal interim analysis after approximately 30 patients. Previously, EXP-4 was an exploratory cohort in this patient population. A minimum duration of follow up of 6 months from the last response may be sufficient to support approval.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In the EXP-5 and EXP-6 Cohorts (TRK TKI-Naïve and TKI-Pretreated), a minimum of 9 months and 6 months of follow up, respectively, from the last response may be sufficient to support approval.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Based on the breakthrough therapy designation for the treatment of patients with ROS1+ metastatic NSCLC who have not been treated with a ROS1 TKI, and the preliminary data in EXP-1 we reported in January 2021, we plan to discuss the next steps towards potential registration of repotrectinib in this patient population at a Type B meeting with the FDA in the second quarter of 2021. We also anticipate providing clinical data and enrollment updates for other cohorts in the study in the second half of 2021.
 Companion Diagnostic
 We have developed a prototype companion diagnostic that is being used as a clinical trial assay to confirm the presence of ROS1+ or NTRK+ gene fusions in patients enrolled in the Phase 2 portion of TRIDENT-1. We received investigational device exemption from the FDA for our clinical trial assay, in May 2019, which allows its use as an investigational device in the Phase 2 portion of TRIDENT-1 and supports a potential future pre-market approval (PMA) application to the FDA. We are also enrolling patients into the Phase 2 portion of TRIDENT-1 based on the results of select laboratory developed tests (LDTs) and other tests used by the clinical sites.

Pediatric Strategy 
 Beyond TRIDENT-1, we are conducting an open-label Phase 1/2 single arm, multi-center, dose-escalation, safety and pharmacokinetics clinical trial of repotrectinib in pediatric and young adult patients with ALK+, ROS1+, or NTRK+ advanced solid tumors. The Phase 1 portion of this trial is a dose finding study in patients aged <12 years old. The Phase 2 portion is designed to enroll patients into 3 separate cohorts based on the identified oncogenic driver and prior treatment, (1) NTRK+ TKI-naïve, (2) NTRK+ TKI-pretreated and (3) Other NTRK, ALK, ROS1 genetic alterations not otherwise specified. 
 Combination Strategy
We believe our preliminary safety data and antitumor activity from TRIDENT-1 support pursuing combination therapies for repotrectinib. Preclinical studies have shown that repotrectinib inhibits JAK2, SRC, and FAK, which leads to modulation of Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling, one of the major signaling pathways for both intrinsic and acquired treatment resistance. The combination of repotrectinib with a KRAS G12C inhibitor showed preclinical synergy inhibiting KRAS G12C tumor cell proliferation, suppressing receptor tyrosine kinase upregulation and reducing KRAS G12C tumor cell cytokine release. The combination of repotrectinib with a KRAS G12C inhibitor in vivo showed significantly increased survival in a lung model (H2122, G12C) relative to each agent given alone. The combination of repotrectinib with a MEK inhibitor showed preclinical synergy in mutant KRAS NSCLC, colorectal cancer and pancreatic cancer cell lines as well as demonstrating enhanced activity in vivo. These results suggest that the combination of repotrectinib with a MEK inhibitor can repress the mutant KRAS signaling network to achieve more potent and durable anti-tumor activity. Based on our preclinical studies of repotrectinib in combination with investigational and approved agents targeting KRAS-driven solid tumors we plan to initiate a multi-arm Phase 2 combination study in mid-2021 evaluating repotrectinib in combination with other agent(s) in patients with KRAS-mutant advanced solid tumors. The planned trial is a Phase 1b/2 multi-center, open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of repotrectinib in combination with anticancer therapies in multiple cohorts, for the treatment of subjects with advanced KRAS-mutant solid tumors. Each cohort is designed to consist of a Phase 1b dose finding portion and a Phase 2 dose expansion portion. We plan to present additional preclinical data highlighting repotrectinib’s combination potential in KRAS-mutant disease at a medical conference in the second quarter of 2021.
 TPX-0022—A Novel MET/SRC/CSF1R Inhibitor 
 Background
 We are developing TPX-0022, our MET/SRC/CSF1R orally administered TKI, for the treatment of both TKI-naïve and TKI-pretreated patients with advanced solid tumors harboring genetic alterations in MET. Our ongoing Phase 1 SHIELD-1 clinical trial of TPX-0022 is designed to evaluate the overall safety profile, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of TPX-0022. We currently have worldwide development and commercialization rights for TPX-0022, other than the rights licensed to Zai in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.
 MET-alterations are well documented in multiple solid tumors, notably NSCLC and gastrointestinal cancers such as gastric and colorectal. Three to 4% of NSCLC are estimated to be driven by MET exon 14 skipping mutations, and up to 6% are estimated to be driven by MET amplification. It is also estimated that approximately 15-20% of patients with EGFR driven NSCLC will develop resistance due to MET amplification following treatment with an EGFR TKI. In addition, 3-5% of gastric cancers are estimated to be driven by MET amplification. There are currently two FDA approved MET TKIs, Tabrecta (capmatinib) and Tepmetko (tepotinib), for NSCLC patients with MET exon 14 skipping mutations. There continues to be a high unmet medical need to develop novel therapies for MET driven disease that can prolong duration of response for MET exon 14 skipping NSCLC with a more tolerable overall safety profile, and for MET amplification in NSCLC and other tumor types where there are no approved therapies.  

TPX-0022 is a multi-targeted orally bioavailable Type I TKI with a novel macrocyclic structure that potently inhibits MET, SRC and CSF1R, in preclinical assays. MET is a receptor tyrosine kinase. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is the high-affinity natural ligand of MET. MET alterations, including point mutations, amplifications, fusions, exon 14 skipping, and the generation of HGF-MET autocrine loops have been reported in many cancers. 
 
SRC and STAT3 can act cooperatively as upstream regulators of HGF expression, resulting in establishment of an HGF autocrine/paracrine loop, signal amplification, and an invasive phenotype. SRC inhibition may have the potential to reduce or abolish the upregulation of HGF via the modulation of STAT3 signaling. Targeting CSF1R (colony stimulating factor 1 receptor) leads to the modulation of tumor associated macrophages (TAMs), which is a promising therapeutic strategy for TPX-0022 as a single agent or in combination with standard of care chemotherapy and immunotherapy in various 
 15

solid tumors. Macrophages are cells in the immune system that generally detect and destroy diseased cells. TAMs, however, are macrophages that have a tumor-promoting function based on their capacity to secrete growth factors and suppress the immune system. Survival of TAMs is mediated by signaling through CSF1R. In addition, autocrine and paracrine upregulation of HGF can limit the likelihood of response and duration of response achieved with the current investigational MET inhibitors in the clinic.
 
Preclinical data demonstrates that TPX-0022 can reprogram tumor associated macrophages as well as support antigen presentation and activation of T cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME). This unique profile engaging autocrine signaling pathways is expected to more effectively suppress CSF1R/MET mediated signaling in tumor cells and the stroma which can contribute to tumor invasiveness and metastasis. We plan to present additional preclinical data highlighting TPX-0022’s effects on the tumor microenvironment at a medical meeting in the second quarter of 2021. 
 SHIELD-1 Phase 1 Trial
 
TPX-0022 is currently being evaluated in an ongoing Phase 1 study called SHIELD-1 for the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors harboring genetic alterations in MET, which was initiated in July 2019. MET genetic alterations –exon 14 skipping, amplification, fusion or oncogenic kinase domain mutations -- are assessed by local testing. The dose finding portion of the study employs a 3+3 design with plans to move to dose expansion in multiple cohorts once the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) is achieved. Responses are evaluated by RECIST v1.1. The primary objectives of the study are to evaluate safety and tolerability of TPX-0022 and to determine the maximum tolerated dose and RP2D. Upon determination of the recommended Phase 2 dose, the study would then evaluate multiple dose expansion cohorts for a targeted enrollment of approximately 180 patients.
Preliminary Clinical Data From SHIELD-1 
 
In October 2020, we reported early interim data from the dose finding portion of SHIELD-1, utilizing an October 15, 2020 data cutoff date. As of the data cutoff date, a total of 22 patients with MET-altered tumors were enrolled in the study, of which 21 had been treated with TPX-0022 at dose levels from 20 mg QD to 120 mg QD. Patients were selected for MET alterations by local testing, including exon 14 skipping, MET amplification, fusion or oncogenic kinase domain mutations. Patients had a median of three prior lines of therapy (range from 1 to 6) with the majority of patients having received multiple rounds of prior combination chemotherapy. All patients received at least one prior line of chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy.
 
As of the data cutoff date, 15 patients were evaluable for efficacy, including 10 who were TKI-naïve (four colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, three NSCLC patients and three gastric or gastroesophageal (GE) junction cancer patients) and five who were TKI-pretreated (all of whom were NSCLC patients). Seven patients were not evaluable for efficacy including four patients who were awaiting a first post-baseline scan; two patients who discontinued treatment prior to first post-baseline scan; and one patient who had no baseline measurable disease. Of the 10 MET TKI-naïve patients, five achieved a partial response, including three gastric or GE junction cancer patients, one CRC patient and one NSCLC patient. All three evaluable patients with gastric or GE junction tumors achieved a response. Of the five responding patients, three patients achieved a confirmed response, and two patients remained on treatment in a response and were awaiting confirmation at the time of the data cutoff. Of the five MET TKI-pretreated NSCLC patients, three patients treated with multiple rounds of prior therapy achieved a best response of stable disease with two patients showing tumor measurement improvements (-27% and -75% accordingly). Nine of 15 patients (9/15) achieved clinical benefit (confirmed or unconfirmed partial response or stable disease). Six of 15 patients (6/15) remained on treatment with duration of treatment ranging from 7.6+ to 34+ weeks. 
 
TPX-0022 was generally well tolerated, with the most frequent TEAE being Grade 1 or 2 dizziness. TEAEs reported in greater than 20 percent of patients were dizziness (n=12; 57%); lipase increased (n=7; 33%); fatigue (n=7; 33%); amylase increased (n=6; 29%); nausea (n=6; 29%); vomiting (n=6; 29%); constipation (n=5; 24%); and anemia (n=5; 24%). The majority of TRAEs were Grade 1 or 2. As of the data cutoff date: there was one TRAE of Grade 3 weight gain, and there were no Grade 4 or 5 TRAEs; the maximum tolerated dose had not been determined with five patients having TEAEs that led to dose reduction; and at the 120 mg daily dose, there had been one dose-limiting toxicity of treatment related Grade 2 dizziness that led to treatment discontinuation. In addition, as of the data cutoff date, clinical pharmacokinetic data suggested sustained MET inhibition throughout the dosing interval across all doses.

TPX-0022 Clinical Development Plan

The Phase 1 SHIELD-1 study of TPX-0022 is ongoing. We are currently evaluating multiple doses/schedules to optimize pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy profile to determine a recommended Phase 2 dose with the goal of selecting the recommended Phase 2 dose in the second quarter of 2021. Upon determination of the recommended Phase 2 dose, the study would then evaluate multiple dose expansion cohorts for a targeted enrollment of approximately 180 patients. We plan to discuss the ongoing Phase 1 SHIELD-1 study with the FDA to potentially modify the trial into a registrational Phase 1/2 design, with the goal of initiating the Phase 2 portion in the second half of 2021, pending FDA feedback. We anticipate reporting updated data from the dose finding portion of the SHIELD-1 study in the second half of 2021. In parallel, based on the SHIELD-1 study initial findings, a Phase 1b/2 combination study with TPX-0022 and an EGFR targeted therapy in patients with EGFR mutated MET-amplified NSCLC is also planned for initiation in the second half of 2021.
TPX-0046—A Novel RET Inhibitor 
 TPX-0046 is a multi-targeted orally bioavailable, Type I TKI with a novel macrocyclic structure that is being developed as a RET kinase inhibitor. The Phase 1 portion of our Phase 1/2 clinical trial of TPX-0046 in patients with advanced solid tumors harboring RET genetic alterations is ongoing. The trial is designed to enroll TKI-naïve and TKI-pretreated patients We currently have worldwide development and commercialization rights for TPX-0046.
 
RET is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK). Constitutive activation of RET through gain-of-function mutations, amplifications and fusions have been found in multiple tumor types, including lung cancer, thyroid cancer and colon cancer. To date, two approved RET inhibitors, GAVRETO (pralsetinib) and RETEVMO (selpercatinib), are marketed for patients with RET-positive NSCLC and thyroid cancer. In addition, multi-targeted TKIs that inhibit RET have been approved by the FDA in thyroid cancer. We evaluated the antiproliferation activities of TPX-0046, pralsetinib and selpercatinib in Ba/F3 cells expressing KIF5B-RET, KIF5B-RET V804M, KIF5B-RET Y806N, KIF5B-RET G810S or KIF5B-RET G810R. The results against the same cell lines by TPX-0046 may vary slightly among different experiments within acceptable experimental variations. Consistent with the RET enzymatic data, TPX-0046 generally showed comparable or stronger potency as compared to pralsetinib and selpercatinib in the Ba/F3 KIF5B-RET cell proliferation assay against wildtype RET and many mutated RETs, and less potency against the gatekeeper mutation RET V804M. A recent published study reported that RET G810 solvent front mutations represent the first described recurrent mechanism of resistance to selective RET inhibition with selpercatinib in the clinic. TPX-0046 is shown to be the most potent compound in Ba/F3 KIF5B-RET G810/R/S cell proliferation assays, whereas pralsetinib and selpercatinib are shown to have minimal activity against the solvent front mutation RET G810R. The results are summarized below. 
 
 
 | Cell Proliferation IC50 (nM)
--------------+-----------------------------
Inhibitor | Ba/F3 KIF5B-RET WT | Ba/F3 KIF5B-RET G810R (Solvent front mutation) | Ba/F3 KIF5B-RET G810S (Solvent front mutation) | Ba/F3 KIF5B-RET Y806N (Hinge mutation) | Ba/F3 KIF5B-RET V804M (Gatekeeper mutation)
TPX-0046 | 0.4 | 16.9 | 0.4 | 10.6 | 533 
Pralsetinib | 0.2 | 568 | 72.9 | 16.3 | 23.4 
Selpercatinib | 0.7 | 749 | 6.9 | 27.9 | 1.1 

 
Data for pralsetinib and selpercatinib based on evaluation of each corresponding proxy chemical compound purchased from commercial sources rather than from the pharmaceutical companies developing the respective kinase inhibitor. IC50 values for WT, G810R and V804M are from at least 3 independent experiments.  The IC50 values for G810S and Y806N are from 1 to 2 independent experiments and include at least three independent replicates. 
 As demonstrated by both the enzyme-based and the cell-based assay data above, TPX-0046 has shown strong potency against wildtype and many mutated RETs, although TPX-0046 is not as potent against RET gatekeeper mutations when compared to wildtype and the solvent front mutation G810R. 
 To further support the activity of TPX-0046 against the solvent front mutation G810R, we evaluated TPX-0046 and selpercatinib and pralsetinib in a Ba/F3 KIF5B-RET G810R cell-derived tumor model. Consistent with the in vitro cellular and enzymatic data, TPX-0046 has strong activity against the G810R mutation with complete tumor regression in 9 out of 10 mice when dosed at 10 mg/kg twice a day while pralsetinib and selpercatinib had minimal tumor growth inhibition at the same dose level by percent of tumor growth inhibition.

TPX-0046 Clinical Development Plan

The Phase 1 dose finding portion of the Phase 1/2 study of TPX-0046 is ongoing. Under the study design, upon determination of the recommended Phase 2 dose, the study would then evaluate multiple dose expansion cohorts for a targeted enrollment of approximately 300 patients. We plan to report early initial data from the Phase 1 dose finding portion of the study in the second quarter of 2021, which will focus primarily on safety and any early signals of efficacy and we anticipate will include approximately 15 to 20 patients across multiple doses.
 
TPX-0131 – A Next-Generation ALK Inhibitor 
 We are developing TPX-0131, our orally administered ALK inhibitor, for the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors harboring ALK gene fusions. TPX-0131 has demonstrated preclinical potency against wild type ALK fusion proteins as well as a broad spectrum of acquired resistance mutations, especially compound mutations which currently lack any effective ALK inhibitor therapy. Preclinical in vivo studies have shown that TPX-0131 has significant brain tissue penetration after repeat oral dosing achieving brain tissue concentrations over 60% of the plasma concentration supporting the potential to cross the blood-brain barrier. We plan to present additional preclinical data highlighting TPX-0131’s in vitro and in vivo profile at a medical conference in the second quarter of 2021. We plan to initiate the Phase 1/2 global study of TPX-0131 in ALK+ advanced NSCLC in the second quarter of 2021. The IND submission to the FDA is anticipated in the first quarter of 2021 and the Australian Ethics Committee has already approved the study design. Our trial is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of TPX-0131, determine a recommended Phase 2 dose and assess preliminary clinical activity in TKI-pretreated patients. After determination of the recommended Phase 2 dose in the dose finding portion of the study, TPX-0131 would be evaluated in multiple dose expansion cohorts for a targeted enrollment of approximately 180 patients. We currently have worldwide development and commercialization rights for TPX-0131. 
 Clinically significant ALK gene fusions are oncogenic drivers and have been found in a number of human cancers, especially in NSCLC. Approximately 3-5% of NSCLC tumors harbor oncogenic ALK fusions. Currently, there are five FDA approved ALK inhibitors available for the treatment of ALK+ NSCLC. Sequential therapy with a next-generation selective ALK inhibitor with increased potency and effectiveness against ALK resistance mutations is a key strategy for treating ALK+ NSCLC patients. The most common solvent front mutation ALK G1202R confers resistance to the current approved ALK inhibitors with one study showing the prevalence of this specific solvent front mutation in approximately 40% of patients treated with a prior ALK inhibitor who developed a resistant mutation. Lorlatinib is the only approved ALK inhibitor that has demonstrated clinical efficacy in ALK+ NSCLC patients who developed the ALK G1202R mutation from a prior ALK TKI. More recently, compound mutations have been reported in patients after treatment with two or three ALK TKIs. One such example is the compound mutation ALK G1202R/L1196M, which confers resistance to currently approved therapies, including lorlatinib.  
 
TPX-0131 is a next-generation ALK inhibitor drug candidate designed with a compact macrocyclic structure, and in preclinical studies has been shown to potently inhibit wildtype ALK and numerous ALK mutations, in particular the clinically observed G1202R solvent front mutation and G1202R/L1196M compound mutation. 
 
TPX-0131 showed comparable or stronger potency against wildtype ALK and many mutated forms of ALK in Ba/F3 cell proliferation assays against other ALK inhibitors as summarized below. TPX-0131 was 11 – 550-fold more potent toward the gatekeeper mutation (L1196M) in cell proliferation assays than previous generations of ALK inhibitors. In preclinical in vivo rat brain distribution studies, TPX-0131 demonstrated significant brain penetration after oral dosing. We believe access to the CNS compartment will be important in treating brain metastases.

Discovery Platform
 Our macrocycle platform is the foundation of our current drug candidate pipeline and we are applying novel small molecule design approaches integrating tumor biology and structure-based drug design to develop a new generation of orally available proprietary targeted agents that we believe will have the potential to address important unmet medical needs for patients. We anticipate our internal and external exploration of oncology candidates will continue to include kinome targets and other oncogenic signaling proteins and pathways that address high unmet medical needs. 
Collaborations and License Agreements
  Zai - repotrectinib
 In July 2020, we entered into a license agreement with Zai (the Zai Repotrectinib Agreement), pursuant to which we granted Zai exclusive rights to develop and commercialize products containing repotrectinib (Repotrectinib Products) in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, also collectively referred to as Greater China or the Zai Territory.  We retain exclusive rights to, among other things, develop, manufacture and commercialize the Repotrectinib Products outside the Zai Territory.

 Under the terms of the Zai Repotrectinib Agreement, Zai has a first right to negotiate a license in the Zai Territory to up to two additional drug candidates in our pipeline, if we seek to license the right to commercialize any such drug candidate in a territory that primarily includes one or more regions in the Zai Territory (but excluding a proposed worldwide license). Zai has exercised its right of first negotiation with respect to one of these drug candidates, TPX-0022.
 The Zai Repotrectinib Agreement will continue in effect until expiration of the last royalty term for a Repotrectinib Product in any region in the Zai Territory, where the royalty term for a Repotrectinib Product in a region continues until the later of (i) the expiry of the last-to-expire valid claim within our patent rights that covers the Repotrectinib Product in such region in the Zai Territory; (ii) the expiry of the regulatory exclusivity for such Repotrectinib Product in such region; or (iii) the close of business of the day that is exactly 10 years after the date of the first commercial sale of such Repotrectinib Product in such region. Subject to the terms of the Zai Repotrectinib Agreement, Zai may terminate the Zai Repotrectinib Agreement for convenience by providing written notice to us, which termination will be effective following a prescribed notice period. In addition, we may terminate the Zai Repotrectinib Agreement under specified circumstances if Zai or certain other parties challenge our patent rights. Either party may terminate the Zai Repotrectinib Agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach of the Zai Repotrectinib Agreement, with a customary notice and cure period, for the other party’s insolvency or if the other party acquires a third party and the acquired party is engaged in activities with a competing product that are not divested or discontinued within a specified period. After termination (but not natural expiration), other than 
 19

certain terminations by Zai for cause, we are entitled to retain a worldwide and perpetual license from Zai to exploit the Repotrectinib Products.
 Zai – TPX-0022
  In January 2021, we entered into a license agreement with Zai (the Zai TPX-0022 Agreement), pursuant to which we granted Zai exclusive rights to develop and commercialize products containing our drug candidate, TPX-0022 (TPX-0022 Products), in the Zai Territory. We retain exclusive rights to, among other things, develop, manufacture and commercialize the TPX-0022 Products outside the Zai Territory. Pursuant to the terms of the Zai TPX-0022 Agreement, we will receive an upfront cash payment of $25.0 million and will be eligible to receive up to approximately $336.0 million in development and sales milestone payments, consisting of up to approximately $121.0 million of development milestones and up to $215.0 million of sales milestones. In addition, during the term of the Zai TPX-0022 Agreement, Zai will pay us tiered percentage royalties ranging from mid-teens to low twenties on annual net sales of the TPX-0022 Products in the Zai Territory, subject to adjustments in specified circumstances.
 Pursuant to the terms of the Zai TPX-0022 Agreement, Zai will be responsible for conducting the development and commercialization activities in the Zai Territory related to the TPX-0022 Products at Zai’s own expense, subject to limited exceptions pursuant to which we may be responsible for the cost. Zai will participate in global clinical studies of the TPX-0022 Products through clinical trial sites in the Zai Territory as agreed as of the effective date of the Zai TPX-0022 Agreement and Zai may, at Zai’s election, subject to specified exceptions, participate in future global clinical studies of the TPX-0022 Products through clinical trial sites in the Zai Territory, in each case at Zai’s expense. 
 Subject to specified exceptions, during the term of the Zai TPX-0022 Agreement, Zai has agreed that neither it nor its affiliates, its licensees and its sublicensees will conduct any development, manufacturing and commercialization activities with specified products that would compete with the TPX-0022 Products in or outside the Zai Territory and we have agreed that neither we nor our affiliates, licensees and sublicensees of TPX-0022 Products will conduct any development, manufacturing and commercialization activities with such competing products in the Zai Territory, other than manufacturing activities in support of activities outside the Zai Territory. Under the terms of the Zai TPX-0022 Agreement, if we are acquired in a change of control transaction, our acquirer will have a first right to negotiate with Zai the right to co-commercialize the TPX-0022 Products in the Zai Territory.
 Under the terms of the Zai TPX-0022 Agreement, we have a first right to negotiate a license outside the Zai Territory to a potential drug candidate from one of Zai’s pipeline programs, if Zai files an IND for the drug candidate.
 The Zai TPX-0022 Agreement will continue in effect until expiration of the last royalty term for a TPX-0022 Product in any region in the Zai Territory, where the royalty term for a TPX-0022 Product in a region continues until the later of (i) the expiry of the last-to-expire valid claim within our patent rights that covers the TPX-0022 Product in such region in the Zai Territory; (ii) the expiry of the regulatory exclusivity for such TPX-0022 Product in such region; or (iii) the close of business of the day that is exactly 10 years after the date of the first commercial sale of such TPX-0022 Product in such region. Subject to the terms of the Zai TPX-0022 Agreement, Zai may terminate the Zai TPX-0022 Agreement for convenience by providing written notice to us, which termination will be effective following a prescribed notice period. In addition, we may terminate the Zai TPX-0022 Agreement under specified circumstances if Zai or certain other parties challenge our patent rights. Either party may terminate the Zai TPX-0022 Agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach of the Zai TPX-0022 Agreement, with a customary notice and cure period, for the other party’s insolvency or if the other party acquires a third party and the acquired party is engaged in activities with a competing product that are not divested or discontinued within a specified period. After termination (but not natural expiration), other than certain terminations by Zai for cause, we are entitled to retain a worldwide and perpetual license from Zai to exploit the TPX-0022 Products.
 Commercial Operations 
 For repotrectinib, we intend to establish our own commercial and marketing organization in the United States and to selectively establish partnerships in markets outside the United States. We intend to build a specialist sales force to target physicians who are high prescribers of treatments for solid tumors. We expect that the sales force will be supported by sales management, internal sales support, an internal marketing group and distribution support. Additionally, we expect that the sales and marketing teams will manage relationships with key accounts such as managed care organizations, group purchasing organizations, hospital systems, physician group networks, and government accounts. To develop the appropriate commercial infrastructure, we expect to invest significant amounts of financial and management resources, some of which will be committed prior to approval of repotrectinib, which we may never obtain. 
 20

For our other drug candidates, we intend to retain commercialization rights in the United States and leverage our commercial and marketing organization for repotrectinib, assuming we obtain regulatory approval in the United States. For certain drug candidates, we will consider entering into relationships with strategic partners that enable the expansion of the ongoing clinical development, while retaining significant value for our stockholders. These pharmaceutical company partnerships could focus on specific patient populations and their caregivers, on regional development, or on distribution and sales.
Manufacturing and Supply
 We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely for the foreseeable future, on third parties for the manufacture of our drug candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture of any drugs that we may commercialize. To date, we have obtained active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and clinical drug supply for repotrectinib and our other drug candidates for our preclinical and ongoing and planned Phase 1 and Phase 2 testing from third-party manufacturers. We obtain our supplies from these manufacturers on a purchase order basis and do not have long-term supply arrangements in place. We do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply for APIs and drug product. For all of our drug candidates, we intend to identify and qualify additional manufacturers to provide the APIs and drug product prior to submission of a NDA to the FDA or other marketing authorization applications to other regulatory authorities. 
 All our drug candidates are compounds of low molecular weight, generally called small molecules. They can be manufactured from readily available starting materials in reliable and reproducible synthetic processes that are amenable to scale-up and do not require specialized equipment in the manufacturing process. We expect to continue to develop drug candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities. We generally expect to rely on third parties for the manufacture of any companion diagnostics we may develop. 
 Competition 
 The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary drugs. We compete in the segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that address inhibition of kinases in cancer. While we believe that our technology, development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any drug candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing drugs and new drugs that may become available in the future. 
 Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved drugs than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient enrollment in clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. 
 We could see a reduction or elimination in our commercial opportunity if our competitors develop and commercialize drugs that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient to administer, are less expensive or with a more favorable label than repotrectinib or any other drugs that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their drugs more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our drug candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the effectiveness of companion diagnostics, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. 
 Repotrectinib Competition
 If we are successful in developing repotrectinib, we expect that repotrectinib will compete against approved drugs, including: crizotinib, which is marketed by Pfizer Inc. under the name Xalkori for the treatment of ROS1+ and ALK+ NSCLC, entrectinib, which is marketed by F. Hoffman La Roche AG under the name Rozlytrek, for the treatment of ROS1+ NSCLC and TRK+ solid tumors; and larotrectinib, which is marketed by Bayer AG under the trade name Vitrakvi, for the 
 21

treatment of TRK+ solid tumors. We also expect that repotrectinib will compete against other compounds which are currently in late-stage clinical development, including TKIs in Phase 2, or later for the treatment of ROS1+ NSCLC at companies including Pfizer Inc. (lorlatinib), Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation (ceritinib), Betta Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. (ensartinib), Exelixis, Inc. (cabozantinib), and AnHeart Therapeutics Company (taletrectinib) and TKIs in Phase 2, or later, clinical development for the treatment of TRK+ solid tumors at companies including Bayer AG (selitrectinib) Exelixis, Inc. (cabozantinib) and AnHeart Therapeutics Company (taletrectinib). 
 TPX-0022 Competition
 If we are successful in developing TPX-0022, we expect it will compete against approved drugs including: capmatinib, which is marketed by Novartis Pharmaceutical Corporation under the name Tabrecta for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have a mutation that leads to MET exon 14 skipping, and tepotinib, which is marketed by Merck KGaA under the name Tepmetko, for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have a mutation that leads to MET exon 14 skipping.  We also expect that TPX-0022 will compete against Xalkori (crizotinib) and other compounds which are in Phase 2 or later clinical development for the treatment of MET+ tumors at companies including AstraZeneca PLC and Hutchison China MediTech Limited (savolitinib), Exelixis, Inc. (cabozantinib), Apollomics, Inc. (APL-101), Johnson & Johnson (amivantamab), Servier (Sym015) and AbbVie Inc. (telisotuzumab vedotin). 
TPX-0046 Competition
 If we are successful in developing TPX-0046, we expect it will compete against selpercatinib, which is marketed by Eli Lilly and Company under the name Retevmo for the treatment of NSCLC, medullary thyroid cancer and other types of thyroid cancer in patients with RET gene alterations; and pralsetinib, which is marketed by F. Hoffman La Roche AG and Blueprint Medicines Corporation under the name Gavreto for the treatment of NSCLC, medullary thyroid cancer and other types of thyroid cancer in patients with RET gene alterations. There are also two multi-targeted inhibitors that target RET, cabozantinib which is marketed by Exelixis, Inc under the name Cometriq and vandetanib, which is marketed by Sanofi Genzyme under the name Caprelsa, both for the treatment of progressive medullary thyroid cancer (MTC).
TPX-0131 Competition
 If we are successful in developing TPX-0131, we expect that TPX-0131 will compete against approved drugs, including: alectinib, which is marketed by F. Hoffman La Roche AG under the name Alecensa for the treatment of ALK+ NSCLC; brigatinib, which is marketed by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited under the name Alunbrig for the treatment of ALK+ NSCLC; ceritinib, which is marketed by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation under the name Zykadia for the treatment of ALK+ NSCLC; crizotinib, which is marketed by Pfizer Inc. under the name Xalkori for the treatment of ROS1+ and ALK+ NSCLC; and lorlatinib, which is marketed by Pfizer Inc. under the names Lorbrena and Lorviqua for the treatment of TKI-pretreated ALK+ NSCLC, and is under FDA review as a first line treatment of ALK+ NSCLC . We also expect that TPX-0131 will compete against other compounds which are currently in late-stage clinical development, including TKIs in Phase 2, or later, for the treatment of ALK+ NSCLC at companies including against Betta Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. (ensartinib).
Intellectual Property
 We strive to protect the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business, including pursuing, obtaining and maintaining patent protection intended to cover the composition of matter of our drug candidates, their methods of use, related technologies and other inventions that are important to our business. In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. 
 Our commercial success depends in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our drug candidates and other commercially important technologies, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our intellectual property, in particular, our patent rights, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable intellectual property and proprietary rights of third parties. 
 The patent positions for biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and can involve complex legal, scientific and factual issues. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before a patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted and even challenged after issuance. Moreover, many jurisdictions permit third parties to challenge patents in administrative proceedings, which may result in further narrowing or even cancellation of patent claims. As a result, we cannot guarantee that any of our drug candidates will be protected or remain protectable by enforceable patents. Moreover, any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties. For

more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.” 
 As of February 1, 2021, we own two patents in the United States directed to repotrectinib and three patents in the United States directed to structurally related compounds, one of which is also directed towards TPX-0022.  In addition, with respect to repotrectinib and TPX-0022, as of February 1, 2021, we also own foreign patents in a number of jurisdictions including Australia, China, Chile, Columbia, Eurasia, Hong Kong, Europe, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, Taiwan and other global regions, directed to compound and pharmaceutical composition of matter claims and/or their use in the treatment of certain diseases, including cancer. These patents are expected to expire between January 2035 and July 2036 depending on the patent and country, without taking into account any possible patent term extension, where applicable. We also have pending patent applications directed to repotrectinib and its use in North America, Europe, Asia and other global regions which, if issued, are expected to expire at dates ranging between January 2035 and November 2040, without taking potential patent term extensions into account. We also have pending patent applications directed to TPX-0022 and its use in North America, South America, Europe, Asia, and other global regions which, if issued, are expected to expire at dates ranging between January 2035 and March 2041, without taking potential patent term extensions into account. 
 In addition to the repotrectinib and TPX-0022 programs, as of February 1, 2021, we own one patent in the United States directed to TPX-0046 and structurally related compounds. We also have pending patent applications directed to composition of matter for TPX-0046 and TPX-0131 and structurally related compounds and their use in treating diseases, including cancer, which if issued are expected to expire at dates ranging between 2038 and 2040, without taking potential patent term extensions into account.
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. 
 In the United States, the term of a patent covering an FDA-approved drug may, in certain cases, be eligible for a patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act as compensation for the loss of patent term during the FDA regulatory review process. The period of extension may be up to five years, but cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for extension and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and in certain other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. It is possible that U.S. patents covering repotrectinib, TPX-0022 and TPX-0046, and patents for TPX-0131, may or will be entitled to patent term extensions. If our drug candidates receive FDA approval, we intend to apply for patent term extensions, if available, to extend the term of patents that cover the approved drug candidates. We also intend to seek patent term extensions in any jurisdictions where they are available; however, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions. 
 In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trade secret protection for our proprietary information that is not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection, including certain aspect of our manufacturing processes. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information, including restricting access to our confidential information, as well as entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, independent contractors, advisors, contract manufacturers, CROs, hospitals, independent treatment centers, suppliers, collaborators and other third parties, such parties may breach such agreements and disclose our proprietary information including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. In addition, third parties may independently develop the same or similar proprietary information or may otherwise gain access to our proprietary information. As a result, we may be unable to meaningfully protect our trade secrets and proprietary information. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.” 
 Government Regulation 
 The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state, and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring, and post-approval reporting of drug products such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the 
 23

governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates. 
 The process required by the FDA before drug product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
 
 
• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practices (GLP), regulation;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is commenced;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product candidate for its intended purpose;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation of and submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the application for review;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCP; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical and Clinical Development 
 Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site, and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries.
 24

For purposes of NDA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap. 
 
 
• | Phase 1—The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2—The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3—The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A registrational trial is a clinical trial that adequately meets regulatory agency requirements for the evaluation of a drug candidate’s efficacy and safety such that it can be used to justify the approval of the drug. Generally, registrational trials are Phase 3 trials but may be Phase 2 trials if the trial design provides a reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in situations where there is an unmet medical need. 
 In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so-called Phase 4 studies may be made a condition to approval of the NDA. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the characteristics of the product candidate, and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 NDA Submission and Review 
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The NDA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. A determination by the FDA within 60 days of the receipt of an NDA to file the application for review for its completeness is initiated at the time of submission. If the FDA determines there is significance to the missing or incomplete information in the context of the proposed drug product, the proposed indication(s), and the amount of time needed to address any given deficiency, it can issue a refusal-to-file letter. The submission of an NDA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies. 
 25

Once an NDA has been submitted, the FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. In both standard and priority reviews, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective. The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 
 After the FDA evaluates an NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the product will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response letter will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the NDA. In issuing the Complete Response letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the NDA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product. 
 If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a product and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.
 Expedited Development and Review Programs 
 The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. The fast track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new products are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a fast track product has opportunities for frequent interactions with the review team during product development and, once an NDA is submitted, the product may be eligible for priority review. A fast track product may also be eligible for rolling review, where the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA. 
 A product intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product can receive breakthrough therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the fast track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product, including involvement of senior managers. 
 26

Any product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition compared to marketed products. For products containing new molecular entities, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date (compared with ten months under standard review). 
 Additionally, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will generally require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires, as a condition for accelerated approval, pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. 
 Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Furthermore, fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation, do not change the standards for approval and may not ultimately expedite the development or approval process.
 Orphan Drug Designation 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process. 
 If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusive approval (or exclusivity), which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA, to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the application user fee. 
 A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing user fee requirements, under which FDA assesses an annual program fee for each product identified in an approved NDA. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. 
 27

The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
 
 
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies; 


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of existing product approvals;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal of the FDA to permit the import or export of products; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics and drugs. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. 
 FDA Regulation of Companion Diagnostics 
 A therapeutic product may rely upon an in vitro companion diagnostic for use in selecting the patients that will be more likely to respond to that therapy. If an in vitro diagnostic is essential to the safe and effective use of the therapeutic product, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the diagnostic at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product. According to FDA guidance, a companion diagnostic device used to make treatment decisions in clinical trials of a drug generally will be considered an investigational device unless it is employed for an intended use for which the device is already approved or cleared. If used to make critical treatment decisions, such as patient selection, the diagnostic device generally will be considered a significant risk device under the FDA’s Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, regulations. Thus, the sponsor of the diagnostic device will be required to comply with the IDE regulations. According to the guidance, if a diagnostic device and a drug are to be studied together to support their respective approvals, both products can be studied in the same investigational trial, if the trial meets both the requirements of the IDE regulations and the IND regulations. The guidance provides that depending on the details of the trial plan and subjects, a sponsor may seek to submit an IND alone, or both an IND and an IDE. 
 Pursuing FDA approval of an in vitro companion diagnostic would require either a pre-market notification, also called 510(k) clearance, or a pre-market approval, or PMA, for that diagnostic. The review of companion diagnostics involves coordination of review with the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. 
 The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and nonclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. The applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness, including information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee. In addition, PMAs for devices must generally include the results from extensive preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In particular, for a diagnostic, the applicant must demonstrate that the diagnostic produces reproducible results. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which imposes elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements.

U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of our drug candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years beyond the normal expiration of the patent, limited to the approved indication (or any additional indications approved during the period of extension), as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for extension and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned patents, and if eligible for such restoration, to add patent term beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA. 
 Marketing exclusivity provisions under the United States Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) can also delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications for competing products. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovator drug or for another indication. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA, if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) applications for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Orphan drug exclusivity, as described below, may offer a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, except in certain circumstances. Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial. 
 
European Drug Development 
 In Europe, our future drugs will also be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can only be marketed if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained. 
 Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in Europe are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the European Union clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the European Union, the European Union Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of the European Union countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority, or NCA, and one or more Ethics Committees, or ECs. Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred. 
 29

In 2014, a new Clinical Trials Regulation 536/2014, replacing the current Directive, was adopted. The new Regulation will become directly applicable in all EU Member States (without national implementation) once the EU Portal and Database are fully functional. It is expected that the Regulation will apply in late 2021. The new Regulation seeks to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. For example, the sponsor shall submit a single application for approval of a clinical trial via the EU Portal. As part of the application process, the sponsor shall propose a reporting Member State, who will coordinate the validation and evaluation of the application. The reporting Member State shall consult and coordinate with the other concerned Member States. If an application is rejected, it can be amended and resubmitted through the EU Portal. If an approval is issued, the sponsor can start the clinical trial in all concerned Member States. However, a concerned Member State can in limited circumstances declare an “opt-out” from an approval. In such a case, the clinical trial cannot be conducted in that Member State. The Regulation also aims to streamline and simplify the rules on safety reporting, and introduces enhanced transparency requirements such as mandatory submission of a summary of the clinical trial results to the EU Database. 
 European Drug Review and Approval 
 In the European Economic Area, or EEA, which is comprised of the 27 Member States of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are two types of marketing authorizations: 
 The Community MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the EMA and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of drugs, such as medicines derived from biotechnology, such as genetic engineering, orphan medicinal drugs, advanced-therapy medicines such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines, and medicinal drugs containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV/AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions, and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for drugs containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, for drugs that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the European Union. 
 National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for drugs not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a drug has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in other Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the drug has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State (RMS). The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the drug characteristics (SPC) and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Concerned Member States (CMS)) for their approval. If the CMS raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the drug is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e. in the RMS and the CMS). 
 Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the drug on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. 
 European Data and Marketing Exclusivity 
 In Europe, new active substances, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. This data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic application for eight years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. 
 
Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
Following the result of a referendum in 2016, the United Kingdom (UK) left the EU on January 31, 2020, commonly referred to as Brexit. Pursuant to the formal withdrawal arrangements agreed between the UK and the EU, the UK was subject to a transition period until December 31, 2020 (the Transition Period), during which EU rules continued to apply.  A 
 30

deal that outlines the future trading relationship between the UK and the EU was agreed in December 2020 and has been approved by each EU member state and the UK (the Deal).  The Deal provisionally applies from January 1, 2021.  
 Since a significant proportion of the regulatory framework in the UK applicable to our business and our product candidates is derived from EU directives and regulations, Brexit has had, and will continue to have, a material impact upon the regulatory regime with respect to the development, manufacture, importation, approval and commercialization of our product candidates in the UK or the EU. Great Britain (made up of England, Scotland, and Wales) is no longer covered by the EEA’s procedures for the grant of marketing authorizations (Northern Ireland will be covered by the centralized authorization procedure and can be covered under the decentralized or mutual recognition procedures). A separate marketing authorization will be required to market drugs in Great Britain. It is currently unclear whether the MHRA in the UK is sufficiently prepared to handle the increased volume of marketing authorization applications that it is likely to receive. Any delay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, any marketing approvals, would delay or prevent us from commercializing our product candidates in the UK or the EU and restrict our ability to generate revenue and achieve and sustain profitability.
 
While the Deal provides for the tariff-free trade of medicinal products between the UK and the EU there may be additional non-tariff costs to such trade which did not exist prior to the end of the Transition Period.  Further, should the UK diverge from the EU from a regulatory perspective in relation to medicinal products, tariffs could be put into place in the future.  We could therefore, both now and in the future, face significant additional expenses (when compared to the position prior to the end of the Transition Period) to operate our business, which could significantly and materially harm or delay our ability to generate revenues or achieve profitability of our business. Any further changes in international trade, tariff and import/export regulations as a result of Brexit or otherwise may impose unexpected duty costs or other non-tariff barriers on us. These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, may significantly reduce global trade and, in particular, trade between the impacted nations and the United Kingdom.  It is also possible that Brexit may negatively affect our ability to attract and retain employees, particularly those from the EU.
 Orphan designation in Great Britain following Brexit is granted on an essentially identical basis to in the EU, but is based on the prevalence of the condition in Great Britain.  It is therefore possible that conditions that are currently designated as orphan conditions in Great Britain will no longer be and that conditions that are not currently designated as orphan conditions in the EU will be designated as such in Great Britain.
 European Union General Data Protection Regulation 
 In addition to EU regulations related to the approval and commercialization of our products, we may be subject to the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The GDPR went into effect on May 25, 2018. The GDPR introduced new data protection requirements in the European Union, as well as potential fines for noncompliant companies of up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of annual global revenue. The regulation imposes numerous new requirements for the collection, use and disclosure of personal information, including more stringent requirements relating to consent and the information that must be shared with data subjects about how their personal information is used, the obligation to notify regulators and affected individuals of personal data breaches, extensive new internal privacy governance obligations and obligations to honor expanded rights of individuals in relation to their personal information (e.g., the right to access, correct and delete their data). In addition, the GDPR includes restrictions on cross-border data transfer. The GDPR will increase our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the new EU data protection rules. Further, the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU, often referred to as Brexit, has created uncertainty with regard to data protection regulation in the United Kingdom. In particular, it is unclear whether the United Kingdom will enact data protection legislation equivalent to the GDPR and how data transfers to and from the United Kingdom will be regulated. 
 
Rest of the World Regulation 
 For other countries outside of the European Union and the United States, such as certain countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, drug licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
 If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 
 Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Sales of our drugs will depend, in part, on the extent to which our drugs will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are 
 31

increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical drugs and services. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic drugs. 
 There may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside of the United States. Moreover, eligibility for coverage and reimbursement does not imply that a drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, intellectual property, manufacture, sale and distribution expenses. Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations. 
 We plan to develop, either by ourselves or with collaborators, in vitro companion diagnostic tests for our drug candidates for certain indications. We, or our collaborators, will be required to obtain coverage and reimbursement for these tests separate and apart from the coverage and reimbursement we seek for our product candidates, once approved. 
 In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal drugs for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal drugs for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal drug or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal drug on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical drugs will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our drugs. Historically, drugs launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally tend to be significantly lower. 
 
Healthcare Reform 
 In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of drug candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect a biopharmaceutical company’s ability to profitably sell any approved drugs. 
 The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for drugs for which we obtain marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our drugs covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private third-party payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental third-party payors. 
 The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. The plan for the research was published in 2012 by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures are made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private third-party payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of our drug candidates, if any such drug or the condition that they are intended to treat are the subject of a trial.

third-party payors do not consider our drugs to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our drugs after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our drugs on a profitable basis. 
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the ACA) enacted in March 2010, has had a significant impact on the healthcare industry. The ACA expanded coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. With regard to pharmaceutical products, the ACA, among other things, addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, established annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, and a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must now agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D. 
 There have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, it has enacted laws that modify certain provisions of the ACA such as removing penalties, starting January 1, 2019, for not complying with the ACA’s individual mandate to carry health insurance, delaying the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, and increasing the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D. In addition, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the ACA-mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminated the health insurer tax. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas (Texas District Court Judge), ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of legislation enacted in 2017, informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing this case, although it is unclear when a decision will be made. It is also unclear how such litigation will impact the ACA and our business.  
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, started in April 2013, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will stay in effect through 2030, except for a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, the then-U.S. President signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, or the ATRA, which, among other things, also reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
 Further, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, the prior Presidential administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2021 includes a $135 billion allowance to support legislative proposals seeking to reduce drug prices, increase competition, lower out-of-pocket drug costs for patients, and increase patient access to lower-cost generic and biosimilar drugs.  Additionally, the prior administration previously released a “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contained proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. On July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the prior administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that seek to implement several of the administration’s proposals. As a result, the FDA released a final rule on September 24, 2020, effective November 30, 2020, providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit

managers and manufacturers. On November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing President Trump’s Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. On December 28, 2020, the United States District Court in Northern California issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against implementation of the interim final rule. The likelihood of implementation of any of the other Trump administration reform initiatives is uncertain, particularly in light of the new Presidential administration. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.  Further, it is possible that additional governmental action be taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 Other Healthcare Laws 
 We may also be subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments where we may market our drug candidates, if approved. These laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physician sunshine laws and regulations. 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute is subject to evolving interpretations. In the past, the government has enforced the federal Anti-Kickback Statute to reach large settlements with healthcare companies based on sham consulting and other financial arrangements with physicians. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws, which establish similar prohibitions and in some cases may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers. 
 Additionally, the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties law, prohibits knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the U.S. government. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. The federal government is using the False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies throughout the U.S., for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales and marketing practices. The government has obtained multi-million and multi-billion dollar settlements under the False Claims Act in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws. 
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) also created additional federal civil and criminal penalties for, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
  Many states have similar health care fraud and abuse laws that may differ from each other and federal law in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts. For example, states have anti-kickback and false claims laws that may be broader in scope than analogous federal laws and may apply regardless of payer. 
 There has also been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The ACA, through the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, requires applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to track and report payments made by them to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by such physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, such obligations will include payments and other transfers of value provided in the previous year to certain other healthcare professionals, including physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, anesthesiologist assistants, and certified nurse midwives. Covered manufacturers are required to submit annual reports to the government and

these reports are posted on a website maintained by CMS. Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices, require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives and/or require tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians. 
 We may also be subject to data privacy and security requirements that may impact the way in which we conduct research and operate our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, impose obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information on covered entities, including certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as individuals and entities that provide services on behalf of a covered entity that involve individually identifiable health information, known as business associates, as well as their covered subcontractors. In addition, we may be directly subject to certain state laws concerning privacy and data security. For example, California recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (CPPA), which creates new individual privacy rights for California consumers (as defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling certain personal data of consumers or households. The CCPA requires covered companies to provide new disclosure to consumers about such companies’ data collection, use and sharing practices, provides such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales or transfers of personal information, and provides consumers with additional causes of action. The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020, and the California Attorney General may bring enforcement actions for violations beginning July 1, 2020. This may impact our business activities and exemplifies the vulnerability of our business to the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data and protected health information. Existing state laws governing the privacy and security of personally identifiable information, and, in some states, health information, impose differing requirements, thus complicating our compliance efforts. 
 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and additional reporting and oversight obligations. If the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to significant criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.
 Compliance with Environmental Regulations
 Our business involves the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals, and biological materials. In the United States, we are subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the California Environmental Protection Agency, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Controlled Substances Act and other federal, state or local regulations.
 
We may be subject to further such regulations in the future. Although we believe that our operations comply in all material respects with the applicable environmental laws and regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result, and the extent of that liability could exceed our resources. Our compliance with these laws and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect upon our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position.
