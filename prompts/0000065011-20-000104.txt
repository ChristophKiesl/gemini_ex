ITEM 1. BUSINESS
GENERAL
Meredith Corporation has been committed to service journalism since its inception in 1902 as an agricultural publisher. In 1924, the Company published the first issue of Better Homes & Gardens. The Company entered the television broadcasting business in 1948. Today Meredith uses multiple media platforms—including print, digital, mobile, video, and broadcast television—to provide consumers with content they desire and to deliver the messages of our advertising and marketing partners. Nationally, Meredith serves more than 190 million unduplicated American consumers, including 120 million women and 90 percent of United States (U.S.) millennial women. Meredith’s broadcast television stations reach 11 percent of U.S. households.
The Company is incorporated under the laws of the State of Iowa. Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol MDP.
The Company operates two business segments: national media and local media. Our national media segment includes leading national consumer media brands delivered via multiple media platforms, including print magazines, digital and mobile media, brand licensing activities, database-related activities, affinity marketing, and business-to-business marketing products and services. Our focus is on the entertainment, food, lifestyle, parenting, and home categories, which include brands such as People, Better Homes & Gardens, InStyle, Allrecipes, Real Simple, Shape, Southern Living, and Martha Stewart Living among others. In addition to subscription magazines, in fiscal 2020, we published over 300 special interest publications. Most of our brands are also available as digital editions on one or more of the major digital newsstands and on major tablet devices. The national media segment’s extensive digital presence consists of 50 websites and applications (apps). The national media segment also includes brand licensing activities, affinity marketing, third-party marketing, an extensive consumer database, and other related operations.
Our local media segment consists of 17 television stations located across the U.S. concentrated in fast-growing markets with related digital and mobile media assets. The television stations include seven CBS affiliates, five FOX affiliates, two MyNetworkTV affiliates, one NBC affiliate, one ABC affiliate, and two independent stations. Local media’s digital presence includes 12 websites and 12 apps focused on news, sports, and weather-related information. In addition, the local media segment sells geographically and demographically targeted advertising programs to third parties.
Financial information about industry segments can be found in Item 7-Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 8-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data under Note 19.
The Company’s largest revenue source is advertising. National and local economic conditions affect the magnitude of our advertising revenues. Both national media and local media revenues and operating results can be affected by changes in the demand for advertising and consumer demand for our products. Television advertising is seasonal and cyclical to some extent, traditionally generating higher revenues in the second and fourth fiscal quarters and during key political contests and major sporting events. Magazine circulation revenues are generally affected by national and regional economic conditions and competition from other forms of media.

BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTS
In September 2019, Meredith acquired magazines.com, a website that promotes, markets, and sells print and electronic magazine subscriptions.
In October 2019, the second step in a two-step process to sell the Sports Illustrated brand was completed. After this second step, the Company ceased publication activities associated with this brand. Also, in October 2019, Meredith closed the sale of the Money brand, and Meredith sold its investment in Viant to Viant’s founders. In January 2020, Meredith closed on the sale of the FanSided brand, and in February 2020, Meredith sold its investment in Xumo. These fiscal 2020 sales marked the completion of all sales of the brands designated as assets-held-for-sale after Meredith acquired Time Inc. (Time) in fiscal 2018.
In October 2019, Meredith completed the acquisition of Stop, Breathe & Think, an emotional wellness platform intended to build the emotional strength of its users. The platform was named one of Amazon Alexa’s Top 10 Skills of 2019. In spring 2020, the platform was renamed MyLife.
Allrecipes, America’s largest digital food media brand, experienced record digital traffic for the Thanksgiving holiday. The site recorded 50.4 million visits during Thanksgiving week (Friday-Thursday, November 22-28, 2019), an increase of 6.4 percent over the prior-year period. In December 2019, Allrecipes reached an all-time monthly high of 60.3 million unique visitors.
In December 2019, Meredith extended its licensing agreement with Walmart Inc. (Walmart) through mid-2024. This program features more than 3,000 SKUs of Better Homes & Gardens branded products at 4,000 Walmart stores across the U.S. and on Walmart.com.
During fiscal 2020, Meredith launched new partnerships to create quarterly premium subscription magazines. Reveal, a lifestyle magazine with home at the core with Drew and Jonathan Scott from the hit show Property Brothers launched in January 2020 and Sweet July, an extension of the lifestyle brand of New York Times bestselling author, restaurateur, chef, television host, and producer, Aeysha Curry, launched in May 2020.
As a result of strong consumer demand and success on the newsstand, Meredith re-launched subscriptions to Coastal Living and Cooking Light with their Winter 2020 issues. Both titles’ subscription models had been discontinued in previous years and were most recently newsstand only titles.
During fiscal 2020, Meredith redesigned and reimagined certain print brands. In January 2020, Meredith re-designed Rachael Ray’s magazine with a fresh look and format under the new name Rachael Ray In Season. The quarterly newsstand only title featured upgraded paper stock, bolder photography, and new editorial sections and insider contributors. The April 2020 issue of Food & Wine featured upgraded paper and a larger trim size to reflect an increasing print audience.
In April 2020, the Company expanded the Meredith Sales Guarantee with its new Meredith Audience Action Guarantee (MAAG). The Meredith Sales Guarantee guaranteed advertisers a specified reach. The MAAG guarantees that a specific number of readers will take action as a result of seeing a brand campaign in Meredith magazines.
In April 2020, Meredith launched a television show based on the Southern Living brand, which is airing in all 12 of Meredith’s local media markets.
COVID-19 Pandemic
In December 2019, there was an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) in China that has since spread to nearly all regions of the world. The outbreak was subsequently declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. In the face of unprecedented business conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, 
 2

we looked to our values and long-term strategy to guide us, while leveraging our agility to quickly adapt to changing business conditions.
As we focus on managing our business and operations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the health and well-being of our employees, our vendors, our customers, and the communities in which we operate are our top priorities. We are taking measures to adhere to all regulations and guidelines from government and health agency authorities related to the containment of COVID-19 and to implement emerging health and safety best practices, including:

• | Implementing a careful, phased reopening of our offices and television broadcast stations where permitted by local regulations.


• | Providing masks and other personal protective equipment for those employees who have returned to work at our offices and television broadcast stations.


• | Ensuring proper distancing or barriers between workstations and requiring masks and social distancing in common areas.


• | Increasing the frequency and intensity of janitorial cleaning and adding sanitizing stations, public cleaning supplies, and signage throughout the worksite.


• | Educating returning team members about disease prevention, including hygiene and cleaning, through required video and online training.


• | Launching an online daily worksite entry questionnaire that must be completed prior to entry to a worksite.


• | Implementing a work-from-home policy for most staff positions and suspending non-critical business travel.


• | Devoting resources to assisting employees diagnosed with COVID-19 and implementing immediate contact tracing and support to other potential close contact employees.

As we continue to navigate through the pandemic, we have taken significant steps to secure our liquidity position to provide financial flexibility, including:

• | Raising $710 million of new secured debt and using the proceeds, along with existing cash on hand, to redeem all outstanding shares of our perpetual convertible redeemable non-voting Series A preferred stock (Series A preferred stock).


• | Repaying the $35 million outstanding balance under our revolving line of credit.


• | Amending our revolving line of credit facility providing for a “Covenant Relief Period” through March 31, 2022, during which the Company will have greater access to borrowings under the facility by increasing the consolidated net leverage ratio financial covenant initially from 4.25x to 6.0x before stepping down in several increments to 5.0x. The financial covenant only applies when Meredith’s borrowings under the facility exceed 30 percent of the amount available under the facility.


• | Pausing our common stock and class B stock dividends, with the intention of reviewing our dividend policy as developments warrant.


• | Temporarily reducing pay for our Board of Directors, our executives, and approximately 60 percent of our employees.


• | Limiting discretionary spending across the organization.


• | Re-prioritizing our capital projects.

1 | Rate base is the circulation guaranteed to advertisers. Actual circulation generally exceeds rate base and, for most of the Company’s titles, is tracked by the Alliance for Audited Media, which issues periodic statements for audited magazines.

In addition to these major magazine titles, we published over 300 special interest publications under approximately 70 brands in fiscal 2020. The titles are issued from one to six times annually and sold primarily on newsstands. A limited number of special interest publication subscriptions are also sold.
Magazine Advertising—Advertising revenues are generated primarily from sales to clients engaged in consumer marketing. Many of Meredith’s larger magazines offer regional and demographic editions that contain similar editorial content but allow advertisers to customize messages to specific markets or audiences. The Company sells two primary types of magazine advertising: display and direct response. Advertisements are either run-of-press (printed along with the editorial portions of the magazine) or inserts (preprinted pages). Most of the national media segment’s advertising revenues are derived from run-of-press display advertising. Meredith also possesses strategic marketing capabilities, which provide clients and their agencies with access to all of Meredith’s media platforms and capabilities, including print, television, digital, video, mobile, consumer events, and custom marketing. Our team of creative and marketing experts delivers innovative solutions across multiple media channels that meet each client’s unique advertising and promotional requirements.

The rates at which we sell print advertising depend on each magazine’s rate base, which is the circulation of the magazine that we guarantee to our advertisers, as well as our audience size. If we are not able to meet our committed rate base, the price paid by advertisers is generally subject to downward adjustments, including in the form of future credits or discounts. Our published rates for each of our magazines are subject to negotiation with each of our advertisers. We sell digital advertising primarily on a flat rate/sponsorship basis or on a cost per thousand, or CPM, basis. Flat rate/sponsorship deals are sold on an exclusive basis to advertisers giving them access to our major events. CPM deals are sold on an impression basis with a guarantee that we will deliver the negotiated volume commitment. If we are not able to meet the impression goal, we will extend the campaign or provide alternative placements.
Magazine Circulation—Most of our magazines are sold primarily by subscription and delivered to subscribers through the mail. Subscriptions obtained through direct-mail solicitation, agencies, insert cards, the internet, and other means are Meredith’s largest source of circulation revenues. Revenue per subscription and related expenses can vary significantly by source. The majority of subscription magazines are also sold by single copy. Single copies sold on newsstands are distributed primarily through magazine wholesalers, who have the right to receive credit from the Company for magazines returned to them by retailers.
Newsstand sales include sales through traditional newsstands as well as supermarkets, convenience stores, pharmacies, and other retail outlets. We also publish branded books, including soft-cover “bookazines.” These are distributed through magazine-style “check-out pockets” at retail outlets and traditional trade book channels. We publish books on a diverse range of topics aligned with our brands, including special commemorative and biographical books. We also publish books under various licensed third-party brands and a number of original titles. Our Oxmoor House imprint publishes a variety of home, cooking, and health books under our lifestyle-oriented brands as well as licensed third-party brands.
Digital and Mobile Media
National media’s 50 websites and apps provide information, ideas, and inspiration for nearly 95 percent of American women. These branded websites focus on the topics that women care about most—celebrity, entertainment, food, home, entertaining, and meeting the needs of moms—and on delivering powerful content geared toward lifestyle topics such as health, beauty, style, and wellness. Our Allrecipes brand has four omni-channel sites serving six countries in two languages, one app across multiple platforms, and one Skill for Amazon Alexa. Fiscal 2020 digital traffic across our various platforms averaged approximately 150 million unique monthly visitors. Our brands have a robust social networking presence as well. In fiscal 2020, national media reached approximately 93 million Facebook fans, 51 million Twitter followers, 46 million Instagram followers, over 12 million Pinterest followers, and over 8 million YouTube subscribers.
Additionally, we have 18 of our titles available as digital editions, with an audience of approximately 2.1 million. Digital subscriptions and single-copy sales collectively represent 5.7 percent of our total rate base.
Other Sources of Revenues
Other revenues are derived from digital and customer relationship marketing, other custom publishing projects, brand licensing agreements, and ancillary products and services.
Affinity Marketing—Synapse Group, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Meredith, is an affinity marketing company that partners with publishers, brick and mortar retailers, digital partners, airline frequent flier programs, and customer service and direct response call centers. It is a major marketer of magazine subscriptions in the U.S. Building on its continuity marketing expertise, Synapse has diversified its business to also market other products and services. For example, Synapse manages several branded continuity membership programs and is developing continuity programs for product partners. Meredith also owns magazines.com and magazine.store, websites focused on the sales of Meredith and third-party magazine subscriptions. 
Brand Licensing—Meredith Brand Licensing generates revenue through multiple long-term trademark licensing agreements with retailers, manufacturers, publishers, and service providers. Our licensing programs extend the 
 5

reach of Meredith brands into additional consumer channels in the U.S. and abroad. Currently the world’s second- largest global licensor, Meredith has direct-to-retail partnerships with leading companies, including Better Homes & Gardens at Walmart, Southern Living at Dillard’s, and InStyle-branded hair salons in select JC Penney stores.
Our most significant partnership is Better Homes & Gardens-branded products sold at Walmart stores in the U.S. and at Walmart.com. The brand is represented by more than 3,000 products across multiple categories in the home décor, outdoor living, hardlines, and garden space. Meredith also has a long-term agreement to license the Better Homes & Gardens brand to Realogy Corporation, which is entering its 13th year as a residential real estate franchise system operating as Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate, LLC. The real estate network now includes more than 370 offices and more than 13,000 real estate professionals across the U.S., Canada, Bahamas, Jamaica, and Australia. Also, in the real estate sector, the Southern Living and Coastal Living brands include networks for 24 Hotel Collection members and 14 inspired residential communities.
The EatingWell branded line of healthy frozen foods entrées manufactured and distributed by Bellisio Foods Inc. now includes up to 12 frozen entrées and four noodle bowls to select from at more than 15,000 regional and national grocery locations. Also new in fiscal 2020 is an Allrecipes licensing program with Lifetime Brands, Inc. for more than 80 kitchenware items sold exclusively at Kroger grocery stores.
Other licensing agreements include the Southern Living Plant Collection at Home Depot, Lowes, and more than 5,000 independent garden centers; the Coastal Living collection by Universal Furniture; and Southern Living and Real Simple with 1-800 FLOWERS. We also entered into agreements in fiscal 2020 for two programs that we anticipate will begin in fiscal 2021: The Clorox Company for Real Simple natural cleaning products and TF Publishing for 2021 wall calendars and meal planners under the Real Simple, Allrecipes, and Life trademarks.
The Company expands its international reach primarily through international licensing agreements. Meredith’s national media brands are currently distributed in approximately 70 countries, including a localized presence in more than 30 countries such as Australia, China, India, Mexico, Russia, and Germany in print and digitally. The Company licenses its national media brands for consumer merchandise in 8 countries. The Company continues to pursue activities that will serve consumers and advertisers while also extending and strengthening the reach and vitality of our brands.
Meredith has granted distribution rights for backlist titles of our consumer-leading brands, including the powerful Better Homes & Gardens imprint, to a book publisher. Meredith creates book content and retains all approval and content rights while the distributor is responsible for reprinting, sales and marketing, distribution, and inventory management. Meredith receives revenue based on sales less a 20 percent distributor fee.
The Foundry 360—The Foundry 360 is a creative content studio serving clients across a broad range of industries. The services include using our content creation expertise to develop content marketing programs across multiple platforms, including native advertising that enables clients to engage new consumers and build long-term relationships with existing customers.
Production and Delivery
Paper, printing, and postage costs accounted for 17 percent of the national media segment’s fiscal 2020 operating expenses. Coated and supercalendered publication paper is the major raw material essential to the national media segment. We directly purchase all the paper for our magazine production and custom publishing business. The Company has contractual agreements with major paper manufacturers to ensure adequate supplies for planned publishing requirements. The price of paper is driven by overall market conditions and is therefore difficult to predict. In fiscal 2020, average paper prices decreased 4 percent, whereas in fiscal 2019 average paper prices increased 10 percent. Paper prices decreased 1 percent in fiscal 2018. Management anticipates a reduction in paper prices of approximately 5 percent in fiscal 2021.
There has been significant consolidation in the printing industry over the last 15 years. In 2019, only two printers remained with the capability and capacity to handle a substantial portion of Meredith’s magazine print production. 
 6

In early 2020 one of the two printers filed for bankruptcy protection. In anticipation of this event, Meredith negotiated an early termination of that contract and moved nearly all our magazine production to the last remaining supplier capable of producing the entirety of our work. This move extended our contract with that printer through 2030, creating price stability for our print manufacturing prices for the next ten years.
Postage is a significant expense of the national media segment. We continually seek the most economical and effective methods for mail delivery, including cost-saving strategies that leverage work-sharing opportunities offered within the postal rate structure. Periodical postage accounts for over 80 percent of Meredith’s postage costs, while other mail items—direct mail, replies, and bills—account for nearly 20 percent. The Governors of the United States Postal Service (USPS) review prices for mailing services annually and adjust postage rates periodically. In general, postage rate changes are capped by law at the rate of inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index. The most recent rate change was an increase of approximately 1.9 percent effective January 2020. Except for fiscal 2016, postage prices have risen in each of Meredith’s last five fiscal years. While we expect postage rates to again increase in January 2021, an ongoing legislatively mandated review of the existing law by the Postal Regulatory Commission could potentially result in adjustments to the current rate-setting regime. The impact of any such change could be effective as early as the first quarter of calendar 2021. Meredith continues to work independently and with others to encourage and help the USPS find and implement efficiencies to contain rate increases. We cannot, however, predict future changes in the postal rates or the impact they will have on our national media business.
Third parties provide subscription fulfillment services for Meredith’s national media brands. Third parties also provide domestic magazine newsstand distribution services through multi-year agreements.
Competition
Publishing is a highly competitive business. The Company’s magazines and related publishing products and services compete with other mass media, including the internet and many other leisure-time activities. Competition for advertising dollars is based primarily on advertising rates, circulation levels, reader demographics, advertiser results, and sales team effectiveness. Competition for readers is based principally on editorial content, marketing skills, price, and customer service. While competition is strong for established titles, gaining readership for newer magazines and specialty publications is especially competitive.
Local Media
Local media contributed 27 percent of Meredith’s consolidated revenues in fiscal 2020. Information about the Company’s television stations at June 30, 2020, is as follows:

Designated Market Area (DMA) is a registered trademark of, and is defined by, Nielsen Media Research. The national rank is from the 2019-2020 DMA ranking. 
Average audience share represents the estimated percentage of households using television tuned to the station in the DMA. The percentages shown reflect the average total day shares (6:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m.) for the November 2019, February 2020, and May 2020 measurement periods. 

Operations
The principal sources of the local media segment’s revenues are 1) retransmission of our television signals by cable, satellite, telecommunications, and over-the-top service providers; 2) local non-political advertising focusing on the 
 8

immediate geographic area of the stations; 3) national non-political advertising; 4) political advertising which is cyclical with peaks occurring in our odd-numbered fiscal years (e.g., fiscal 2019, fiscal 2021) and particularly in our second fiscal quarter of those fiscal years; 5) geographic and demographic-targeted digital and print advertising programs sold to third parties; and 6) digital advertising on the stations’ websites, mobile-optimized websites, and apps.
The stations sell commercial time to both local/regional and national advertisers. Rates for spot advertising are influenced primarily by the market size, number of media competitors, including in-market broadcasters, and audience ratings and demographics. Generally, the larger a station’s audience in any particular daypart or program, the higher the advertising rates it can command. As supply and demand fluctuate in the market, so do a station’s advertising rates. Independent representative firms sell most national advertising while the sales staff at each station sell local/regional advertising.
Typically, 40 to 50 percent of a market’s television advertising revenue is generated during local newscasts. Stations are continually working to increase the number of newscasts and additionally grow their news ratings, which in turn increase advertising revenues.
Meredith’s 16 national network affiliation agreements also influence advertising rates. A network affiliation agreement provides a station the exclusive right to broadcast network programming in its local service area. In return, the network has the right to sell most of the commercial advertising aired during network programs and receives programming fees from the station.
Retransmission consent revenue is generated from cable, satellite, telecommunications, and over-the-top service providers who pay Meredith for access to our television station signals so that they may retransmit our signals and charge their subscribers for this programming. These fees increased in each of the last three fiscal years, primarily due to renegotiations of expiring contracts and negotiated rate increases on existing contracts effective during the year.
Programming fees paid to the networks are, in essence, a portion of those retransmission consent fees. Programming fees paid to the networks increased significantly in fiscal 2020 and 2019 due to renegotiations of expiring contracts.
Stations sometimes also pay networks for certain marquee sports programming (professional football, college basketball, and Olympics) and news services. While Meredith’s relations with the networks historically have been very good, the Company can make no assurances they will remain so over time.
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has permitted broadcast television station licensees to use their digital spectrum for a wide variety of services such as high-definition television programming, audio, data, mobile applications, and other types of communication, subject to the requirement that each broadcaster provide at least one free video channel equal in quality to the current technical standards. All of our stations are broadcasting one or more additional programming streams on their digital channels: one airs the Fox network; two of our markets have MyNetworkTV; ten carry Cozi TV; six broadcast the Court TV: Mystery and Circle networks; three air the Bounce and Grit networks; and four air the LAFF, DABL, and Court TV networks.
The costs of television programming are significant. In addition to network fees, there are two principal programming costs for Meredith: locally produced programming, including local news, and purchased syndicated programming. The Company continues to increase our locally produced news and entertainment programming to control content and costs and to attract advertisers. Syndicated programming costs are based largely on demand from stations in the market and can fluctuate significantly.
Local media’s operations also include MNI Targeted Media (MNI). Through MNI, we provide clients with a single point of contact for a range of targeted digital and print advertising programs primarily on a local and regional level. Digital products include programmatic offerings and custom display advertising on local and national websites. 
 9

Print products include customized geographic and demographic-targeted advertising programs in approximately 35 top U.S. magazines, including our own national media magazines and those of other leading magazine publishers.
Competition
Meredith’s television stations compete directly for advertising dollars and programming in their respective markets with other local television stations, radio stations, and cable/satellite systems, newspapers, outdoor, local magazines, direct mail, and their related websites and apps. The stations further compete against these media competitors and other local and national digital and mobile media properties. Advertisers compare audience viewership/consumption, market share, audience demographics, and advertising rates, whether local, network, or syndicated, when making advertising decisions.
Regulation
The ownership, operation, and sale of broadcast television stations, including those licensed to the Company, are subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC, which engages in extensive regulation of the broadcasting industry under authority granted by the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (Communications Act), and has the authority to promulgate rules and regulations governing broadcasting. The Communications Act requires broadcasters to serve the public interest. Among other things, the FCC assigns frequency bands; determines stations’ locations and operating parameters; issues, renews, revokes, and modifies station licenses; regulates and limits changes in ownership or control of station licenses; regulates equipment used by stations; regulates station employment practices; regulates certain program and advertising content, including commercial matters in children’s programming; regulates the retransmission of television stations by multichannel video programming distributors; has the authority to impose penalties for violations of its rules or the Communications Act; and imposes annual fees on stations. Reference should be made to the Communications Act, as well as to the FCC’s rules, public notices, and rulings for further information concerning the nature and extent of federal regulation of broadcast stations.
Broadcast licenses are granted for terms of up to eight years. The Communications Act directs the FCC to renew a broadcast license if the station has served the public interest and is in substantial compliance with the provisions of the Communications Act and FCC rules and policies. Management believes the Company is in substantial compliance with all applicable provisions of the Communications Act and FCC rules and policies and knows of no reason why Meredith’s broadcast station licenses will not be renewed.
The FCC has, on occasion, changed the rules related to ownership of media assets, including rules relating to the ownership of one or more television stations in a market. The FCC’s media ownership rules are subject to further review by the FCC, various court appeals, petitions for reconsideration before the FCC, and possible actions by Congress. We cannot predict the impact of any of these developments on our business.
The Communications Act and the FCC also regulate relationships between television broadcasters and cable, satellite, and telecommunications television providers. Under these provisions, most cable systems must devote a specified portion of their channel capacity to the carriage of the signals of local television stations that elect to exercise this right to mandatory carriage. Alternatively, television stations may elect to restrict cable systems from carrying their signals without their written permission, which is referred to as retransmission consent. Congress and the FCC have established and implemented generally similar market-specific requirements for mandatory carriage of local television stations by satellite television providers when those providers choose to provide a market’s local television signals and grants of retransmission consent to satellite television providers. These rules, including existing related rules on exclusivity and good faith bargaining, and proposed rules governing “over-the-top” carriage by Internet video programming distributors are subject to further review by the FCC and possible actions by Congress. Carriage of local television stations by multichannel video programming distributors is also governed by U.S. copyright law, including the Copyright Act of 1976, as amended, which is subject to revision by Congress and interpretation by the courts. We cannot predict further changes in the laws or rules governing these relationships or the impact of any such developments on our business.
The FCC proposed a plan, called the National Broadband Plan, to increase the amount of spectrum available in the U.S. for wireless broadband use. In furtherance of the National Broadband Plan, Congress authorized the FCC to 
 10

conduct a “reverse auction” for which television broadcast licensees could submit bids to receive compensation in return for relinquishing all or a portion of their rights in the television spectrum of their full service and/or Class A stations. Under the law, the FCC was permitted to hold one reverse auction and a follow-up auction for the newly freed spectrum. The FCC completed both auctions in calendar year 2017.
Even if a television licensee did not participate in the reverse auction, Congress granted the FCC the authority to force a television station to change channels and/or modify its coverage area to allow the FCC to rededicate certain channels within the television band for wireless broadband use. Following the incentive auction, the FCC released a list of television stations that were required to change their facilities by a specified date as part of this “repacking” process. Several of our stations were among the hundreds of stations selected for repacking of the television band. All our stations selected for repacking completed their move and commenced operations on their new channels on or before the FCC’s deadline. The FCC reimburses us for certain repacking expenses subject to an overall industry cap on the reimbursed expenses of all repacked television stations and certain other entities. We cannot predict whether we will receive full reimbursement for our repacking expenses or how this process will ultimately affect the broadcast television industry, the Company, or our television stations.
Congress, certain States, and the FCC have under consideration, and in the future may adopt, new laws, regulations, and policies regarding a wide variety of other matters that also could affect, directly or indirectly, the operation, ownership transferability, and profitability of the Company’s broadcast stations and affect the ability of the Company to acquire additional stations. In addition to the matters noted above, these could include, among other things, spectrum usage fees, regulation of political advertising rates, restrictions on the advertising of certain products (such as pharmaceuticals, alcoholic beverages, or gambling), program content restrictions, and ownership rule changes.
Other matters that could potentially affect the Company’s broadcast properties include, but are not limited to, technological innovations and developments generally affecting competition in the mass communications industry for viewers or advertisers, such as home video recording devices and players, satellite radio and television services, cable television systems, newspapers, outdoor advertising, and internet-delivered video programming services. For example, the FCC approved a proposal to allow the voluntary transition of television broadcasters to ATSC 3.0, known as Next Generation Television. We cannot predict whether or how this process will ultimately affect the Company or our television stations.
Large mass communication transactions have also increased the scrutiny of federal and state antitrust enforcement on the mass communications industry. The Company, along with other major broadcasters, is subject to a Consent Decree with the U.S. Department of Justice entered in 2019 restricting the exchange of pacing and other information between stations. In entering the Consent Decree, the Company did not admit liability and was not required to pay any fine or other penalty. We cannot predict whether or how this Consent Decree will ultimately affect the broadcast industry, the Company, or our television stations.
The information provided in this section is not intended to be inclusive of all regulatory provisions currently in effect. Statutory provisions and FCC regulations are subject to change, and any such changes could affect future operations and profitability of the Company’s local media segment. Management cannot predict what regulations or legislation may be adopted, nor can management estimate the effect any such changes would have on the Company’s television broadcasting operations.
