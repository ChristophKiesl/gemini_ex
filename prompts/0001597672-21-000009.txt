Item 1. | Business

We are a global leader of cellulose-based technologies, which comprise a broad offering of high purity cellulose specialties, a natural polymer commonly used in the production of specialty chemicals and polymers for use in producing LCD displays, filters, fibers, performance additives for pharmaceutical, food and other industrial applications. Starting from a tree and building upon more than 90 years of experience in cellulose chemistry, we provide high quality high-purity cellulose pulp products that make up the essential building blocks for our customers’ products while providing exceptional service and value. In addition, we produce lumber, paperboard, newsprint and high-yield pulp for use in consumer products.
Prior to June 27, 2014, we consisted of Rayonier Inc.’s (“Rayonier’s”) wholly-owned performance fibers business which was engaged primarily in the production of cellulose specialties. On that date, we separated from Rayonier and started our business as an independent, publicly traded company.
In November 2017, we completed the acquisition of Tembec Inc. (the “Acquisition”) which manufactured cellulose specialties, as well as lumber, paperboard, newsprint and high-yield pulp. The Acquisition created a combined company with leading positions across the cellulose specialties product spectrum, including acetate, ethers, high-strength viscose, filtration and other cellulose specialties, as well as adding complementary assets in the forest products, paperboard, high-yield pulp and newsprint businesses. 
In November 2019, we sold the Matane pulp mill (the “Matane Mill”), which was acquired in the Acquisition, to Sappi Limited, a global diversified wood fiber company. As a result of the sale, we have reclassified the Matane Mill’s operating results and assets and liabilities for prior periods as discontinued operations. See Note 3 — Discontinued Operations of our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Following the sale of the Matane Mill, we report the following business segments:
•High Purity Cellulose
•Forest Products
•Paperboard
•Pulp & Newsprint
All prior period disclosures have been conformed to the above segment structure. See Note 21 — Segment and Geographical Information of our consolidated financial statements for more information.
High Purity Cellulose
The High Purity Cellulose segment, and in particular the cellulose specialties product line, is the primary driver of our profitability. Cellulose specialties are natural polymers, used as raw materials to manufacture a broad range of consumer-oriented products such as liquid crystal displays, impact-resistant plastics, thickeners for food products, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, cigarette filters, high-tenacity rayon yarn for tires and industrial hoses, food casings, paints and lacquers. We manufacture products tailored to the precise and demanding chemical and physical specifications of our customers, achieving industry-leading purity and product functionality. Our ability to consistently manufacture high-quality cellulose specialties products is the result of our proprietary production processes, intellectual property, and more than 90 years of technical expertise and knowledge of cellulosic chemistry.
Additionally, a significant portion of our production capacity is dedicated to manufacturing high-purity commodity products for viscose and absorbent materials applications. Commodity viscose is a raw material required for the manufacture of viscose staple fibers which are used in woven applications such as rayon textiles for clothing and other fabrics, and in non-woven applications such as baby wipes, cosmetic and personal wipes, industrial wipes and mattress ticking. Absorbent materials, typically referred to as fluff fibers, are used as an absorbent medium in products such as disposable baby diapers, feminine hygiene products, incontinence pads, convalescent bed pads, industrial towels and wipes and non-woven fabrics. Cellulose specialties typically contain over 95 percent cellulose, while commodity products typically contain less than 95 percent cellulose.
Products
Cellulose Specialties
Cellulose specialties are a natural polymer primarily derived from either wood or cotton and are used as a principal raw material to manufacture a broad range of products. Cellulose specialties generally command a price premium and earn higher margins relative to other commodity wood pulp products. Cellulose specialties are a dissolving wood pulp product which target a combination of high purity and high viscosity. Unlike other wood pulps used for their physical properties, cellulose specialties are sought after for the unique chemical properties and reactivity they impart on downstream products. 
Derived from wood, our cellulose specialties require high levels of purity, consistency and process knowledge. Our products play a significant role in our customers’ manufacturing processes, which require cellulose specialties of high purity and uniformity for efficient production. Therefore, our customers demand products of the highest quality. As a result, our products are custom-engineered and manufactured to each customers’ unique specifications and require a stringent qualification process; our quality and consistency allow our customers to operate more efficiently and cost-effectively.
One of our key competitive advantages is our unique ability to leverage our global manufacturing asset base to provide our customers greater supply chain security for cellulose specialties fibers. With our four facilities and five manufacturing lines capable of producing cellulose specialties, we are the only cellulose specialties producer in the world with flexibility to use both hardwood and softwood fibers, kraft and sulfite cooking processes, and a variety of proprietary chemical treatments to provide customized product functionality. Additionally, we possess significant process knowledge: the understanding of wood fiber properties and their modification under a sequence of chemical processes, accumulated and developed over 90 years of practical application to satisfy a variety of customer needs. This process knowledge, combined with our manufacturing scale and flexibility and knowledge of customers’ applications and specifications, makes us the industry’s most adaptable modifier of cellulose fibers.
Commodity Products
We can shift our High Purity Cellulose segment manufacturing assets between commodity viscose and absorbent materials production. Historically we have opted to participate in both markets and fluctuate production to take advantage of market conditions and generate the most attractive margins.
Commodity viscose is primarily sold to producers of viscose staple fibers which in turn are used to manufacture rayon fibers which are widely used in the clothing and textile industries. Shifts in fashion styles and textile fiber blending have increased demand for viscose staple fibers. Additionally, variability in cotton linter supply and increasing environmental concerns about cotton production have resulted in viscose staple producers shifting volume away from cotton linter pulp to wood-based dissolving pulp.
Absorbent materials, or fluff fibers, are typically used in consumer products such as baby diapers. These fibers provide a medium for fluid acquisition, distribution and retention in the products in which they are incorporated. Pricing for commodity products is typically referenced to published indexes or based on publicly available spot market prices.
Competition
Cellulose Specialties
Significant intellectual property, capital investment and technical expertise are needed to design and manufacture customized cellulose specialties fibers to exacting customer specifications. The product must be formulated to achieve the desired characteristics including parameters for purity, viscosity, brightness, reactivity and other physical properties. Product qualification time can be lengthy, extending six to twenty-four months. Resulting customer relationships are typically long-term and are based on an understanding of our customers’ production processes and technical expertise which we utilize to help solve our customers’ production challenges and support new product development. Further, establishing a production line and obtaining the necessary production technologies requires substantial capital and ongoing maintenance expenditures.
Product performance, technical service and price are principal methods of competition in cellulose specialties. Product performance is primarily determined by the chemical attributes of the pulp, including purity, viscosity and uniformity of the cellulose specialties. Our processes, which are a key element of our intellectual property, are capable of generating cellulose specialties purity levels in excess of 98 percent as well as the highest levels of viscosity derived from wood pulp. Typically, product pricing is set annually in the fourth quarter for the following year based on discussions with customers and the terms of contractual arrangements.
We compete with both domestic and foreign producers in cellulose specialties. Competitors include GP Cellulose, Borregaard, Bracell, Sappi, Nippon, Cosmo Specialty Fibers and Aditya Birla Group. Some competitors use both wood and cotton linter fibers, as a source of cellulose fibers. Our multiple manufacturing lines, processes and intellectual property allow us to compete in more segments of the cellulose specialties market than any of our competitors.
Commodity Products
The principal method of competition in commodity products is price, as purity and uniformity are less critical differentiators. We compete with both domestic and foreign producers of commodity products.
For commodity viscose, many competitors derive their commodity viscose from either wood or cotton. Although cellulose specialties can generally be sold to meet commodity viscose demand, the reverse is not typically true. However, in recent years commodity viscose has continued to supplant cotton as the preferred raw material input for viscose staple fiber production. For commodity viscose, major competitors include Sappi, Austrocell and Bracell.
For absorbent materials, major competitors include GP Cellulose, Domtar and International Paper.
Forest Products
We manufacture and market high-quality, construction-grade softwood lumber, both stud and random lengths, in North America through our six sawmills located in Canada.
In 2020, approximately 67 percent of our lumber sales were exported from Canada to the U.S. On December 28, 2017, the United States Department of Commerce (“USDOC”) issued a determination for countervailing and anti-dumping duties (collectively, the “Duties”) of approximately 20 percent on imports of softwood lumber from Canada. On January 3, 2018, the USDOC issued orders to the United States Customs and Border Protection to collect the Duties on softwood lumber imports from Canada. Through year-end 2020, the Company has paid approximately $91 million of duties. In December 2020, following its administrative review of the period of April 28, 2017 through December 31, 2018 (“First Administrative Review”), the USDOC determined revised rates for the Duties, with the Company now being subject to an anti-dumping duty rate of approximately nine percent. 
Products
We manufacture finished dimensional lumber (2 by 4’s, 2 by 8’s, etc.) made of spruce, pine, or fir, used in the construction of residential and multi-family homes, light industrial and commercial facilities, and the home repair and remodel markets. Wood chips, a by-product of the lumber manufacturing process, are used as raw materials in our High Purity Cellulose, Pulp and Newsprint facilities in Canada. Additionally, bark and sawdust are used for fuel in several of our operations.
Competition
The principal method of competition in the Forest Products segment is price, which is based on individual sawmill efficiency, the availability of competitively-priced raw materials, demand for wood products used in the construction of residential and multi-family homes as well as demand from the repair and remodel of existing homes. Residential and multi-family home construction is influenced by demographic factors such as population growth, employment, consumer confidence, consumer income, availability of financing and interest rate levels, and the supply and pricing of existing homes on the market. Repair and remodel activity is affected by the size and age of existing housing inventory and access to home equity financing and other credit.
Our significant competitors include West Fraser Timber Ltd., Resolute Forest Products, Weyerhaeuser, Georgia Pacific, Interfor, Canfor, Eacom and other producers of softwood lumber in North America.
Paperboard
We manufacture paperboard in the Temiscaming plant in Quebec.

Raw Materials and Input Costs
All our manufacturing operations require significant amounts of wood fiber, in the form of logs or wood chips, as a raw material and energy to produce our products. Additionally, our High Purity Cellulose and Pulp & Newsprint segments’ manufacturing processes require significant amounts of chemicals. These raw materials and input costs are subject to significant changes in prices as a result of weather conditions, supply and demand. To control cost, we continually pursue reductions in usage and costs of key supplies, services and raw materials. We do not foresee any material constraints in the near term from pricing or availability.
Wood
Our Canadian Forest Products operations rely on the consistent supply of substantial quantities of logs. Substantially all timberlands in Canada are government-owned and the right to harvest timber is acquired through provincially-granted licenses. Licenses grant the holder the right to harvest, for a fee, up to a specified quantity of timber annually. Government objectives in granting licenses include responsible management of timber, soils, wildlife, water and fish resources and the preservation of biodiversity and the protection of cultural values. The objectives also include achieving the fullest possible economic utilization of the forest resources and employment in local communities. In addition, license holders are required to replant the trees harvested to ensure re-establishment of the forest after harvesting. Reforestation projects are planned and supervised by our forest resource management staff and subject to approval by relevant government authorities. Our timber harvesting operations are performed directly or carried out by independent contractors under our forest resource management supervision.
In Canada, the High Purity Cellulose and Pulp & Newsprint plants are supplied with wood chips produced as a by-product from the lumber manufacturing process.
In the U.S. and France, we supply wood chips to our High Purity Cellulose plants through the purchase of chips from lumber producers or produce chips through our wood chipping facilities.
Chemicals
Chemicals, which include caustic soda (sodium hydroxide), sulfuric acid, ammonia, sodium chlorate and various specialty chemicals, are purchased under negotiated supply agreements with third parties. The prices for these products are impacted by various factors including supply and demand, environmental regulation, energy prices and overall economic conditions.
Energy
Our energy is primarily produced through the burning of lignin and other residual biomass in recovery and power boilers located at our plants. However, our manufacturing facilities still utilize significant amounts of fuel oil, natural gas and purchased electricity to supplement their energy requirements. In addition, energy prices impact our transportation costs for delivery of raw materials to our manufacturing facilities and delivery of our finished products to customers.
Intellectual Property
Substantially all of our intellectual property relates to our High Purity Cellulose segment. We own patents, trademarks and trade secrets, and have developed significant know-how, particularly in the production of high purity cellulose, which we deem important to our operations. We intend to protect our intellectual property, including, when appropriate, filing patent applications for inventions that we deem important to our business and operations. Our U.S. patents generally have a duration of 20 years from the date of filing. We also require key employees to enter into non-compete agreements as appropriate.
Seasonality
Our operating results are not significantly affected by seasonal changes. However, working capital is affected by the Canadian wood harvest which occurs primarily in the winter months.
Customers
No single customer accounted for more than 10 percent of our consolidated net sales during the year ended December 31, 2020. 
Research and Development
Research and development capabilities and activities are focused on the High Purity Cellulose segment. The quality and consistency of our cellulose specialties and research and development capabilities create a significant competitive advantage; they are important factors in achieving an optimal value for our cellulose specialties products. Our research and development efforts are primarily directed at further developing products and technologies, improving the quality of cellulose fiber grades, improving manufacturing efficiency and environmental controls and reducing fossil fuel consumption. We continue to focus our research and development activities to develop and market additional new products and applications.
