ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

The Company 
 Century Bancorp, Inc. (together with its bank subsidiary, unless the context otherwise requires, the “Company”) is a Massachusetts state-chartered bank holding company headquartered in Medford, Massachusetts. The Company is a Massachusetts corporation formed in 1972 and has one banking subsidiary (the “Bank”): Century Bank and Trust Company formed in 1969. At December 31, 2020, the Company had total assets of $6.4 billion. Currently, the Company operates 27 banking offices in 20 cities and towns in Massachusetts, ranging from Braintree in the south to Andover in the north. The Bank’s customers consist primarily of small and medium-sized businesses and retail customers in these communities and surrounding areas, as well as local governments and large healthcare and higher education institutions throughout Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Virginia, Washington DC, and Pennsylvania. 
 The Company’s results of operations are largely dependent on net interest income, which is the difference between the interest earned on loans and securities and interest paid on deposits and borrowings. The results of operations are also affected by the level of income and fees from loans and deposits, as well as operating expenses, the provision for loan losses, the impact of federal and state income taxes and the relative levels of interest rates and economic activity. 
 The Company offers a wide range of services to commercial enterprises, state and local governments and agencies, non-profit organizations, and individuals. It emphasizes service to small and medium-sized businesses and retail customers in its market area. The Company makes commercial loans, real estate and construction loans and consumer loans, and accepts savings, time, and demand deposits. In addition, the Company offers to its corporate and institutional customers automated lock box collection services, cash management services and account reconciliation services, and actively promotes the marketing of these services to the municipal market. Also, the Company provides full service securities brokerage services through a program called Investment Services at Century Bank, which is supported by LPL Financial, a third party full-service securities brokerage business. 
 The Company has municipal cash management client engagements in Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode Island comprised of approximately 302 government entities. 
 Availability of Company Filings 
 Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Sections 13 and 15(d), periodic and current reports must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The Company electronically files with the SEC its periodic and current reports, as well as other filings it makes with the SEC from time to time. The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports and other information regarding issuers, including the Company, that file electronically with the SEC, at www.sec.gov, in which all forms filed electronically may be accessed. Additionally, our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K and additional shareholder information are available free of charge on the Company’s website: www.centurybank.com. 
 Employees and Human Capital Resources 
 As of December 31, 2020, the Company had 418 full-time and 50 part-time employees. The Company’s employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit. The Company believes that its employee relations are good. We encourage and support the growth and development of our employees. Continual learning and career development is advanced through ongoing performance and development conversations with employees, internally developed training programs, customized corporate training engagements and educational reimbursement programs.

  The safety, health and wellness of our employees is a top priority. The COVID-19 pandemic presented a unique challenge with regard to maintaining employee safety while continuing successful operations. Through teamwork and the adaptability of our management and staff, we were able to transition, over a short period of time, 28% of our employees to effectively working from remote locations and ensure a safely-distanced working environment for employees performing customer facing activities at branches and operations centers. All employees are asked not to come to work when they experience signs or symptoms of a possible COVID-19 illness and have been provided additional paid time off to cover compensation during such absences. On an ongoing basis, we further promote the health and wellness of our employees by strongly encouraging work-life balance, offering flexible work schedules, keeping the employee portion of health care premiums to a minimum and sponsoring various wellness programs. We believe our commitment to living out our core values, actively prioritizing concern for our employees’ well-being, supporting our employees’ career goals, offering competitive wages and providing valuable fringe benefits aids in retention of our top-performing employees. 
 Supervision and Regulation 
 The Company and the Bank are subject to extensive regulation under federal and state laws designed to promote the safety and soundness of depository institutions and protect consumers. 
 Among other requirements, these laws require extensive disclosures to consumers concerning the substantive terms of the deposit taking, lending, and payment services provided by the Bank, regulate the collection, use and disclosure of non-public personal information concerning consumers and require disclosure of privacy practices, prohibit unfair, deceptive and/or abusive acts or practices, and address other matters. Violations of consumer protection laws can result in substantial civil money penalties and other consequences. 
 The Community Reinvestment Act requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to evaluate the Bank’s performance in helping to meet the credit needs of the entire communities it serves, generally based upon the Banks record of making loans in its assessment area, its investments in community development projects, affordable housing and programs that benefit low-to-moderate income persons and geographies, and its delivery of services through its branch offices and ATMs. Failure to achieve at least a “Satisfactory” rating under the Community Reinvestment Act could prevent the Bank or the Company from undertaking certain activities in the future, including establishment of new branch offices and the acquisition of other financial institutions. Massachusetts has a law that is substantially equivalent to the federal Community Reinvestment Act. 
 Federal law requires financial institutions such as the Bank to implement a written anti-money laundering program to mitigate risk that the financial services it provides may be used to facilitate money laundering and terrorist financing, including verifying the identify its customers and beneficial owners of legal entity customers, and monitoring and reporting to the government suspicious activity. 
 Banking laws require banks and bank holding companies to operate with at least a minimum level of capital, restrict dividends payable by banks and bank holding companies and require bank holding companies to serve as a source of financial strength to their subsidiary banks. These laws may limit the Company’s capacity to declare and pay dividends to shareholders and may require the Company to take actions to support the Bank even at times when the Company may not necessarily have the resources to do so. 
 Certain aspects of federal and state banking laws are described below. 
 Financial Services Modernization 
 On November 12, 1999, President Clinton signed into law The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“Gramm-Leach”) which significantly altered banking laws in the United States. Gramm-Leach enables combinations among banks, securities firms and insurance companies beginning March 11, 2000. As a result of Gramm Leach, many of the 
 
2 

  depression-era laws that restricted these affiliations and other activities that may be engaged in by banks and bank holding companies were repealed. Under Gramm-Leach, bank holding companies are permitted to offer their customers virtually any type of financial service that is financial in nature or incidental thereto, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both underwriting and agency) and merchant banking. 
 In order to engage in these financial activities, a bank holding company must qualify and register with the Federal Reserve Board as a “financial holding company” by demonstrating that each of its bank subsidiaries is “well capitalized,” “well managed,” and has at least a “satisfactory” rating under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (the “CRA”). The Company has not elected to become a financial holding company under Gramm-Leach. 
 These financial activities authorized by Gramm-Leach may also be engaged in by a “financial subsidiary” of a national or state bank, except for insurance or annuity underwriting, insurance company portfolio investments, real estate investment and development and merchant banking, which must be conducted in a financial holding company. In order for the new financial activities to be engaged in by a financial subsidiary of a national or state bank, Gramm-Leach requires each of the parent bank (and any bank affiliates) to be “well capitalized” and “well managed;” the aggregate consolidated assets of all of that bank’s financial subsidiaries may not exceed the lesser of 45% of its consolidated total assets or $50 billion; the bank must have at least a satisfactory CRA rating; and, if the bank is one of the 100 largest banks, it must meet certain financial rating or other comparable requirements. The Company does not currently conduct activities through a financial subsidiary. 
 Gramm-Leach establishes a system of functional regulation, under which the federal banking agencies will regulate the banking activities of financial holding companies and banks’ financial subsidiaries, the SEC will regulate their securities activities, and state insurance regulators will regulate their insurance activities. Gramm-Leach also provides new protections against the transfer and use by financial institutions of consumers’ nonpublic, personal information. 
 Holding Company Regulation 
 The Company is a bank holding company as defined by the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “Holding Company Act”) and is registered as such with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “FRB”), which is responsible for administration of the Holding Company Act. Although the Company may meet the qualifications for electing to become a financial holding company under Gramm-Leach, the Company has elected to retain its pre-Gramm-Leach status for the present time under the Holding Company Act. As required by the Holding Company Act, the Company files with the FRB an annual report regarding its financial condition and operations, management and intercompany relationships of the Company and the Bank. It is also subject to examination by the FRB and must obtain FRB approval before (i) acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting stock of any bank or bank holding company, unless it already owns or controls a majority of the voting stock of that bank or bank holding company, (ii) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of a bank, except through a subsidiary which is a bank, or (iii) merging or consolidating with any other bank holding company. A bank holding company must also give the FRB prior written notice before purchasing or redeeming its equity securities, if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when aggregated with the net consideration paid by the company for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the company’s consolidated net worth. 
 The Holding Company Act prohibits a bank holding company, with certain exceptions, from (i) acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of voting shares of any company which is not a bank or a bank holding company, or (ii) engaging in any activity other than managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to or performing services for its subsidiaries. A bank holding company may own, however, shares of a company engaged in activities which the FRB has determined are so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. 
 The Company and its subsidiaries are examined by federal and state regulators.

  USA PATRIOT Act 
 Under Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act, also known as the “International Money Laundering Abatement and Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001”, all financial institutions are required in general to identify their customers, adopt formal and comprehensive anti-money laundering programs, scrutinize, or prohibit altogether certain transactions of special concern, and be prepared to respond to inquiries from U.S. law enforcement agencies concerning their customers and their transactions. Additional information-sharing among financial institutions, regulators, and law enforcement authorities is encouraged by the presence of an exemption from the privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach Act for financial institutions that comply with this provision and the authorization of the Secretary of the Treasury to adopt rules to further encourage cooperation and information-sharing. The effectiveness of a financial institution in combating money laundering activities is a factor to be considered in any application submitted by the financial institution under the Holding Company Act or Bank Merger Act. 
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, signed into law July 30, 2002, addresses, among other issues, corporate governance, auditor independence and accounting standards, executive compensation, insider loans, whistleblower protection and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. The SEC has adopted a substantial number of implementing rules and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has adopted corporate governance rules that have been approved by the SEC and are applicable to the Company. The changes are intended to allow stockholders to monitor more effectively the performance of companies and management. As directed by Section 302(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are each required to certify that the Company’s quarterly and annual reports do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact. This requirement has several parts, including certification that these officers are responsible for establishing, maintaining and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting; that they have made certain disclosures to the Company’s auditors and the Board of Directors about the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, and that they have included information in the Company’s quarterly and annual reports about their evaluation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, and whether there have been significant changes in the Company’s internal disclosure controls and procedures or in other factors that could significantly affect such controls and procedures subsequent to the evaluation and whether there have been any significant changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected or reasonably likely to materially affect the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, and compliance with certain other disclosure objectives. Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires an additional certification that each periodic report containing financial statements fully complies with the requirements of Section 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and that the information in the report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial conditions and results of operations of the Company. 
 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 
 On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “D-F Act”) became law. The D-F Act was intended to address many issues arising in the recent financial crisis and is exceedingly broad in scope, affecting many aspects of bank and financial market regulation. The D-F Act requires, or permits by implementing regulation, enhanced prudential standards for banks and bank holding companies inclusive of capital, leverage, liquidity, concentration, and exposure measures. In addition, traditional bank regulatory principles such as restrictions on transactions with affiliates and insiders were enhanced. The D-F Act also contains reforms of consumer mortgage lending practices and creates a Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, which is granted broad authority over consumer financial practices of banks and others. It is expected as the specific new or incremental requirements applicable to the Company become effective that the costs and difficulties of remaining compliant with all such requirements will increase. The D-F Act broadened the base for FDIC assessments to average consolidated assets less tangible equity of financial institutions and also permanently raises the current standard maximum FDIC deposit insurance amount to $250,000.

  In addition, the D-F Act added a new Section 13 to the Bank Holding Company Act, the so-called “Volcker Rule,” (the “Rule”) which generally restricts certain banking entities such as the Company and its subsidiaries or affiliates, from engaging in proprietary trading activities and owning equity in or sponsoring any private equity or hedge fund. The Rule became effective July 21, 2012. The final implementing regulations for the Rule were issued by various regulatory agencies in December 2013 and under an extended conformance regulation compliance was required to be achieved by July 21, 2015. The conformance period for investments in and relationships with certain “legacy covered funds” was extended to July 21, 2017. Under the Rule, the Company may be restricted from engaging in proprietary trading, investing in third party hedge or private equity funds or sponsoring new funds unless it qualifies for an exemption from the rule. The Company has little involvement in prohibited proprietary trading or investment activities in covered funds and the Company does not expect that complying with the requirements of the Rule will have any material effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operation. The federal banking agencies have issued amendments to the Rule to provide greater clarity and certainty about what activities are prohibited and to improve the effective allocation of compliance resources, and to conform the Rule to the EGRRCPA (discussed below). In addition, pursuant to the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, or EGRRCPA, which was enacted on May 24, 2018, the Volcker rule excludes from its coverage an insured depository institution if it has and if every company that controls it has total consolidated assets of $10 billion or less and consolidated trading assets and liabilities that are 5% or less of consolidated assets. 
 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 
 On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) was enacted, which represents the most comprehensive reform to the U.S. tax code in over thirty years. The majority of the provisions of the Tax Act took effect on January 1, 2018. The Tax Act lowered the Company’s federal tax rate from 34% to 21%. Also, for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (“AMT”) has been repealed. For 2018 through 2021, the AMT credit carryforward can offset regular tax liability and is refundable in an amount equal to 50% (100% for 2021) of the excess of the minimum tax credit for the tax year over the amount of the credit allowable for the year against regular tax liability. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act was signed into law. As a result of the CARES Act, the full balance of the AMT credit was refunded during 2020. The Tax Act also contains other provisions that may affect the Company currently or in future years. Among these are changes to the deductibility of meals and entertainment, the deductibility of executive compensation, the dividend received deduction and net operating loss carryforwards. Tax Act changes for individuals include lower tax rates, mortgage interest and state and local tax limitations as well as an increase in the standard deduction, among others. 
Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act, Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA), and Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2021 
 On March 18, 2020 the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) was signed into law and on March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act was signed into law. The FFCRA and the CARES Act provide relief for families and businesses impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. The provisions in this legislation include, among other things, loan programs for businesses, expanded unemployment insurance benefits, stimulus payments to certain taxpayers, new provisions on sick leave and family leave, and funding for a variety of health-related efforts and government programs. Also, as a result of the CARES Act, the full balance of the AMT credit was refunded in 2020. 
 In response to the pandemic, on March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act was signed into law. The CARES Act, among other things, provides cash payments to certain individuals and has various programs for businesses. In particular, it includes the Payroll Protection Program (PPP) which provides forgivable loans to qualified small businesses, primarily to allow these businesses to continue to pay their employees. The original amount allocated to the program was $349 billion, which was exhausted on April 16, 2020. On April 24, 2020, an additional allocation of $310 billion was signed into law. These loans are 
 
5 

  funded by participating banks and are 100% guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA). If utilized primarily for payroll, subject to certain other conditions, the loans may be forgiven, in whole or in part, and repaid by the SBA. During 2020, the Company participated in the SBA PPP program. PPP originations totaled approximately 1,300 loans for approximately $232 million. As of December 31, 2020, Century Bank’s PPP loans totaled approximately 1,157 loans for approximately $196 million. The fees collected, from the SBA, amount to approximately $8.0 million. Cost deferrals amounted to approximately $1.2 million. The fees and costs are being amortized over the lives of the loans utilizing the level-yield method. 
 Under Section 4013 of the CARES Act, loans less than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019 will be considered current for COVID-19 modifications. The Company can then suspend the requirements under GAAP for loan modifications related to COVID-19 that would otherwise be categorized as a Troubled Debt Restructuring (TDR), and suspend any determination of a loan modified as a result of COVID-19 as being a TDR, including the requirement to determine impairment for accounting purposes. 
 As of December 31, 2020, and as a result of COVID-19 loan modifications, the Company has modifications of 20 loans aggregating approximately $25 million, primarily consisting of short-term payment deferrals. Of these modifications, $25 million, or 100%, were performing in accordance with their modified terms. 
 The CARES Act also allows companies to delay Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (CECL), including the current expected credit losses methodology for estimating allowances for credit losses. The Company elected to delay FASB ASU 2016-13. This ASU was delayed until the earlier of the date on which the national emergency concerning the COVID–19 outbreak declared by the President on March 15, 2020 terminates or December 31, 2020, with an effective retrospective implementation date of January 1, 2020. On December 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2021 was signed into law. The law changed the delayed implementation date to the earlier of the Company’s fiscal year that begins after the date on which the national emergency terminates or January 1, 2022. 
 Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act 
 The EGRRCPA requires the federal banking agencies to develop a community bank leverage ratio (defined as the ratio of tangible equity capital to average total consolidated assets) for banks and holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion and an appropriate risk profile. The required regulations must specify a minimum community bank leverage ratio of not less than 8% and not more than 10%. The federal banking agencies jointly issued a final rule, effective January 1, 2020, which set the minimum ratio at 9%. Qualifying banks that exceed the minimum community bank leverage ratio will be deemed to be in compliance with all other capital and leverage requirements including the capital ratio requirements that are required to be considered well capitalized under Section 38 of Federal Deposit Insurance Act. On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was enacted to address the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act reduced the community bank leverage ratio from 9% to 8% until the earlier of the end of the national emergency related to the COVID-19 pandemic or December 31, 2020. In response to the CARES Act, federal banking regulators set the community bank leverage ratio at 8% for the remainder of 2020, 8.5% for 2021 and 9% thereafter. The Company and the Bank have not elected to use the community bank leverage framework. 
Deposit Insurance Premiums 
 The Bank’s deposits are insured by the FDIC insurance up to applicable limits. The FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund is funded by assessments on insured depository institutions, which depend on the risk category of an institution and the amount of assets that it holds. The FDIC may increase or decrease the assessment rate schedule on a semi-annual basis. Deposit insurance premiums are based on total consolidated assets less average tangible equity. In 2016, the FDIC’s Board of Directors adopted a final rule that changed the manner in which deposit insurance assessment rates are calculated for established small banks, generally those banks with less 
 
6 

  than $10 billion of assets that have been insured for at least five years. The rule utilizes the CAMELS rating system, which is a supervisory rating system designed to take into account and reflect all financial and operational risks that a bank may face, including capital adequacy, asset quality, management capability, earnings, liquidity and sensitivity to market risk. To determine a bank’s assessment rate, each of seven financial ratios and a weighted average of CAMELS component ratings are multiplied by a corresponding pricing multiplier. The sum of these products is added to a uniform amount, with the resulting sum being an institution’s initial base assessment rate (subject to minimum or maximum assessment rates based on a bank’s CAMELS composite rating). This method takes into account various measures, including an institution’s leverage ratio, brokered deposit ratio, one-year asset growth, the ratio of net income before taxes to total assets and considerations related to asset quality. In December 2018, the FDIC issued a final rule to implement a provision in EGRRCPA providing a limited exception for a capped amount of reciprocal deposits from treatment as brokered deposits for qualifying institutions. 
 On January 24, 2019, the FDIC notified the Company that $1.2 million of small bank assessment credits were available to offset quarterly FDIC assessment charges. The FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund Reserve Ratio reached 1.40% as of June 30, 2019, and the FDIC first applied small bank credits on the September 30, 2019 assessment invoice (for the second quarter of 2019). The FDIC will continue to apply small bank credits so long as the Reserve Ratio is at least 1.35%. After applying small bank credits for four quarters, the FDIC will remit the value of any remaining small bank credits in the next assessment period in which the Reserve Ratio is at least 1.35%. The Company utilized the remaining small bank assessment credit during 2020. 
 Risk-Based Capital Guidelines 
 Federal banking regulators have issued risk-based capital guidelines, which assign risk weights to asset categories and off-balance-sheet items and require banking organizations to maintain capital as a specified percentage of risk-weighted assets and a minimum. Also, the Basel Committee has issued capital standards entitled “Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems” (“Basel III”). The Federal Reserve Board has finalized its rule implementing the Basel III regulatory capital framework. The rule that came into effect in January 2015 sets the Basel III minimum regulatory capital requirements for all organizations. It included a new common equity Tier I ratio of 4.5 percent of risk-weighted assets, raised the minimum Tier I capital ratio from 4 percent to 6 percent of risk-weighted assets and would set a new conservation buffer of 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets. The implementation of the framework did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. 
Competition 
 The Company experiences substantial competition in attracting deposits and making loans from commercial banks, thrift institutions and other enterprises such as insurance companies and mutual funds. These competitors include several major commercial banks whose greater resources may afford them a competitive advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous branch offices and mount extensive advertising campaigns. A number of these competitors are not subject to the regulatory oversight that the Company is subject to, which increases these competitors’ flexibility. 
 Forward-Looking Statements 
 Except for the historical information contained herein, this Annual Report on Form 10-K may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended. Investors are cautioned that forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain. Actual performance and results of operations may differ materially from those projected or suggested in the forward-looking statements due to certain risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, (i) the fact of the indeterminant length and extent of the economic contraction resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, (ii) the fact that the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operation have been or 
 
7 

  may be negatively impacted by the extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, (iii) the fact that consumer behavior may change due to changing political, business and economic conditions, including increased unemployment, or legislative or regulatory initiatives, (iv) the fact that the Company’s success is dependent to a significant extent upon general economic conditions in New England, (v) the fact that the Company’s earnings depend to a great extent upon the level of net interest income (the difference between interest income earned on loans and investments and the interest expense paid on deposits and other borrowings) generated by the Bank and thus the Bank’s results of operations may be adversely affected by increases or decreases in interest rates, (vi) the fact that the Bank’s participation in the Paycheck Protection Program involves reputational risks (vii) the fact that the banking business is highly competitive and the profitability of the Company depends upon the Bank’s ability to attract loans and deposits within its market area, where the Bank competes with a variety of traditional banking and other institutions such as credit unions and finance companies, (viii) the fact that our operations are subject to risks including, but not limited to, cybersecurity incidents, fraud, natural disasters and future pandemics, (ix) the fact that future credit losses may be higher than currently expected due to changes in economic assumptions and adverse economic developments, and (x) the fact that a significant portion of the Company’s loan portfolio is comprised of commercial loans, exposing the Company to the risks inherent in loans based upon analyses of credit risk, the value of underlying collateral, including real estate, and other more intangible factors, which are considered in making commercial loans. Accordingly, the Company’s profitability may be negatively impacted by errors in risk analyses, and by loan defaults, and the ability of certain borrowers to repay such loans may be adversely affected by any downturn in general economic conditions, These factors, as well as general economic and market conditions, may materially and adversely affect the market price of shares of the Company’s common stock. Because of these and other factors, including those described under “Risk Factors” in Item 1A. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, past financial performance should not be considered an indicator of future performance. You should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. You should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on forward-looking statements because they are subject to significant risks, uncertainties and other factors which are, in some cases, beyond the Company’s control. The forward-looking statements contained herein represent the Company’s judgment as of the date of this Form 10-K, and the Company cautions readers not to place undue reliance on such statements.
