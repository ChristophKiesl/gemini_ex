ITEM 1.    DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
GENERAL
 
The Company was originally incorporated in the State of Colorado on February 16, 1984 under the name of Oravest Interests, Inc.  On April 10, 2002 we re-domiciled to the State of Nevada under the name Broadleaf Capital Partners, Inc.  On July 23, 2014 we changed our name to EnergyTek Corp.
 
On March 31, 2014 we closed a transaction whereby we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of Texas Gulf Oil & Gas, Inc., a Nevada corporation, which were contributed to our then wholly-owned subsidiary Texas Gulf Exploration & Production, Inc. On March 31, 2014, we also closed a transaction whereby we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of Litigation Capital, Inc., a Nevada corporation, which were contributed to our then wholly-owned subsidiary Legal Capital Corp.
 
On January 6, 2015, we entered into a Joint Venture Agreement with Wagley Offshore-Onshore, Inc. to pursue a distressed energy asset acquisition program. The joint venture was formed as Wagley-EnergyTEK J.V. LLC, a Texas limited liability company to which we issued 2,000,000 restricted shares of our common stock.
 
Effective September 13, 2016, the Company acquired Timefire, LLC, a Phoenix-based virtual reality content developer that is an Arizona limited liability company and is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. As consideration for the acquisition, the Company issued the equity holders of Timefire a total of 41,400,000 shares of the Company's common stock and 2,800,000 five-year warrants, which constituted a change of control of the Company (the “Merger”). Effective November 21, 2016, we effected a one-for-10 reverse stock split and changed our name to TimefireVR Inc. The common stock share numbers used throughout this report give effect to the reverse split.
 
In connection with the Merger, the Company dissolved Wagley-EnergyTEK J.V. LLC and cancelled its shares of the Company. In December 2016, the Company transferred ownership of Texas Gulf Oil & Gas, Inc. and Legal Capital Corp. to Litigation Capital, Inc. in exchange for Litigation Capital, Inc. assuming approximately $180,000 of the Company’s liabilities. This had the effect of terminating the Company’s oil and gas business.
 
DESCRIPTION OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
 
We are focused on building a software-based virtual reality, or “VR,” ecosystem designed to alter the course of social interaction, experiential learning, commerce, and culture by way of VR. Using our VR developed content as well as user community-developed content, we intend to provide a complex and massive virtual economy that is replete with the arts, culture, education, social interaction, and commerce. Our first product, which has been under full development for over two years, is the first VR global city, “Hypatia.” Hypatia is designed to offer revolutionary social and experiential content and is expected to launch with over 40 hours of unique content. In addition, Hypatia will offer an expanding ecosystem where its users can create, market, and sell products and services, experience new content daily, and visit new features. Users can download Hypatia and explore basic features for free, while other features will require payment to utilize. Monetization opportunities include real estate, commerce, advertising and participation fees. Hypatia has not yet generated revenues as of the date of this report, and we cannot offer any assurances as to if, or when, it will begin to generate revenues.
Anticipated Trial and Launch Timeline
 
The Company launched its first, or test, version of Hypatia – which we refer to as “Alpha Phase I” - in late March 2017. The initial test field is comprised of up to 200 U.S.-based VR industry experts and seasoned gamers, as well as some users with no prior VR or gaming experience. The test phase is expected to last approximately one month, providing detailed analysis, which the Company will use to make adjustments and modifications to the product.
 
We expect to launch Hypatia in its substantially final form, or the beta version, in the fourth quarter of 2017 or sooner.
 
Hypatia’s initial commercial roll-out will be social media driven, including through the Steam VR store, which had approximately 125 million users as of April 25, 2016 (according to a Valve Corporation press release), and HTC’s Viveport online distribution and arcade channels. Subsequent roll-out is planned for platforms such as Facebook’s Oculus (which remains a closed system until 2018), Sony PlayStation VR, and Google Direct Venture, with planned mobile applications for Google Play and the Apple App Store.

COMPETITION & COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS
 
The primary competitors to Hypatia are AltspaceVR (developed by Altspace VR Inc.), Sansar and Second Life (developed by Linden Research, Inc., doing business as Linden Lab); vTime (developed by the UK-based Starship Group); High Fidelity (developed by High Fidelity, Inc.); VRChat (developed by VRChat LLC), and VR Life (developed by VR Life S.L.), all of which are virtual environments. Other than Sansar, Second Life and High Fidelity, our competitors primarily provide seated-only chat in a fixed area environment.
 
To the Company’s knowledge, only Sansar, Second Life and High Fidelity are planning the launch of a metaverse built for the immersive tethered headset VR platform. These environments are expected to be more heavily curated by users than Hypatia will be, which creates the risk that they will be less suitable environments for younger users. Hypatia is developing and integrating a review process for all community-generated content prior to that content going live. In addition, these competitive worlds appear to be geared primarily at the social space, with entertainment playing a large role. In contrast, Hypatia's ultimate focus is experiential learning involving cultural immersion, social interaction, collaborative participation, and commerce in addition to entertainment. We expect that Hypatia’s city elements will be further distinguished from our competitors’ by the “big city” incorporation of density, largely influenced by international capitals, including Amsterdam, Barcelona, Venice, Paris, London, Osaka, New York, Mexico City, and Washington, D.C.
