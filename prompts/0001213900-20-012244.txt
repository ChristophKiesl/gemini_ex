THE COMPANY

The Company manufactures, sells and markets functional RTD (Ready to Drink) beverages sold under the “Gratitude” trademark. The Company’s initial products were the Chinese Dragon Well Green Teas which came in different flavors. This product was subsequently rebranded into “Gratitude Tea”. The Gratitude Tea products, which contain high levels of micronutrients called polyphenols, come in four flavors and are based on tea formulations derived from a U.S. patent (U.S. Patent No. 6,713,605 Tea Polyphenols Esters and Analogs) issued to the University of South Florida which the Company licensed pursuant to a Standard Exclusive License Agreement, executed in January 2018. This product was redesigned and repackaged from a single serve mason jar bottle to a single serve soft pack container.
 
During 2019, the Company was primarily focused on research and development of an additional product line called “Keto Fuel”, which is a ready to drink keto meal being offered in three flavors.

Home Bistro
 
Since inception, Home Bistro has provided high quality, direct-to-consumer, ready-made gourmet meals and restaurant quality meats and seafood through its Colorado Prime brand. Home Bistro is uniquely positioned to take advantage of the developing market opportunity generated by consumers’ growing demand for prepared meals ordered online and delivered to their homes. Home Bistro’s focus is to provide restaurant quality gourmet meals to customers without the need for shopping, cooking or cleanup.
THE PRODUCTS AND PACKAGING:
 
Gratitude 
 
Gratitude has been seeking to build the “Gratitude” brand through the launch of unique, naturally flavored and unsweetened RTD (Ready To Drink) teas.
 
Today, tea is the second largest drink category in America and is an obvious driver and mainstay in delivery systems across food and beverage categories. Americans and, especially Millennial Americans, are increasingly becoming more and more aware of the generous levels of cancer-fighting antioxidants found in tea.
 
While Green, White and Black teas are the most common types consumed in America, research shows that their growth is solid year-over-year but barely above flat. We believe this is due to two factors:
 

● | The category is staid and boring; and
--+--------------------------------------


● | RTD teas are not delivering on their health promises.
--+------------------------------------------------------

 
We are attempting to address these issues with unique varieties of tea that not only have interesting and curious names but also health research that supports their benefits. Naturally, we will be calorie and carb free and always strive for maximum antioxidant delivery. Our teas were originally sourced from Dragon Well in China. Our initial five flavors were:
 

● | Wildberry
--+----------


● | Blood Orange
--+-------------


● | Mint
--+-----


● | Original
--+---------


● | Peach
--+------

 
In support of these unique flavors, and key to our brand building presentation, we are shifting our packaging from a “mason jar” (which the Company has ceased production of) to a soft pack container. 
 
During 2019, the Company was primarily focused on research and development of an additional product line called “Keto Fuel” which is a ready to drink keto meal being offered in three flavors: cocoa chocolate, true vanilla and caffeinated mocha. After a small batch production run of Dragon Well Green Tea in March 2019, the Company turned its focus to development and testing of its Keto Fuel complete meal product. Efforts included obtaining suppliers and packaging for a small test production in June 2019 followed by a larger test at a prospective co-packer in December 2019. Packaging design was finalized, and an agreement was obtained with a broker to promote and distribute the Keto Fuel in Florida. A food quality consultant was contracted to review and advise on all aspects of the product formulation and production process. The product formulation is ready for commercial production that remains dependent on investor funding to procure ingredients, produce and package the final product, and bring to market. Keto Fuel will be sold via an internet sales/fulfillment center to individuals and to retailers via our sales and marketing broker. The Company is repackaging Dragon Well tea into a 500-milliliter tetra-pak to reduce cost and improve shipping, storage, and handling capabilities. 
 
Home Bistro
 
Home Bistro offers a variety of meals and purchasing options to its customers. Customers can choose from individual meals, meal combos, dietary preferences, superbowls and chef choices. Customers can also choose from “Best Sellers” and “Premium Meats” through Home Bistro’s Colorado Prime operations. Home Bistro meals (such as Mediterranean Chicken with Orange Honey Sauce and Chianti Braised Short Ribs with Rice) are ordered online at www.homebistro.com and delivered fresh-frozen to the customer’s home or office. Meals typically consist of one protein, vegetable and starch, with accompanying sauces, packaged separately to allow customers a convenient choice of heating either by microwave or stovetop boiling. Colorado Prime is a direct to consumer brand of premium quality frozen proteins (such as beef, chicken, pork and fish), and prepared meals, soups, appetizers and desserts which are ordered online at www.primechop.com. We market these products primarily through outbound telemarketers. The Company offers credit to its Colorado Prime customers through a third-party finance company.

MARKET INFORMATION AND THE VALUE CHAIN AND ROUTES TO MARKET
 
Gratitude
 
We are the first company to introduce Chinese Dragon Well Tea to the mass RTD American market. Dragon Well is subtle in taste with a hint of chestnut and is the most popular tea in China being granted “Imperial” status. Because it is “Green”, our tea will be well known to the U.S. consumer. Because it is “DragonWell”, it will be a welcome new experience to the U.S. RTD market. All our teas are either low calorie—45 per 16oz—or unsweetened. Our “small batch * handmade” brand positioning features totally unique and first-to-market packaging that meets artisanal characteristics influencing today’s consumer purchase.
 
According to Zenith Global, a beverage consultancy, global consumption of RTD tea is expected to surpass 45 billion liters by 2021 and is the biggest of the emerging soft drink categories by volume growth. Furthermore, according to the Tea Association of USA in its 2017-18 tea market review and forecast: “Naturalness continues to drive consumers who demand foods that are closer to their unrefined or pure state, seeking “less processed” drinks, incentivizing companies to remove artificial ingredients. This trend will also encourage consumers to reach for foods in their most natural, original form, such as true teas, for health benefits, instead of supplements and nutraceuticals. Tea is a natural, simple and whole food.”
 
By marrying a famous and revered green tea in China with such organic flavors as Peach, Mint, Wildberry and Blood Orange, Gratitude is well positioned for our targeted consumer audience.
 
There will be two routes to market:
 

1. | Direct-to-Retail sales (grocery, big box, and drug chains) via a sales and marketing broker.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Direct-to-Consumer sales via the internet. We will partner with a fulfillment company.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Value chain for channel one includes delivered pricing from Gratitude direct to the retailer. We will target a suggested retail price in these accounts. Knowing that these accounts demand net delivery to their warehouses and a SET gross margin, Gratitude will price cases at wholesale to this channel of trade at a set price per bottle per cost of goods sold as calculated so that the Company has already calculated its margin less cost of freight for delivery.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The second sales model is direct consumer sales through the internet. These sales are always made by the case with an added delivery fee to the individual. We will partner with a fulfillment company to handle orders and simply deliver to their regional warehouses. These sales provide great opportunity for gross margin having eliminated the distributor and retailer margin, but require significant digital marketing programs and advertising. We will use this channel immediately to service consumers that have heard of the brand but cannot find it at their local store yet. We know this channel will not be a large business initially but, as the brand grows, we plan to build this segment aggressively.

Home Bistro
 
The overall meal delivery market is currently divided into three primary segments: restaurant delivery, meal-kits and prepared meals/diet plans. According to a 2018 UBS report, “Driven by these three trends – lower production costs, improved logistics and strong demographics – we estimate the global online food ordering market could grow more than tenfold over the next decade or so, to $365bn by 2030 from $35bn today (2018).”
 
As consumers become increasingly time-starved and convenience-seeking, they have aggressively sought out alternatives to cooking at home or ordering take-out. While meal-kit providers and third-party restaurant delivery services have attracted the most attention over the last few years, raising substantial capital and achieving significant growth, prepared meal delivery services have begun to proliferate the market and fill yet another significant void within the sector.
 
Meal-Kits vs. Third-Party Delivery vs. Prepared Meals
 
Business models for meal-kit providers, third-party delivery services and prepared “heat-to-eat” meal companies, differ vastly from one another. Meal-kit companies such as Blue Apron, Home Chef and Sun Basket provide customers pre-portioned raw ingredients and recipes for a set number of meals every week. Utilizing the ingredients and following the recipes, customers create home cooked meals. On average, meals take anywhere from 30-60 minutes for preparation and cooking and another 15 minutes to clean up.
 
Third-party online delivery platforms such as Grubhub, Uber Eats and DoorDash offer access to restaurants’ menus via a single online portal. By logging on to a website or mobile app, consumers can quickly compare menus, prices and reviews. Customers then order directly from the app and cooked meals are delivered typically within 60 minutes by the restaurant, third party delivery service or the app platform itself.
 
Lastly, the prepared, heat-to-eat providers in the meal delivery segment (in which Home Bistro operates) ship fresh and fresh-frozen, fully-cooked meals direct-to-consumer. On average, these meals require heating for three to five minutes and they are ready to eat. The experience is extremely convenient and requires very little cleanup. The meals can typically be purchased individually, as combo packages or monthly subscriptions.

PRODUCTION
 
Gratitude
 
We used third party vendors to outsource and purchase raw materials as well as a co-packer. Our co-packer is independently owned and operated and functions as a third party manufacturing partner in order fulfill the inventory needs of Gratitude’s RTD brands. Our co-packer is located in the eastern United States, and currently we use one co-packer.
Home Bistro
 
Home Bistro’s recipes are provided to a third-party co-packer who cooks, packages, fulfills and ships customer orders. This co-packer ships from its location in San Diego, California.
 
Colorado Prime orders are processed through a third-party co-packer who fulfills and ships customer orders. This co-packer is based in North Carolina.
 
COMPETITION
 
Gratitude
 
Our competition is extensive and includes larger more established companies such as Arizona, Lipton, Gold Peak and Snapple, which have significantly greater financial, technical, sales and marketing resources than the Company, as well as numerous smaller independent providers.

Home Bistro
 
In the direct-to-consumer prepared meal home delivery market segment, our competition is extensive and includes larger more established companies such as Jenny Craig, WW International and Nutrisystem which have significantly greater financial, technical, sales and marketing resources than the Company, as well as numerous smaller independent providers. We believe, however, there is considerable room for additional competitors offering modestly priced, high quality offerings, as the direct-to-consumer segment of the home delivery market for food continues to expand. In addition, we believe the competition for consumers seeking ready-made gourmet meals (such as Home Bistro) is less intensive than other niches such as weight loss, high protein, keto or paleo.
 
In the direct-to-consumer, high quality meats and seafood market segment, our competition is extensive and includes larger more established companies such as Omaha Steaks, Kansas City Steak Company and Snake River Farms which have significantly greater financial, technical, sales and marketing resources than the Company, as well as Butcher Block, D’Artagnan and Crowd Cow. We believe, however, there is considerable room for additional competitors offering modestly priced, high quality offerings, as the direct-to-consumer segment of the home delivery market for food continues to expand.

Home Bistro’s online competition consists primarily of national and local service providers, point-of-sale module vendors that serve some independent restaurants who have their own standalone websites and the online interfaces of restaurants that also offer takeout. The Company also competes for diners with online competitors on the basis of convenience, control and customer care. For restaurants, Home Bistro competes with other online platforms based on its ability to generate additional orders, manage challenges such as customization, change orders, menu updates and specials and the ability to help them improve their operational efficiency.

OUR CORPORATE HISTORY AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 17, 2009. Effective March 23, 2018, the Company changed its legal name to Gratitude Health, Inc. from Vapir Enterprises Inc. On March 26, 2018, the Company merged with Gratitude Health Inc., a private company incorporated in Florida on September 14, 2017 (“Gratitude Subsidiary”), in a transaction treated as a reverse acquisition and recapitalization effected by a share exchange. The consolidated financial statements are those of Gratitude Subsidiary (the accounting acquirer) prior to that merger and include the activity of the Company (the legal acquirer) from the date of that merger. Before that merger, business was focused on inventing, developing and producing aromatherapy devices and vaporizers. Since that merger, we have been engaged in manufacturing, selling and marketing functional RTD (Ready to Drink) beverages sold under the Company’s trademark. As set forth in greater detail below, on April 20, 2020, we acquired Home Bistro, Inc., a privately-held Delaware corporation engaged in the food preparation and home-delivery business, through a “reverse merger” transaction. As a result of the Merger, Home Bistro became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
 
Subsequent to the Merger to acquire Home Bistro, the Company has moved its headquarters from Palm Beach Gardens, Florida to Miami Beach, Florida. The Company maintains the following websites: www.homebistro.com; www.primechop.co; www.organicgratitude.com; and www.ketofuel.com.

On April 20, 2020, the Company and a stockholder entered into a Put Option Agreement, pursuant to which, among other things, the Company agreed, at the election of the stockholder, to purchase certain shares of the Common Stock from such stockholder no sooner than two years from the date of the Put Option Agreement, sometimes referred to herein as the “Market Period”. Pursuant to the Put Option Agreement, in the event that the stockholder does not generate $1.3 million dollars, sometimes referred to herein as the “Total Investment”, in gross proceeds from the sale of its shares of Common Stock by the second anniversary of the Put Option Agreement, then the stockholder has the right to cause the Company to purchase up to an amount of the stockholder’s shares equal to the difference between the Total Investment and the net proceeds actually realized by the stockholder during the Market Period. The Put Right expires fourteen (14) days from end of the Market Period.
 
The Company plans to: (i) change its name to “Home Bistro, Inc.” (the “Name Change”); (ii) request a change to its ticker symbol (the “New Symbol”); and (iii) effect a reverse stock split of its Common Stock at a ratio of approximately 1-for-32 shares (the “Reverse Split”, together with the Name Change and the New Symbol, the “Corporate Actions”). The Company intends to consummate the Corporate Actions as soon as possible and upon approval from the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
