Company Overview
 DFIN is a leading global risk and compliance solutions company. The Company provides regulatory filing and deal solutions via its software, technology-enabled services and print and distribution solutions to public and private companies, mutual funds and other regulated investment firms, to serve its clients’ regulatory and compliance needs. DFIN helps its clients comply with applicable regulations where and how they want to work in a digital world, providing numerous solutions tailored to each client’s precise needs. The prevailing trend is toward clients choosing to utilize the Company’s software solutions, in conjunction with its tech-enabled services, to meet their document and filing needs, while at the same time shifting away from physical print and distribution of documents, except for cases where it is still regulatorily required or requested by shareholders.
 The Company serves its clients’ regulatory and compliance needs throughout their respective life cycles. For its capital markets clients, the Company offers solutions that allow public companies to comply with applicable U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regulations including filing agent services, digital document creation and online content management tools that support their corporate financial transactions and regulatory reporting; solutions to facilitate clients’ communications with their shareholders; and virtual data rooms and other deal management solutions. For investment companies, including mutual fund, insurance-investment and alternative investment companies, the Company provides solutions for creating, compiling and filing regulatory communications as well as solutions for investors designed to improve the access to and accuracy of their investment information. 
 Technological advancements, regulatory changes, and evolving workflow preferences, have led to the Company’s clients managing more of the financial disclosure process themselves, changing the marketplace for the Company’s services and products. DFIN’s strategy in its Software Solutions segments (CM-SS and IC-SS, as defined below) aligns with the changing marketplace by focusing the Company’s investments and resources in its advanced software solutions, primarily ActiveDisclosure®, Arc Suite and Venue® Virtual Data Room (“Venue”), while making targeted investments, such as the Company’s acquisition of eBrevia, Inc. (“eBrevia”) to further broaden its solution set. In its Compliance & Communications Management segments (CM-CCM and IC-CCM, as defined below), the Company’s strategy focuses on maintaining its market-leading position by offering a high-touch, service-oriented experience, using its combination of tech-enabled services and print and distribution capabilities. 
 Capital Markets
 The Company provides software solutions, technology-enabled services and print and distribution solutions to public and private companies that are, or are preparing to become, subject to the filing and reporting requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Clients leverage the Company’s software solutions, proprietary technology, deep industry expertise and experience to successfully navigate the SEC’s specified file formats when submitting compliance documents through the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (“EDGAR”) system for their transactional and ongoing compliance needs. The Company assists its capital markets clients throughout the course of public and private business transactions; mergers and acquisitions (“M&A”), initial public offerings (“IPOs”), initial creation of special purpose acquisition corporations (“SPAC”) and subsequent de-SPAC (acquisition of a public or private company), debt offerings and other similar transactions. In addition, the Company provides clients with compliance solutions to prepare their ongoing required Exchange Act filings that are compatible with the SEC’s EDGAR system, most notably Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, Form 8-K and proxy filings. These solutions include the Company’s traditional full-service EDGAR filing preparation and filing agent services, technology-enabled services and print and distribution solutions as well as the Company’s software solutions, ActiveDisclosure, Venue, EDGAR Online and eBrevia.

Transaction Solutions
 The Company helps capital markets clients throughout the course of public and private business transactions. For M&A transactions, the Company supports deal participants in creating transaction-related registration statements, proxy statements and prospectuses, files client documents as their filing agent through the EDGAR filing system and manages print for distribution to shareholders. The Company also provides registration statement and prospectus preparation and filing services through the Company’s proprietary filing solution and software solution, ActiveDisclosure, data room and secure file sharing through Venue as well as contract analytics through eBrevia.
 The Company’s Venue solution is a highly secure data room platform that allows clients to share confidential information in real-time throughout the transaction lifecycle. Clients can also maintain control over sensitive data when conducting due diligence for M&A transactions, raising capital for an IPO or developing a document repository. Specifically, companies have used Venue to securely organize, manage, distribute and track corporate governance, financing, legal and other documents in an online workspace accessible to internal and outside advisors. Via integration with the Company’s eBrevia solution, Venue can use artificial intelligence to analyze documents to help clients better understand their content and make informed decisions.
 The Company’s eBrevia solution leverages artificial intelligence-based data extraction and contract analytics algorithms to provide enterprise contract review and analysis solutions, utilizing machine learning to produce fast and accurate results. eBrevia's software, which extracts and summarizes key provisions and other information, is leveraged in due diligence, contract management, lease abstraction, and document drafting. eBrevia complements the Company’s Venue offerings to provide clients with secure data aggregation, due diligence, compliance and risk management solutions.  
 The Company also offers clients the use of private conferencing facilities in major global cities. This service helps clients maintain confidentiality in deal negotiations and provides clients a place to host in-person working groups to meet, strategize and prepare documents for the transactional deal stream. The Company’s sites are outfitted to provide around-the-clock services to support the transaction process. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company provided support for the transaction process in a virtual environment. The Company transformed its production platform and service delivery model to adapt to clients’ need for a fully-virtual experience while replicating the in-person experience.

When combined with ActiveLink, a synchronous updating tool, ActiveDisclosure seamlessly flows changes throughout an entire document automatically, reducing risk and providing additional assurance to clients. In 2020, beta clients began using an entirely new cloud-based ActiveDisclosure disclosure management system, which was built from the ground up to be faster and to provide new features such as built-in collaboration tools and eXtensible Business Reporting Language (“XBRL”) client-tagging capability. The “new ActiveDisclosure” launched in 2021.

 Segments
 In the first quarter of 2020, management realigned the Company’s operating segments to reflect changes in the manner in which the chief operating decision maker assesses information for decision-making purposes. The Company’s four operating and reportable segments are: Capital Markets – Software Solutions (“CM-SS”), Capital Markets – Compliance and Communications Management (“CM-CCM”), Investment Companies – Software Solutions (“IC-SS”) and Investment Companies – Compliance and Communications Management (“IC-CCM”). Corporate is not an operating segment and consists primarily of unallocated selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) activities and associated expenses within Corporate, including, in part, executive, legal, finance and certain facility costs as well as companywide share-based compensation expense and certain costs and earnings of employee benefit plans, such as pension and other postretirement benefit plans expense (income). Prior to its sale in 2018, the Language Solutions business, which helped companies adapt their business content into different languages for specific countries, markets and regions, was an operating segment.

Company History
 Spin-off Transaction
 On October 1, 2016, DFIN became an independent publicly traded company through the distribution by R.R. Donnelley & Sons Company (“RRD”) of approximately 26.2 million shares, or 80.75%, of DFIN common stock to RRD shareholders (the “Separation”) where holders of RRD common stock received one share of DFIN common stock for every eight shares of RRD common stock held on September 23, 2016. As part of the Separation, RRD retained approximately 6.2 million shares of DFIN common stock, or a 19.25% interest in DFIN, which were all subsequently sold by RRD in 2017. On October 1, 2016, RRD also completed the previously announced separation of LSC Communications, Inc. (“LSC”), its publishing and retail-centric print services and office products business.

Language Solutions Disposition
 On July 22, 2018, the Company sold its Language Solutions business. Prior to its sale, the Language Solutions business supported domestic and international businesses in different countries and in a variety of industries, including the financial, corporate, life sciences and legal industries, among others, by helping them adapt their business content into different languages for specific countries, markets and regions through a complete suite of language services and products. 
 eBrevia Acquisition
 On December 18, 2018, the Company acquired eBrevia, a provider of artificial intelligence-based data extraction and contract analytics software solutions. Prior to the acquisition, the Company held a 12.8% investment in eBrevia. The purchase price for the remaining equity of eBrevia, which included the Company’s estimate of contingent consideration, was $23.3 million, net of cash acquired of $0.2 million, as well as payments of $4.5 million and $1.9 million in 2019 and 2020, respectively. The eBrevia technology provides enterprise contract review and analysis solutions, leveraging machine learning to produce fast and accurate results. eBrevia's software, which extracts and summarizes key legal provisions and other information, is used in due diligence, contract management, lease abstraction and document drafting. eBrevia’s operations are included within the CM-SS operating segment. The acquisition enhances the Company’s Venue offerings to provide clients with secure data aggregation, due diligence, compliance and risk management solutions. 
 Markets and Competition 
 Technological and regulatory changes, including the electronic distribution of documents, continue to impact the market for the Company’s services and products. In addition to the Company’s ongoing innovation in its software solutions, one of the Company’s competitive strengths is that it offers a wide array of products for required regulatory communications, compliance services, a global platform, exceptional sales and service and regulatory domain expertise, which provide differentiated solutions for its clients. 
 The global risk and compliance industry, in general, is highly competitive and barriers to entry have decreased as a result of technology innovation and the simplification of EDGAR filings. Despite some consolidation in recent years, the industry remains highly fragmented in the United States and even more so internationally with many in-country alternative providers. The Company expects competition to increase from existing competitors as well as new and emerging market entrants. In addition, as the Company expands its services and products offerings, it may face competition from new and existing competitors. The Company competes primarily on product quality and functionality, service levels, subject matter regulatory expertise, security, price and reputation. 
 The impact of digital technologies has impacted many of the products and markets in which the Company competes, most acutely in the Company’s mutual fund, variable annuity and public company compliance business offerings. While the Company offers a high-touch, service oriented experience, technology changes have provided alternatives to the Company’s clients that allow them to manage more of the financial disclosure process themselves. The Company has invested in its own software solutions, ActiveDisclosure, Arc Suite and Venue, to serve clients and increase retention, and has invested to expand capabilities and address new market sectors. The future impact of technology as well as the streamlining and modernizing of disclosure requirements on the business is difficult to predict and could result in additional expenditures to restructure impacted operations or develop new technologies. In addition, the Company has made targeted acquisitions and investments in its existing business to offer clients innovative services and solutions, including the acquisition of eBrevia and investments in Mediant and Gain Compliance that support the Company’s position as a technology service leader in this evolving industry.  
 The Company’s competitors for SEC filing services for public company compliance clients include full service financial communications providers, technology point solution providers focused on financial communications and general technology providers. The Company’s competitors for Venue include providers of virtual data room-specific solutions and enterprise software providers that offer online products that serve as document repositories, virtual data rooms as well as file sharing and collaboration solutions. The Company’s competitors for SEC filing services for investment companies clients include full service traditional providers, small niche technology providers and local and regional print providers that bid against the Company for printing, mailing and fulfillment services.    8


Technology
 The Company invests resources in developing software solutions to complement its services. The Company invests in its core composition systems and client facing solutions and has also adopted market-leading third-party systems which have improved the efficiency of its sales and operations processes. The Company has continued to invest in enhancements of its technology-based offerings including EDGAR filing and XBRL services, Venue, ActiveDisclosure, the Arc Suite software platform, and its data and analytics solutions. The Company continues to invest in leading and innovative technology such as Kubernetes, API management machine learning and hybrid cloud architecture.
 Market Volatility/Cyclicality and Seasonality
 The Company’s Capital Markets segments (CM-SS and CM-CCM), in particular, are subject to market volatility in the United States and world economy, as the success of the transactional and Venue offerings is largely dependent on the global market for IPOs, secondary offerings, M&A, public and private debt offerings, leveraged buyouts, spinouts and other transactions. A variety of factors impact the global markets for transactions, including economic activity levels, market volatility, the regulatory and political environment, civil unrest and global pandemics, among others. The global transactional markets were disrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts to the overall economy and market volatility. Due to the significant net sales and profitability derived from transactional and Venue offerings, market volatility can lead to uneven financial performance when comparing to previous periods. U.S. IPOs, M&A transactions and public debt offerings were also disrupted by the U.S. federal government shutdown that occurred, most recently, from December 2018 to January 2019. Future government shutdowns could result in additional volatility. The Company mitigates a portion of this volatility through its compliance offerings, supporting the quarterly and annual public company reporting processes through its filing services and ActiveDisclosure, as well as its Investment Companies segments (IC-SS and IC-CCM) regulatory and shareholder communications offerings, including Arc Suite. The Company also mitigates some of that risk by offering services in higher demand during a down market, such as document management tools for the bankruptcy/restructuring process and by moving upstream in the filing process with products like Venue.
 The quarterly/annual public company reporting process work subjects the Company to filing seasonality shortly after the end of each fiscal quarter, with peak periods during the course of the year. Additionally, investment companies clients require the Company to manage the financial and regulatory reporting and filing for mutual funds on an annual basis as well as annual prospectus filings, which peaks during the second fiscal quarter. The seasonality and associated operational implications include the need to increase staff during peak periods through a combined strategy of hiring temporary personnel, increasing the premium time of existing staff and outsourcing production for a number of services. Additionally, clients and their financial advisors have begun to increasingly rely on web-based services which allow clients to autonomously file and distribute compliance documents with regulatory agencies, such as the SEC. While the Company believes that its ActiveDisclosure and Arc Suite solutions are competitive in this space, competitors are also continuing to develop technologies that aim to improve clients’ ability to autonomously produce and file documents to meet their regulatory obligations. The Company remains focused on driving annual recurring revenue to mitigate market volatility.
COVID-19
 In December 2019, COVID-19 was identified in China and has since extensively impacted the global health and economic environment. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. Although COVID-19 has adversely impacted the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and overall financial performance, the extent of that impact is currently uncertain and depends on factors including the impact on the Company’s customers, employees and vendors.
 The COVID-19 pandemic has had and may continue to have a material adverse impact on certain of the Company’s customers’ financial results, which has and may continue to force those clients to alter their plans for purchasing the Company’s services and products. In addition, the global markets were disrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which negatively impacted the Company’s transactional offerings. The market stabilized in the third quarter of 2020 and the Company has experienced an increase in transactional offerings. However, there remains uncertainty for future periods with the possibility of a resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic, including potentially new strains of COVID-19, resulting in renewal of mitigation measures, including targeted shutdowns. Some of this volatility is mitigated through the Company’s compliance offerings, supporting the quarterly and annual public company reporting processes, as well as its investment companies regulatory and shareholder communications offerings. If the Company’s customers reduce, defer or cancel their spending with DFIN, it would materially adversely impact the Company’s business, results of operations and overall financial performance.

Some of the Company’s operations also have been affected by a range of external factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic that are not within the Company’s control. For example, many jurisdictions imposed a wide range of restrictions on the physical movement of the Company’s employees and vendors to limit the spread of COVID-19, although many of these restrictions have been rescinded, in whole or in part. If any of these external factors or widespread geographic shutdowns are renewed, or if the COVID-19 pandemic and related mitigation measures otherwise have a substantial impact on the Company’s or vendors’ employee attendance or productivity, the Company’s operations are expected to be adversely affected, and in turn the Company’s business, results of operations, liquidity and overall financial performance would be harmed. Furthermore, the Company’s insurance costs may increase.
 The Company has taken numerous steps, and will continue to take further actions as needed, in its response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company has implemented business continuity plans and has instructed all employees that can work from home to do so, has implemented travel restrictions and has conducted virtual customer and employee meetings. These decisions may delay or reduce sales and harm productivity and collaboration. In 2020, the Company incurred $0.5 million of incremental expenses, net of sales surcharges and government subsidies, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Incremental expenses incurred included incremental vendor costs and premium wages paid to certain employees as well as costs to clean and disinfect the Company’s facilities more frequently. The Company also received certain government subsidies in connection with COVID-19, primarily related to employee wages at certain international locations. As a result of the incremental expenses, the Company invoiced certain customers COVID-19-related sales surcharges to recoup some of the expenses. The Company could continue to incur such costs in future periods, however, the impact of such costs on the Company’s business, results of operations, liquidity and overall financial performance cannot be predicted at this time. The Company is also working closely with its clients to support them as they implement their own contingency plans, helping them access the Company’s services and products and continue to meet their regulatory requirements. 
 The Company believes that implementing cost reduction efforts helped mitigate the impact that reduced revenues in the first half of 2020 had on income from operations. The Company has reduced expenses and may take further actions that alter its business operations as the situation evolves. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effects on the Company’s business, results of operations, liquidity and overall financial performance cannot be predicted at this time. 
 Government Regulation and Regulatory Impact
 The SEC is adopting new as well as amending existing rules and forms to modernize the reporting and disclosure of information by registered investment companies. These changes are driving significant regulatory changes which impact the Company’s customers within its Investment Companies business. On October 13, 2016, the SEC adopted an N-PORT filing requirement, which requires certain registered investment companies to report information about their portfolio in XML, a structured data format, on a monthly basis, replacing what was previously a quarterly filing requirement. This rule also includes an annual N-CEN filing in XML, replacing a semi-annual filing requirement. The first N-PORT filing deadlines began in April 2019 for larger funds with over $1 billion in assets and began in April 2020 for smaller funds began filing N-PORT on a quarterly basis. The Company’s Arc Suite can support both filings.
 On June 5, 2018, the SEC adopted Rule 30e-3 which provides certain registered investment companies with an option to electronically deliver shareholder reports and other materials rather than providing such reports in paper. Investors who prefer to receive reports in paper will continue to receive them in that format. While Rule 30e-3 was effective January 1, 2019, default electronic distribution pursuant to the rule began on January 1, 2021 due to a 24-month transition period, during which registered investment companies notified investors of the upcoming change in transmission format of shareholder reports. The Company expects a significant decline in the volume of printed annual and semi-annual shareholder reports in 2021 and beyond as a result of Rule 30e-3. 
 On June 28, 2018, the SEC announced that it was adopting amendments to require the use of the Inline XBRL (“iXBRL”) format for the submission of operating company financial statement information and fund risk/return summary information to improve the data’s usefulness, timeliness and quality, benefiting investors, other market participants and other data users and decreasing, over time, the cost of preparing data for submission to the SEC. On September 17, 2020, large fund groups, defined as fund groups with net assets of $1 billion or more as of the end of their most recent fiscal year, became subject to the iXBRL requirements. The Company expects an increase in revenue associated with iXBRL compliance services for the IC-SS segment.
 10


On March 11, 2020, the SEC announced that it has adopted a new rule 498A under the Securities Act and related regulatory amendments permitting variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts to use a more concise summary prospectus to provide disclosures to investors. More detailed information about the variable annuity or variable life insurance contract will be available online, and an investor can now choose to have that information delivered in paper. The new rule and related form amendments became effective on July 1, 2020 with compliance required by January 1, 2022. The Company expects the majority of its insurance customers will adopt the rule by early 2021. As a result, the Company expects a decline in printed prospectus volume in 2021 and beyond. Based on the requirements of the rule, the Company is also expecting an increase in revenue from the ArcPro software solution and related regulatory filings.
 It is the Company’s policy to conduct its global operations in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations and other requirements. It is not possible to quantify with certainty the potential impact of actions regarding environmental matters, particularly remediation and other compliance efforts that the Company may undertake in the future. However, in the opinion of management, compliance with the present environmental protection laws, before taking into account estimated recoveries from third parties, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated annual results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 
 Resources 
 The primary raw materials used in the Company’s printed products are paper and ink. The paper and ink is sourced from a small set of select suppliers to ensure consistent quality that meets the Company’s performance expectations and provides for continuity of supply. The Company believes that the risk of incurring material losses as a result of a shortage in raw materials is unlikely and that the losses, if any, would not have a materially negative impact on the Company’s business. 
Distribution
 The Company’s products are distributed to end-users through the U.S or foreign postal services, through retail channels, electronically or by direct shipment to customer facilities. 
 Customers 
 For each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, no customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s net sales. 
 Cybersecurity and Data Protection
 A core aspect of the Company’s business relies on technology and software; as a result, the security of those technologies and software, as well as the protection of the confidential information entrusted to the Company by its customers, are key components of the Company’s business and strategy. The DFIN Cybersecurity Program is based upon industry leading frameworks, which include International Standardization Organization #27001 (ISO 27001), Control Objectives for Information Technology (COBIT), and the National Institute of Standards and Technology Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity (commonly known as NIST). The Company’s technologies and software must also comply with domestic and international regulatory and legal requirements. Ensuring that these technologies and software comply with those regulations is a key focus of the Company’s efforts.
 The Company leverages cybersecurity technologies designed to provide for the security of client, employee and business confidential data. The Company’s cybersecurity portfolio is inclusive of, but not limited to, data encryption, data masking, leading secure software development methodologies, application and network penetration testing, incident response, digital forensics, least-privileged access controls, anti-malware, end-point detection and response, virtual private networks and cyber threat intelligence. Additionally, the Company manages a 24x7 Security Operations capability that monitors and responds to cyber threats in real time.
 To demonstrate transparency, the Company’s commitment to effective cybersecurity and data protection efforts and in pursuit of continuous improvement, the Company undergoes a series of third-party security reviews, including third-party penetration tests.

Human Capital
 The Company’s human capital management objective is to attract, retain and develop talent to deliver on the Company’s corporate strategy. DFIN employs a strategy of “get, grow and keep” in which it strives to get the best talent available, develop their skills and abilities to help them grow their career, and keep them engaged and motivated with rewards based on their contributions and performance.  
 As of February 15, 2021, the Company had approximately 2,350 employees, with approximately 85% located in the United States and approximately 15% in international locations. Approximately 37% of DFIN’s workforce is female and approximately 63% is male, with an average tenure of approximately 13.3 years with DFIN (including periods prior to the Separation from RRD). The Company also hires temporary employees in its manufacturing facilities during peak periods of production. None of the Company’s employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement.  
 The Company manages its human capital through the following programs: 
 Compensation and Benefits—The Company’s compensation and benefits program is designed to attract, retain and motivate employees. DFIN offers competitive base salaries and a variety of short-term, long-term and commission-based incentive compensation programs to reward performance relative to key strategic and financial metrics. DFIN also offers comprehensive benefit options, including retirement savings plans, medical insurance, prescription drug benefits, dental insurance, vision insurance, accident and critical illness insurance, life and disability insurance, health savings accounts, flexible spending accounts and legal insurance. The Company continuously evaluates elements of its benefits program, which it calls Total Rewards, to address the needs of its employees. For example, in 2020, DFIN increased paid time off to cover sick time, added four weeks of paid parental leave and implemented supplemental pay programs to reward employees’ special efforts during COVID-19.
 Employee Wellbeing—DFIN’s wellbeing program focuses on physical health, emotional/mental health and financial wellness and encourages all employees to take ownership of their wellbeing. The Company’s approach has been to raise awareness about and increase participation in programs that address the diverse needs of its employee base. Program highlights include topical webinars, targeted programs (e.g., tobacco cessation, diabetes management, weight management), virtual health challenges and paid time off to support individual wellbeing. During the fourth quarter of 2020, DFIN surveyed employees to gauge how they were coping with issues arising during 2020. They identified stress, burnout, work/life balance, career advancement and financial stress as their top five challenges, but they also felt that their managers showed support for their wellbeing. By continuing to foster a culture of wellbeing, DFIN advances employee morale, productivity and engagement. 
 Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (“DEI”)—The Company values diverse perspectives. In 2020, DFIN hosted a series of conversations with its global workforce that generated ideas on how the Company could continue to create an inclusive, equitable and diverse environment, with emerging themes of education and awareness, advocacy and support and fairness and equality. An employee-led DEI task force is creating recommendations around each of those areas. While the Company supports employee-led efforts, the Company believes it is equally important that leadership is engaged. DFIN’s Chief Executive Officer, Dan Leib, expressed the Company’s commitment to DEI in a letter that was shared with employees and posted to its website in the fall of 2020. DFIN has made progress in bringing more diverse perspectives to leadership. Since the beginning of 2020, approximately 32% of all hires and promotions at the Vice President level were women or part of an underrepresented group and approximately 31% of all hires and promotions at the Director level were women. Women and people who are part of an underrepresented group constitute approximately 30% and 15% of the Company’s independent Board of Directors, respectively. Approximately 33% of DFIN’s employees in managerial roles were female and approximately 24% of its employees in managerial roles were part of an underrepresented group. Creating an inclusive community in which all voices are heard is key to the Company’s success.
 Training and Development—DFIN invests in its employees’ skills and professional development by offering virtual, social and self-directed learning, mentoring, coaching and career development opportunities. In 2020, approximately 70% of employees engaged in self-directed learning and development activities through its on-demand learning platform. DFIN equips its employees with targeted learning pathways for leadership, finance, and technical roles as well as safety, compliance and equipment-related training. Guided by the Company’s philosophy of continuous performance management, DFIN encourages its people managers to check in with employees frequently.

Employee Experience and Retention—The Company strives for all employees to feel valued and part of the DFIN community. DFIN collects feedback in the form of pulse surveys to gain insight into what matters to its employees, what motivates them and how best to reach them. The Company has surveyed its employees to better understand their preferences regarding remote work, commuting and productivity as well as their assessment of their overall wellbeing and stress management. Engagement was high: response rates ranged from 40% to 60% and many employees provided thoughtful comments. The Company has strengthened the connection between executives and employees through town hall meetings, quarterly all-employee calls and more frequent internal communications from executives. DFIN provides tools and resources to help its people managers cultivate an environment in which employees are well-informed and comfortable providing feedback.  
 Health and Safety—The health, safety and well-being of its employees is DFIN’s highest priority and a core element of its culture. The Company believes everyone contributes to a safe and healthy work environment no matter where they sit in the organization. DFIN’s Environmental, Health and Safety Management System aligns with ISO 14001 and 45001. The Company sets annual leading and lagging indicators to improve its sustainability performance and achieved, in 2020, a workforce total recordable incident rate of 0.47 (per 200,000 hours worked) and a 99% completion rate for safety training. Employee engagement and positive recognition are pivotal to DFIN’s success. The Company’s manufacturing employees participate in robust safety committees and quarterly roundtables to share best practices transparently and conduct a Speak Up for Safety employee recognition program for identifying near misses. DFIN also observes Safety Month globally and launched a Safety Pinnacle Award to recognize the best-in-class contributions of employees who foster a culture of safety, health and well-being in the workplace. The Company’s employee resilience and focus on safety has clearly been demonstrated during COVID-19. DFIN quickly implemented numerous changes in operations to protect its global workforce, preserve business continuity and comply with government requirements. Employees that can work from home are doing so, travel restrictions have been implemented and virtual employee and customer meetings are required. Additional safety measures recommended by government and public health authorities have been implemented for essential employees who continue critical onsite work in the Company’s manufacturing facilities that are based in the United States. In June 2020, 93% of employees responding to the Company’s first Workplace Survey said DFIN communicated well during the pandemic. In July 2020, 95% of employees responding to the Safety Month Survey believe DFIN has taken appropriate safety actions in response to COVID-19.
