Item 1. Business 
 
W&T Offshore, Inc. is an independent oil and natural gas producer, active in the exploration, development and acquisition of oil and natural gas properties in the Gulf of Mexico.  W&T Offshore, Inc. is a Texas corporation originally organized as a Nevada corporation in 1988, and successor by merger to W&T Oil Properties, Inc., a Louisiana corporation organized in 1983.
 
Since our founding in 1983 by our Chairman and CEO, Tracy Krohn, we have continually grown our footprint in the Gulf of Mexico through acquisitions, exploration and development.  We currently hold working interests in 43 offshore producing fields in federal and state waters.  Our acreage, well, production and reserves information is described in more detail under Part I Item 2, Properties, in this Form 10-K.  Our working interests in fields, leases, structures and equipment are primarily owned by W&T Offshore, Inc. and our wholly-owned subsidiary, W&T Energy VI, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and through our proportionately consolidated interest in Monza Energy, LLC (“Monza”), as described in more detail in Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 4 – Joint Venture Drilling Program under Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K.  
 
We have developed significant technical expertise in finding and developing properties in the Gulf of Mexico with production rates which provide the best opportunity to achieve a rapid return on our invested capital. We have leveraged our experience in the conventional shelf to develop higher impact capital projects in the Gulf of Mexico in both the deepwater and the deep shelf.  We have acquired rights to explore and develop new prospects and existing oil and natural gas properties in both the deepwater and the deep shelf, while at the same time continuing our focus on the conventional shelf.  Our drilling efforts in recent years have included the deepwater of the Gulf of Mexico. 
 
Business Strategy 
 
Our goal is to pursue high rate of return projects and develop oil and natural gas resources that allow us to grow our production, reserves and cash flow in a capital efficient manner, thus enhancing the value of our assets. We intend to execute the following elements of our business strategy in order to achieve this goal:

● | Exploiting existing and acquired properties to add additional reserves and production;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Exploring for reserves on our extensive acreage holdings and in other areas of the Gulf of Mexico;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Acquiring reserves with substantial upside potential and additional leasehold acreage complementary to our existing acreage position at attractive prices; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continuing to manage our balance sheet in a prudent manner and continuing our track record of financial flexibility in any commodity price environment.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our focus is on making profitable investments while operating within cash flow, maintaining sufficient liquidity, cost reductions and fulfilling our contractual, legal and financial obligations.  Over time, we expect to de-lever through free cash flow generated by our producing asset base, capital discipline, organic growth and acquisitions. We continue to closely monitor current and forecasted commodity prices to assess if changes are needed to our plans. 
 
Market Trends
 
In managing our business, we are focused on optimizing production and increasing reserves in a profitable and prudent manner, while managing cash flows to meet our obligations and investment needs.  Our cash flows are materially impacted by the prices of commodities we produce (crude oil, natural gas and the natural gas liquids ("NGLs") extracted from natural gas).  In addition, the prices of goods and services used in our business can vary and impact our cash flows.

COVID-19 Impacts on Economic Environment.  Due to circumstances related to the outbreak of COVID-19, various measures have been taken by federal, state and local governments to reduce the rate of spread of COVID-19.  These measures and other factors have resulted in a decrease of general economic activity and a corresponding decrease in global and domestic energy demand impacting commodity pricing.  In addition, actions by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other high oil exporting countries like Russia (“OPEC+”) negatively impacted crude oil prices during early 2020.  These rapid and unprecedented events pushed crude oil storage near capacity and drove prices down significantly in the second quarter of 2020.  These events were the primary cause of the significant supply-and-demand imbalance for oil, significantly lowering oil pricing in 2020 compared to the prior year.  Throughout the United States during 2020, COVID-19 outbreaks continued and, in some areas, increased.  Should these conditions continue in future periods, they could constrain our ability to store and move production to downstream markets, delay or curtail development activity or temporarily shut-in production, any or all of which could further reduce our cash flow.
 
Hurricanes Impact on our Production.  Beginning in the second quarter of 2020 and extending through October 2020, the Gulf of Mexico experienced numerous hurricanes and tropical storms that required us to shut-in production at times due to their impact.  We have since returned substantially all wells to production that were shut-in due to the hurricanes and tropical storms, as have operators of properties in which we have an interest.  While no major structural damage occurred, we incurred $4.7 million in repairs costs during 2020 associated with repairs to our assets caused by storm events in 2020. See “Risk Factors” – “the geographic concentration of our properties in the Gulf of Mexico subjects us to an increased risk of loss of revenues or curtailment of production from factors specifically affecting the Gulf of Mexico.”
 
During 2020, average realized commodity prices decreased from those we experienced during 2019.  Our margins in 2020 decreased from 2019 primarily due to lower average realized commodity prices, partially offset by lower operating expenses as a result of our cost-cutting efforts in 2020.  We measure margins using net income (loss) before net interest expense; income tax (benefit) expense; depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion; unrealized commodity derivative gain or loss; amortization of derivative premiums; bad debt reserve; gain on debt transaction; litigation; and other (“Adjusted EBITDA”) as a percent of revenue, which is a not a financial measurement under generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).
 
 Our production increased 3.8 % in 2020 from the prior year. Our proved reserves decreased by 13.0 million barrels of oil equivalent ("MMBoe") in 2020, primarily due to the significant decline in commodity prices in 2020 as compared to 2019. MMBoe was computed on an equivalency ratio as described above.  During 2020, we drilled one well which we expect to complete in 2021.

We continue to closely monitor current and forecasted commodity prices to assess what changes, if any, should be made to our 2021 plans.  See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources under Part II, Item 7 in this Form 10-K for additional information.
 
Competition 
 
The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive.  We also face increasing indirect competition from alternative energy sources, including wind, solar, and electric power. We currently operate in the Gulf of Mexico and compete for the acquisition of oil and natural gas properties and lease sales primarily on the basis of price for such properties.  We compete with numerous entities, including major domestic and foreign oil companies, other independent oil and natural gas companies and individual producers and operators.  Many of these competitors are large, well established companies that have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours and greater ability to provide the extensive regulatory financial assurances required for offshore properties.  Our ability to acquire additional oil and natural gas properties, acquire additional leases and to discover reserves in the future will depend upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties, finance investments and consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment.
Oil and Natural Gas Marketing and Delivery Commitments
 
 We sell our crude oil, NGLs and natural gas to third-party customers.  We are not dependent upon, or contractually limited to, any one customer or small group of customers.  However, in 2020, approximately 39% of our revenues were received from BP Products North America, 13% to Williams Field Services and 10% to Mercuria Energy America Inc. Trading (US) Co., with no other customer comprising greater than 10% of our 2020 revenues. Given the commoditized nature of the products we produce and market and the location of our production in the Gulf of Mexico, we believe the loss of any of the customers above would not result in a material adverse effect on our ability to market future oil and natural gas, as replacement customers could be obtained in a relatively short period of time on terms, conditions, and pricing substantially similar to those currently existing. We do not have any agreements which obligate us to deliver a fixed volumes of physical products to customers.

Compliance with Government Regulations 
 
General.  Various aspects of our oil and natural gas operations are subject to extensive and continually changing regulations as legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion.  Numerous departments and agencies, both federal and state, are authorized by statute to issue, and have issued, rules and regulations binding upon the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members.  The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (“BOEM”) and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (“BSEE”), both agencies under the U.S. Department of the Interior (“DOI”), have adopted regulations pursuant to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (“OCSLA”) that apply to our operations on federal leases in the Gulf of Mexico. 
 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) regulates the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce pursuant to the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (“NGA”) and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (“NGPA”).  In 1989, Congress enacted the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act, which removed all remaining price and non-price controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas, effective January 1, 1993.  Sales by producers of natural gas and all sales of crude oil, condensate and NGLs can currently be made at uncontrolled market prices.  The FERC also regulates rates and service conditions for the interstate transportation of liquids, including crude oil, condensate and NGLs, under various statutes.
 
The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), the FERC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) hold statutory authority to monitor certain segments of the physical and futures energy commodities markets.  These agencies have imposed broad regulations prohibiting fraud and manipulation of such markets.  We are required to observe the market related regulations enforced by these agencies with regard to our physical sales of crude oil or other energy commodities, and any related hedging activities that we undertake.  Any violation of the FTC, FERC, and CFTC prohibitions on market manipulation can result in substantial civil penalties amounting to over $1.0 million per violation per day.   
 
These departments and agencies have substantial enforcement authority and the ability to grant and suspend operations, and to levy substantial penalties for non-compliance.  Failure to comply with such regulations, as interpreted and enforced, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 
Federal leases.  Most of our offshore operations are conducted on federal oil and natural gas leases in the OCS waters of the Gulf of Mexico.  The DOI has delegated its authority to issue federal leases granted under the OCSLA to the BOEM, which has adopted and implemented regulations relating to the issuance and operation of oil and natural gas leases on the OCS. These leases are awarded by the BOEM based on competitive bidding and contain relatively standardized terms. These leases require compliance with the BOEM, the BSEE, and other government agency regulations and orders that are subject to interpretation and change.  The BSEE also regulates the plugging and abandonment of wells located on the OCS and, following cessation of operations, the removal or appropriate abandonment of all production facilities, structures and pipelines on the OCS (collectively, these activities are referred to as “decommissioning”), while the BOEM governs financial assurance requirements associated with those decommissioning obligations.
 
President Biden entered office in January 2021 and has made tackling climate change, including the restriction or elimination of future greenhouse gases (“GHGs”), a priority in his administration.  The Biden Administration has already adopted several executive orders and is expected to pursue additional orders and pursue legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives in support of this regulatory agenda.  Notably, the Acting Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior issued an order on January 20, 2021, effective immediately, that suspends new oil and gas leases and drilling permits on federal lands and offshore waters, including the OCS for a period of 60 days. Building on this suspension, President Biden issued an executive order on January 27, 2021 that suspends new leasing activities for oil and gas exploration and production on federal lands and offshore waters pending review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices.  While these January 20, 2021 and January 27, 2021 orders do not apply to existing leases, the January 27, 2021 order further directs applicable agencies to take measures to eliminate provision of subsidies to the fossil fuel industry, although the term "subsidies" is not defined by the adminstration.  We continue to conduct our operations on our existing leases in the OCS; however, uncertainty on future Biden Administration actions with regards to offshore oil and gas activities on the OCS together with the issuance of any future executive orders or adoption and implementation of laws, rules or initiatives that further restrict, delay or result in cancellation of existing oil and gas activities on the OCS could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.

Decommissioning and financial assurance requirements.  The BOEM requires that lessees demonstrate financial strength and reliability according to its regulations and provide acceptable financial assurances to assure satisfaction of lease obligations, including decommissioning activities on the OCS.  In 2016, the BOEM under the Obama Administration issued Notice to Lessees and Operators (“NTL”) #2016-N01 (“NTL #2016-N01”) to clarify the procedures and guidelines that BOEM Regional Directors use to determine if and when additional financial assurances may be required for OCS leases, rights of way (“ROWs”) and rights of use and easement (“RUEs”).  While NTL #2016-N01 became effective in September 2016, it was not fully implemented as the BOEM under the Trump Administration first extended indefinitely in 2017 implementation of the NTL and subsequently rescinded the NTL in the latter half of 2020, instead electing to publish in October 2020 a proposed rule that would amend the BOEM’s financial assurance requirements.  The Biden Administration is expected to review and reconsider actions made under the Trump Administration with respect to provision of financial assurance, including the rescission of NTL #2016-N01 and publication of the October 2020 proposed rulemaking.  Any issuance by the Biden Administration of more stringent NTL guidance or rules relating to the provision of additional financial assurance may have a material adverse effect on us and similarly situated offshore oil and gas operators on the OCS.  Moreover, the BOEM has the authority to issue liability orders in the future, including if it determines there is a substantial risk of nonperformance of the interest holder’s decommissioning liabilities.  See Risk Factors under Part I, Item 1A, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 and Financial Statements and Supplementary Data under Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K for more discussion on decommissioning and financial assurance requirements.
 
Reporting of decommissioning expenditures. Under applicable BSEE regulations, lessees operating on the OCS and conducting decommissioning activities are required to submit summaries of actual expenditures for decommissioning of subject wells, platforms, and other facilities. The BSEE has reported that it uses this summary information to better estimate future decommissioning costs, and the BOEM typically relies upon the BSEE’s estimates to set the amount of required bonds or other forms of financial security in order to minimize the government’s perceived risk of potential decommissioning liability.
 
Unbundling.  The ONRR has publicly announced an “unbundling” initiative to revise the methodology employed by producers in determining the appropriate allowances for transportation and processing costs that are permitted to be deducted in determining royalties under Federal oil and gas leases.  The ONRR’s initiative requires re-computing allowable transportation and processing costs using revised guidance from the ONRR going back 84 months for every gas processing plant utilized during that period.
 
Regulation and transportation of natural gas.  Our sales of natural gas are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. The price and terms for access to pipeline transportation are subject to extensive regulation. The FERC has undertaken various initiatives to increase competition within the natural gas industry.  As a result of initiatives like FERC Order No. 636, issued in 1992, the interstate natural gas transportation and marketing system allows non-pipeline natural gas sellers, including producers, to effectively compete with interstate pipelines for sales to local distribution companies and large industrial and commercial customers.  The most significant provisions of Order No. 636 require that interstate pipelines provide firm and interruptible transportation service on an open access basis that is equal for all natural gas supplies.  In many instances, the effect of Order No. 636 and related initiatives have been to substantially reduce or eliminate the interstate pipelines’ traditional role as wholesalers of natural gas in favor of providing only storage and transportation services.  The rates for such storage and transportation services are subject to FERC ratemaking authority, and FERC exercises its authority either by applying cost-of-service principles or granting market based rates. Similarly, the natural gas pipeline industry is subject to state regulations, which may change from time to time.
 
The OCSLA, which is administered by the BOEM and the FERC, requires that all pipelines operating on or across the OCS provide open access, non-discriminatory transportation service.  One of the FERC’s principal goals in carrying out OCSLA’s mandate is to increase transparency in the OCS market, to provide producers and shippers assurance of open access service on pipelines located on the OCS, and to provide non-discriminatory rates and conditions of service on such pipelines.  The BOEM issued a final rule, effective August 2008, which implements a hotline, alternative dispute resolution procedures, and complaint procedures for resolving claims of having been denied open and nondiscriminatory access to pipelines on the OCS.
 
In 2007, the FERC issued rules (“Order 704”) requiring that any market participant, including a producer such as us, that engages in wholesale sales or purchases of natural gas that equal or exceed 2.2 million British thermal units (“MMBtu”) during a calendar year must annually report such sales and purchases to the FERC to the extent such transactions utilize, contribute to, or may contribute to the formation of price indices.  It is the responsibility of the reporting entity to determine which individual transactions should be reported based on the guidance of Order 704. Order 704 also requires market participants to indicate whether they report prices to any index publishers, and if so, whether their reporting complies with FERC’s policy statement on price reporting.  These rules are intended to increase the transparency of the wholesale natural gas markets and to assist the FERC in monitoring such markets and in detecting market manipulation.

Additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are pending before Congress, the FERC, state legislatures, state commissions and the courts.  The natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated.  As a result, there is no assurance that the less stringent regulatory approach pursued by the FERC, Congress and the states will continue.
 
While these federal and state regulations for the most part affect us only indirectly, they are intended to enhance competition in natural gas markets.  We cannot predict what further action the FERC, the BOEM or state regulators will take on these matters.  However, we do not believe that any such action taken will affect us differently, in any material way, than other natural gas producers with which we compete.
 
Oil and NGLs transportation rates.  Our sales of liquids, which include crude oil, condensate and NGLs are not currently regulated and are transacted at market prices.  In a number of instances, however, the ability to transport and sell such products is dependent on pipelines whose rates, terms and conditions of service are subject to FERC jurisdiction.  The price we receive from the sale of crude oil and NGLs is affected by the cost of transporting those products to market. Interstate transportation rates for crude oil, condensate, NGLs and other products are regulated by the FERC.  In general, interstate crude oil, condensate and NGL pipeline rates must be cost-based, although settlement rates agreed to by all shippers are permitted and market based rates may be permitted in certain circumstances.  The FERC has established an indexing system for such transportation, which generally allows such pipelines to take an annual inflation-based rate increase.
 
In other instances, the ability to transport and sell such products is dependent on pipelines whose rates, terms and conditions of service are subject to regulation by state regulatory bodies under state statutes and regulations.  As it relates to intrastate crude oil, condensate and NGL pipelines, state regulation is generally less rigorous than the federal regulation of interstate pipelines.  State agencies have generally not investigated or challenged existing or proposed rates in the absence of shipper complaints or protests, which are infrequent and are usually resolved informally.  We do not believe that the regulatory decisions or activities relating to interstate or intrastate crude oil, condensate or NGL pipelines will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way they affect other crude oil, condensate and NGL producers or marketers.
 
Regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production.  Our exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels.  Such regulations include requiring permits, bonds and pollution liability insurance for the drilling of wells, regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling, casing, operating, plugging and abandoning wells, and governing the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled.  Many states also have statutes or regulations addressing conservation of oil and gas resources, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells and the regulation of spacing of such wells.
 
Hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico can have a significant impact on oil and gas operations on the OCS. The effects from past hurricanes have included structural damage to fixed production facilities, semi-submersibles and jack-up drilling rigs. The BOEM and the BSEE continue to be concerned about the loss of these facilities and rigs as well as the potential for catastrophic damage to key infrastructure and the resultant pollution from future storms.  In an effort to reduce the potential for future damage, the BOEM and the BSEE have periodically issued guidance aimed at improving platform survivability by taking into account environmental and oceanic conditions in the design of platforms and related structures.
 
Compliance with Environmental Regulations

General.  We are subject to complex and stringent federal, state and local environmental laws.  These laws, among other things, govern the issuance of permits to conduct exploration, drilling and production operations, the amounts and types of materials that may be released into the environment and the discharge and disposal of waste materials and, to the extent waste materials are transported and disposed of in onshore facilities, remediation of any releases of those waste materials from such facilities.  Numerous governmental agencies issue rules and regulations to implement and enforce such laws, which are often costly to comply with, and a failure to comply may result in substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory, remedial and corrective action obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures, the occurrence of restrictions, delays or cancellations in the permitting, or development or expansion of projects and the issuance of orders enjoining some or all of our operations in affected areas.  Certain environmental laws, such as the federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended (“OPA”) impose strict joint and several liability for environmental contamination, such as may arise in the event of an accidental spill on the OCS, rendering a person liable for environmental damage and cleanup costs without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person. The regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases our cost of doing business and consequently affects our profitability.  The cost of remediation, reclamation and decommissioning, including abandonment of wells, platforms and other facilities in the Gulf of Mexico is significant.  These costs are considered a normal, recurring cost of our on-going operations.  Our competitors are subject to the same laws and regulations.
 
    5 

  

Hazardous Substances and Wastes.  The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended, (“CERCLA”) imposes liability, without regard to fault, on certain classes of persons that are considered to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment.  These persons include the current or former owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances.  Under CERCLA, such persons are subject to strict joint and several liability for the cost of investigating and cleaning up hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the cost of certain health studies.
 
 The federal Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (“RCRA”), regulates the generation, transportation, storage, treatment and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous wastes and can require cleanup of hazardous waste disposal sites.  RCRA currently excludes drilling fluids, produced waters and certain other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of oil and natural gas from regulation as “hazardous waste”, and the disposal of such oil and natural gas exploration, development and production wastes is regulated under less onerous non-hazardous waste requirements, usually under state law.   
  
 Standards have been developed under RCRA and/or state laws for worker protection from exposure to Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials (“NORM”); treatment, storage, and disposal of NORM and NORM waste; management of NORM-contaminated piping valves, containers and tanks.  Historically, we have not incurred any material expenditures in connection with our compliance with the existing RCRA and applicable state laws related to NORM waste. 
 
 Air Emissions and Climate Change.  Air emissions from our operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act, as amended (“CAA”), and comparable state and local requirements.  We may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissions.  For example, in 2015, the EPA issued a final rule under the CAA lowering the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ground level ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion.  Since that time, the EPA issued area designations with respect to ground-level ozone and, on December 31, 2020, published notice of a final action to retain the 2015 ozone NAAQS without revision on a going-forward basis. However, several groups have filed litigation over this December 2020 final action, and the NAAQS may be subject to revision under the Biden Administration. 
 
In the United States, no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented at the federal level, but President Biden is expected to issue executive orders or pursue legislative or regulatory actions to limit future GHG emissions.  For example, on January 20, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order committing the United States to the Paris Agreement, from which the United States had withdrawn under the Trump Administration.  President Biden has called for the federal government to begin formulating the United States’ nationally determined emissions reduction goal under the agreement, which may result in the issuance of GHG limitations in the future.  Additionally, the threat of climate change may result in litigation and financial risks.  Litigation risks are increasing, as a number of states, municipalities and other plaintiffs have sought to bring suit against the largest oil and natural gas exploration and production companies in state or federal court, alleging, among other things, that such companies created public nuisances by producing fuels that contributed to global warming effects and therefore are responsible for roadway and infrastructure damages as a result, or alleging that the companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change for some time but defrauded their investors by failing to adequately disclose those impacts.  There are also increasing financial risks for fossil fuel producers as well as other companies handling fossil fuels, as stockholders and bondholders currently invested in fossil fuel energy companies concerned about the potential effects of climate change may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investments into non-fossil fuel energy related sectors. Institutional investors who provide financing to fossil fuel energy companies also have become more attentive to sustainability lending practices and some of them may elect not to provide funding for fossil fuel energy companies.

 From a regulatory perspective, the EPA has determined that GHG emissions present a danger to public health and the environment, and it has adopted regulations that, among other things, restrict emissions of GHG under existing provisions of the CAA and may require the installation of control technologies to limit emissions of GHG.  For example, in 2016, the EPA under the Obama administration published a final rule establishing new source performance standards (“NSPS”) that require new, modified, or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural gas sector to reduce methane gas and volatile organic compound emissions.  The 2016 rule applies to any new or significantly modified facilities that we construct in the future that would otherwise emit large volumes of GHG together with other criteria pollutants.  The 2016 new source performance standards regulate GHGs through limitations on emissions of methane.  However, the EPA under the Trump Administration has undertaken several measures, including publishing in September 2020 final rule policy and technical amendments to the NSPS, for stationary sources of air emissions. The policy amendments, effective September 14, 2020, notably removed the transmission and storage sector from the regulated source category and rescinded methane and volatile organic compound requirements for the remaining sources that were established by former President Obama's Administration, whereas the technical amendments, effective November 16, 2020, included changes to fugitive emissions monitoring and repair schedules, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, and more. Various states and industry and environmental groups are separately challenging both the original 2016 standards and the EPA's September 2020 final rules, and on January 20, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order, that among other things, directed EPA to reconsider the technical amendments and issue a proposed rule suspending, revising or rescinding those amendments by no later than September 2021.  A reconsideration of the September 2020 policy amendments is expected to follow. The January 20, 2021 executive order also directed the establishment of new methane and volatile organic compound standards applicable to existing oil and gas operations, including the production, transmission, processing and storage segments. Certain of our operations are subject to EPA rules requiring the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from specified offshore production sources.
 
The OCSLA authorized the DOI to regulate activities authorized by the BOEM in the Central and Western Gulf of Mexico.  EPA has air quality jurisdiction over all other parts of the OCS.  Under the OCSLA, DOI is limited to regulating offshore emissions of criteria and their precursor – pollutants to the extent they significantly affect the air quality of any state.
 
On May 14, 2020, the BOEM issued its final rule to update air quality regulations applicable to activities authorized by BOEM on the OCS in the Central and Western Gulf of Mexico.  This newly revised rule adopted changes such as incorporation of the definition of the NAAQS, updated Significance Levels (SLs), added new requirements for PM2.5 and PM10, updates to emissions exemption thresholds and revision to the Air Quality Spreadsheets.


Water Discharges.  The primary federal law for oil spill liability is the OPA which amends and augments oil spill provisions of the federal Water Pollution Control Act (the “Clean Water Act”).  OPA imposes certain duties and liabilities on “responsible parties” related to the prevention of oil spills and damages resulting from such spills in or threatening United States waters, including the OCS or adjoining shorelines.  A liable “responsible party” includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility, vessel or pipeline that is a source of an oil discharge or that poses the substantial threat of discharge or, in the case of offshore facilities, the lessee or permittee of the area in which a discharging facility is located.  OPA assigns joint and several, strict liability, without regard to fault, to each liable party for all containment and oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages including, but not limited to, the costs of responding to oil and natural resource release related damages and economic damages suffered by persons adversely affected by an oil spill.  Although defenses exist to the liability imposed by OPA, they are limited. In January 2018, the BOEM raised OPA’s damages liability cap to $137.7 million; however, a party cannot take advantage of liability limits if the spill was caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct, resulted from violation of a federal safety, construction or operating regulation, or if the party failed to report a spill or cooperate fully in the cleanup.  OPA requires owners and operators of offshore oil production facilities to establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility to cover costs that could be incurred in responding to an oil spill, and to prepare and submit for approval oil spill response plans.  These oil spill response plans must detail the action to be taken in the event of a spill; identify contracted spill response equipment, materials, and trained personnel; and identify the time necessary to deploy these resources in the event of a spill. In addition, OPA currently requires a minimum financial responsibility demonstration of between $35.0 million and $150.0 million for companies operating on the OCS.  We are currently required to demonstrate, on an annual basis, that we have ready access to $150.0 million that can be used to respond to an oil spill from our facilities on the OCS.

The Clean Water Act and comparable state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the monitoring and discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other natural gas wastes, into federal and state waters.  The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency.  The EPA has also adopted regulations requiring certain onshore oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities to obtain individual permits or coverage under general permits for storm water discharges.  The treatment of wastewater or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans, as well as for monitoring and sampling the storm water runoff from our onshore gas processing plant have compliance costs.  Pursuant to these laws and regulations, we may be required to obtain and maintain approvals or permits for the discharge of wastewater or storm water and are required to develop and implement spill prevention, control and countermeasure plans, also referred to as “SPCC plans,” in connection with on-site storage of significant quantities of oil.
 
Marine Protected Areas and Endangered and Threatened Species.  Executive Order 13158, issued in May 2000, directs federal agencies to safeguard existing Marine Protected Areas (“MPAs”) in the United States and establish new MPAs.  The order requires federal agencies to avoid harm to MPAs to the extent permitted by law and to the maximum extent practicable.  It also directs the EPA to propose new regulations under the Clean Water Act to ensure appropriate levels of protection for the marine environment.  In addition, Federal Lease Stipulations include regulations regarding the taking of protected marine species (sea turtles, marine mammals, Gulf sturgeon and other listed marine species).
 
Certain flora and fauna that have been officially classified as “threatened” or “endangered” are protected by the federal Endangered Species Act, as amended (“ESA”).  This law prohibits any activities that could “take” a protected plant or animal or reduce or degrade its habitat area.  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) under former President Trump issued a final rule on January 7, 2021, which notably clarifies that criminal liability under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (“MBTA”) will apply only to actions “directed at” migratory birds, its nests, or its eggs.  While the rule was scheduled to become effective on February 8, 2021, the USFWS subsequently published notice on February 9, 2021, that it was delaying the effective date of this rule until March 8, 2021, pursuant to the Biden Administration and in conformity with the Congressional Review Act.  Additionally, the USFWS may make determinations on the listing of species as threatened or endangered under the ESA and litigation with respect to the listing or non-listing of certain species may result in more fulsome protections for non-protected or lesser-protected species. We conduct operations on leases in areas where certain species that are listed as threatened or endangered are known to exist and where other species that potentially could be listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA may exist. 
 
Other federal statutes that provide protection to animal and plant species and which may apply to our operations include, but are not necessarily limited to, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Coastal Zone Management Act, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act, the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the National Historic Preservation Act.  These laws and related implementing regulations may require the acquisition of a permit or other authorization before construction or drilling commences and may limit or prohibit construction, drilling and other activities on certain lands lying within wilderness or wetlands.  These and other protected areas may require certain mitigation measures to avoid harm to wildlife, and such laws and regulations may impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations. 
 
The leases and permits required for our various operations are subject to revocation, modification and renewal by issuing authorities.  Moreover, applicable leasing and permitting programs may be subject to legislative, regulatory or executive actions to delay or suspend the issuance of leases and permits, such as has occurred under the Biden Administration’s DOI order issued on January 20, 2021 with respect to drilling permits, or cancellation of such programs.

Seasonality 
 
Generally, the demand for and price of natural gas increases during the winter months and decreases during the summer months.  However, these seasonal fluctuations are somewhat reduced because during the summer, pipeline companies, utilities, local distribution companies and industrial users purchase and place into storage facilities a portion of their anticipated winter requirements of natural gas.  As utilities continue to switch from coal to natural gas, some of this seasonality has been reduced as natural gas is used for both heating and cooling.  In addition, the demand for oil is higher in the winter months, but does not fluctuate seasonally as much as natural gas. Seasonal weather changes affect our operations.  Tropical storms and hurricanes occur in the Gulf of Mexico during the summer and fall, which require us to evacuate personnel and shut in production until the storm subsides.  Also, periodic storms during the winter often impede our ability to safely load, unload and transport personnel and equipment, which delays the installation of production facilities, thereby delaying production and sales of our oil and natural gas.
Human Capital Resources
 
People are our most valuable asset, and we strive to provide a work environment that attracts and retains the top talent in the industry, reflects our core values and demonstrates our core values to the communities in which we operate.
 
As of December 31, 2020, our personnel base consisted of 303 of our employees and over 300 individuals who are employees of third parties that provide skilled labor in support of our field operations. This combined workforce conducts our business in Texas, Alabama and the Gulf of Mexico. Our workforce in Texas is primarily composed of our corporate employees, including our executive officers, drilling and production managers, technical engineers and administrative and support staff. Our employees in Alabama and the Gulf of Mexico are primarily composed of skilled labor who conduct our field operations and manage third party personnel used in support of our field operations. We focus on certain measures and objectives when managing our workforce that are material in understanding our business, which are summarized below:
 
Health and Safety.  Our highest priorities are the safety of all personnel and protection of the environment. To drive a culture of personnel safety in our operations, we operate under a comprehensive Safety and Environmental Management System (“SEMS”). Our 2020 total recordable incident rate (“TRIR”) for employees was 0.3, which is far below the industry average for the Gulf of Mexico of 0.5.  Our Health, Safety and Environmental (“HS&E”) group is comprised of a Vice President, and Environmental, Safety and Regulatory Managers and 10 staff personnel. The Department works with field personnel to create and regularly review safety policies and procedures, in an effort to support continuous improvement of our SEMS.
 
As a company identified by the Federal Government as essential to the critical infrastructure of the United States, we have continuously operated during the COVID-19 pandemic. To provide our personnel with a physically safer work environment and mitigate the risks associated with the transmission of COVID-19, we implement policies requiring mandatory face masks and social distancing in all work environments, conduct daily temperature screening at all locations and COVID-19 testing for field project crews, and limiting headcount to 50% or less in our offices during peak COVID-19 outbreaks in the community.
 
Recruitment and Compensation.  We pride ourselves on providing an attractive compensation and benefits program that allows our employees to view working at W&T as more than where they work, but a place where they may grow and develop.  Our ability to succeed depends on recruiting and retaining top talent in the industry. We believe employees choose W&T in part due to our professional advancement opportunities, on the job training, engaging culture and competitive compensation and benefits.
 
As part of our compensation philosophy, we believe we must offer and maintain market competitive total rewards programs in order to attract and retain superior talent. These programs not only include base wages and incentives in support of our pay for performance culture, but also health and retirement benefits. We focus many programs on employee wellness. We believe these solutions help the overall health and wellness of our employees and help us successfully manage healthcare and prescription drug costs for our employee population.
 
Diversity and Inclusion.  The key to our past and future successes is promoting a workforce culture that embraces integrity, honesty and transparency those we interact, fosters a trusting and respectful work environment that embraces changes and moves us forward in an innovative and positive way.
