     Item 1.  Business
     General
     Papa John’s International, Inc., a Delaware corporation (referred to as the “Company”, “Papa John’s” or in the first person notations of “we”, “us” and “our”) operates and franchises pizza delivery and carryout restaurants and, in certain international markets, dine-in and delivery restaurants under the trademark “Papa John’s”.  Papa John’s began operations in 1984.  At December 25, 2016, there were 5,097 Papa John’s restaurants in operation, consisting of 744 Company-owned and 4,353 franchised restaurants operating domestically in all 50 states and in 45 countries and territories. Our Company-owned restaurants include 222 restaurants operated under five joint venture arrangements and 42 units in Beijing and North China.
     Papa John’s has defined five reportable segments: domestic Company-owned restaurants, North America commissaries (Quality Control Centers), North America franchising, international operations, and “all other” business units. North America is defined as the United States and Canada. Domestic is defined as the contiguous United States. International franchisees are defined as all franchise operations outside of the United States and Canada. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Note 20” of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for financial information about our segments.

     Strategy
     Our goal is to build the strongest brand loyalty in the pizza industry by delivering on our “Better Ingredients. Better Pizza.” promise. Recognized as a trusted brand and quality leader in the domestic pizza category, our objective is to build our brand on a global basis by executing the key elements of our strategy.  
     High-Quality Menu Offerings. Our menu strategy focuses on the quality of our ingredients.  Domestic Papa John’s restaurants offer high-quality pizza along with side items, including breadsticks, cheesesticks, chicken poppers and wings, dessert items and canned or bottled beverages. Papa John’s traditional crust pizza is prepared using fresh dough (never frozen). We also introduced a fresh dough pan crust in 2016; this is the first new crust offered in 10 years.  Papa John’s pizzas are made from a proprietary blend of wheat flour, real cheese made from mozzarella, fresh-packed pizza sauce made from vine-ripened tomatoes (not from concentrate) and a proprietary mix of savory spices, and a choice of high-quality meat and vegetable toppings. Our traditional crust pizza is delivered with a container of our special garlic sauce and a pepperoncini pepper. In addition to our fresh dough pizzas, we offer a par-baked thin crust. Each is served with a pepperoncini pepper.  We have a continuing “clean label” initiative to remove unwanted ingredients from our product offerings, such as synthetic colors, artificial flavors and preservatives, announcing in 2016 that we had removed an additional fourteen unwanted ingredients across our entire food menu during the year.

 We also offer limited time pizzas on a regular basis and expect to continue to test new product offerings both domestically and internationally. The new products can become a part of the permanent menu if they meet certain internally established guidelines.
     All ingredients and toppings can be purchased by our Company-owned and franchised restaurants from our North American Quality Control Center (“QC Center”) system, which delivers to individual restaurants twice weekly. To ensure consistent food quality, each domestic franchisee is required to purchase dough and pizza sauce from our QC Centers and to purchase all other supplies from our QC Centers or other approved suppliers. Internationally, the menu may be more diverse than in our domestic operations to meet local tastes and customs. Most QC Centers outside the U.S. are operated by franchisees pursuant to license agreements or by other third parties. The Company operates three international QC Centers in Mexico, the United Kingdom (“UK”), and China.  We provide significant assistance to licensed QC Centers in sourcing approved quality suppliers. All of the QC Centers are required to meet food safety and quality standards and to be in compliance with all applicable laws.
     Efficient Operating System. We believe our operating and distribution systems, restaurant layout and designated delivery areas result in lower restaurant operating costs and improved food quality, and promote superior customer service. Our QC Center system takes advantage of volume purchasing of food and supplies and provides consistency and efficiencies of scale in fresh dough production. This eliminates the need for each restaurant to order food from multiple vendors and commit substantial labor and other resources to dough preparation.
     Commitment to Team Member Training and Development. We are committed to the development and motivation of our team members through training programs, incentive and recognition programs and opportunities for advancement. Team member training programs are conducted for Company-owned restaurant team members, and operational training is offered to our franchisees. We offer performance-based financial incentives to corporate team members and restaurant managers.
     Marketing. Our domestic marketing strategy consists of both national and local components. Our national strategy includes national advertising via television, print, direct mail, digital, mobile marketing and social media channels. Our digital marketing activities have increased significantly over the past several years in response to increasing consumer use of online and mobile web technology. Local advertising programs include television, radio, print, direct mail, store-to-door flyers, digital, mobile marketing and local social media channels. See “Marketing Programs” below which describes more local marketing programs. 
     In international markets, our marketing focuses on reaching customers who live or work within a small radius of a Papa John’s restaurant. Our international markets use a combination of advertising strategies, including television, radio, print, digital, mobile marketing and local social media depending on the size of the local market.
     Technology. We use technology to both enhance the customer experience and improve efficiencies in our Company-owned and franchised restaurants. Our proprietary digital ordering platform processes over half of domestic restaurant sales and allows customers to order online. In 2016, we also launched ordering on Apple TV.  Our alternative payment technologies include VISA checkout, PayPal, Google Hands Free and Venmo PayShare.  Our Papa Rewards® program is a customer loyalty program designed to increase customer loyalty and frequency of digital ordering, enhanced in 2016 through redemption offerings including sides and desserts in addition to pizza. We have internally developed and continue to upgrade our domestic proprietary point-of-sale technology, which we refer to as “FOCUS”.  We believe the FOCUS system facilitates fast and accurate order-taking and pricing and is an easy tool for restaurant operators to learn and use. The FOCUS system is also integrated with our digital ordering solutions in all domestic traditional Papa John’s restaurants, enabling Papa John’s to offer nationwide digital ordering to our customers.
     Strong Franchise System. We are committed to developing and maintaining a strong franchise system by attracting experienced operators, supporting them to expand and grow their business and monitoring their compliance with our high standards. We seek to attract franchisees with experience in restaurant or retail operations and with the financial resources and management capability to open single or multiple locations. While each Papa John’s franchisee manages and operates its own restaurants and business, we devote significant resources to providing franchisees with assistance in restaurant operations, training, marketing, site selection and restaurant design.

     Our strategy for global unit growth focuses on our strong unit economics model. We strive to eliminate barriers to expansion in existing international markets, and identify new market opportunities. Our growth strategy varies based on the maturity and penetration of the market and other factors in specific domestic and international markets, with overall unit growth expected to come increasingly from international markets.
     Restaurant Sales and Investment Costs
     We are committed to maintaining strong restaurant unit economics. In 2016, the 694 domestic Company-owned restaurants included in the full year’s comparable restaurant base generated average annual unit sales of $1.16 million. Our North American franchise restaurants, which included 2,363 restaurants in 2016, generated average annual unit sales of $883,000. North American franchise restaurant sales are lower than Company-owned restaurants as a higher percentage of our Company-owned restaurants are located in more heavily penetrated markets.
     With few exceptions, domestic restaurants do not offer a dine-in area, which reduces our restaurant capital investment. The average cash investment for the 12 domestic traditional Company-owned restaurants opened during 2016, exclusive of land, was approximately $339,000 per unit, compared to the $319,000 investment for the 11 domestic traditional units opened in 2015, excluding tenant allowances that we received. Over the past few years we have experienced an increase in the cost of our new restaurants primarily as a result of building larger units to accommodate increased sales, an increase in the cost of certain equipment as a result of technology enhancements, and increased costs to comply with applicable regulations.
     We define a “traditional” domestic Papa John’s restaurant as a delivery and carryout unit that services a defined trade area. We consider the location of a traditional restaurant to be important and therefore devote significant resources to the investigation and evaluation of potential sites. The site selection process includes a review of trade area demographics, target population density and competitive factors.  A member of our development team inspects each potential domestic Company-owned restaurant location and substantially all franchised restaurant locations before a site is approved. Papa John’s restaurants are typically located in strip shopping centers or freestanding buildings that provide visibility, curb appeal and accessibility. Our restaurant design can be configured to fit a wide variety of building shapes and sizes, which increases the number of suitable locations for our Company-owned and franchised restaurants. A typical traditional domestic Papa John’s restaurant averages 1,100 to 1,500 square feet with visible exterior signage.
     “Non-traditional” Papa John’s restaurants generally do not provide delivery service but rather provide walk-up or carry out service to a captive customer group within a designated facility, such as a food court at an airport, university or military base or an event-driven service at facilities such as sports stadiums or entertainment venues. Non-traditional units are designed to fit the unique requirements of the venue and may not offer the full range of menu items available in our traditional restaurants.
     All of our international restaurants are franchised, except for 42 Company-owned restaurants in Beijing and North China. Generally, our international Papa John’s restaurants are slightly smaller than our domestic restaurants and average between 900 and 1,400 square feet; however, in order to meet certain local customer preferences, some international restaurants have been opened in larger spaces to accommodate both dine-in and restaurant-based delivery service, typically with 35 to 140 seats.
     Development
     A total of 343 Papa John’s restaurants were opened during 2016, consisting of 13 Company-owned and 330 franchised restaurants (104 in North America and 226 internationally), while 139 Papa John’s restaurants closed during 2016, consisting of four Company-owned (one in North America and three internationally) and 135 franchised restaurants (63 in North America and 72 internationally), representing net global unit growth of 204 restaurants.
     Although most of our domestic Company-owned markets are well-penetrated, our Company-owned growth strategy is to continue to open domestic restaurants in existing markets as appropriate, thereby increasing consumer awareness and enabling us to take advantage of operational and marketing efficiencies. Our experience in developing markets indicates 

 
  5

 
that market penetration through the opening of multiple restaurants in a particular market results in increased average restaurant sales in that market over time. We have co-developed domestic markets with some franchisees or divided markets among franchisees and will continue to utilize market co-development in the future, where appropriate.
 Of the total 3,441 North American restaurants open as of December 25, 2016, 702 or 20% were Company-owned (including 222 units owned in joint venture arrangements with franchisees in which the Company has a majority ownership position). Operating Company-owned restaurants allows us to improve operations, training, marketing and quality standards for the benefit of the entire system.  From time to time, we evaluate the purchase or sale of units in significant markets, which could change the percentage of Company-owned units.
     Of the 1,656 international restaurants open as of December 25, 2016, 42 or 2.5% were Company-owned (all of which are located in Beijing and North China).  We plan to sell the Company-owned China restaurants and the China QC Center in the next 12 months. Accordingly, as of December 25, 2016, the Company’s China operations, including these restaurants and the QC Center, are classified as held for sale in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
     QC Center System and Supply Chain Management
     Our North American QC Center system is currently comprised of 10 full-service regional production and distribution centers in the U.S. which supply pizza sauce and dough, food products, paper products, smallwares and cleaning supplies twice weekly to each traditional restaurant it serves. Additionally, we have one QC Center in Canada that produces and distributes dough.  This system enables us to monitor and control product quality and consistency, while lowering food and other costs. We evaluate the QC Center system capacity in relation to existing restaurants’ volumes and planned restaurant growth, and facilities are developed or upgraded as operational or economic conditions warrant. In 2017, we plan to complete construction of and open an additional North American full-service QC Center in Georgia.
     We currently own full-service international QC Centers in Milton Keynes, United Kingdom, Mexico City, Mexico, and Beijing, China. Other international QC Centers are licensed to franchisees or non-franchisee third parties and are generally located in the markets where our franchisees have restaurants.
     We set quality standards for all products used in Papa John’s restaurants and designate approved outside suppliers of food and paper products that meet our quality standards.  To ensure product quality and consistency, all domestic Papa John’s restaurants are required to purchase pizza sauce and dough from QC Centers. Franchisees may purchase other goods directly from our QC Centers or other approved suppliers. National purchasing agreements with most of our suppliers generally result in volume discounts to us, allowing us to sell products to our restaurants at prices we believe are below those generally available to restaurants in the marketplace. Within our North American QC Center system, products are primarily distributed to restaurants by leased refrigerated trucks operated by us.
     Marketing Programs
     Our local restaurant-level marketing programs target consumers within the delivery area of each restaurant through the use of local television, radio, print materials, targeted direct mail, store-to-door flyers, digital display advertising, email marketing, text messages and local social media. Local marketing efforts also include a variety of community-oriented activities within schools, sports venues and other organizations supported with some of the same advertising vehicles mentioned above.
     Domestic Company-owned and franchised Papa John’s restaurants within a defined market may be required to join an area advertising cooperative (“Co-op”). Each member restaurant contributes a percentage of sales to the Co-op for market-wide programs, such as television, radio, digital and print advertising, and sports sponsorships. The rate of contribution and uses of the monies collected are determined by a majority vote of the Co-op’s members. The contribution rate for Co-ops generally may not be below 2% of sales without approval from Papa John’s.
     The restaurant-level and Co-op marketing efforts are supported by media, print, digital and electronic advertising materials that are produced by Papa John’s Marketing Fund, Inc. (“PJMF”). PJMF is an unconsolidated nonstock corporation designed to operate at break-even for the purpose of designing and administering advertising and promotional programs for all participating domestic restaurants. PJMF produces and buys air time for Papa John’s national television 

 
  6

 
commercials, buys digital media such as banner advertising, paid search-engine advertising, mobile marketing, social media advertising and marketing, text messaging, and email.  It also engages in other brand-building activities, such as consumer research and public relations activities. Domestic Company-owned and franchised Papa John’s restaurants are required to contribute a certain minimum percentage of sales to PJMF.  The contribution rate to PJMF can be set at up to 3% of sales, if approved by the governing board of PJMF, and beyond that level if approved by a supermajority of domestic restaurants. The domestic franchise system approved a new contribution rate of 4.25% effective in the fourth quarter of 2016. The new rate is an increase of 0.25% from the 4.0% contribution rate that had been in place since 2011.  The rate will increase an additional 0.25% in annual increments until the rate reaches 5.0% of sales in 2019.
     Our proprietary domestic digital ordering platform allows customers to order online, including “plan ahead ordering,” Apple TV ordering and Spanish-language ordering capability.  Digital payment platforms include VISA Checkout, PayPal, Google Hands Free and Venmo PayShare.  We provide enhanced mobile web ordering for our customers, including Papa John’s iPhone® and Android® applications. Our Papa Rewards® program is a customer loyalty program designed to increase loyalty and frequency; we offer this program domestically and in the UK. We receive a percentage-based fee from North American franchisees for online sales, in addition to royalties, to defray development and operating costs associated with our digital ordering platform.  We believe continued innovation and investment in the design and functionality of our online and mobile platforms is critical to the success of our brand.
     Our domestic restaurants offer customers the opportunity to purchase reloadable gift cards, sold as either a plastic gift card purchased in our restaurants, or an online digital card. Gift cards are sold to consumers on our website, through third-party retailers, and in bulk to business entities and organizations. We continue to explore other gift card distribution opportunities. Gift cards may be redeemed for delivery, carryout, and digital orders and are accepted at all Papa John’s traditional domestic restaurants.
     We provide both Company-owned and franchised restaurants with pre-approved marketing materials and catalogs for the purchase of promotional items. We also provide direct marketing services to Company-owned and domestic franchised restaurants using customer information gathered by our proprietary point-of-sale technology (see “Company Operations — Domestic Point-of-Sale Technology”). In addition, we provide database tools, templates and training for operators to facilitate local email marketing and text messaging through our approved tools.
     In international markets, our marketing focuses on customers who live or work within a small radius of a Papa John’s restaurant. Certain markets can effectively use television and radio as part of their marketing strategies. The majority of the marketing efforts include using print materials such as flyers, newspaper inserts, in-store marketing materials, and to a growing extent, digital marketing such as display, search engine marketing, social media, mobile marketing, email, and text messaging. Local marketing efforts, such as sponsoring or participating in community events, sporting events and school programs, are also used to build customer awareness.
     Company Operations
     Domestic Restaurant Personnel. A typical Papa John’s Company-owned domestic restaurant employs a restaurant manager and approximately 20 to 25 hourly team members, many of whom work part-time. The manager is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the restaurant and maintaining Company-established operating standards. We seek to hire experienced restaurant managers and staff and provide comprehensive training programs in areas such as operations and managerial skills. We also employ directors of operations who are responsible for overseeing an average of seven Company-owned restaurants. Senior management and corporate staff also support the field teams in many areas, including, but not limited to, quality assurance, food safety, training, marketing and technology. We seek to motivate and retain personnel by providing opportunities for advancement and performance-based financial incentives.
     Training and Education. The Global Operations Support and Training department is responsible for creating tools and materials for the operational training and development of both corporate and franchise team members. We believe training is very important to delivering consistent operational execution. Operations personnel complete our management training program and ongoing development programs, including multi-unit training, in which instruction is given on all aspects of our systems and operations.

 North America Point-of-Sale Technology. Our proprietary point-of-sale technology, “FOCUS”, is in place in all North America traditional Papa John’s restaurants. We believe this technology facilitates fast and accurate order-taking and pricing, and allows the restaurant manager to better monitor and control food and labor costs, including food inventory management and order placement from the North American QC Centers. The system allows us to obtain restaurant operating information, providing us with timely access to sales and customer information. The FOCUS system is also integrated with our digital ordering solutions in all North American traditional Papa John’s restaurants.
     Domestic Hours of Operation. Our domestic restaurants are open seven days a week, typically from 11:00 a.m. to 12:30 a.m. Monday through Thursday, 11:00 a.m. to 1:30 a.m. on Friday and Saturday and 12:00 noon to 11:30 p.m. on Sunday. Carry out hours are generally more limited for late night, for security purposes.
     Franchise Program
     General. We continue to attract franchisees with significant restaurant and retail experience. We consider our franchisees to be a vital part of our system’s continued growth and believe our relationship with our franchisees is good. As of December 25, 2016, there were 4,353 franchised Papa John’s restaurants operating in all 50 states and 45 countries and territories.  During 2016, our franchisees opened an additional 330 (104 North America and 226 internationally) restaurants, which includes the opening of Papa John’s restaurants in six new countries.  As of December 25, 2016, we have development agreements with our franchisees for approximately 220 additional North America restaurants, the majority of which are committed to open over the next two to three years, and agreements for approximately 1,080 additional international franchised restaurants, the majority of which are scheduled to open over the next six years. There can be no assurance that all of these restaurants will be opened or that the development schedule set forth in the development agreements will be achieved.
     Approval. Franchisees are approved on the basis of the applicant’s business background, restaurant operating experience and financial resources. We seek franchisees to enter into development agreements for single or multiple restaurants. We require each franchisee to complete our training program or to hire a full-time operator who completes the training and has either an equity interest or the right to acquire an equity interest in the franchise operation. For most non-traditional operations and for operations outside the United States, we will allow an approved operator bonus plan to substitute for the equity interest.
     North America Development and Franchise Agreements. We enter into development agreements with our franchisees in North America for the opening of a specified number of restaurants within a defined period of time and specified geographic area. Our standard domestic development agreement includes a fee of $25,000 before consideration of any incentives. The franchise agreement is generally executed once a franchisee secures a location. Our current standard franchise agreement requires the franchisee to pay a royalty fee of 5% of sales, and the majority of our existing franchised restaurants have a 5% royalty rate in effect.
     Over the past several years, we have offered various development incentive programs for domestic franchisees to accelerate unit openings. Such incentives included the following for 2016 traditional openings: (1) waiver of the standard one-time $25,000 franchise fee if the unit opens on time in accordance with the agreed-upon development schedule, or a reduced fee of $5,000 if the unit opens late; (2) the waiver of some or all of the 5% royalty fee for a period of time; (3) a credit for a portion of the purchase of certain leased equipment; and (4) a credit to be applied toward a future food purchase, under certain circumstances. We believe development incentive programs have accelerated unit openings and expect they will continue to do so in 2017.
     Substantially all existing franchise agreements have an initial 10-year term with a 10-year renewal option. We have the right to terminate a franchise agreement for a variety of reasons, including a franchisee’s failure to make payments when due or failure to adhere to our operational policies and standards. Many state franchise laws limit our ability as a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise.
     We provide assistance to Papa John’s franchisees in selecting sites, developing restaurants and evaluating the physical specifications for typical restaurants. We provide layout and design services and recommendations for subcontractors, signage installers and telephone systems to Papa John’s franchisees. Our franchisees can purchase complete new store 

 
  8

 
equipment packages through an approved third-party supplier. We sell replacement smallwares and related items to our franchisees. Each franchisee is responsible for selecting the location for its restaurants but must obtain our approval of the restaurant design and location based on traffic accessibility and visibility of the site and targeted demographic factors, including population density, income, age and traffic.
     Domestic Franchise Support Initiatives. From time to time, we offer discretionary support initiatives to our domestic franchisees, including:
    
· | Performance-based incentives;
--+------------------------------


· | Targeted royalty relief and local marketing support to assist certain identified franchisees or markets;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Restaurant opening incentives; and
--+-----------------------------------


· | Reduced-cost direct mail campaigns from Preferred Marketing Solutions (“Preferred,” our wholly owned print and promotions subsidiary).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      In 2017, we plan to offer some or all of these domestic franchise support initiatives.
     International Development and Franchise Agreements.  We opened our first franchised restaurant outside the United States in 1998. We define “international” as all markets outside the United States and Canada. In international markets, we have either a development agreement or a master franchise agreement with a franchisee for the opening of a specified number of restaurants within a defined period of time and specified geographic area. Under a master franchise agreement, the franchisee has the right to sub-franchise a portion of the development to one or more sub-franchisees approved by us. Under our current standard international development or master franchise agreement, the franchisee is required to pay total fees of $25,000 per restaurant: $5,000 at the time of signing the agreement and $20,000 when the restaurant opens or on the agreed-upon development date, whichever comes first. Additionally, under our current standard master franchise agreement, the master franchisee is required to pay $15,000 for each sub-franchised restaurant — $5,000 at the time of signing the agreement and $10,000 when the restaurant opens or on the agreed-upon development date, whichever comes first.
     Our current standard international master franchise and development agreements provide for payment to us of a royalty fee of 5% of sales. For international markets with sub-franchise agreements, the effective sub-franchise royalty received by the Company is generally 3% of sales and the master franchisee generally receives a royalty of 2% of sales. The remaining terms applicable to the operation of individual restaurants are substantially equivalent to the terms of our domestic franchise agreement. From time to time, development agreements will be negotiated at other-than-standard terms for fees and royalties, and we may offer various development and royalty incentives to help drive net unit growth and results.
     Non-traditional Restaurant Development. We had 240 non-traditional domestic restaurants at December 25, 2016. Non-traditional restaurants generally cover venues or areas not originally targeted for traditional unit development, and our franchised non-traditional restaurants have terms differing from the standard agreements.
     Franchisee Loans. Selected domestic and international franchisees have borrowed funds from us, principally for the purchase of restaurants from us or other franchisees or for construction and development of new restaurants. Loans made to franchisees can bear interest at fixed or floating rates and in most cases are secured by the fixtures, equipment and signage of the restaurant and/or are guaranteed by the franchise owners. At December 25, 2016, net loans outstanding totaled $13.6 million. See “Note 11” of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information.
     Domestic Franchise Training and Support. Our domestic field support structure consists of franchise business directors, each of whom is responsible for serving an average of 130 franchised units. Our franchise business directors maintain open communication with the franchise community, relaying operating and marketing information and new initiatives between franchisees and us. 
     Every franchisee is required to have a principal operator approved by us who satisfactorily completes our required training program. Principal operators for traditional restaurants are required to devote their full business time and efforts to the operation of the franchisee’s traditional restaurants. Each franchised restaurant manager is also required to complete our 

 
  9

 
Company-certified management operations training program. Ongoing compliance with training is monitored by the Global Operations Support and Training team. Multi-unit franchisees are encouraged to appoint training store general managers or hire a full-time training coordinator certified to deliver Company-approved operational training programs.
     International Franchise Operations Support. We employ or contract with international business directors who are responsible for supporting one or more franchisees. The international business directors usually report to regional vice presidents. Senior management and corporate staff also support the international field teams in many areas, including but not limited to food safety, quality assurance, marketing, technology, operations training and financial analysis.
     Franchise Operations. All franchisees are required to operate their Papa John’s restaurants in compliance with our policies, standards and specifications, including matters such as menu items, ingredients, and restaurant design. Franchisees have full discretion in human resource practices, and generally have full discretion to determine the prices to be charged to customers, but we have the authority to set maximum price points for nationally advertised promotions.
     Franchise Advisory Council. We have a Franchise Advisory Council (“FAC”) that consists of Company and franchisee representatives of domestic restaurants. We also have a franchise advisory council in the United Kingdom (“UK FAC”). The FAC and UK FAC and subcommittees hold regular meetings to discuss new product and marketing ideas, operations, growth and other business issues. From time to time, certain domestic franchisees have also formed a separate franchise association for the purpose of communicating and addressing issues, needs and opportunities among its members.
     We currently communicate with, and receive input from, our franchisees in several forms, including through the FAC, UK FAC, annual operations conferences, system communications, national conference calls, various regional meetings conducted with franchisees throughout the year and ongoing communications from franchise business directors and international business directors in the field. Monthly webcasts are also conducted by the Company to discuss current operational, marketing or other issues affecting the domestic franchisees’ business. We are committed to communicating with our franchisees and receiving input from them.
     Industry and Competition
     The United States Quick Service Restaurant pizza (“QSR Pizza”) industry is mature and highly competitive with respect to price, service, location, food quality and product innovation. There are well-established competitors with substantially greater financial and other resources than Papa John’s. The category is largely fragmented and competitors include international, national and regional chains, as well as a large number of local independent pizza operators, any of which can utilize a growing number of food delivery services.  Some of our competitors have been in existence for substantially longer periods than Papa John’s and can have higher levels of restaurant penetration and stronger, more developed brand awareness in markets where we compete. According to industry sources, domestic QSR Pizza category sales, which includes dine-in, carry out and delivery, totaled approximately $34.9 billion in 2016, or an increase of 1% from the prior year.
     With respect to the sale of franchises, we compete with many franchisors of restaurants and other business concepts. There is also active competition for management personnel and attractive commercial real estate sites suitable for Papa John’s restaurants.
     Government Regulation
     We, along with our franchisees, are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws affecting the operation of our respective businesses, including laws and regulations related to the preparation and sale of food, including food safety and menu labeling. Each Papa John’s restaurant is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities, which include zoning, health, safety, sanitation, building and fire agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is located. Difficulties in obtaining, or the failure to obtain, required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the opening of a new restaurant in a particular area. Our QC Centers are licensed and subject to regulation by state and local health and fire codes, and the operation of our trucks is subject to federal and state transportation regulations. We are also subject to federal and state environmental regulations. In addition, our domestic operations are subject to

various federal and state laws governing such matters as minimum wage requirements, benefits, working conditions, citizenship requirements, and overtime.
     We are subject to Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) regulation and various state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises. The laws of several states also regulate substantive aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship. The FTC requires us to furnish to prospective franchisees a franchise disclosure document containing prescribed information. State laws that regulate the franchisor-franchisee relationship presently exist in a significant number of states, and bills have been introduced in Congress from time to time that would provide for federal regulation of the U.S. franchisor-franchisee relationship in certain respects if such bills were enacted. The state laws often limit, among other things, the duration and scope of non-competition provisions and the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise. Some foreign countries also have disclosure requirements and other laws regulating franchising and the franchisor-franchisee relationship. National, state and local government regulations or initiatives, including health care legislation, “living wage,” legislation imposing “joint employer liability” or other current or proposed regulations and increases in minimum wage rates affect Papa John’s as well as others within the restaurant industry. As we expand internationally, we are also subject to applicable laws in each jurisdiction.
     We are increasingly subject to laws and regulations that require us to disclose calorie content and other specific content of our food, including fat, trans fat, and salt content. A provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA) requires us and many restaurant companies to disclose calorie information on restaurant menus. The Food and Drug Administration issued final rules to implement this provision beginning in May 2017, which will require restaurants to post the number of calories for most items on menus or menu boards and to make other nutritional information available. A number of states, counties and cities in which we do business have also enacted menu labeling laws. Government regulation of nutrition disclosure and advertising could result in increased costs of compliance and could also impact consumer habits in a way that adversely impacts sales at our restaurants. For further information regarding governmental regulation, see Item 1A, Risk Factors.
