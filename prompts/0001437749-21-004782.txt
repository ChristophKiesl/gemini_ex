For a depiction of net sales from external customers, income before taxes on income and total assets by segment for each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, please refer to Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 (“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”) (collectively referred to as “Financial Statements,” and individually referred to as “statements of comprehensive income,” “balance sheets,” “statements of shareholders’ equity,” and “statements of cash flows” herein).
 
During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, uniforms and service apparel and related products accounted for approximately 55%, 63% and 69%, respectively, of net sales. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, promotional and related products accounted for approximately 38%, 29% and 23%, respectively, of net sales.
 
Services
 
Through the recruitment and employment of highly qualified English-speaking agents, we provide our customers with extended office support from a versatile call and contact center environment in our Remote Staffing Solutions segment. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, our Remote Staffing Solutions segment accounted for approximately 7%, 8% and 8%, respectively, of net sales.
Competition
 
Superior competes in its Uniforms and Related Products segment with more than three dozen firms, including divisions of larger corporations. Superior competes with national and regional companies, such as, ARAMARK Corporation, Cintas Corporation, Lands’ End, Inc., Medline Industries, Inc., Standard Textile Co., Inc., Careismatic Brands, Twin Hill and UniFirst Corporation. Superior also competes with local firms in most major metropolitan areas. The nature and degree of competition varies with the customer and the market. We believe Superior is one of the leading suppliers of garments to hospitals, retailers, hotels, food service establishments, and linen suppliers. Superior experiences competition primarily based on breadth of products and services offered, styling and pricing. We believe that the strength of our brands and marketing, coupled with the quality of our products, allow us to compete effectively.
 
The market in which TOG operates has evolved into a global multi-billion dollar marketplace that is highly competitive and fragmented. TOG’s competitors in the Remote Staffing Solutions segment range in size from very small firms offering specialized services or short-term project completion to very large independent firms, and include the in-house operations of many customers and potential customers. We compete directly and indirectly with various companies that provide contact center and other business process solutions on an outsourced basis. These companies include, but are certainly not limited to, global providers such as APAC Customer Services, Atento, Concentrix, Sitel, Sykes, and Teleperformance. TOG also competes with local entities in other offshore locations. The list of potential competitors includes both publicly traded and privately held companies.

The promotional products industry is highly fragmented. We compete with a multitude of foreign, regional, and local competitors that vary by market. Major competitors in the Promotional Products segment include companies such as BDA, Inc., HALO Branded Solutions, Inc., Staples, Inc., and InnerWorkings, Inc. We believe our creative services, product development, proprietary web platforms and extensive global sourcing network, along with our success with major brands, will enable us to continue to be competitive and grow in this market.
 
Customers
 
The Uniform and Related Products segment has a substantial number of customers, none of which accounted for more than 10% of that segment’s 2020 net sales. The Remote Staffing Solutions segment’s largest customer represented 14% of that segment’s 2020 external revenues. No customer accounted for more than 10% of the Promotional Products segment’s 2020 net sales.
Resources Material to Our Business
 
Raw Materials
 
The principal fabrics used in the manufacture of finished goods for Superior's Uniform and Related Products segment are cotton, polyester and cotton-synthetic blends. The majority of such fabrics are sourced in China. If Superior or its suppliers are unable to source raw materials from China, it could significantly disrupt Superior’s business. 
 
Despite the concentration of raw material sourcing, Superior does not have a concentration of suppliers of finished goods in any single country or region of the world. However, the Company’s suppliers generally source or manufacture finished goods in parts of the world that may be affected by economic uncertainty, political unrest, labor disputes, health emergencies, or the imposition of duties, tariffs or other import regulations by the United States. The Company believes that its redundant network of suppliers, including its own manufacturing facilities in Haiti, provide sufficient capacity to mitigate any dependency risks on a single supplier.
 
The Promotional Products segment relies on the supply of different types of raw materials as well as textiles, including plastic, glass, fabric and metal. The vast majority of these raw materials are principally sourced from China, either directly by BAMKO or its suppliers. If we are unable to continue to obtain our finished products from China or if our suppliers are unable to source raw materials from China, it could significantly disrupt our business. Further, we are affected by economic, political and other conditions in China or the United States, including those resulting in the imposition or increase of import duties, tariffs and other import regulations and widespread health emergencies, which could have a material adverse effect on this business segment.
 
Prices within the promotional products industry are directly affected by the cost of raw materials. The market for promotional products is price sensitive and has historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality. The Promotional Products segment has flexibility in its suppliers, as other suppliers of the same or similar products are widely available. Additionally, the nature of the promotional products industry is such that should specific types of raw materials undergo significant cost increases, it is possible that alternative products using different materials could be utilized for similar promotional activities. However, if cost increases cannot be entirely passed on to customers and alternative suppliers or suitable product alternatives are unavailable, profit margins could decline.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Superior owns and uses several trademarks and service marks relating to its brands that have significant value and are instrumental to its ability to market its products. Superior’s most significant trademarks, which are critically important to the marketing and operation of Superior’s Uniforms and Related Products segment, are Fashion Seal Healthcare® and WonderWink®. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Fashion Seal Healthcare (presently registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office until 2029) and WonderWink (presently registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office until at least 2022) represented approximately 24% and 21%, respectively, of sales in that segment.
Seasonal Fluctuations
 
Our results of operations have not historically reflected material seasonal tendencies and we do not believe that seasonal fluctuations will have a material impact on us in the foreseeable future.

Effects of Compliance with Government Regulations
 
Trade Regulations
 
As disclosed above, the Company’s suppliers generally source or manufacture finished goods in parts of the world that may be affected by the imposition of duties, tariffs or other import regulations by the United States. The Company believes that its redundant network of suppliers, including its own manufacturing facilities in Haiti, provide sufficient capacity to mitigate any dependency risks on a single supplier.
 
The Promotional Products segment relies on raw materials that are principally sourced from China, either directly by BAMKO or its suppliers. If we are unable to continue to obtain our finished products from China or if our suppliers are unable to source raw materials from China, it could significantly disrupt our business. Further, we are affected by economic, political and other conditions in China or the United States, including those resulting in the imposition or increase of import duties, tariffs and other import regulations and widespread health emergencies, which could have a material adverse effect on this business segment.
 
Environmental Matters
 
In view of the nature of our business, compliance with federal, state, and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, has had no material effect upon our operations or earnings, and we do not expect it to have a material impact in the foreseeable future.
Human Capital Resources
 
The Company’s key human capital management objectives are to attract, retain and develop quality talent. To support these objectives, the Company’s human resources initiatives are designed to: keep people safe and healthy; enhance the Company’s culture; acquire and retain diverse talent; reward and support employees through competitive pay, benefits and other programs; and develop talent to prepare them for critical roles and leadership positions. In 2020, the Company deployed resources to positively impact all of these objectives. For example, we implemented substantial COVID-19-related safety measures, transitioned much of our workforce to work-from-home, expanded our recruiting efforts and strategies, amplified our total rewards packages, and provided skills, competency and compliance training to more of our team members than ever before.
 
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had approximately 4,600 full-time employees worldwide, which is a year-over-year increase of approximately 1,200 people. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 800 employees were employed in the U.S. and approximately 3,800 employees were employed in foreign countries. The Remote Staffing Solutions segment has the Company’s largest labor force at approximately 2,300 full-time employees as of December 31, 2020.
