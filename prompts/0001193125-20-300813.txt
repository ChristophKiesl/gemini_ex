  Diagnostics Segment 
 Products and Markets 
 Prior to the current year effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, our largest source of revenues has been clinical diagnostic products, historically representing approximately two-thirds of our consolidated revenues. However, primarily due to the effects of the pandemic, our Diagnostics segment provided 48% of consolidated net revenues for fiscal 2020.
 Our clinical diagnostic products provide accuracy, simplicity and speed; enable early diagnosis and treatment of common, acute medical conditions; and provide for better patient outcomes at reduced costs. We target diagnostics for disease states that: (i) are conditions where rapid diagnosis impacts patient outcomes; (ii) have opportunistic demographic and disease profiles; (iii) are underserved by current diagnostic products; and/or (iv) have difficult sample handling requirements (e.g., stool). This approach has allowed us to establish meaningful market share in our target disease states, gastrointestinal and respiratory illnesses, and tests for elevated lead levels in blood. 
 Our product portfolio includes approximately 150 diagnostic tests and transport media, and is marketed to acute care hospitals, reference laboratories, outpatient clinics and physician office laboratories in over 70 countries around the world. Our testing platforms include: Real-time PCR Amplification (Revogene brand); Isothermal DNA Amplification (Alethia brand); Lateral Flow Immunoassay using fluorescent chemistry (Curian brand); Rapid Immunoassay (ImmunoCard and ImmunoCard STAT! brands); Enzyme-linked Immunoassay (PREMIER brand); Anodic Stripping Voltammetry (LeadCare and Pediastat brands); and urea breath testing for H. pylori (BreathID brand).
 Our research and development programs are focused on menu expansion for our Curian and Revogene instrument platforms, with disease targets in the gastrointestinal and respiratory areas, as well as next generation blood-chemistry testing. Over the next 12 months, we intend to submit to the FDA at least six new products across both the Curian and Revogene instrument platforms. These new products include the following: Curian – Campylobacter, EHEC Shiga Toxins and C. difficile combo common antigen and Toxins A and B; Revogene – SARS-CoV-2 (emergency use authorization), gastrointestinal panel and respiratory panel. Although at an earlier stage in our research and development program, we are also exploring the merits and viability of a liver function test on the BreathID system. We are also pursuing opportunities to complement our internal research and development programs by securing rights to finished diagnostics tests. Our arrangement with GenBody for access to its rapid antigen SARS-CoV-2 test is a recent example of this pursuit.
 The 2019 acquisition of the GenePOC business and the Revogene platform refreshed our molecular diagnostics product portfolio, stabilized our molecular customer base and provided menu expansion opportunities for RNA-based tests and small-to-mid sized multi-target panels. This year’s acquisition of Exalenz Bioscience Ltd. (“Exalenz”) and the BreathID system strengthened our position in H. pylori testing, as it gives us a second non-invasive test (in addition to stool antigen testing).
 Market Trends 
 Despite the effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic and the near-term focus on SARS-CoV-2 testing, we believe the global market for infectious disease tests continues to expand as new disease states are identified, new therapies become available, and worldwide standards of living and access to health care improve. There is a continuing shift from conventional testing to more technologically advanced testing, which can be performed by less highly trained personnel and completed in minutes or hours.
 The growing global pressures to contain total health care costs have accelerated the increased use of diagnostic testing. Integrated Delivery Networks (“IDNs”) in our U.S. market have the goal of increasing the efficiency of health care delivery, reducing spending and improving clinical outcomes. We believe our product portfolio positions us competitively with IDNs and health care systems that are transitioning from fee-for-service compensation models to value-based reimbursement.
 We also continue to see aggregation of buying power in our U.S. market via multi-hospital group purchasing organizations and IDNs, consolidation among reference laboratories, hospital laboratories being operated by large reference laboratories, and acquisition of physician practices by hospitals, health systems and for-profit specialty health care companies.

  Cost containment pressures have also affected health care systems outside the U.S., particularly in Europe, where the health care systems are generally government-run. The level of government budget deficits can have an adverse effect on the amount of government health care spend.
 Sales, Marketing and Distribution 
 Our Diagnostics segment relies on direct sales personnel and independent distribution networks. We have a direct sales force in four countries, covering the United States and certain major markets in the EMEA region. We also use independent distributors either in a complementary manner with our direct sales force (e.g., the United States) or solely to supply our products to end-users. Two independent distribution customers in the United States have historically significantly contributed to our revenues, comprising 21% of consolidated revenues as recently as fiscal 2018.
 Competition 
 Our major competitors in molecular diagnostics are Cepheid (a Danaher business) and Becton Dickinson, both of which have systems with multiple-assay menus. We also face competition in molecular diagnostics, but to a lesser degree, from companies such as Abbott (former Alere business) and Quidel. 
 Our major competitors in rapid immunoassay diagnostics are primarily Abbott (former Alere business) and Quidel. In recent years, companies such as bioMerieux have captured market share in our gastrointestinal category via its BioFire multi-plex panel tests. However, since their introduction to the market, payors have raised concerns over reimbursement levels relative to clinical utility, particularly for panels with 12 or more targets. 
 For blood lead testing, we believe we have the only FDA-cleared, CLIA-waived point-of-care test available commercially. Other blood lead testing systems in use, marketed by our competitors, include Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy, which requires a highly skilled technician and larger laboratory space to operate, in addition to not being portable or suitable for point-of-care use.
 Our major competitor for urea breath testing for H. pylori is Otsuka, a pharmaceutical company that also markets and sells a urea breath testing system. We believe that our BreathID system has a competitive advantage in that it: (i) has substantially higher sensitivity and specificity; (ii) has a shorter processing time; (iii) offers full automation; and (iv) connects directly to lab information systems.
 We believe that with the breadth and depth of our product portfolio, we are well positioned for the clinical laboratory. 
 Research and Development 
 Our Diagnostics segment’s research and development personnel are organized into three pre-clinical teams: immunoassay, PCR-based molecular and blood-chemistry. We have a separate team responsible for execution of clinical trials across all three pre-clinical programs. Our research and development activities are focused on new product and new technology development, new applications for our existing technologies, and improvements to existing products, including assay-menu expansion. Research and development efforts may occur in-house or with collaborative partners. We believe that new product development is a key source for sustaining revenue growth. The products within our Revogene and Alethia molecular platforms, H. pylori product family and blood lead testing family were developed in-house. See “Operating Expenses” section within MD&A on page 31.
 Manufacturing 
 Our Diagnostics tests are manufactured at four principal sites in Billerica, Massachusetts (blood-chemistry); Cincinnati, Ohio (immunoassays and molecular tests); Modi’in, Israel, (urea breath tests for H. pylori); and Quebec City, Quebec, Canada (molecular tests). Our immunoassay and molecular assay products require the production of highly specialized reagents, primers and enzymes, and our BreathID system requires the production of urea in pharmaceutical-grade form. We produce the vast majority of our own immunoassay requirements. Reagents, primers and enzymes for our Revogene molecular assay products, primers for our Alethia molecular assay products, and urea for our BreathID system are purchased from outside vendors. Our blood lead testing products require the production of electrical chemical sensors, which we manufacture using critical raw materials purchased from outside vendors.

  Intellectual Property, Patents and Licenses 
 We own or license U.S. and foreign patents, most of which are for select products manufactured by our Diagnostics segment. These patents are used in our manufacturing processes for select products (e.g., method patents) or may relate to the design of the test device technology format (e.g., design patents). In the absence of patent protection, we may be vulnerable to competitors who successfully replicate our production and manufacturing technologies and processes. Our employees are required to sign confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements designed to protect our proprietary products.
 The patents for our Alethia products, which represented 9%, 13% and 16% of consolidated revenues for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, are licensed from a third party, Eiken Chemical Co., Ltd., under a non-exclusive license agreement and expire between 2020 and 2022. These patents were issued in the U.S., European Union and other countries. The term of our license agreement runs until the last patent expires in 2022, at which point we will be free to practice the patents without any restriction or royalty obligation.
 The patents for the Revogene platform and related products acquired as part of the GenePOC business are either wholly owned or licensed from two third parties, Laval University and The Regents of California, under an exclusive license agreement. These patents are issued in the U.S., European Union and other countries. The term of our exclusive license agreement and the related patents currently runs through June 15, 2034, after which we will be free to practice the patents without any restriction or royalty obligation. For a description of our acquisition of the GenePOC business, see Note 2 of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 The patents for the BreathID system and related urea breath test for H. pylori are either wholly owned or licensed from a third party, Oridion Medical 1987 Ltd., under an exclusive, royalty free, license agreement. The licensed and wholly owned patents are issued in the U.S., European Union, Israel, Japan, Australia and China. The wholly owned patents have varying expiration dates, with the last being in 2033.
 The patents for our stool antigen H. pylori products, owned by us and which represented approximately 10%, 16% and 16% of consolidated revenues for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, expired in May 2016 in the U.S. and in May 2017 in countries outside the U.S. We expect competition with respect to our stool antigen H. pylori products to continue to increase, and such competition may have an adverse impact on our selling prices for these products, or our ability to retain business at prices acceptable to us, and consequently, adversely affect our future results of operations and liquidity, including revenues and gross profit. We have executed on a number of measures to address competitive pressures in coming off patent including: (i) in October 2018, we entered into a strategic collaboration with DiaSorin to sell H. pylori tests; (ii) we have executed multi-year supply agreements with our two largest reference laboratory customers for H. pylori tests to secure volume, albeit at lower selling prices; and (iii) upon FDA clearance in March 2020, we launched Curian HpSA, our first assay on the new Curian platform, which we expect will help protect our existing customer base using lateral flow tests. We also expect the acquisition of the Exalenz BreathID platform to combat competitive pressures, as we believe that we are now the only company with FDA-cleared, non-invasive assays for both stool antigen and urea breath samples, allowing physicians a choice in test format from a single supplier. We are unable to provide assurances that we will be successful with any strategy or that any strategy will prevent an adverse effect on our future results of operations and liquidity, including revenues and gross profit.
 Government Regulation 
 Our diagnostic products are regulated by the FDA as “devices” pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”). Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes (i.e., Class I, II or III). Class I and II devices are not expressly approved by the FDA, but, instead, are “cleared” for marketing. Class III devices generally must receive “pre-market approval” from the FDA as to safety and effectiveness. Our diagnostics manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA. See page 28 within MD&A for discussion regarding the FDA’s inspection of our Billerica facility.
 Each of the diagnostic products currently marketed by us in the United States has been cleared by the FDA pursuant to the 510(k) clearance process or is exempt from such requirements. We believe that most, but not all (e.g., liver function test on the BreathID system in development, a Class III medical device), products under development will be classified as Class I or II medical devices and, in the case of most of our Class I and all Class II devices, will be eligible for 510(k) clearance; however, we can make no assurances in this regard. Our urea breath test for H. pylori on the BreathID system was cleared as a Class I medical device since the urea drug component was approved by the FDA separately via the New Drug Application process. Our SARS-CoV-2 test on the Revogene platform is expected to be submitted to the FDA under its emergency use authorization program in late November or early December 2020. We notified the FDA of our intent to submit for emergency use authorization on November 13, 2020.

  Sales of our diagnostic products in foreign countries are subject to foreign government regulation, which is similar to that of the FDA. Our Diagnostics facilities are certified to ISO 13485:2016. 
 Following a five-year transition period, sales of our diagnostic tests in the European Union will be subject to new regulations under the In Vitro Diagnostics Regulation of 2017 (“IVDR”) beginning in May 2022. IVDR replaces the previous IVD Regulation (98/79/EC). We have begun our assessment regarding which products will not be sellable under IVDR and the revenue associated with these products is not expected to be material. 
 Our principal business is the sale of a broad range of clinical diagnostic test kits for common gastrointestinal and respiratory infectious diseases, and elevated blood lead levels. Certain infectious diseases may be seasonal in nature, while others may be associated with sporadic outbreaks, such as foodborne illnesses or pandemics such as an influenza outbreak or the current COVID-19 pandemic. While we believe that the breadth of our diagnostic product lines normally reduces the risk that infections subject to seasonality and sporadic outbreaks will cause significant variability in diagnostic revenues, the current COVID-19 pandemic did result in a significant decline in our Diagnostics revenues during the second half of fiscal 2020. Accordingly, we can make no assurance that revenues will not be impacted period over period by such factors.
 Life Science Segment 
 Products and Markets 
 Our Life Science segment develops, manufactures, sells and distributes bulk antigens, antibodies, PCR/qPCR reagents, nucleotides, and bioresearch reagents used predominantly by IVD manufacturing companies, and to a lesser degree, by researchers and non-human clinical customers. The COVID-19 pandemic has provided the opportunity for our Life Science segment to showcase the breadth of its reagent products across not only SARS-CoV-2 testing platforms (molecular, rapid antigen and serology), but also RNA and DNA based molecular tests for nearly any infectious disease. For fiscal 2020, approximately 85% of Life Science revenues were generated from the industrial market, defined as IVD manufacturers, and reagents for use in SARS-CoV-2 tests contributed approximately $71,500 in new revenues. We engage direct sales teams in the U.S., the U.K., France, Germany, China and Australia. During fiscal 2020, 27% of third-party revenues for this segment were from three IVD manufacturing customers.
 Our Life Science products are marketed to IVD manufacturing customers as a source of raw materials for their human clinical diagnostics tests, or as an outsourced step in their manufacturing processes. We seek and maintain multi-year supply arrangements to provide stability in volumes and pricing. Independent distributors market our molecular biology products to academic/research customers. These products are used in measuring DNA and RNA in human, animal, plant and environmental applications. 
 Market Trends 
 Major IVD manufacturing customers often have global footprints, where we are supplying reagents to specific manufacturing sites around the world. IVD manufacturers in specific countries of the Asia-Pacific region (e.g., China) are increasing their efforts in the development and manufacturing of infectious disease tests. We intend to use the breadth of our product portfolio, particularly molecular reagents, to increase the penetration of our products in IVD manufacturing customers’ tests, regardless of customer class (large multi-national companies or regional companies). 
Competition 
 The market for bulk biomedical reagents is highly competitive with respect to product quality, price, customer service and reputation. Our competitors often have greater financial, research and development, sales and marketing, and manufacturing resources. Customers also may choose to manufacture their biomedical reagents in-house rather than purchase from us.
 
- 8 - 

   Research and Development 
 Our research and development activities for the Life Science segment focus on improving molecular reagents, including DNA and RNA master mixes. For example, our Life Science segment introduced a family of lyophilization-ready reagents that have a number of advantages over prior generation “wet” reagents (e.g., room-temperature shipping and storage and longer shelf-life). See “Operating Expenses” section within MD&A on page 31. 
Manufacturing and Government Regulation 
 Our Life Science facilities are ISO 13485:2016 certified. Additionally, where appropriate, our Life Science facilities comply with Regulation EC 1069:2009. 
 International Markets 
 International markets are an important source of revenues and future growth opportunities for both of our segments. For both segments combined, revenues from customers located outside of the United States and its territories approximated $122,000 or 48% of consolidated fiscal 2020 revenues, $74,000 or 37% of consolidated fiscal 2019 revenues, and $71,000 or 33% of consolidated fiscal 2018 revenues. For our Life Science segment, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the significantly higher percentage of international revenues for fiscal 2020. We expect to continue to look to key European markets as a source of revenue growth in the future for both business units. For the Life Science segment, we have also focused resources on IVD manufacturing customers in China. To date, we have not experienced any adverse effects from the trade tensions between the United States and China, but we cannot be sure that we will not experience any adverse effects in the future.
 Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates since fiscal 2019 had an approximate $1,250 unfavorable impact on fiscal 2020 revenues; $150 within the Diagnostics segment and $1,100 within the Life Science segment. This compares to year-to-year currency exchange rates having an approximate $2,200 unfavorable impact on revenues in fiscal 2019; $1,150 within the Diagnostics segment and $1,050 within the Life Science segment.
 Environmental 
 We are in compliance with applicable portions of the federal and state hazardous waste regulations and have never been a party to any environmental proceeding. 
 Human Capital 
 As of September 30, 2020, our Diagnostics segment had approximately 560 employees in ten countries and our Life Science segment had approximately 190 employees in seven countries. Approximately 58% of our employees are women. In addition, of our U.S. based employees, which represents approximately 60% of our total worldwide workforce, approximately 23% are ethnically diverse. 
 Below is additional demographic information about our current employee base as of September 30, 2020.

 We believe that developing a diverse, equitable and inclusive culture is critical to continuing to attract and retain the top talent necessary to deliver on our growth strategy. As such, we are investing in the creation of a work environment where our employees can feel inspired to deliver their workplace best every day. All employees are responsible for upholding the Meridian Values and Meridian Code of Conduct, which form the foundation of our policies and practices. We continue to expand our Human Resources Information System (“HRIS”) and other systems to track key human capital metrics, including workforce demographics, diversity, turnover, engagement and training data. 
 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
 A diverse and inclusive workforce is a business imperative and key to our long-term success. To champion our efforts in this area, we have recently initiated the “One Meridian Inclusion Diversity and Equity Team,” which is comprised of a group of employees around the world and led by Dr. Lourdes Weltzien, Executive Vice President, Life Science. This team will be developing a mission and a strategy that will look to identify gaps and present suggestions on how we can encourage and enforce an environment in which all employees feel included and empowered to achieve their best. Though we are proud of our efforts in these areas to date, we realize that the voice and ongoing feedback of this newly established team is critical for Meridian to achieve its full potential. 
Compensation and Benefits 
 We strive to provide pay, benefits, and services that are competitive to market and create incentives to attract and retain employees globally. Our compensation package includes market-competitive pay, broad-based stock grants and bonuses, health care and retirement benefits, paid time off and family leave, among others, depending upon locale. We are focused on pay equity globally and are striving to close the gap in pay among similar roles and responsibilities throughout our organization, after accounting for legitimate business factors that can explain differences, such as performance, time at grade level, and tenure. We also continue to advance transparency in our pay and representation data by complying with all applicable statutory filing requirements. 
Communication and Engagement 
 We strongly believe that Meridian’s success depends on employees understanding how their work contributes to the Company’s overall strategy. To this end, we utilize a variety of channels to facilitate open and direct communication, including: (i) quarterly CEO update videos; (ii) open forums or town hall meetings with executives; (iii) regular ongoing update communications; and (iv) employee engagement surveys.
