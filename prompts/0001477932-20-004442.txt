ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Overview

China VTV Limited (the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada, originally under the name T-Bamm, on February 19, 2015. The Company has conducted limited business operations and has had no revenues from operations since its inception. The Company was organized to sell Bamboo T-Shirts over the internet. On February 9, 2018, the Company changed its name from T-Bamm to “China VTV Limited”. 

On March 15, 2019, the Company and Mr. Guoping Chen, the then Principal Executive Officer and President of the Company, entered into a share exchange agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) with China VTV Ltd. (“China VTV”), a Hong Kong company, and all of the shareholders of China VTV ( “China VTV Shareholders”), pursuant to which the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of China VTV from the China VTV Shareholders by issuing an aggregate of 110,550,000 restricted shares of common stock of the Company (the “Stock Exchange”) to China VTV Shareholders pro rata upon closing of the Stock Exchange. Upon closing of the Stock Exchange, China VTV became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and China VTV Shareholders collectively owned approximately 51.29% of the then issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock on a fully diluted basis. As a result of the Stock Exchange, the Company and its operational subsidiaries primarily engaged in broadcasting news, videos, television shows, tourists’ programs and other entertainment programs via the over-the-top (the “OTT”) platform over the internet. We disclosed such transaction in a current report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) on March 21, 2019, which is incorporated herein by reference. 

On December 18, 2019, the Company, VTV Global Culture Media (Beijing) Co., Ltd., a Chinese wholly foreign owned entity and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“WFOE”), Butterfly Effect Culture Media (Beijing) Co., Ltd., a corporation formed under the laws of China (the “Butterfly Effect”) and each and all of the shareholders of Butterfly Effect Media (each, a “Target Shareholder”, and collectively, “Target Shareholders”) entered into a business acquisition agreement (the “Acquisition Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company through its WFOE agreed to acquire Butterfly Effect Media through a series of management agreements (the “VIE Agreements”) to effectively control and own Butterfly Effect Media (the “Acquisition”). In accordance with the Acquisition Agreement, in consideration for the effective control over Butterfly Effect Media, the Company issued an aggregate of 24,000,000 shares of its common stock (the “Common Stock”), par value $0.001 per share, at the stipulated price of $4.00 per share (the “Stock Consideration”) without respect of the stock price at which the Common Stock trades, to the Target Shareholders in accordance with the percentage (the “Target Shareholder Equity Percentage”) listed on Schedule A as set forth in the Acquisition Agreement. In addition, subject to the terms and conditions in the Acquisition Agreement, the Company and its subsidiaries agreed to pay a total of RMB 288,000,000 (the “Cash Consideration”) to the Target Shareholders pro rata with the Target Shareholder Equity Percentage over a period of time as set forth therein.

On February 24, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition transaction of Butterfly Effect Media contemplated under the Acquisition Agreement dated December 18, 2019, as amended, pursuant to which the Company effectively controls Butterfly Effect Media via a series of variable interest entity Agreements. Butterfly Effect Media is a literature and media company that devotes to literary adaptation to another medium, such as television shows, movies, audible books or video games. Butterfly Effect Media’s business chain starts from composing books or scripts, licensing copyrights, producing moving pictures or video games to eventually distributing the moving pictures, audio products and video games on the internet. With the addition of Butterfly Effect Media, we expanded our internet media platform business into the content production business and hope that our Blockchain cloud-based platform and the content production business may benefit from each other, although there is no assurance of any of such benefits or advantages. 

Through mergers and acquisitions, we have become an internet-based online entertainment media company with focuses on audience interaction, entertainment and business opportunities. The Company’s goal is to build a dream for young entertainment people and create entertainment value for audience. As of the date of this annual report, the Company primarily distributes news, produces moving pictures, trades copyrights, and produces video games.

As of the date of this annual report, the Company has established a functioning Blockchain cloud-based platform which distributes news, videos, television shows, travel programs and other entertainment programs via internet to the end devices (the “End Devices”), such as computers, smart TVs, smart phones and tablets.

The Company has engaged Xin Mei Culture Distribution Co., Ltd.

Later the Company and Xin Mei Technology mutually agreed to terminate the OTT Development Agreement due to changes to the Company’s business needs. On December 31, 2018, the Company and Xin Mei Technology entered into a termination agreement, pursuant to which Xin Mei ceased its maintenance services to the Company’s OTT platform on December 31, 2018 and also waived the Company’s obligation to pay the balance of service fee balance of RMB 16,000,000 in cash or the Company’s common stock. 

In addition, the new CTO of the Company and the engineers at CybEye Image, Inc.

Intellectual Property

We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology and brand names. Monitoring unauthorized use of our products and brands is difficult and costly, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology and brand names, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. From time to time, we may have to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources.

In addition, third parties may initiate litigation against us alleging infringement of their proprietary rights. In the event of a successful claim of infringement and our failure or inability to develop non-infringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely basis, our business could be harmed. In addition, even if we are able to license the infringed or similar technology, license fees could be substantial and may adversely affect our results of operations.

The Company and its strategic partner CybEye have developed a new software system for the blockchain cloud-based platform. The Company may register any copyrights related to the blockchain cloud-based platform. 

As of the date of this annual report, the Company, through Butterfly Effect Media, owned various copyrights to approximately 49 original stories, including the right to adapt the original stories to audible books, TV shows, movies, or video games and market and distribute online or offline the adapted contents.
