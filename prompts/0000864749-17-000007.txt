In 2016, we launched a next-generation survey instrument, the Trimble SX10 Scanning Total Station, which merges high-speed 3D scanning, enhanced Trimble VISION imaging technology and high-accuracy total station measurements into familiar field and office workflows for surveyors. We also launched Trimble® Catalyst, a software-defined Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver that works with select Android mobile handhelds, smartphones and tablets, which, when combined with a small, lightweight, plug-and-play digital antenna and subscription to the Catalyst service, provides on-demand GNSS, geo-location capabilities to transform consumer devices into high-accuracy mobile data collection systems.
We sell and distribute our products in the Engineering and Construction segment through multiple global networks of independent dealers with expertise and customer relationships in their respective segments, each supported by Trimble personnel. In 2016, the network of SITECH Technology Dealers, which serves the civil construction industry, expanded to 111 dealers worldwide across all regions, including the Americas, Europe, Middle East, Africa, Asia, China, and the South Pacific. We also made significant progress during the year with BuildingPoint, an initiative to form a global network of distribution partners to serve the needs of the building construction industry. 
Competitors in this segment are typically companies that provide optical, laser or GNSS positioning products as well as companies that produce software specific to the construction process. Our principal competitors are Topcon Corporation, Hexagon AB and Autodesk. We compete principally on the basis of innovative, differentiated products, service, quality and geographic reach.
Field Solutions
Our Field Solutions segment primarily addresses the agriculture and geographic information systems (GIS) markets.
Agriculture. Our precision agriculture products consist of guidance and positioning systems, automated application systems and information management solutions that enable farmers and their partners to improve crop performance, profitability and environmental quality. Trimble precision agriculture solutions can assist farmers throughout every step of their farming process, beginning with land preparation and continuing through the planting, nutrient and pest management, and harvesting phases of a crop cycle. We provide manual and automated navigation guidance for tractors and other farm equipment used in spraying, planting, cultivating, and harvesting applications. The benefits to the farmer include faster machine operation, higher yields, and lower consumption of fuel and chemicals than conventional equipment. In addition, we provide solutions to automate application of pesticide and seeding. Our water solutions help farmers minimize their water costs and distribute water more efficiently, and include applications for leveling agricultural fields for irrigation, aligning drainage systems to better manage water flow in fields, and controlling water application in linear and pivot irrigation systems.
During 2016, we continued to develop our precision agriculture portfolio. We expanded our portfolio of Android-based display with the introduction of the MMX-070 tablet and continued to add more applications to our in-field mobile environment. We launched Vertical RTK, a grade control system for agriculture, which enables land improvement contractors to reduce downtime and costly delays by significantly enhancing vertical accuracy and stability of single baseline RTK systems. In the water management area, we released an industry-first technology for irrigation called Irrigate-IQ optimal flow. This technology enables farmers to utilize no-spray areas on center pivot irrigation systems that do not have a variable frequency drive pump, while keeping the pressure regulated across the pivot. Now, farmers who were unable to change the application across the pivot due to pumping equipment limitations can benefit from using no spray areas to focus water where it is needed, without the risk of damage due to significant pressure changes. In addition to Irrigate-IQ optimal flow, we also launched Irrigate-IQ uniform corner which enables farmers to apply a consistent application in areas covered by the corner arm. The solution utilizes individual nozzle control to minimize gaps and overlaps that are typically seen in traditional corner arm systems. As a result, farmers can extend the capabilities of their current corner arm by optimizing water use and preventing over- or under-watering.
Solutions which use data to enhance farm productivity are an increasing focus in our agriculture business. In 2016, we consolidated a number of Trimble Agriculture's software brands and platforms into a single Trimble Ag Software solution. This integrated solution is designed to not only help farmers seeking solutions to integrate all of the information on the farm, but where advisors, suppliers, and purchasers can share information to improve efficiencies. Trimble Ag Software enables a chain of custody where the farm can pass critical food safety and sustainability information to processors, distributors and ultimately to consumers who 
9

seek transparency. Acquired in 2015, Agri-Trend’s Professional Agricultural Coaching services help farmers allocate scarce resources to produce a safe, reliable, and profitable food supply in an environmentally sustainable manner. The combination of our software platform and the coaching advisory services enables farmers to make more informed decisions leading to higher yields, better quality crops, increased profitability, and reduced environmental impact. Trimble Ag Software and Agri-Trend Coaching services are available in many locations including within our Vantage distribution channel.
In the course of 2016, we continued to add third-party applications to our Android-based TMX-2050 display platform, enabling customers to view more complete data from multiple industry software platforms and machines, in addition to the wide range of applications Trimble already offers.
We use multiple distribution approaches to access the agricultural market, including independent dealers and direct selling to enterprise accounts. A significant portion of our sales are through CNH Global and affiliated dealer networks. During 2016 we expanded our Vantage global distribution channel. Vantage distributors provide a premier level of technical expertise, customer service and support capabilities and operate with a strategy that fosters technology interoperability in mixed fleets used on a farm. Vantage partners are committed to providing reliable, responsive and dedicated infield service and support as well as creating a hassle free experience for the grower and their advisors when implementing advanced technology solutions. They also provide training so farmers and advisors have a better understanding of how to use the technology in a way that best meets their farming needs. We currently have Vantage partners in over 12 countries across 4 continents. Competitors in this market are vertically integrated farm equipment and implement companies such as John Deere and agricultural instrumentation companies such as Raven and Ag Junction. As we expand our business in agronomic services and data oriented applications, we expect to increasingly compete with major input suppliers such as Monsanto. We compete principally on the basis of robust performance, ease of use, price, interoperability, interconnectedness and the completeness of our solutions.
Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Our GIS product line collects authoritative field data and integrate that data into GIS databases. Our handheld data collection systems allow users to quickly log positions and descriptive information about their assets, ensure the integrity and accuracy of GIS information and ultimately, enable better decision-making. Through a combination of wireless technologies and software solutions, fieldwork results are seamlessly delivered to the back-office GIS, and mobile workers can also access GIS information remotely. This capability provides significant advantages to users including improved productivity, accuracy and access to information in the field.
Primary markets for our GIS products and solutions include both governmental and commercial users. Distribution for GIS products is primarily through a network of independent dealers and business partners, supported by Trimble personnel. Competitors in this market are typically survey instrument companies utilizing GNSS technology such as Topcon and Leica. We compete principally on the basis of robust performance, ease of use, price, interoperability and interconnectedness.

11

Competition 
Our markets are highly competitive and we expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase in the future. Within our markets, we encounter direct competition from other GNSS, software, optical and laser suppliers such as Hexagon and Topcon, and competition may intensify from various larger U.S. and non-U.S. competitors. Our hardware products are increasingly subject to competition from existing and new entrants from emerging markets such as China, which compete aggressively on price at the lower priced end of the market. Our integrated hardware and software products may also be subject to increasing competition from mass market devices such as smartphones and tablets combined with relatively inexpensive applications, which have not been heavily used for commercial applications in the past. 
Many of our products and solutions are focused on specific industries. In each of these industries we face competition from companies providing point solutions or more traditional, less technology intensive products and services, and these companies often have greater financial resources and more established and recognized brands in those industries. Competing in vertical markets with more established industry participants requires that we successfully establish a market position and market new and sometimes unfamiliar technology and automated solutions to customers that have not previously used such products. We also increasingly offer enterprise level solutions designed to meet the specific needs of our target industries. In doing so, we face competition from larger and more well established providers of enterprise software and services with whom we have not previously competed. See also "Risk Factors - We face substantial competition in our markets which could decrease our revenue and growth rates or impair our operating results and financial condition."
Sales and Marketing
We tailor our distribution to the needs of our products and regional markets around the world. Many of our products are sold worldwide primarily through indirect channels, including distributors, dealers and authorized representatives. Occasionally we grant exclusive rights to market certain products, or within specific countries. These channels are supported by our regional sales offices throughout the world. We also utilize distribution alliances, OEM relationships, and joint ventures with other companies as a means to serve selected markets, as well as direct sales to end-users.
During fiscal 2016, sales to customers in the United States represented 49%, Europe represented 24%, Asia Pacific represented 15%, and other regions represented 12% of our total revenue. 
Seasonality of Business 
Construction purchases tend to occur in early spring, and U.S. governmental agencies tend to utilize funds available at the end of the government’s fiscal year for additional purchases at the end of our third fiscal quarter in September of each year. Our agricultural equipment business revenues have historically been the highest in the first quarter, followed by the second quarter, reflecting buying in anticipation of the spring planting season in the Northern hemisphere. However, overall as a company, as a result of diversification of our business across segments and the increased impact of subscription revenues, we may experience less seasonality in the future. Changes in global macroeconomic conditions could also impact the level of seasonality we experience.
Backlog
In most of our markets, the time between order placement and shipment is short. Orders are generally placed by resellers and customers on an as-needed basis. In general, customers may cancel or reschedule orders without penalty. For these reasons, we do not believe that backlog is a meaningful indicator of future revenue or material to understanding our business.
Manufacturing
We outsource the manufacturing of many of our hardware products to our key contract manufacturing partners that include Flextronics International Limited, Benchmark Electronics Inc. and Jabil. Our contract manufacturing partners are responsible for significant material procurement, assembly and testing. We continue to manage product design through pilot production for the subcontracted products, and we are directly involved in qualifying suppliers and key components used in all our products. Our current contract with Flextronics continues in effect until either party gives the other ninety days written notice. We also utilize original design manufacturers for some of our products.
We manufacture our laser and optics-based products, as well as some of our GPS products, at our plants in Dayton, Ohio; Danderyd, Sweden and Shanghai, China. Some of these products or portions of these products are also subcontracted to third parties for assembly.
12

Our design manufacturing and distribution sites in Dayton, Ohio; Sunnyvale, California; Danderyd, Sweden; Eersel, Netherlands, Auckland, New Zealand​ and Shanghai, China are registered to ISO9001:20​15, covering the design, production, distribution, and servicing of all our products.
Research and Development
We believe that our competitive position is maintained through the development and introduction of new products, including software and services, that incorporate improved features and functionality, better performance, smaller size and weight, lower cost, or some combination of these factors. We invest substantially in the development of new products. We also make significant investment in the positioning, communication and information technologies that underlie our products and will likely provide competitive advantages.
We expect to continue investing in research and development at a rate consistent with our past, with the goal of maintaining or improving our competitive position, and entering new markets.
Employees
At the end of fiscal 2016, we employed 8,388 employees, with approximately 55% of employees in locations outside the United States.
Some employees in Sweden and Finland are represented by unions. Some employees in Germany and France are represented by works councils. We also employ temporary and contract personnel that are not included in the above headcount numbers. We have not experienced work stoppages or similar labor actions.
