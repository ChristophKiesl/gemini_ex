 Item 1. Business
General
In this annual report in Form 10-K, except as otherwise indicated, the terms:
 “Company,” "we," "us," "our," “BlackRock Capital” and “Registrant” refer to BlackRock Capital Investment Corporation.
 The “Advisor” or “BCIA” refers to BlackRock Capital Investment Advisors, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and the investment manager; and “Administrator” refers to BlackRock Financial Management, Inc., an affiliate of the Advisor and administrator of the Company.
 We were incorporated on April 13, 2005, commenced operations with private funding on July 25, 2005, and completed our initial public offering on July 2, 2007. We are an externally-managed, non-diversified closed-end management investment company. We have elected to be regulated as a business development company (“BDC”) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”). In addition, for tax purposes we intend to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”). As a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. See “Regulation” for discussion of BDC regulation and other regulatory considerations. We are also registered as an investment advisor under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, which we refer to as the “Advisers Act.”
The Company has elected to be treated as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a RIC, we will not be taxed on our income to the extent that we distribute such income each year and satisfy other applicable income tax requirements.
 The Company’s investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. We invest primarily in middle-market companies in the form of senior debt securities and loans, and our investment portfolio may include junior

secured and unsecured debt securities and loans, each of which may include an equity component. Our strategy is to provide capital to meet our clients’ current and future needs across this spectrum, creating long-term partnerships with growing middle-market companies.
 The Advisor
 Our investment activities are managed by the Advisor. Our advisor, a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, including but not limited to the Advisor, “BlackRock”), is a Delaware limited liability company registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) as an investment advisor under the Advisers Act. BlackRock is a leading publicly traded investment management firm with $8.6 trillion of assets under management (“AUM”) at December 31, 2022. BlackRock has substantial investment and portfolio management experience, which we believe is beneficial to the Company and our stockholders. As part of the BlackRock platform, we continue to seek to enhance the risk-return profile of the Company, strengthen its distribution paying capacity and optimize the valuation for our shareholders.
 Our investment activities are carried out by the Advisor, which is led by James E. Keenan, Interim Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and the BlackRock US Private Capital Group’s Investment Committee (the “Investment Committee”). The voting members of the Investment Committee of the Company are currently James E. Keenan, Jason A. Mehring, R. Marshall Merriman Jr., Rajneesh Vig, Nik Singhal, and Philip M. Tseng.
Market Opportunity
We believe that current market conditions present opportunities for investment in middle-market companies with attractive risk-adjusted returns for several reasons, including:
Middle-market companies have faced increased difficulty in accessing the capital markets. While many middle-market companies were able to raise funds by raising debt in the capital markets in the past, we believe this approach to financing has become more difficult, as transactions have increased in size to address investors’ demands for greater liquidity in securities such as high yield bonds. In addition, we believe that many senior lenders have, in recent years, de-emphasized their service and product offerings to middle-market businesses in favor of lending to large corporate clients and managing large, liquid capital markets transactions.
There is a large pool of uninvested private equity capital likely to seek additional capital to support private investments. We believe there is a large pool of uninvested private equity capital available to middle-market companies. We expect that private equity firms will be active investors in middle-market companies and that these private equity firms will seek to supplement their equity investments with senior secured and junior loans and equity co-investments from other sources, such as us.
Middle-market companies are increasingly seeking private sources for debt and equity capital. We believe that many middle-market companies prefer to execute transactions with private capital providers such as us, rather than execute high-yield bond or equity transactions in the public markets, which may necessitate increased financial and regulatory compliance and reporting obligations.
Consolidation among commercial banks has reduced the focus on middle-market business. We believe that many senior lenders have de-emphasized their service and product offerings to middle-market companies in favor of lending to large corporate clients, managing capital markets transactions and providing other non-credit services to their customers.
Competitive Advantages
We believe we possess the following competitive advantages over other capital providers to middle-market companies:
 The BlackRock Platform: Our investment activities are carried out by the Advisor, a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of BlackRock. BlackRock is a leading publicly traded investment management firm with $8.6 trillion of AUM at December 31, 2022. With employees in more than 30 countries, BlackRock provides a broad range of investment and risk management services to institutional and retail clients worldwide. We believe our affiliation with BlackRock provides us with access to one of the deepest, broadest investment platforms in the financial services industry, with strategies across asset classes and investment styles all backed by our industry leading technology and risk management. BlackRock’s platform provides our investment professionals with market, company and industry insights that enhances our investment and due diligence processes.
 Acquisition and Integration of Tennenbaum Capital Partners, LLC (“TCP”): In August 2018, BlackRock completed the acquisition of TCP, a leading investment manager focused on middle market performing credit and special situations credit opportunities. We believe that the acquisition of TCP and integration of its operations has benefited the Company through increased deal flow and added industry-specific expertise, along with providing a more holistic financing solution to our borrowers. As part of the integration, three of TCP’s principals joined the Investment Committee as voting members who brought vast experience and expertise in direct lending. Following the integration, our combined platform increased in scale and capabilities, which we believe helped and continues to help to add value for stockholders.
 Demonstrated ability to deploy capital consistent with our investment policies. Since our inception, we have invested in excess of $5.7 billion across 324 portfolio companies through December 31, 2022. We have a debt and income producing equity yield at fair value of approximately 12.0% at December 31, 2022. During 2022, we invested approximately $231.5 million of gross assets.

Proven transaction sourcing strategy. Since the inception of operations, we have sourced and reviewed more than 6,700 potential investments and have a proven process through which we have invested in excess of $5.7 billion through December 31, 2022. The Advisor identifies potential investments through its dynamic transaction origination efforts. The origination efforts include calling on financial institutions such as investment banks, commercial banks, specialty finance companies and private equity firms; as well as on advisory firms, trade associations and the owners and managers of middle-market companies with whom the investment professionals and Investment Committee members have relationships. We expect that our ability to leverage these relationships will continue to result in the referral of investment opportunities to us and provide us with a competitive advantage.
Highly experienced investment team. Since April 2018, our investment activities have been carried out by our Advisor, which is led by James E. Keenan, Interim Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and the Investment Committee. The voting members of the Investment Committee of the Company are currently James E. Keenan, Jason A. Mehring, R. Marshall Merriman Jr., Rajneesh Vig, Nik Singhal and Philip M. Tseng. The investment professionals, as well as members of the Investment Committee, have extensive experience in fixed income, public equity and private equity investing, and possess a broad range of transaction, financial, managerial and investment skills.
Our executive officers and directors and the employees of BlackRock and certain of its affiliates, as well as members of the Investment Committee, serve or may serve as investment advisors, officers, directors or principals of entities or investment funds that operate in the same or a related line of business as we do and/or investment funds managed by our affiliates. We note that any affiliated investment vehicle currently formed or formed in the future and managed or to be managed in the future by the Advisor or its affiliates may have overlapping investment objectives with our own and, accordingly, may invest in asset classes similar to those targeted by us. As a result, the Advisor or its affiliates may face conflicts in allocating investment opportunities between us and such other entities. Accordingly, we may not be given the opportunity to participate in certain investments made by investment funds managed by the Advisor or its affiliates. However, the Advisor and its affiliates will endeavor to allocate investment opportunities in a fair and equitable manner and consistent with applicable allocation procedures. In any such case, if the Advisor forms other affiliates in the future, we may co-invest on a concurrent basis with such other affiliates, subject to compliance with applicable regulations and regulatory guidance, as well as applicable allocation procedures. In certain circumstances, negotiated co-investments may be made only if we receive an order from the SEC permitting us to do so. While our ability to enter into transactions with our affiliates is restricted under the 1940 Act, we have received an exemptive order from the SEC permitting certain affiliated investments subject to certain conditions.
Disciplined investment process with focus on preservation of capital. In making investment decisions, the Advisor employs a disciplined and selective review process that focuses on, among other things, a thorough analysis of the underlying issuer’s business and the performance drivers of that business, as well as an assessment of the legal and economic features of each particular investment.
Cost-effective and high-quality infrastructure. We benefit from the existing infrastructure and administrative capabilities of the Administrator. For providing these services, facilities and personnel, we reimburse the Administrator for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the administration agreement.
Operating and Regulatory Tax Structure
Our investment activities are managed by the Advisor and supervised by our Board of Directors, a majority of whom are independent of us, the Advisor and our affiliates. The Advisor is registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. Under our investment management agreement, we have agreed to pay the Advisor an annual base management fee (the “Management Fee”) based on our total assets, as well as an incentive management fee (the “Incentive Fee”) based on our performance. The investment management agreement also provides that we will reimburse the Advisor for costs and expenses incurred by the Advisor for administrative or operating services, office space rental, office equipment and utilities allocable to the Advisor under the investment management agreement, as well as any costs and expenses incurred by the Advisor relating to any non-investment advisory, administrative or operating services provided by the Advisor to the Company.
The Company elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a RIC under the Code. As a RIC, the Company generally does not have to pay corporate-level federal income taxes on any net ordinary income or capital gain that we distribute to our stockholders as dividends if we meet certain source-of-income, distribution and asset diversification requirements. The Company has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. As a BDC we are required to invest at least 70% of our total assets primarily in securities of private and certain public U.S. companies (other than investment companies and certain financial institutions), cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Government securities, and other high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less and to comply with other regulatory requirements, including limitations on our use of debt. Further, BDCs must maintain an asset coverage ratio (the ratio of total assets less total liabilities other than indebtedness to total indebtedness) of not less than 150% (200% prior to May 2, 2020) in order to incur debt or issue senior securities, meaning generally that for every dollar of debt incurred or senior securities issued, we must have one dollar and fifty cents of assets. Our existing debt arrangements also require that we maintain an asset coverage ratio of not less than 150% (200% prior to May 2, 2020), among other things.
Investment Strategy
 Our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through our debt and equity investments. We invest primarily in middle-market companies and target investments that we believe provide an attractive risk-adjusted return. The term “middle-market” refers to companies with enterprise value typically between $100 million and $1.5 billion. Our targeted investment typically ranges between $5 million and $20 million, although the investment sizes may be more or less than the targeted range and the size of our investments

may grow with our capital availability. We generally seek to invest in companies that operate in a broad variety of industries and that generate positive cash flow.
Although most of our new investments are in senior secured loans to primarily U.S. private middle-market companies, our investment portfolio may include junior secured, unsecured and subordinated loans, common and preferred equity, options and warrants, credit derivatives, high-yield bonds, distressed debt and other structured securities. We may from time to time invest up to 30% of our assets opportunistically in other types of investments, including securities of other public companies and foreign securities.
The senior and junior secured loans in which we invest generally have stated terms of three to ten years and the subordinated debt investments we make generally have stated terms of up to ten years, but the expected average life of such senior and junior secured loans and subordinated debt is generally between three and seven years. However, we may invest in securities of any maturity or duration. The debt that we invest in typically is not initially rated by any rating agency, but we believe that if such investments were rated, they would be below investment grade (rated lower than “Baa3” by Moody’s Investors Service, lower than “BBB-” by Fitch Ratings or lower than “BBB-” by Standard & Poor’s). We may invest without limit in debt of any rating, as well as debt that has not been rated by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization.
Investment Portfolio
 At December 31, 2022, our investment portfolio of $570.5 million (at fair value) consisted of 116 portfolio companies and was invested 98% in debt investments, primarily in senior secured debt. In aggregate, our investment portfolio was invested 94% in senior secured loans, 4% in unsecured or subordinated debt securities, 2% in equity investments and less than 1% in senior secured notes. Our average portfolio company investment at amortized cost was approximately $5.7 million. Our largest portfolio company investment at fair value was approximately $24.8 million and our five largest portfolio company investments by value comprised approximately 14% of our portfolio at December 31, 2022. For further details on portfolio mix by industry and type, refer to Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements.
Investment Process
 The Advisor’s investment process is designed to maximize its strategic advantages: a strong brand name as a specialty lender to the middle-market and diverse in-house expertise and skills. The Advisor seeks out opportunities by conducting a rigorous and disciplined investment process that combines the following characteristics:
Deal Sourcing
 As a leading middle-market corporate debt investment manager with approximately $22.2 billion in committed capital as of December 31, 2022 (approximately 3% of which consists of the Company’s committed capital), the Advisor is active in new deal financing opportunities in the middle-market segment. However, we believe that the Advisor’s real deal flow advantage comes from the proprietary network of established relationships of its investment professionals and synergies among its professionals and portfolio companies. Members of the Advisor’s Investment Committee for the Company have long-term relationships with deal sources including investment bankers, restructuring professionals, bankruptcy attorneys, senior lenders, high yield bond specialists, research analysts, accountants, fund management teams, the Advisor’s advisory board, senior executive advisors, board members of former clients, former colleagues and other operating professionals to facilitate deal flow. The Investment Committee is currently comprised of six voting members. In total, the Investment Committee consists of approximately 64 members from the Advisor. The number of voting and non-voting members of the Investment Committee is subject to increase or decrease in the sole discretion of the Advisor. All members of the Investment Committee attend investment meetings and are encouraged to participate in discussions. In addition, members of the Investment Committee have relationships with other investors, including insurance companies, bond funds, mezzanine funds, private equity funds, hedge funds and other funds which invest in similar assets. Further, the Advisor regularly calls on both active and recently retired senior executives from the relevant industries to assist with the due diligence of potential investments. Historically, these relationships with retired senior executives have also been a valuable source of transactions and information. The Advisor anticipates that they will continue to provide future opportunities. We believe the Advisor’s strong relationships with its portfolio companies facilitate positive word-of-mouth recommendations to other companies seeking the Advisor’s expertise. The Advisor’s relationships often result in the ability to access investment opportunities earlier than many of its competitors and in some cases on an exclusive basis.
Due Diligence Process
 The foundation of the Advisor’s investment process is intensive investment research and analysis by its experienced staff of investment professionals. The Advisor’s senior professionals have worked together for numerous years and we believe that they have a superior level of credit investing knowledge relative to other credit investors. The Advisor supplements its in-house knowledge with industry experts, including CEO/CFO-level executives, with direct management experience in the industries under consideration. The Advisor prefers these industry experts to consultants because of the practical business advice that comes from having managed businesses. The Advisor rigorously and comprehensively analyzes issuers of securities of interest. The process includes a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the issuer’s business, an evaluation of its management, an analysis of the business strategy and industry trends, and an in-depth examination of the company’s capital structure, financial results and projections. The Advisor’s due diligence process includes:


•an assessment of the outlook for the industry and general macroeconomic trends;
 •discussions with issuer management and other industry executives, including the assessment of management/board strengths and weaknesses;
 •an analysis of the fundamental asset values and the enterprise value of the issuer;
 •review of the issuer’s key assets, core competencies, competitive advantages, historical and projected financial statements, capitalization, financial flexibility, debt amortization requirements, and tax, environmental, legal and regulatory contingencies;
 •review of the issuer’s existing credit documents, including credit agreements, indentures, intercreditor agreements, and security agreements; and
 •review of documents governing the issuer, including charter, by-laws, and key contracts.
 As a part of its due diligence process, the Advisor considers sustainability-related factors that can affect the future prospects of the issuer. Since sustainable investment options have the potential to offer better outcomes, the Advisor integrates sustainability considerations into the way it manages risk, constructs portfolios, designs products, and engages with companies.
 Structuring Originations
 As an early non-bank participant in the leveraged loan market, we believe that loan origination is a core competency of the Advisor. Supplementing industry deal teams’ experience and competency, the Advisor has a number of professionals with legal experience, including significant experience in bankruptcy and secured credit. Deal teams work with the Advisor’s in-house legal specialists and outside counsel to structure over-collateralized loans with what we believe to be strong creditor protections and contractual controls over borrower operations. In many cases, the Advisor works to obtain contractual governance rights and board observer seats to protect principal and maximize post-investment returns. Deals usually include original issue discounts, upfront fees, exit fees and/or equity participations through warrants or direct equity stakes.
Trading and Secondary Market Purchases
 A key element in maximizing investment returns in secondary purchases is buying and selling investments at the best available prices. The Advisor has a dedicated trading staff for both the highly specialized traded loan market and for high-yield bonds. Through its trading operations, the Advisor maintains its established relationships with a network of broker-dealers in the debt securities markets. These relationships provide the Advisor with access to the trading dynamics of existing or potential investments and assist it in effectively executing transactions. These relationships may also lead to the early identification of potential investment opportunities for the Company.
Portfolio Management & Monitoring
 The Advisor actively monitors the financial performance of its portfolio companies and market developments. This constant monitoring permits the Advisor to update position risk assessments, seek to address potential problems early, refine exit plans, and make follow-on investment decisions quickly. We view active portfolio monitoring as a vital part of our investment process.
 We consider board observation and information rights, regular dialogue with company management and sponsors, and detailed internally generated monitoring reports to be critical to our performance. We have developed a monitoring template that seeks to ensure compliance with these standards and that is used as a tool by the Investment Committee to assess investment performance relative to plan.
 •Deal teams maintain contact with portfolio company management through regularly scheduled and ad hoc conference calls and onsite visits.
 •Deal teams review portfolio company progress relative to plan and pre-determined performance benchmarks.
 •Adverse or unexpected developments, as well as consequential routine updates, are reported to the Investment Committee and thoroughly discussed at regularly scheduled weekly meetings. If merited, the Investment Committee will hold ad hoc meetings as necessary to address urgent issues.
 •Deal teams, with Investment Committee approval, encourage portfolio company managers to catalyze events to monetize holdings for greater return, or where needed, take corrective actions to address shortfalls to plan or benchmarks.
 •All existing portfolio holdings are formally reviewed in detail by the entire Investment Committee once per quarter at the Advisor’s quarterly portfolio review.
 Investment Committee and Decision Process
 The Advisor’s investment process is organized around the Investment Committee that provides for a centralized, repeatable decision process. The Investment Committee meets weekly and, with respect to each fund the Advisor advises, certain members of the Investment Committee are voting members. The voting members of the Investment Committee for the Company are currently James E. Keenan, Jason A. Mehring, R. Marshall Merriman, Jr., Rajneesh Vig, Nik Singhal, and Philip M. Tseng. Approval by a simple majority vote of the voting members of the Investment Committee is required for the purchase or sale of any investment. No voting member has veto power. The Advisor’s investment process is designed to maximize risk-adjusted returns and preserve downside protection.
Investment Rating System
The Advisor generally employs a grading system for our entire portfolio. The Advisor grades all loans on a scale of 1 to 4. This system is intended to reflect the performance of the borrower’s business, the collateral coverage of the loans and other factors considered relevant. Generally, the Advisor assigns only one loan grade to each portfolio company for all loan investments in that portfolio company; however, the Advisor will assign multiple ratings for different investments in one portfolio company, when appropriate. The following is a description of the conditions associated with each investment rating:
Grade 1: Investments in portfolio companies whose performance is substantially within or above the Advisor’s original base case expectations and whose risk factors are neutral to favorable to those at the time of the original investment or subsequent restructuring.
 Grade 2: Investments in portfolio companies whose performance is materially below the Advisor’s original base case expectations or risk factors have increased since the time of original investment or subsequent restructuring. No loss of investment return or principal (or invested capital) is expected.
 Grade 3: Investments in portfolio companies whose performance is materially below the Advisor’s original base case expectations or risk factors have increased materially since the time of original investment or subsequent restructuring. Some loss of investment return is expected, but no loss of principal (or invested capital) is expected.
Grade 4: Investments in portfolio companies whose performance is materially below the Advisor’s original base case expectations or risk factors have increased substantially since the time of original investment or subsequent restructuring. Some loss of principal (or invested capital) is expected.
 The Advisor monitors and, when appropriate, changes the investment ratings assigned to each investment in our portfolio. In connection with our valuation process, the Advisor and Board of Directors review these investment ratings on a quarterly basis. Our average investment rating was 1.33 at December 31, 2022 and 1.21 at December 31, 2021. The following is a distribution of the investment ratings of our portfolio companies at December 31, 2022 and 2021:
 

 | December 31,2022 | | December 31,2021 | 
Grade 1 | $ | 422,813,958 | | $ | 474,466,652
Grade 2 | | 117,689,506 | | | 49,356,296 
Grade 3 | | 9,675,397 | | | — 
Grade 4 | | 15,936,823 | | | 22,579,310 
Not Rated(1) | | 4,373,400 | | | 6,161,736 
Total investments | $ | 570,489,084 | | $ | 552,563,994

 
(1)Not Rated category at December 31, 2022 consists primarily of the Company’s residual equity investment in Stitch Holdings, L.P. Not Rated category at December 31, 2021 consists primarily of the Company’s residual equity investment in Stitch Holdings, L.P. and AGY Equity, LLC. For purposes of calculating our weighted average investment rating, the Not Rated category is excluded.
 The investment rating process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially evaluated by the investment team, led by a senior investment professional that is responsible for the portfolio company relationship. This evaluation generally is completed no less frequently than quarterly. At the Advisor’s periodic and timely meetings, the transaction team presents an update on the activities of any company rated below Grade 1. Each quarter, all investment professionals attend a separate investment rating meeting. At these quarterly meetings, the investment team responsible for each portfolio investment reviews each portfolio company and suggests a rating for each investment for discussion among the investment professionals.
 Regulation
 We have filed an election to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between BDCs and their affiliates (including any investment advisors or co-advisors), principal underwriters and affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters and requires that a majority of the directors be persons other than “interested persons,” as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a BDC unless approved by “a majority of our outstanding voting securities”, which is defined in the 1940 Act as the lesser of a majority of the outstanding voting securities or 67% or more of the securities voting if a quorum of a majority of the outstanding voting securities is present.
 We may invest up to 100% of our assets in securities acquired directly from issuers in privately negotiated transactions. With respect to such securities, we may, for the purpose of public resale, be deemed an “underwriter” as that term is defined in the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”), or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We do not intend to acquire securities issued by any investment company that exceed the limits imposed by the 1940 Act. Under these limits, except for registered money market funds we generally cannot acquire more than 3% of the voting stock of any investment company, invest more than 5% of the value of our total assets in the securities of one investment company or invest more than 10% of the value of our total assets in the securities of more than one investment company. With regard to that portion of our portfolio invested in securities issued by investment companies, it should be noted that such investments might indirectly subject our

stockholders to additional expenses as they will indirectly be responsible for the costs and expenses of such companies. None of our investment policies are fundamental and any may be changed without stockholder approval.
 Qualifying Assets
 Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the Company’s total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our proposed business are the following:
 •Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer which:
 ois organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the U.S.;
 ois not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly owned by the BDC) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and
 osatisfied either of the following:
 ▪has a market capitalization of less than $250.0 million or does not have any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange; or
 ▪is controlled by a BDC or a group of companies including a BDC, the BDC actually exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of the eligible portfolio company, and, as a result thereof, the BDC has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company.
 •Securities of any eligible portfolio company which we control.
 •Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements.
 •Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own 60% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company.
 •Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities.
 •Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment.
 Asset Coverage Requirement
 Under Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act, prior to March 23, 2018, a BDC was generally not permitted to issue senior securities unless after giving effect thereto the BDC met a coverage ratio of total assets, less liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities, to total senior securities, which includes all borrowings of the BDC, of at least 200%. On March 23, 2018, the Small Business Credit Availability Act (“SBCAA”) was signed into law, which among other things, amended Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act to add a new Section 61(a)(2) that reduces the asset coverage requirement applicable to BDCs from 200% to 150% so long as the BDC meets certain disclosure requirements and obtains certain approvals. The reduced asset coverage requirement permits a BDC to have a ratio of total outstanding indebtedness to equity of 2:1 as compared to a maximum of 1:1 under the 200% asset coverage requirement.
 In accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we were allowed to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage ratio, as defined in the 1940 Act, equaled at least 200% after such borrowing. Effective October 29, 2019, the Company's board of directors, including a “required majority” (as such term is defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our board of directors, approved the application of the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, as amended by the SBCAA (the “Asset Coverage Ratio Election”), which would have resulted (had the Company not received earlier stockholder approval) in our asset coverage requirement applicable to senior securities being reduced from 200% to 150%, effective on October 29, 2020. Effective on May 2, 2020, after obtaining stockholder approval at the annual meeting of the Company’s stockholders held on May 1, 2020, the Company’s asset coverage requirement was reduced from 200% to 150%.
 Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies
A BDC must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the U.S. and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described in “Qualifying assets” above. However, in order to count portfolio securities as qualifying assets for the purpose of the 70% test, the BDC must either control the issuer of the securities or must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities significant managerial assistance. Where the BDC purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, the BDC will satisfy this test if one of the other persons in the group makes available such managerial assistance, although reliance on other investors may not be the sole method by which the BDC satisfies the requirement to make available managerial assistance. Making available managerial assistance means, among other things, any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its investment manager, directors,

officers or employees, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company.
 Taxation of the Company
 We have elected to be taxed as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. To continue to qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, (a) derive in each taxable year at least 90 percent of our gross income from dividends, interest (including tax-exempt interest), payments with respect to certain securities loans, gains from the sale or other disposition of stock, securities or foreign currencies, other income (including but not limited to gain from options, futures and forward contracts) derived with respect to our business of investing in stock, securities or currencies, or net income derived from an interest in a “qualified publicly traded partnership” (a “QPTP”); and (b) diversify our holdings so that, at the end of each quarter of each taxable year (i) at least 50 percent of the market value of our total assets is represented by cash and cash items, U.S. Government securities, the securities of other RICs and other securities, with other securities limited, in respect of any one issuer, to an amount not greater than five percent of the value of our total assets and not more than 10 percent of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer (subject to the exception described below), and (ii) not more than 25 percent of the market value of our total assets is invested in the securities (other than U.S. Government securities and the securities of other regulated investment companies) (A) of any issuer, (B) of any two or more issuers that we control and that are determined to be engaged in the same business or similar or related trades or businesses, or (C) of one or more QPTPs. The Code provides for certain exceptions to the foregoing diversification requirements. We may generate certain income that might not qualify as good income for purposes of the 90% annual gross income requirement described above. We monitor our transactions to endeavor to prevent our disqualification as a RIC.
 If we fail to satisfy the 90% annual gross income requirement or the asset diversification requirements discussed above in any taxable year, we may be eligible for relief provisions if the failures are due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect and if a penalty tax is paid with respect to each failure to satisfy the applicable requirements. Additionally, relief is provided for certain de minimis failures of the asset diversification requirements where we correct the failure within a specified period. If the applicable relief provisions are not available or cannot be met, all of our income would be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax as described below. We cannot provide assurance that we would qualify for any such relief should we fail the 90% annual gross income requirement or the asset diversification requirements discussed above.
 As a RIC, in any taxable year with respect to which we timely distribute at least 90% of the sum of our (i) investment company taxable income (which includes, among other items, dividends, interest and the excess of any net short-term capital gain over net long-term capital loss and other taxable income (other than any net capital gain), reduced by deductible expenses) determined without regard to the deduction for dividends and distributions paid and (ii) net tax exempt interest income (which is the excess of our gross tax exempt interest income over certain disallowed deductions) (the “Annual Distribution Requirement”), we (but not our stockholders) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on investment company taxable income and net capital gain (generally, net long-term capital gain in excess of short-term capital loss) that we distribute to our stockholders. We intend to distribute annually all or substantially all of such income on a timely basis. To the extent that we retain our net capital gain for investment or any investment company taxable income, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate income tax rates. We may choose to retain our net capital gains for investment or any investment company taxable income, and pay the associated federal corporate income tax, including the federal excise tax described below.
 Certain amounts not distributed during a calendar year are subject to a nondeductible four percent U.S. federal excise tax payable by us. To avoid this tax, we would need to distribute (or be deemed to have distributed) during each calendar year an amount equal to the sum of:
 (1)at least 98 percent of our ordinary income (not taking into account any capital gains or losses) for the calendar year;
 (2)at least 98.2 percent of the amount by which our capital gains exceed our capital losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for a one-year period generally ending on October 31 of the calendar year (unless an election is made by us to use our taxable year); and
 (3)certain undistributed amounts from previous years on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax.
 While we intend to distribute any income and capital gains in the manner necessary to minimize imposition of the four percent federal excise tax, sufficient amounts of our taxable income and capital gains may not be distributed to avoid entirely the imposition of the tax. In that event, we will be liable for the tax only on the amount by which we do not meet the foregoing distribution requirement.
 If, in any particular taxable year, we do not satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement or otherwise were to fail to qualify as a RIC (for example, because we fail the 90% annual gross income requirement described above), and relief is not available as discussed above, all of our taxable income (including our net capital gains) will be subject to tax at regular corporate rates without any deduction for distributions to stockholders, and distributions generally will be taxable to the stockholders as ordinary dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits.
 We may decide to be taxed as a regular corporation even if we would otherwise qualify as a RIC if we determine that treatment as a corporation for a particular year would be in our best interests.
 As a RIC, we are permitted to carry forward a net capital loss to offset capital gain indefinitely. For net capital losses, the excess of our net short-term capital loss over our net long-term capital gain is treated as a short-term capital loss arising on the first day of our next taxable year and the excess of our net long-term capital loss over our net short-term capital gain is treated as a long-term capital loss arising on the first day of our next taxable year. If future capital gain is offset by carried forward capital losses, such future capital gain is not subject to fund-level U.S. federal income tax, regardless of whether they are distributed to stockholders. Accordingly, we do not expect to distribute any such offsetting capital gain. A RIC cannot carry back or carry forward any net operating losses.


Investment Structure
Once we determine that a prospective portfolio company is suitable for a direct investment, we work with the management of that company and its other capital providers, including senior and junior lenders, and equity holders, to structure an investment. We negotiate among these parties to agree on how our investment is expected to be structured relative to the other capital in the portfolio company’s capital structure.
Leveraged Loans
 We structure most of our new investments as secured leveraged loans. Leveraged loans are generally senior debt instruments that rank ahead of subordinated debt of the portfolio company. Leveraged loans generally have the benefit of security interests on the assets of the portfolio company, which may rank ahead of, or be junior to, other security interests.
 High-Yield Securities
 The Company’s portfolio currently includes high-yield securities and the Company may invest in high-yield securities in the future. The Company does not anticipate high-yield securities to be a significant part of its investment strategy. High-yield securities have historically experienced greater default rates than has been the case for investment grade securities and are generally rated below investment grade by one or more nationally recognized statistical rating organizations or will be unrated but of comparable credit quality to obligations rated below investment grade, and have greater credit and liquidity risk than more highly rated obligations. High-yield securities are generally unsecured and may be subordinate to other obligations of the obligor and are often issued in connection with leveraged acquisitions or recapitalizations in which the issuers incur a substantially higher amount of indebtedness than the level at which they had previously operated. The Company’s portfolio may also include mezzanine investments which are generally unsecured and rated below investment grade. Mezzanine investments of the type in which the Company invests in are primarily privately negotiated subordinated debt securities often issued in connection with leveraged transactions, such as management buyouts, acquisitions, re-financings, recapitalizations and later stage growth capital financings, and are generally accompanied by related equity participation features such as options, warrants, preferred and common stock. In some cases, our debt investments may provide for a portion of the interest payable to be paid in kind interest. To the extent interest is paid in kind, it will be payable through the increase of the principal amount of the obligation by the amount of interest due on the then-outstanding aggregate principal amount of such obligation.
 Warrants, Options and Equity Investments
 In some cases, we will also receive nominally priced warrants or options to buy a minority equity interest in the portfolio company in connection with a loan. As a result, if a portfolio company appreciates in value, we may achieve additional investment return from this equity interest. We may structure such warrants to include provisions protecting our rights as a minority-interest holder, as well as a “put,” or right to sell such securities back to the issuer, upon the occurrence of specified events. In many cases, we may also seek to obtain registration rights in connection with these equity interests, which may include demand and “piggyback” registration rights. Additionally, our portfolio may consist of preferred and common equity investments, which are typically made in conjunction with loans to portfolio companies in some cases. We may also receive equity as part of a restructuring.
Distressed Debt
 The Company’s portfolio currently includes certain distressed debt investments and the Company is authorized to continue to invest in the securities and other obligations of distressed and bankrupt issuers, including debt obligations that are in covenant or payment default. As of December 31, 2022, two of the Company’s debt investments and one preferred stock investment were on non-accrual status. The Company does not anticipate distressed debt to be a significant part of its investment strategy. Such investments generally trade significantly below par and are considered speculative. The repayment of defaulted obligations is subject to significant uncertainties. Defaulted obligations might be repaid only after lengthy workout or bankruptcy proceedings, during which the issuer might not make any interest or other payments. Typically such workout or bankruptcy proceedings result in only partial recovery of cash payments or an exchange of the defaulted obligation for other debt or equity securities of the issuer or its affiliates, which may in turn be illiquid or speculative.
Opportunistic Investments
 Opportunistic investments may include, but are not limited to, investments in debt securities of all kinds and at all levels of the capital structure and may include equity securities of public companies that are thinly traded, emerging market debt, structured finance vehicles such as collateralized loan obligation, or CLO, funds and debt of middle-market companies located outside the U.S. We do not intend such investments to be our primary focus.
 We tailor the terms of each investment to the facts and circumstances of the transaction and the prospective portfolio company, negotiating a structure that protects our rights and manages our risk while creating incentives for the portfolio company to achieve its business plan and improve its operating results. We seek to limit the downside potential of our investments by:
 •requiring a total return on our investments (including both interest and potential equity appreciation) that we believe will compensate us appropriately for credit risk;


•negotiating covenants in connection with our investments that afford our portfolio companies as much flexibility in managing their businesses as possible, consistent with the preservation of our capital. Such restrictions may include affirmative and negative covenants, default penalties, lien protection, change of control provisions and board rights, including either observation or rights to a seat on the board of directors under some circumstances; and
 •selecting investments that we believe have a very low probability of loss.
 We expect to hold most of our investments to maturity or repayment, but we may sell some of our investments earlier if a liquidity event occurs, such as a sale, recapitalization or worsening of the credit quality of the portfolio company.
 Competition
 A number of entities compete with us to make the types of investments that we make. We compete with other BDCs, public and private funds, commercial and investment banks, CLO funds, commercial financing companies, insurance companies, high yield investors and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity funds. Additionally, because competition for investment opportunities generally has increased among alternative investment vehicles, such as hedge funds, those entities have begun to invest in areas they have not traditionally invested in, including investments in middle-market companies. As a result of these new entrants, competition for investment opportunities at middle-market companies has intensified. Many of our existing and potential competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC or the restrictions that the Code imposes on us as a RIC.
Investment Management Agreement
At a special meeting of the Company’s stockholders, held on February 18, 2015, the Company’s stockholders approved a new investment management agreement between the Company and BlackRock Advisors, LLC (“BlackRock Advisors”) to permit BlackRock Advisors to serve as the Company’s investment adviser following the completion of the sale of certain assets related to managing the Company from the Previous Advisor, 52nd Street Capital Advisors LLC, formerly BlackRock Kelso Capital Advisors LLC. BlackRock Advisors is a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of BlackRock. The Transaction was completed on March 6, 2015 and, pursuant to the BlackRock Advisors Management Agreement, dated as of March 6, 2015, BlackRock Advisors began managing the Company’s investment activities. Prior to the consummation of the Transaction, the Company had entered into an investment management agreement with 52nd Street Capital Advisors LLC, the Company’s previous adviser.
On January 16, 2018, BlackRock Advisors assigned the BlackRock Advisors Management Agreement, dated March 6, 2015, to a wholly owned subsidiary, BCIA, the Advisor, pursuant to Rule 2a-6 of the 1940 Act and the Company entered into a new investment management agreement with BCIA (the “Previous Management Agreement”).
At the annual meeting of the Company’s stockholders, held on May 1, 2020, the Company’s stockholders approved, among other matters, a proposal to allow the Company to increase leverage by approving the application to the Company of a minimum asset coverage ratio of 150%, pursuant to Section 61(a)(2) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, to become effective on May 2, 2020. Effective at the same time, the Company and BCIA, the Advisor, amended and restated its previous investment management agreement to reduce the Management Fee and Incentive Fees as follows: (i) the Management Fee was reduced from 1.75% of total assets to 1.50% on total assets up to 200% of net asset value and 1.0% on total assets that exceed 200% of net asset value; (ii) the Incentive Fee based on net investment income was reduced from 20% over a 7% hurdle to 17.5% over a 7% hurdle; and (iii) the Incentive Fee based on net capital gains was reduced from 20% to 17.5% (the “Current Management Agreement”).
 The Current Management Agreement will be in effect from year-to-year if approved annually by the Board of Directors or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of outstanding voting securities, including, in either case, approval by a majority of the directors who are not interested persons. The Company’s Board of Directors approved the continuation of the Current Management Agreement on October 28, 2022.
 Management Fee
Under the Current Management Agreement, the Advisor, subject to the overall supervision of the Board, manages the day-to-day operations and provides the Company with investment advisory services. For providing these services, effective May 2, 2020, the Advisor receives a Management Fee at an annual rate of 1.50% of total assets up to 200% of net asset value (excluding cash and cash equivalents), including any assets acquired with the proceeds of leverage, payable quarterly in arrears based on the asset valuation as of the end of the prior quarter. Additionally, the Management Fee is calculated at 1.00% on assets that exceed 200% of net asset value of the Company. The Management Fee for any partial quarter is prorated.
 For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company incurred $8,311,686, $7,784,188 and $10,799,832, respectively, in Management Fees.

Incentive Fees
 (i)Quarterly Incentive Fee Based on Income
 The Current Management Agreement provides that the Advisor or its affiliates may be entitled to an Incentive Fee under certain circumstances. The Incentive Fee has two parts. The first portion is based on income other than capital gains and is calculated separately for each calendar quarter and will be paid on a quarterly basis. Effective May 2, 2020, the Incentive Fee based on income is calculated as follows:
•No Incentive Fee based on income other than capital gains for any calendar quarter in which the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed 1.75% (7.00% annualized) of net assets attributable to common stock at the beginning of such quarter. 
 •100% of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income in any calendar quarter with respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, for such calendar quarter, that exceeds 1.75% (7.00% annualized) of net assets attributable to common stock at the beginning of such quarter but is less than approximately 2.12% (8.48% annualized). 
 •17.5% of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, for any calendar quarter that exceeds approximately 2.12% (8.48% annualized) of net assets attributable to common stock at the beginning of such quarter. 
 Prior to May 2, 2020 (and since March 6, 2017), the Incentive Fee based on income was calculated as follows:
•No Incentive Fee based on income other than capital gains for any calendar quarter in which the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed 1.75% (7.00% annualized) of net assets attributable to common stock at the beginning of such quarter. 
 •100% of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income in any calendar quarter with respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, for such calendar quarter, that exceeds 1.75% (7.00% annualized) of net assets attributable to common stock at the beginning of such quarter but is less than approximately 2.19% (8.75% annualized). 
 •20% of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, for any calendar quarter that exceeds approximately 2.19% (8.75% annualized) of net assets attributable to common stock at the beginning of such quarter.
 The calculations described above will be appropriately prorated for any period of less than a quarter and adjusted for the net proceeds from any common stock issuances and the cost of any common stock repurchases during such quarter.
 The payment of any such Incentive Fee based on income otherwise earned by our Advisor will be deferred if, for the most recent four full calendar quarter period ending on or prior to the date such payment is to be made, the Annualized Rate of Return is less than 7.0% of net assets attributable to common stock at the beginning of such four quarter period as adjusted for the net proceeds from any common stock issuances and the cost of any common stock repurchases during such four full calendar quarter period, with any deferred Incentive Fees to be carried over for payment in subsequent quarterly calculation periods to the extent such payment can then be made in accordance with the investment management agreement.
For purposes of calculating the Incentive Fee, (i) “Annualized Rate of Return” is computed by reference to the sum of (i) the aggregate distributions to common stockholders for the period in question and (ii) the change in net assets attributable to common stock (before taking into account any Incentive Fees otherwise payable during such period); (ii) “net assets attributable to common stock” means total assets less indebtedness and preferred stock; and (iii) “Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income” means net investment income (as determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”)) accrued by the Company during the calendar quarter excluding any accruals for or payments in respect of the Incentive Fee.
For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company incurred $3,422,362, $249,385 and $6,304,333, respectively, in Incentive Fees based on income. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Advisor voluntarily waived Incentive Fees on income of $79,383, resulting in net Incentive Fees on income of $170,002. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Advisor waived Incentive Fees on income of $6,304,333, resulting in no net Incentive Fees on income for the period. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there was $3,403,349 and $170,002, respectively, of Incentive Fees payable based on income. The payment of Incentive Fee based on income of $3,403,349 at December 31, 2022 was deferred pursuant to the Incentive Fee deferral provision discussed above.
(ii)Annual Incentive Fee Based on Capital Gains
 The second portion of the Incentive Fee is based on capital gains and is calculated separately for each Annual Period. Effective May 2, 2020, our Advisor is entitled to receive an Incentive Fee based on capital gains for each Annual Period in an amount equal to 17.5% of the amount by which (1) net realized capital gains during the period, if any, exceeds (2) gross unrealized capital depreciation, if any, during the period. In calculating the portion of the Incentive Fee based on capital gains payable for any period, investments are accounted for on a security-by-security basis. In addition, the portion of the Incentive Fee based on capital gains is determined using the “period-to-period” method pursuant to which the portion of the Incentive Fee based on capital gains for any period will be based on realized capital gains for the period reduced by realized capital losses for the period and unrealized capital depreciation for the period. Prior to May 2, 2020 (and since March 6, 2017), the Incentive Fee on capital gains was calculated at an annual rate of 20%.
 The Company is required under GAAP to accrue an Incentive Fee on capital gains on a hypothetical liquidation basis, based upon net realized capital gains and unrealized capital appreciation and depreciation on investments held at the end of each period. The accrued Incentive Fee on capital gains assumes all unrealized capital appreciation and depreciation is realized in order to reflect an Incentive Fee on capital gains (if any) that would be payable at each measurement date, even though unrealized capital appreciation is not permitted to be considered in

determining the Incentive Fee on capital gains actually payable for each Annual Period under the Current Management Agreement. If such amount is positive at the end of the period, an Incentive Fee on capital gains is accrued equal to 17.5% of such amount, for periods ended after May 2, 2020 (or 20%, for periods ended prior to May 2, 2020), less the amount of any Incentive Fees on capital gains already accrued during the Annual Period. If the resulting calculation amount is negative, the accrual for GAAP in a given period may result in the reduction or reversal of Incentive Fee expense on capital gains previously accrued during the Annual Period.
 Incentive Fees on capital gains accrued (reversed) on a liquidation basis under GAAP for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $(1,544,569), $1,544,569 and zero, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the balance of accrued Incentive Fees on capital gains was zero and $1,544,569, respectively. However, as of December 31, 2021, no Incentive Fees on capital gains were realized and payable to the Advisor as of such date. There can be no assurance that unrealized capital appreciation and depreciation will be realized in the future, or that any accrued capital gains Incentive Fee will become payable under the Current Management Agreement. Incentive Fee amounts on capital gains actually paid by the Company will specifically exclude consideration of unrealized capital appreciation, consistent with requirements under the Advisers Act and the Current Management Agreement.
 For purposes of calculating the Incentive Fee based on capital gains, “Annual Period” means the period beginning on July 1 of each calendar year, including the calendar year prior to the year in which the investment management agreement became effective, and ending on June 30 of the next calendar year. Capital gains and losses are calculated using the difference between proceeds received and either (i) fair market value at the beginning of the Annual Period or (ii) cost for investments acquired during the Annual Period. In calculating whether the portion of the Incentive Fee based on capital gains is payable with respect to any period, the Company accounts for assets on a security-by-security basis. In addition, the Company uses the “period-to-period” method pursuant to which the portion of the Incentive Fee based on capital gains for any period is based on realized capital gains for the period reduced by realized capital losses and gross unrealized capital depreciation for the period. Based on current interpretations of Section 205(b)(3) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 by the SEC and its staff, the calculation of unrealized depreciation for each portfolio security over a period is based on the fair value of the security at the end of the period compared to the fair value at the beginning of the period. Incentive Fees earned in any of the periods described above are not subject to modification or repayment based upon performance in a subsequent period.
The following is a graphical representation of the calculation of the portion of the Incentive Fee based on income under the Current Management Agreement (since May 2, 2020).

Percentage of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income comprising Incentive Fee
  Examples of Incentive Fees Calculation
Example 1: Incentive Fee Based on Income(1)
 Formula
The formula for the portion of the Incentive Fee based on income for any quarter can be expressed as follows:
Incentive Fee with respect to Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income —
•When the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for such quarter exceeds 1.75%(2) but does not exceed 2.12% = 100% x (Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income – 1.75%) 
 •When the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for such quarter exceeds 2.12% = 100% x (2.12% – 1.75%) + 17.5% x (Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income – 2.12%) 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Annualized Rate of Return for the most recent four full calendar quarter period ending on or prior to the date such payment is to be made payment is less than 7.0% of the BDC’s net assets attributable to common stock at the beginning of such four quarter period, adjusted for the net proceeds from any common stock issuances and the cost of any common stock repurchases during the period, the payment of such Incentive Fee will be deferred until the earliest quarter such four full calendar quarter Annualized Rate of Return requirement is satisfied. “Annualized Rate of Return” in this context is computed by reference to the sum of (i) the aggregate distributions the BDC’s common stockholders during the period and (ii) the change in the BDC’s net asset value attributable to common stock prior to calculation of any income or capital gain Incentive Fees during the period and does not take into account changes in the market price of the BDC’s common stock.
Assumptions
•Management fee(3) = 0.375% 
 •Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.)(4) = 0.0625% 
 •After accounting for the distribution of income during each period, there is no change in the Company’s net assets
 
(1)The hypothetical amount of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income shown is based on a percentage of net assets attributable to common stock (defined as total assets less indebtedness and preferred stock). The example assumes that during the most recent four full calendar quarter period ending on or prior to the date the payment set forth in the example is to be made, the sum of (a) the BDC’s aggregate distributions to stockholders and (b) the BDC’s change in net assets attributable to common stock (defined as total assets less indebtedness and preferred stock) before taking into account any Incentive Fees accrued during the period, is at least 7.0% of the BDC’s net assets attributable to common stock (defined as total assets less indebtedness and preferred stock) at the beginning of such four quarter period (as adjusted for the net proceeds from any common stock issuances and the cost of any common stock repurchases during such four full calendar period). See Alternative 4 for an example of a failure to satisfy this assumption and Alternative 5 for an example of subsequent satisfaction of this assumption.
 (2)Represents quarterly percentage of the value of net assets attributable to common stock at the beginning of the quarter, adjusted for the net proceeds from any common stock issuances and the cost of any common stock repurchases during the quarter.
 (3)Represents quarterly portion of an annual base management fee of 1.5% of the value of total assets.
 (4)Expressed as a percentage of the value of net assets attributable to common stock at the beginning of the quarter, adjusted for the net proceeds from any common stock issuances and the cost of any common stock repurchases during the period. 


Alternative 1
 Additional Assumptions
 •Investment Income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 1.25%
 •Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income
 = (investment income - (management fee + other expenses))
= (1.25% - (0.375% + 0.0625%))
 = 0.8125%
 Conclusion
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed the Hurdle rate, therefore there is no Incentive Fee based on income.
Alternative 2
 Additional Assumptions
 •Investment Income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 2.40%
 •Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income 
 = (investment income – (management fee + other expenses))
 = (2.40% - (0.375% + 0.0625%))
= 1.9625%
 Determination of Incentive Fee
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for the quarter exceeds the Hurdle rate, therefore there is an Incentive Fee payable with respect to net income for the quarter.
•Incentive Fee Based on Income 
 = 100% x the lesser of (2.12% – 1.75%) AND (Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income – 1.75%) + the greater of 0% and 17.5% x (Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income – 2.12%)
 = 100% x (1.9625% – 1.75%) + 0%
= 100% x 0.2125%
 = 0.2125%
 Alternative 3
 Additional Assumptions
 •Investment Income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 3.50%
 •Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income 
 = (investment income – (management fee + other expenses))
 = (3.50% - (0.375% + 0.0625%))
= 3.0625%
 Determination of Incentive Fee
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for the quarter exceeds the Hurdle rate, therefore there is an Incentive Fee payable with respect to net income for the quarter.
•Income Based Incentive Fee 
 = 100% x the lesser of (2.12% – 1.75%) AND (Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income – 1.75%) + the greater of 0% AND 17.5% x (Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income – 2.12%)
 = 100% x (2.12% – 1.75%) + 17.5% x (3.0625% - 2.12%)
 = 0.37% + (17.5% × 0.9425%)
 = 0.37% + 0.165%


= 0.535%
 Alternative 4
 Additional Assumptions
 During most recently completed quarter (Q4):
 •Investment Income = 3.50%
 •Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income 
 = (investment income – (management fee + other expenses))
 = (3.50% - (0.375% + 0.0625%))
= 3.0625%
 During four quarter period ending with most recently completed quarter:
 •Q1 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income = 1.00%
 •Q2 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income = 1.00%
 •Q3 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income = 1.50%
 •All Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income is distributed during the period.
 •After accounting for the distribution of the net investment income during the period, there is no change in the BDC’s net assets during the period. 
 Determination of Incentive Fee
 During most recently completed quarter:
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for the quarter exceeds the Hurdle rate, therefore there is an Incentive Fee based on income payable for the quarter.
•Incentive Fee Based on Income
 = 100% x the lesser of (2.12% – 1.75%) AND (Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income – 1.75%) + the greater of 0% AND 17.5% x (Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income – 2.12%)
 = 100% x (2.12% – 1.75%) + 17.5% x (3.0625% – 2.12%)
 = 0.37% + 0.165%
 = 0.535%
 During four quarter period ending with most recently completed quarter:
 •Annualized Rate of Return(5) 
 = (Q1 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income + Q2 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income + Q3 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income + Q4 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income) + (BDC’s change in net assets attributable to common stock)
 = (1.00% + 1.00% + 1.50% + 3.0625%) + (0)
 = 6.5625%
 
(5)Annualized Rate of Return is measured before any calculation of Incentive Fees for income or capital gains. 
 Conclusion
 Although an Incentive Fee is payable for such quarter, because the Annualized Rate of Return over the four quarter period is less than 7.00%, the payment is deferred until the first quarter for which the Annualized Rate of Return over the four quarter period including such subsequent quarter equals or exceeds 7.00%.
Alternative 5
 Additional Assumptions
 During most recently completed quarter (Q4):
 •Investment Income = 4.00%
 •Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income 
 = (investment income – (management fee + other expenses)
= (4.00% - (0.375% + 0.0625%))
= 3.5625%
 During four quarter period ending with most recently completed quarter:
 •Q1 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income = 1.00%
 •Q2 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income = 1.50%
 •Q3 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income = 3.00%
 •All Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income is distributed during the period.
 •After accounting for the distribution of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income during the period, there is no change in the BDC’s net assets attributable to common stock during the period. 
 •Deferred income based Incentive Fee during the period = 0.60%
 Determination of Incentive Fee
 During most recently completed quarter:
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for the quarter exceeds the Hurdle rate, therefore there is an Incentive Fee based on income payable for the quarter.
•Incentive Fee Based on Income 
 = 100% x the lesser of (2.12% – 1.75%) AND (Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income – 1.75%) + the greater of 0% AND 17.5% x (Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income – 2.12%)
 = 100% x (2.12% – 1.75%) + 17.5% x (3.5625% – 2.12%)
 = 0.37% + 0.2524%
 = 0.6224%
 During four quarter period ending with most recently completed quarter:
 •Annualized Rate of Return(6)
= (Q1 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income + Q2 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income + Q3 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income + Q4 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income) + (BDC’s change in net assets attributable to common stock)
 = (1.00% + 1.50% + 3.00% + 3.50%) + (0)
 = 9.00%
 
(6)Annualized rate of return is measured before any calculation of Incentive Fees for income or capital gains. 
 Conclusion
 Both the current quarter income based Incentive Fee of 0.62% and the earlier deferred income based Incentive Fee of 0.60% are paid.
Example 2: Incentive Fee Based on Capital Gains
 Formula
The formula for the capital gains portion of the Incentive Fee for each July 1 through June 30 “Annual Period” can be expressed as follows:
Incentive Fee with respect to capital gains = 17.5% x (net realized capital gains to the extent in excess of gross unrealized capital depreciation)


Alternative 1
Assumptions
•Year 1: $20.0 million investment made in Company A (“Investment A”), and $30.0 million investment made in Company B (“Investment B”) 
 •Year 2: Investment A is sold for $50.0 million and fair value of Investment B determined to be $32.0 million 
 •Year 3: fair value of Investment B determined to be $25.0 million 
 •Year 4: Investment B sold for $31.0 million 
 Determination of Incentive Fee
 The capital gains portion of the Incentive Fee, if any, would be:
•Year 1: None (No sales transactions) 
 •Year 2: $5.25 million (17.5% multiplied by $30.0 million realized capital gains on sale of Investment A) 
 •Year 3: None
 •Year 4: $1.05 million (17.5% multiplied by $6.0 million realized capital gains on sale of Investment B) 
 Alternative 2
Assumptions
•Year 1: $20.0 million investment made in Company A (“Investment A”), $30.0 million investment made in Company B (“Investment B”) and $25.0 million investment made in Company C (“Investment C”) 
 •Year 2: Investment A sold for $50.0 million, fair value of Investment B determined to be $25.0 million and fair value of Investment C determined to be $25.0 million 
 •Year 3: fair value of Investment B determined to be $27.0 million and Investment C sold for $30.0 million 
 •Year 4: fair value of Investment B determined to be $35.0 million 
 •Year 5: Investment B sold for $20.0 million
 Determination of Incentive Fee
 The capital gains portion of the Incentive Fee, if any, would be:
•Year 1: None (No sales transactions) 
 •Year 2: $4.375 million (17.5% multiplied by $25.0 million ($30.0 million realized capital gains on Investment A less $5.0 million unrealized capital depreciation on Investment B)) 
 •Year 3: $0.875 million (17.5% multiplied by $5.0 million realized capital gains on Investment C)
 •Year 4: None (No sales transactions)
 •Year 5: None

 Portfolio Management
 Portfolio Manager Compensation Overview
 The discussion below describes the portfolio managers compensation as of December 31, 2022.
 BlackRock’s financial arrangements with its portfolio managers, its competitive compensation and its career path emphasis at all levels reflect the value senior management places on key resources. Compensation may include a variety of components and may vary from year to year based on a number of factors. The principal components of compensation include a base salary, a performance-based discretionary bonus, participation in various benefits programs and one or more of the incentive compensation programs established by BlackRock.
 Base compensation. Generally, portfolio managers receive base compensation based on their position with the firm.
 Discretionary Incentive Compensation. Discretionary incentive compensation is a function of several components: the performance of BlackRock, the performance of the portfolio manager’s group within BlackRock, the investment performance, including risk-adjusted returns, of the firm’s AUM or supervision by that portfolio manager relative to predetermined benchmarks, and the individual’s performance and contribution to the overall performance of these portfolios and BlackRock. In most cases, these benchmarks are the same as the benchmark or benchmarks against which the performance of the funds or other accounts managed by the portfolio managers are measured. Among other things, BlackRock’s Chief Investment Officers make a subjective determination with respect to each portfolio manager’s compensation based on the performance of the funds and other accounts managed by each portfolio manager relative to the various benchmarks. Performance of fixed income funds is measured on a pre-tax and/or after-tax basis over various time periods including 1-, 3- and 5- year periods, as applicable. The performance of Mr. Keenan is not measured against a specific benchmark.
 Distribution of Discretionary Incentive Compensation. Discretionary incentive compensation is distributed to portfolio managers in a combination of cash and BlackRock, Inc. restricted stock units which vest ratably over a number of years. For some portfolio managers, discretionary incentive compensation is also distributed in deferred cash awards that notionally track the returns of select BlackRock investment products they manage and that vest ratably over a number of years. The BlackRock restricted stock units, upon vesting, will be settled in BlackRock common stock. Typically, the cash portion of the discretionary incentive compensation, when combined with base salary, represents a meaningful portion of total compensation for the portfolio managers. Paying a portion of discretionary incentive compensation in BlackRock stock puts compensation earned by a portfolio manager for a given year “at risk” based on BlackRock’s ability to sustain and improve its performance over future periods. Providing a portion of discretionary incentive compensation in deferred cash awards that notionally track the BlackRock investment products they manage provides direct alignment with investment product results.
 Long-Term Incentive Plan Awards — From time to time, long-term incentive equity awards are granted to certain key employees to aid in retention, align their interests with long-term shareholder interests and motivate performance. Equity awards are generally granted in the form of BlackRock restricted stock units that, once vested, settle in BlackRock common stock.


Deferred Compensation Program — A portion of the compensation paid to eligible U.S.-based BlackRock employees may be voluntarily deferred at their election for defined periods of time into an account that tracks the performance of certain of the firm’s investment products. Any portfolio manager who is either a managing director or director at BlackRock with compensation above a specified threshold is eligible to participate in the deferred compensation program.
 Other Compensation Benefits. In addition to base compensation and discretionary incentive compensation, portfolio managers may be eligible to receive or participate in one or more of the following:
 Incentive Savings Plans – BlackRock has created a variety of incentive savings plans in which BlackRock employees are eligible to participate, including a 401(k) plan, the BlackRock Retirement Savings Plan (“RSP”), and the BlackRock Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”). The employer contribution components of the RSP include a company match equal to 50% of the first 8% of eligible pay contributed to the plan capped at $5,000 per year, and a company retirement contribution equal to 3-5% of eligible compensation up to the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) limit. The RSP offers a range of investment options, including registered investment companies and collective investment funds managed by the firm. BlackRock contributions follow the investment direction set by participants for their own contributions or, absent participant investment direction, are invested into a target date fund that corresponds to, or is closest to, the year in which the participant attains age 65. The ESPP allows for investment in BlackRock common stock at a 5% discount on the fair market value of the stock on the purchase date. Annual participation in the ESPP is limited to the purchase of 1,000 shares of common stock or a dollar value of $25,000 based on its fair market value on the purchase date. All of the eligible portfolio managers are eligible to participate in these plans.
 Potential Material Conflicts of Interest
 BlackRock has built a professional working environment, firm-wide compliance culture and compliance procedures and systems designed to protect against potential incentives that may favor one account over another. BlackRock has adopted policies and procedures that address the allocation of investment opportunities, execution of portfolio transactions, personal trading by employees and other potential conflicts of interest that are designed to ensure that all client accounts are treated equitably over time. Nevertheless, BlackRock furnishes investment management and advisory services to numerous clients in addition to the Company, and BlackRock may, consistent with applicable law, make investment recommendations to other clients or accounts (including accounts which are hedge funds or have performance or higher fees paid to BlackRock, or in which portfolio managers have a personal interest in the receipt of such fees), which may be the same as or different from those made to the Company. In addition, BlackRock, its affiliates and significant shareholders and any officer, director, shareholder or employee may or may not have an interest in the securities whose purchase and sale BlackRock recommends to the Company. BlackRock, or any of its affiliates or significant shareholders, or any officer, director, shareholder, employee or any member of their families may take different actions than those recommended to the Company by BlackRock with respect to the same securities. Moreover, BlackRock may refrain from rendering any advice or services concerning securities of companies of which any of BlackRock’s (or its affiliates’ or significant shareholders’) officers, directors or employees are directors or officers, or companies as to which BlackRock or any of its affiliates or significant shareholders or the officers, directors and employees of any of them has any substantial economic interest or possesses material non-public information. Certain portfolio managers also may manage accounts whose investment strategies may at times be opposed to the strategy utilized for the Company. It should also be noted that a portfolio manager may be managing hedge fund and/or long only accounts, or may be part of a team managing hedge fund and/or long only accounts, subject to incentive fees. Such portfolio managers may therefore be entitled to receive a portion of any incentive fees earned on such accounts. Currently, the Company’s portfolio manager is not entitled to receive a portion of incentive fees of other accounts.
 As a fiduciary, BlackRock owes a duty of loyalty to its clients and must treat each client fairly. When BlackRock purchases or sells securities for more than one account, the trades must be allocated in a manner consistent with its fiduciary duties. BlackRock attempts to allocate investments in a fair and equitable manner among client accounts, with no account receiving preferential treatment. To this end, BlackRock has adopted policies that are intended to ensure reasonable efficiency in client transactions and provide BlackRock with sufficient flexibility to allocate investments in a manner that is consistent with the particular investment discipline and client base, as appropriate.
 Leverage
Debt is comprised of a senior secured revolving credit facility dated as of February 19, 2016 (as amended, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, including as amended and restated by the sixth amendment thereto, dated as of April 23, 2021, the “Credit Facility”) and senior unsecured notes issued through a private placement on June 9, 2022 by the Company and due December 9, 2025 (the “2025 Private Placement Notes”). Prior to being repaid on June 15, 2022, debt also included the Company’s unsecured convertible senior notes due 2022 (the “2022 Convertible Notes”).
Effective on May 2, 2020, after obtaining stockholder approval at the annual meeting of the Company’s stockholders held on May 1, 2020, the Company’s asset coverage requirement was reduced from 200% to 150%, as set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, as amended by the Small Business Credit Availability Act.
Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility
On April 23, 2021, the Company amended its Credit Facility. Among other items, the amendment (i) extended the maturity date on loans made under the Credit Facility from June 5, 2023 to April 23, 2025, (ii) reduced the aggregate principal amount of the commitments under the Credit Facility from $300,000,000 to $265,000,000, (iii) reduced the amount by which the Company may seek an increase in the commitments

under the Credit Facility (subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, including obtaining commitments) from $375,000,000 to $325,000,000, and (iv) revised to require a minimum shareholders’ equity under the Credit Facility to the greater of (i) 33% of the total assets of the Company and its subsidiaries and (ii) $240,000,000 plus 25% of net proceeds from the sale of equity interests by the Company its subsidiaries. Additionally, the Sixth Amendment (i) eliminated the springing maturity date that would have occurred if the 2022 Convertible Notes were not refinanced by March 16, 2022 and (ii) removed certain restrictions on repurchase or prepayment of the 2022 Convertible Notes. For further details on the Company’s Credit Facility including prior amendments, refer to the Company’s Form 10-K as filed with the SEC on March 3, 2021.
 Unsecured Convertible Senior Notes Due 2022
On June 13, 2017, the Company issued $143,750,000 in aggregate principal amount ($125,000,000 of the initial offering and $18,750,000 of the underwriters’ exercise of the overallotment option) of 5.00% Convertible Notes due 2022 under an indenture, dated as of June 13, 2017 (the “2022 Convertible Notes Indenture”). Net proceeds to the Company from the offering, including the exercise of the overallotment option, were approximately $139,800,000. The 2022 Convertible Notes matured on June 15, 2022, and the Company fully repaid the aggregate outstanding $143,720,000 principal amount (post noteholder conversion) plus outstanding accrued interest. The interest rate on the notes was 5.00% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing on December 15, 2017. Holders were able to convert their notes at their option prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding December 15, 2021, in integral multiples of $1,000 principal amount, only under certain circumstances. Upon noteholder conversion, the Company was able to pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election at an initial conversion rate of 118.2173 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $8.46 per share of the Company’s common stock. On or after December 23, 2021, the Company was able to redeem the 2022 Convertible Notes for cash, in whole or from time to time in part, at its option in accordance with their terms. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company issued 3,546 shares of common stock with an aggregate value of $30,000 to a noteholder who elected the conversion option in lieu of principal repayment pursuant to the redemption terms of the 2022 Convertible Notes Indenture.
Unsecured Senior Notes Due 2025

On April 21, 2022, the Company entered into a Master Note Purchase Agreement (the “Note Purchase Agreement”) governing the issuance on June 9, 2022, of $92,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in two tranches to qualified institutional investors in a private placement. The Company issued $35,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 2025 Private Placement Notes with a fixed interest rate of 5.82% with interest to be paid semi-annually on June 9 and December 9 of each year, beginning on December 9, 2022, and $57,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 2025 Private Placement Notes bearing interest at a rate equal to SOFR plus 3.14% with interest to be paid quarterly on March 9, June 9, September 9, and December 9 of each year, beginning on September 9, 2022. In addition, during any time that the rating assigned to the 2025 Private Placement Notes declines below investment grade, the 2025 Private Placement Notes will bear interest at a rate that is increased by 1.00%. The 2025 Private Placement Notes were issued at a closing which occurred on June 9, 2022. The 2025 Private Placement Notes will be due on December 9, 2025 unless redeemed, purchased or prepaid prior to such date by the Company or its affiliates in accordance with their terms. The Company may prepay the 2025 Private Placement Notes at its option, subject to a prepayment premium, in an amount equal to 2% on or before June 9, 2023, 1% after June 9, 2023 but on or before June 9, 2024, 0.5% after June 9, 2024 but on or before June 9, 2025 and zero after June 9, 2025. In addition, the Company will be obligated to offer to repay the 2025 Private Placement Notes at par if certain change in control events occur. The 2025 Private Placement Notes are general unsecured obligations of the Company that rank pari passu with all outstanding and future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness issued by the Company.
In connection with the 2025 Private Placement Notes, the Company entered into a centrally cleared Interest Rate Swap to offset interest payable on the fixed rate tranche of the Notes. The notional amount of the Interest Rate Swap is $35,000,000 and matures on June 9, 2025. Under the swap agreement, the Company receives a fixed rate of 2.633% and pays a floating interest rate of SOFR. Such payments will be due annually. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company did not make any periodic payments. Since the swap contract has not been designated as a hedge accounting relationship pursuant to ASC 815, “Derivatives and Hedging,” both the net interest receivable and the change in the fair value of the swap contract are presented as part of the change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
For more information on the Company's debt, see Note 4 to the Company's consolidated financial statements.

 Dividend Reinvestment Plan
 Unless the registered owner of your common shares elects to receive cash by contacting Computershare Inc. (“Computershare”), agent for stockholders in administering our amended and restated dividend reinvestment plan (the “Plan”), all dividends declared for you in common shares of our company will be automatically reinvested by the plan agent in additional common shares of our company. If the registered owner of your common shares elects not to participate in the Plan, you will receive all dividends in cash paid by check mailed directly to you (or, if the shares are held in street or other nominee name, then to such nominee) by Computershare, as dividend disbursing agent. You may elect not to participate in the Plan and to receive all dividends in cash by sending written instructions or by contacting Computershare, as dividend disbursing agent, at the address set forth below. Participation in the Plan is completely voluntary and may be terminated or resumed at any time without penalty by contacting the plan agent before the dividend record date; otherwise such termination or resumption will be effective with respect to any subsequently declared dividend. Some brokers may automatically elect to receive cash on your behalf and may re-invest that

cash in additional common shares of our company for you. As this approach may cause you to incur brokerage charges or other transaction costs, we recommend that you consult with your broker or financial adviser. If you wish for all dividends declared on your common shares of our company to be automatically reinvested pursuant to the Plan, please contact your broker.
 The plan agent will open an account for each common stockholder under the plan in the same name in which such common stockholder’s common shares are registered. Whenever we declare a dividend payable in cash, non-participants in the Plan will receive cash and participants in the Plan will receive the number of common shares referred to below. The common shares will be paid to the plan agent for the participants’ accounts through receipt of additional unissued but authorized common shares or treasury common shares from us, or through shares purchased on the open-market, as discussed below.
 On March 6, 2018, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted amendments to the Plan. Under the terms of the amended Plan, if the Company declares a dividend or determines to make a capital gain or other distribution, the reinvestment plan agent will acquire shares for the participants’ accounts, depending upon the following circumstances, (i) through receipt of additional unissued but authorized shares from the Company (“newly issued shares”) and/or (ii) by purchase of outstanding shares on the open market (“open-market purchases”). If, on the dividend payment date, the last quarterly net asset value per share (“NAV”) is equal to or less than the closing market price per share on such dividend payment date (such condition often referred to as a “market premium”), the reinvestment plan agent will invest the dividend amount in newly issued shares on behalf of the participants. The number of newly issued shares to be credited to each participant’s account will be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the dividend by the greater of (i) the NAV or (ii) 95% of the closing market price on the dividend payment date. If, on the dividend payment date, the NAV is greater than the closing market price per share on such dividend payment date (such condition often referred to as a “market discount”), the reinvestment plan agent may, upon notice from the Company, either (a) invest the dividend amount in newly issued shares on behalf of the participants or (b) invest the dividend amount in shares acquired on behalf of the participants in open-market purchases.
 On May 13, 2020, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted further amendments to the Plan. Under the terms of the amended Plan, if the Company makes a Cash/Stock Dividend, each stockholder will be required to elect whether to receive the dividend in cash or in shares of the Company's common stock (“Common Shares”), pursuant to such notices, forms or other documentation as may be provided to the stockholder by the Company (the “Election Forms”). If the stockholder is a Plan participant and elects to receive the Cash/Stock Dividend in cash, the stockholder will be deemed to have elected not to participate in the Plan solely with respect to such Cash/Stock Dividend and will receive the dividend in cash subject to any rules applicable to the distribution that may limit the portion of the dividend the Company is required to pay in cash. If the stockholder is a Plan participant and elects to receive the Cash/Stock Dividend in stock, the stockholder will receive the dividend in newly issued Common Shares. The number of newly issued Common Shares credited to the stockholders' account in either case will be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the dividend (or portion of the dividend to be paid in Common Shares) by the price per Common Share determined in accordance with the Election Forms rather than pursuant to the formula(s) otherwise applicable under the Plan. This feature of the Plan means that, under certain circumstances, we may issue shares of our common stock at a price below net asset value per share, which could cause our stockholders to experience dilution. At the Company's special meeting of stockholders held on May 3, 2022, stockholders did not approve the Company's ability to sell or otherwise issue shares of common stock at a price below its then current net asset value per share for a 12-month period expiring on the anniversary of the date of stockholder approval. We may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make dividends at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time. Also, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions due to the asset coverage test applicable to us as a BDC under the 1940 Act and due to provisions in our existing and future debt arrangements.
 The plan agent maintains all stockholders’ accounts in the Plan and furnishes written confirmation of all transactions in the accounts, including information needed by stockholders for tax records. Common shares in the account of each plan participant will be held by the plan agent on behalf of the plan participant, and each stockholder proxy will include those shares purchased or received pursuant to the plan. The plan agent will forward all proxy solicitation materials to participants and vote proxies for shares held under the Plan in accordance with the instructions of the participants.
 In the case of stockholders such as banks, brokers or nominees which hold shares for others who are the beneficial owners, the plan agent will administer the plan on the basis of the number of common shares certified from time to time by the record stockholder’s name and held for the account of beneficial owners who participate in the Plan.
 There will be no brokerage charges with respect to common shares issued directly by us. The automatic reinvestment of distributions will not relieve participants of any federal, state or local income tax that may be payable (or required to be withheld) on such distributions. Participants that request a sale of shares through the plan agent are subject to a $2.50 sales fee and a $0.15 per share sold brokerage commission.
 We reserve the right to amend or terminate the plan. There is no direct service charge to participants in the plan; however, we reserve the right to amend the plan to include a service charge payable by the participants.
 All correspondence concerning the plan should be directed to the plan agent at Computershare Inc., 462 South 4th Street, Suite 1600, Louisville, KY 40202.
