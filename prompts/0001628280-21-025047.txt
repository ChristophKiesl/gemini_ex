Item 1. Business
Our Company
Weber Inc. (“Weber,” “Company,” “we,” and “our”), together with its affiliates, is the leading outdoor cooking company in the global outdoor cooking market. Our founder George Stephen, Sr., established the outdoor cooking category when he invented the original charcoal grill nearly 70 years ago. In the decades since, we have built a loyal and global following of both grilling enthusiasts and barbeque professionals in backyards all around the world. Our product portfolio includes traditional charcoal grills, gas grills, smokers, pellet and electric grills and recently our Weber Connect™ technology-enabled grills. Our full range of products are sold in 78 countries. 
We completed our initial public offering (“IPO”) in August 2021 and our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) under the symbol “WEBR.” 
We operate in the global outdoor cooking market, which is comprised of outdoor products that include gas grills, charcoal grills, wood pellet grills, electric grills, smokers, grilling accessories, and solid fuel products (including charcoal briquettes, lump charcoal, pellets, and wood chips and chunks). Our mission at Weber is to lead the outdoor cooking industry by innovating breakthrough new products and services that enhance our global consumers’ grilling experiences. Our purpose is to ignite inspiration and discovery through everything we do, at every touchpoint with our consumers. Grilling is about making delicious food, bringing people together and creating memories. Weber is an experience, a passion, a way of life and a journey to discover what grilling can be.

Accessories, Consumables and Services
Accessories, consumables and services are a core component of our product offering that represent a high margin, year-round recurring revenue stream between grill purchases. We offer connected devices with our Weber Connect Smart Grilling Hub, serving accessories, grill care, Weber branded merchandise, grilling guide and recipe books, and Weber branded fuel. We also offer services in select geographies such as delivery, assembly and grilling classes.
Sales Channels
We sell our products through an omni-channel network that consists of wholesale, direct-to-consumer (“DTC”) and e-commerce.
Wholesale. We develop and maintain relationships with our global and international retailers and independent and specialty dealers by offering them an attractive combination of category validation, marketing and merchandising support, and rapid inventory turns. Our wholesale network is supported by our direct sales organization covering all channels of distribution. We have established relationships with leading global and international retailers who expand our reach and offer our consumers a broader range of our products. We also sell our products to approximately 2,300 independent retailers (barbecue and grilling stores, hardware stores, outdoor and recreation stores, and farm and ranch supply stores, etc.).
DTC. We sell our products directly to consumers through Weber.com, our 193 Weber branded retail stores and Grill Academy sites. We relaunched our website in 2021 and implemented a new digital customer service experience. Consumers can now browse and purchase the entire Weber portfolio with curated search functionality on Weber.com, buy products exclusive to our site, and receive direct financing through a third-party provider. We partner with local operators who fund and operate Weber branded retail locations and Grill Academy sites under strict Weber guidelines.
E-commerce. We have a strong presence in the e-commerce channel and a dedicated digital commerce team to drive penetration and growth within the online platforms of our global, multi-national and European retailers, as well as digitally native retailers such as Amazon and Wayfair. 
During fiscal year 2021, two customers in the Americas segment accounted for 14% and 10% of Net Sales and for 20% and 13% of accounts receivable. During fiscal year 2020, two customers in the Americas segment accounted for 16% and 11% of Net Sales and for 19% and 8% of accounts receivable. During fiscal year 2019, two customers in the Americas segment accounted for 14% and 13% of Net Sales and for 11% and 4% of accounts receivable.
Marketing and Consumer Engagement
We execute a wide range of marketing tactics. We develop and selectively use advertising to showcase our brand and new product launches during the key grilling seasons around the world. Our advertising appears in online display and connected and online TV, such as YouTube. We work with high-profile food, lifestyle, and barbecue influencers worldwide as extensions of our brand and we use social media to further cultivate our Weber community and amplify the passion for our brand and products. We collect consumer data from a wide range of sources, including our connected devices, Weber apps, purchases on Weber.com, owner warranty registrations and Grill Academy classes, to tailor our marketing, offers and programs.
We collaborate with our retail partners to deliver an engaging and compelling Weber brand experience through custom fixtures, signage and product displays. We also partner with many of our customers, globally, to create an omni-channel experience linking category leading digital content with in-store displays.
Our “Grill Masters”—a global team of Weber culinary experts with a deep expertise in grilling techniques and Weber products—participate in more than 200 events annually, doing in-person experiential events and virtual cooking demonstrations while also showcasing our products. In addition, we have a mobile grilling academy that does pop-up events at Do-It-Yourself and independent retailers across North America.
Product Innovation and Development
Consumers are at the center of our product innovation and development process. In recent years, we have significantly increased investment in product innovation and development to bring innovation to our existing product portfolio and facilitate entry into new product categories based on data driven consumer insight. Our product innovation and development team develops new products and enhances our existing product portfolio with an unwavering focus on improving consumers’ grilling experiences, encouraging them to grill more often and with more confidence. In 2021, we acquired June Life Inc., which augmented our software and hardware engineering capabilities.
In 2020, we introduced our new connected device platform, Weber Connect™ powered by June OS. This precision grilling technology was first made available as the stand-alone Smart Grilling Hub, and as an integrated feature in our SmokeFire wood pellet grill. Today, Weber Connect is also available in our Genesis gas grill, Spirit gas grill and Pulse electric grill. 
Manufacturing and Distribution
We are the only major grill company that maintains a significant U.S.-based manufacturing footprint and the majority of our U.S. sold grills are produced in our facility in Huntley, Illinois. We have a long standing history with a diversified set of suppliers, mainly within the U.S. and Asia, who send component parts to Huntley for finished grill manufacturing. In addition to our U.S. manufacturing, we maintain long-standing relationships with three major grill manufacturers in China who provide us with flexibility and redundancy across our major project lines. All of our partners 
operate according to our strict quality standards and in accordance with our supplier code of conduct. We enforce stringent product quality standards over our own manufacturing and that of our manufacturing partners. 
In October 2021, we opened our first European-based manufacturing and distribution hub in Zabrze, Poland. This new location manufactures and distributes key product lines for the EMEA market. The strategic location of this facility will increase our manufacturing capacity, deliver working capital efficiencies, improve demand responsiveness in EMEA, reduce manufacturing and transportation costs and further diversify our global manufacturing footprint.
Our Global Distribution Center in Huntley, Illinois serves as a central hub for shipments to our North American retail customers and plays a key role in our global hub and spoke distribution model. Globally, we occupy 22 distribution facilities, maintaining a hub and spoke approach to distribution. We use distribution partners to serve markets in EMEA and APAC to strengthen our network. This hybrid model allows us to control distribution of our product in markets where it is economically viable. We manage inventory through a disciplined, global sales and operations planning process that manages demand and supply dynamics in real-time.
Raw Materials
The primary raw materials used in our manufacturing facilities as well as those of our suppliers include aluminum, carbon steel, stainless steel, polypropylene and nylon. Many of these materials are available globally from multiple suppliers. In some cases, we will specify certain suppliers for key raw materials or components in order to maintain our quality standards. 
Competition
We compete in the large global outdoor cooking market. Competition in our markets is based on a number of factors including product quality, performance, durability, features and price, as well as brand image and recognition. Weber is the only outdoor cooking brand with significant global scale, operating a vertically integrated manufacturing platform with an omni-channel distribution network. As the largest global grilling brand, we compete against a variety of well-known and emerging brands based on fuel type and geography. While no other company offers the breadth of our product offering, our competitors, in certain categories, include Big Green Egg, Broil King, Campingaz, Char-Broil, Landmann, Napoleon, Nexgrill, Pit Boss, Traeger and Ziegler & Brown.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright and other intellectual property laws in the U.S. and similar laws in other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures, cybersecurity practices and contractual provisions and restrictions, to establish, maintain and protect the intellectual property and proprietary rights and our products and technology. As of September 30, 2021, we held approximately 193 issued U.S. patents, 722 issued foreign patents and 311 pending patent applications worldwide relating to our products, as well as approximately 66 registered U.S. trademarks, 448 registered foreign trademarks and 88 pending trademark applications worldwide covering our brands and products. In addition to the intellectual property rights that we own, we license certain technologies and intellectual property rights from third parties, some of which are incorporated into our products.
We have implemented an online marketplace monitoring and seller/listing termination program to disrupt any counterfeit or infringing offerings. We collaborate with Amazon and other online marketplaces to operate such termination programs. 
Seasonality
Although we generally have demand for our products throughout the year, our sales have historically experienced some seasonality. We have typically experienced our highest level of sales of our products in the second and third fiscal quarters as retailers across North America and Europe changeover their floor sets, build inventory and fulfill consumer demand for outdoor cooking products. Sales are typically lower during our first and fourth fiscal quarters, with the exception of our Australia/New Zealand business which is counter seasonal to the balance of our business. We have a long track record of investing in our business throughout the year, including in operating expenses, working capital, and other growth initiatives. While these investments drive performance during the primary selling season in our second and third fiscal quarters, they generally have a negative impact on cash flow and net income during our first and fourth fiscal quarters. Unfavorable weather during our higher sales season can also have a material adverse impact on our results, and can cause shifts in sales across fiscal quarters. A few examples are colder, wetter weather patterns during the key second and third fiscal quarters in North America and Europe, or drought conditions leading to wildfires similar to what we experienced in Australia in early fiscal year 2020.
Human Capital Resources
As of September 30, 2021, we had approximately 2,534 full-time employees, including 1,406 in global operations and supply chain, nearly 423 in sales and marketing, and the remaining headcount support various business functions around the world. Of all of our full-time employees, 1,680 are located in the U.S. and 854 are located internationally. Approximately 26% of our employees are covered by collective labor agreements, all three of which were renewed in 2021. We have not experienced any significant union-related work stoppages over the last ten years. 
Employee Development. As part of our human capital resource objectives, we seek to attract, retain, develop and reward our employees through a variety of mechanisms. We build upon Weber’s objectives by seeking to attract, retain, develop and reward behaviors to ensure our long-term sustainability as a company. We continue to advance our efforts to develop a performance culture by strengthening performance management processes through management training and the development and implementation of consistent documentation and methodologies designed to ensure a robust process for all employees. We schedule performance discussions for all employees each year and establish clearly defined goals and incentive programs to drive employee performance in alignment with our overall business objectives. In addition, we have implemented a coordinated approach in managing our overall compensation structure and regularly conduct full evaluations of our compensation and incentive programs to ensure we are competitive in these areas. We monitor our performance by measuring numerous elements relating to our human capital management efforts, including, but not limited to, employee turnover, time to fill open roles and general diversity statistics.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion ("DE&I"). Weber is focused on recruiting and retaining diverse employees, creating awareness of diversity issues, fostering a supportive, positive environment where inclusive behaviors are the norm, and embedding accountability for diversity throughout the organization. Our goal is to reflect the diversity of our consumers throughout our Company. We have taken action to make progress on our DE&I journey, and we are firmly committed to continuing to advance our DE&I priorities. In 2020, we increased our focus on DE&I by creating a Corporate Vision Statement "Together It's Possible" and retaining a Head of DE&I to focus the Company on achieving these goals. Our focus on equity, diversity and inclusion enables us to build a culture where employees are inspired to share their passion, talents and ideas. Our four Employee Resource Groups, which include Weber Pride, Women of Weber, Weber African Ancestry Network and Weber Hispanic & Latino Heritage Network, also play a critical role in attracting diverse talent, providing mentoring and career development opportunities, delivering commercial business insights and connecting people to the Company and the communities where we do business.
Employee Engagement. We communicate frequently and transparently with our employees through a variety of engagement vehicles, including a global annual Employee Engagement Survey. This survey provides tools to leaders and employees to drive improvements globally.
Market-Based Compensation. We provide a market-based competitive compensation through our salary, annual incentive and long-term incentive programs, and a robust benefits package that promotes employee well-being across all aspects of their lives, including physical, financial, social and emotional well-being. Weber offers a comprehensive retiree medical plan for those who meet eligibility requirements. In addition, we provide a 401(k) plan for eligible employees in the U.S.
Health and Wellness. Creating a culture where all colleagues feel supported and valued is paramount to our corporate mission. The COVID-19 pandemic led to unique challenges and we are striving to ensure the health, safety and general well-being of our colleagues. We continue to evolve our programs to meet our colleagues’ health and wellness needs, which we believe is essential to attract and retain employees of the highest caliber, and we offer a competitive benefits package focused on fostering work/life integration. Our Wellness Committee in the U.S. provides resources and initiatives to emphasize these priorities. 
Company Ethics. The Company has processes in place for compliance with the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Weber employees, requiring employees to disclose actual or potential conflicts of interest, report actual or potential violations of the law, rules, regulations, ethics or the Code policy and acknowledge their obligation to comply with the applicable code. Ethics are deeply embedded in our values and business processes. Respect and Responsibility is a core Company value and is the anchor for our Code of Business Conduct. The Company regularly re-enforces our commitment to ethics and integrity in employee communications, in our everyday actions and through our processes. In addition, the Company provides targeted training across the globe during the course of the of the year. The Company also maintains an ethics related hotline, managed by a third party, through which individuals can anonymously raise concerns or ask questions about business behavior. 
Government Regulations
We are subject to many varying laws and regulations in the U.S., the European Union, the United Kingdom, and throughout the world, including those related to privacy, data protection, intellectual property, consumer protection, e-commerce, marketing, advertising, messaging, rights of publicity, health and safety, employment and labor, product 
liability, accessibility, competition, and taxation. These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created, or amended in a manner that could harm our current or future business and operations. In addition, it is possible that certain governments may seek to block or limit our products and services or otherwise impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility or usability of any or all of our products and services for an extended period of time or indefinitely.
We are also subject to laws regulating consumer products in the jurisdictions in which we sell our products. In the United States for instance, certain of our products are subject to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Act, under which the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission may exclude products from the market that are found to be unsafe or hazardous, require repair, replacement or refund of products, impose fines for noncompliance with requirements and impose fines for failure to timely notify them of potential safety hazards.
Environmental Matters
Our properties and operations are subject to a number of environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, air emissions, water discharges, handling and disposal of solid and hazardous substances and wastes, soil and groundwater contamination, employee health and safety and the chemical content of products. Under certain of these laws and regulations, we may be subject to joint and several liability for environmental investigations and cleanups, including at properties that we currently or previously owned or operated, or at sites at which waste we generated was disposed, even if the contamination was not caused by us or was legal at the time it occurred. We are not a party to any material proceedings arising under these regulations. We believe that compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations will not materially affect our consolidated financial condition or our competitive position.
