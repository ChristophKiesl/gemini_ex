Item 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
Eastside Distilling, Inc. (the “Company,” “Eastside Distilling,” “we,” “us,” or “our,” below) was incorporated under the laws of Nevada in 2004 under the name of Eurocan Holdings, Ltd. In December 2014, we changed our corporate name to Eastside Distilling, Inc. to reflect our acquisition of Eastside Distilling, LLC. We manufacture, acquire, blend, bottle, import, market and sell a wide variety of alcoholic beverages under recognized brands. We employ 78 people in the United States.
 
Our brands span several alcoholic beverage categories, including whiskey, vodka, gin, rum, tequila and Ready-to-Drink (“RTD”). We sell our products on a wholesale basis to distributors in open states, and brokers in control states, and until March 2020, we operated four retail tasting rooms in Portland, Oregon to market our brands directly to consumers. We operate a mobile craft canning and bottling business (“Craft C+B”) that primarily services the craft beer and craft cider business. Craft C+B operates 11 mobile lines in Seattle, Washington; Portland, Oregon; and Denver, Colorado.
 
Total company revenue in 2020 was almost split evenly between spirits and Craft Canning; yet, the Craft Canning division contributed 80% of our gross profit and spirits contributed 20%. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant effect on each business unit. Craft Canning revenue had over 20% growth from 2019 due to the incremental demand for packaging stimulated by the shift in on-premise beer sales from kegs to cans. The spirits portfolio had approximately 20% in revenue growth from 2019 due to a full year of Azuñia Tequila sales. Overall, the U.S. craft spirits category revenue was down $2.1 billion, or 40%, in 2020 according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States (“DISCUS”).

Principal Spirits Brands and Products During 2020
 

● | Hue-Hue (pronounced “way-way”) Coffee Rum – cold-brewed free-trade, single-origin Arabica coffee beans grown at the Finca El Paternal Estate in Huehuetenango, Guatemala that is sourced and then lightly roasted through Portland Roasting Company. The concentrated brew is then blended with premium silver rum and a trace amount of Demerara sugar. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Azuñia Tequila – estate-crafted, smooth, clean craft tequila with authentic flavor from the local terroir. It is the exclusive export of Agaveros Unidos de Amatitán and a second generation, family-owned-and-operated Rancho Miravalle estate, which has created tequila for over 20 years. Made with 100% pure Weber Blue Agave grown in dedicated fields of the Tequila Valley, it is harvested by hand and roasted in traditional clay hornos, and then finished with a natural, open-air fermentation process and bottled on-site in small batches using a consistent process to deliver field-to-bottle quality. 
● | Portland Potato Vodka – Portland’s award-winning premium craft vodka. The key to producing our vodka is to distill it four times. While most vodka is made from grain used in whiskey, we use potatoes and natural spring water sourced from the state of Oregon. 
● | Burnside Whiskey –We source the best ingredients available to produce Burnside Whiskey. We develop each blend using the various qualities of Quercus Garryana, the native Oregon Oak. Expanding on our initial experiment in 2012, we made it our mission to turn the Burnside program into a one- of-a-kind oak study. Our blends are all distinctive from one another, and the treatment of oak is equally specific.

Eastside Distilling is unique in several specific areas: (1) to our knowledge, we are the only craft spirits company listed on Nasdaq, (2) we do not function as a traditional craft distillery with store fronts relying on local sales, (3) we are diversified with our contract manufacturing division, and (4) we have a diversified portfolio of spirits brands. We are similar to other craft distillers in that (1) we have concentrated local volume, (2) we produce small batches and remain within the volume definition of “Craft”, and (3) our brands achieve success through differentiation, discovery and distribution.
 
The U.S. spirits marketplace is occupied by large multi-national conglomerates with substantially more resources than Eastside Distilling. However, we can use our small size to be fast, focused, flexible in our strategy. If we attempt to grow too quickly, we may lack the underlying strength required to build scale with loyalty via strong unaided awareness and powerfully derived attributes. Moreover, attempting to focus our “frame-of-reference” to compete with the biggest brands in the most expensive venues, is likely to fail without first establishing underlying brand equity.
 
We will seek to utilize our public company stature to our advantage and position our spirits portfolio as a leading tier 2 spirits provider that develops brands, expands geographic presence and positions for either a sale to the tier 1 suppliers or continued ownership with growth in revenue and cash flow. We will look to grow, and vertically integrate, our Craft Canning portfolio.
 
Market Opportunity – Roll-up Craft Distilleries with a Vertically Integrated Production Platform
 
Size of the United States for the Craft Spirits Market
 
The U.S. craft spirits market retail value was estimated at $3.3 billion in 2020, down 40% from $5.5 billion in 2019 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and loss of on-premise sales. The craft spirits category is estimated to continue to struggle in the 1st half of 2021, declining at 15% and then experience explosive growth in the 2nd half as the on-premise class of trade opens, growing at 30%. Overall, we project a growth rate of 10% in 2021. The compound annual growth rate from 2020 to 2023 is forecasted to be 20%.

Estimated Craft Spirits Revenue Growth 20% CAGR through 2023

The craft spirits category share is dominated by whiskey products, followed by gin and brandy. Overall share mix continues to remain constant as growth rates tend to be consistent across product types. The rye whiskey category is growing twice that of American whiskey. While tequila is not considered a domestically produced craft spirit as all tequila is imported from Mexico, we believe Azuñia Tequila has the potential to grow and excel as an artisanal, authentic brand in the premium and super premium tequila category.
Projected 2023 Mix of Craft Spirits

According to DISCUS, distilled spirits sales in the U.S. were up 5.3% in 2019, increasing by $1.5 billion, to a new record of $29 billion. Key spirits category drivers of sales growth in 2019 included: American whiskey, up 10.8%, or $387 million, to $4 billion; rye was an important component of the overall American whiskey category growth with sales up 14.7%, or $30 million, reaching $235 million; tequila/mezcal, up 12.4%, or $372 million, to $3.4 billion; mezcal surpassed $100 million in sales for the first time totaling $105 million. Pre-mixed cocktails were up 7.5%, or $25 million, to $351 million. Volumes rose by 3.3% to a record 239 million cases, an increase of 7.6 million cases from 2018. The trend underscored the decades long trend in market premiumization as consumers shifted their purchases toward more expensive spirits, resulting in a faster rate of growth in revenue over the rate of growth in physical shipments. According to DISCUS, in 2019, the spirits industry again gained market share over beer and wine sales. Revenues grew by half a percent to 37.8% of the total beverage alcohol market. This was the 10th year of market share gains for the spirits industry. Each percentage point gain in market share is worth $770 million in additional revenue to the industry.
Key Salient Areas We Target and Focus Our Spirits Portfolio
 

● | Premiumization – Craft spirits are anticipated to cost more and be more premium. Overall consumer behavior continues to drink less but consume premium alcoholic beverages. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-


● | Experiential Branding – Brands that consumers can discover and become an integral part of consumer lifestyles and self-expression are on the rise. This trend will continue as users search for authenticity. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Farm to Flask – Better ingredients, authentic production processes and a better taste experience will continue to be interesting attributes. Craft spirits, which have a unique sense of identity and originality, continue to gain popularity. 
● | Artisanal and Handmade – Batch produced limited quantities with the highest care, attention and quality are important to consumers seeking special, premium products. This trend is a critical driver of craft growth. 

Spirits Aficionados that Appreciate Authentic, Hand Crafted, Batch Produced Products
 
The overall target for Eastside Distilling is a “psychographic target” that transcends demographics and focuses on what consumers want versus who they are.
 
Our Strategy
 
Our overall strategy is to build Eastside Distilling to a leader in the craft spirits and craft packaging marketplace. We will continue to focus our spirits portfolio on a “house of brands” architecture with Azuñia Tequila, Burnside Whiskey, Portland Potato Vodka, Hue-Hue Coffee Rum and the Eastside brand of limited edition premium spirits products. We aim to grow these brands to either be an attractive acquisition candidate for the tier 1 producers in the spirits industry or be a consistent stream of earnings for the spirits portfolio generated from scale, scope and differentiation.
 
In terms of strategic sequence, we are focused on initiating the turnaround and then beginning the rapid value creation phase for shareholders through the following:
 

1) | The first and most critical step is to reduce the year on year cash burn. In 2019, the cash burn rate (adjusted EBITDA + interest expense) was approximately $10 million and in 2020, it was $6 million. The primary source of this cash burn was the investment in the Redneck Riviera brand. Management believed we would need to increase our investment in Redneck Riviera three-fold to maintain the velocity in the national off-premise chain accounts. We recently terminated the license for the Redneck Riviera brand and will now focus our investment on the remaining brands in the portfolio. In addition, we will assess gross profit to cash operating costs as a scorecard matrix to ensure we maintain a sustainable operating cash burn rate in 2021 below $3 million and make incremental progress toward lowering that cash burn rate. 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) | The second critical step is to establish proper liquidity and improve underlying fundamentals in net working capital. We over-invested in working capital in prior years and collateralized our barrel inventory to raise incremental capital. With the divestiture of the Redneck Riviera brand, we have reduced barrel inventory by 40%. We plan to convert a substantial portion of the remaining barrel inventory to cash by utilizing the barrel product for Eastside limited edition products. We intend to use cash from both debt and equity financings to augment cash generated from reducing working capital to fund operations this year. 
3) | Given the vision for Eastside Distilling to be a national leader in craft spirits and craft contract packaging, it is imperative that management work diligently to professionalize the Company and prepare to scale and expand. To this end, we are focused on converting from manual to automated systems. We have recently hired a Controller and Vice President of Financial Planning and Analysis. This capability will bring faster monthly close, added controls to the accounting systems, stronger 3-year strategic plans and robust phased fiscal budgets. In addition, with the goal of scale and expansion, we will be better prepared to evaluate the optimal return for expenditures by business unit, brand, market, and event. 
4) | Volume and market share, with profit, is the goal for our spirits portfolio. We are a company inspired by craft spirits and the art of craftmanship. We focus on creating unique high-quality artisan products that are rare and hard to get. Our Craft Canning division embraces the same inspiration to package craft beverages with quality and precision. We build experiential brands that are uniquely relevant to our target audience. We focus on creating relationships between our brands and consumers that are deep and enduring.

To help achieve our strategy, we are focused on the following:
 

● | Identifying and completing strategic brand development in-house and acquisitions that fill out our product portfolio and/or our distribution strategy; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Achieving world-class spirit rebranding with the collaboration of Neil Powell Studios; 
● | Achieving brand penetration through our national distribution platform “up and down the street” with our 3-tier distribution network; 
● | Maximizing our margins through (a) premium unique brands and products, (b) optimizing price and price promotion, and (c) targeted cost leverage utilizing our “operations center of excellence” that will focus on buy/make/deliver best practice model; 
● | Monetizing our diverse and growing branded-product portfolio through select and focused geographic expansion; and, 
● | Building a sustainable business model that owns a unique competitive advantage through our brands, products, people, infrastructure and distributors. 

Our Strengths
 
We believe the following competitive strengths will help enable the implementation of our growth strategies:
 

● | Experiential brands with the potential to be highly relevant/unique yet scalable/expandable: As consumers generally “drink the image,” our brands will (a) strive to be discovered versus marketed, (b) create experiences versus interactions, (c) be relevant and unique vs only relevant or unique; and (d) be iconic and admired by our target audience. We will accomplish these goals by building brands that have a deep connection to product attributes and consumer values. When combined, we will create brand gestalt that is highly regarded and highly desired. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Artisan products that are craft inspired and driven by the art of craftmanship: We will seek to provide the most interesting products as measured by individual product attribute ratings and combined derived attribute ratings. In the end, the most important measurement is purchase intent driven by strategic attribute ratings. 
● | Experienced distilling and blending experts: We believe that our team of expert blenders and distillers, with highly regarded palates and experience is important to us maintaining a high-quality, artisanal character to our products as well as adding to our consumer appeal. 
● | Experienced marketing and branding: Our new CEO has over 23 years beverage experience with 16 years in alcoholic beverages. He has created Miller Sharp’s non-alcoholic beer for Miller Brewing, he acquired and grew Stolichnaya vodka for Allied Domecq, and he received the Edgar Bronfman award for outstanding leadership in the spirits industry. Our new Chief Branding Officer brings over 20 years in branding and marketing with several world class agencies. As brand marketing director, she has repackaged and repositioned Beefeater Gin, Kahlua Liqueur, Sauza Tequila and provided marketing direction for other top brands like Makers Mark and Canadian Club. Our new Vice President of Financial Planning and Analysis has over 20 years in the alcoholic beverage industry with Pernod Ricard, Diageo, Bacardi and Heineken, specifically working with brand management to support test market analysis, new product development, sales and operations planning process and marketing matrix measurement/return. Finally, Eastside Distilling has established a strong relationship with Neil Powell Studios, an acclaimed branding firm, to provide us with packaging and digital branding expertise.

● | Key distribution relationships: We have distribution arrangements with several of the largest wine and spirits distributors in the United States, such as RNDC. We have also maintained our relationship with Park Street, a provider of back-office administrative and logistical services for alcohol and beverage companies. We believe these relationships will help accomplish our goal of having our premium spirits sold and distributed nationwide. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Expanded production: With the recent arrival of our new Senior Vice President of Operations, we now have the ability to create an “operational center of excellence” for the entire company. Our new Senior Vice President of Operations has over 20 years’ experience in classic consumer goods manufacturing, including change management, scale & expansion, CRM (integrated, data-driven software solutions), line engineering, black belt methodology and team leadership. The Company plans to combine all purchasing, manufacturing and logistics/warehousing under our new Senior Vice President of Operations. 

Our Product Approach
 
Our approach to our craft spirits involves five important aspects:
 

● | Commitment to high quality unique artisan products inspired by craft spirits and driven by the highest standards of craftmanship: We create and deliver extraordinary products that have unique qualities in ingredients, distilling, blending or barrel aging that offer consumers a special experience. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Authentic craft products and yet scalable and expandable: We believe our unwavering commitment to produce authentic craft spirits that delight our consumers can be scaled and consistent with proper care given to consistency and quality of our production process. 
● | Unique talent and experience: Every spirit reflects the craft inspiration, the highest standards of craftmanship and the creativity and capability of our entire team. Eastside recently announced a new Head Distiller to protect our standards, guide our process and innovate new products. 


● | Strategic spirit portfolio architecture: We will focus on a “house of brands” portfolio architecture that focuses on experiential brands, artisan products, “up and down the street” distribution and micro guerilla marketing. Our portfolio architecture will seek to offer the most unique, high quality and high margin products. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Build consumer relationships, affinity and loyalty: The goal is to build an ongoing relationship with our brands and consumers that fosters loyalty and word of mouth. 

Production and Supply
 
Bringing a brand to market involves several important stages, including bottle and label design, raw materials procurement, filling the bottles, and packaging the bottles in various configurations for shipment. To achieve a unique flavor profile for each brand, we use one or more of the following techniques: infusion of fruit, addition of natural flavorings, blending of products, and aging in selected casks. Once the final profile is approved and quality control standards are met, we filter the liquid as needed and bottle or can the product.
 
We rely on a limited number of suppliers for the sourcing of our spirit products and raw materials, including our distillate products and other ingredients. These suppliers consist of third-party producers in the U.S and Mexico. We are in the process of reviewing our contract with Agaveros Unidos de Amatitan, SA. de CV., which was part of the acquisition of the Azuñia Tequila assets in 2019. We do not have long-term, written agreements with any of our other suppliers for the production of raw materials. However, we believe that we have consistent and reliable third-party sources for the needed materials. We produce and bottle all our spirits for distribution, regardless of whether the distillation phase of the process was at our facility or at one of our suppliers.

--


Most recently, we have consolidated all procurement, manufacturing, logistics, and warehousing under the responsibility of our Senior Vice President of Operations. We have created a “center of operational excellence” that will lead and manage the following: (1) company procurement of raw materials and finished goods from Agaveros Unidos de Amatitan, SA. de CV, (2) Craft C+B contract manufacturing, (3) craft spirits direct manufacturing, and (4) company logistics and warehousing. This initiative will decrease waste, fully utilize and deploy resources, and establish a platform for expansion.
 
Distribution Network
 
Since 2018 with the introduction of Redneck Riviera Whiskey, we developed a national distribution network and currently have distribution and brokerage relationships with three-tier distributors in 49 U.S. states. Despite the divestiture of Redneck Riviera Whiskey from our product portfolio, we continue to enjoy our relationship with a national distributor network.
 
U.S. Distribution
 
Producers and importers of beverage alcohol in the U.S. must sell their products through a three-tier distribution system. Typically, a brand is first sold to a network of distributors, or wholesalers, covering the U.S., in either “open” states or “control” states. In the 33 open states, the distributors are generally large, privately held companies. In the 17 control states, the states themselves function as the distributor, and regulate suppliers, including our Company. The distributors and wholesalers in turn sell to individual retailers, such as liquor stores, restaurants, bars, supermarkets and other outlets licensed to sell alcoholic beverages. In larger states, such as New York, more than one distributor may handle a brand in separate geographical areas. In control states, producers and importers sell their products directly to state liquor authorities, which distribute the products and either operate retail outlets or license the retail sales function to private companies, while maintaining strict control over pricing and profit.
 
The U.S. spirits industry has consolidated dramatically over the last ten years due to merger and acquisition activity. Eight major spirits companies currently dominate the industry, each of which owns and operates its own importing businesses. All companies, including these large companies, are required by law to sell their products through wholesale distributors in the United States. The major companies continue to exert increasing influence over the regional distributors and as a result, it has become increasingly difficult for smaller companies to get their products recognized by distributors. Before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, over 2,000 craft distillers operated in the United States. Since the COVID-19 pandemic commenced, it is estimated that the total number will be reduced to 1,200.
 
Importation
 
We hold the federal importer and wholesaler license required by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau of the U.S. Treasury Department and the requisite state licenses within the states in which we conduct business.
 
Our inventory is maintained in offsite bonded warehouses at our producers, our bonded warehouse in Milwaukie, Oregon, and at bonded warehouses managed by Park Street, our fulfillment and logistics partner. We also typically have inventory in transit that we ship nationally through our network of licensed and bonded carriers.
 
Wholesalers and Distributors
 
In the United States, we are required by law to use state-licensed distributors or, in the control states, state-owned agencies performing this function, to sell our brands to retail outlets. As a result, we depend on distributors for sales, product placement and retail store penetration. All of the distributors with whom currently work also distribute our competitors’ products and brands. As a result, we must foster and maintain our relationships with our distributors. Through our internal sales team, we have established relationships for our brands with wholesale distributors in the forty-nine states where we sell our products, and our products are sold in the U.S. by these wholesale distributors, as well as by various state beverage alcohol control agencies.

Significant Customers
 
Sales to one customer, the Oregon Liquor Control Commission, accounted for approximately 18% and 16% of our consolidated sales for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
 
Sales Team
 
We have a total sales force of approximately 10 people, with an average of over ten years of industry experience with premium beverage alcohol brands.
 
Our sales personnel are engaged in the day-to-day management of our distributors, which includes setting quotas, coordinating promotional plans for our brands, maintaining adequate levels of stock, brand education and training and sales calls with distributor personnel. Our sales team also maintains relationships with key chain and retail customers through independent sales calls. They also schedule promotional events, create local brand promotion plans, host in-store tastings, where permitted, and provide wait staff and bartender training and education for our brands.
 
In addition, we have also engaged Park Street, a provider of back-office administrative, fulfillment, and logistical services for alcohol and beverage distributors, which services include state compliance, logistics planning, order processing, order fulfillment, distributor chargeback and bill-support management and certain accounting and reporting services. In addition, Park Street provides a factoring service that we can take advantage of to improve cash flow.
 
Advertising, Marketing and Promotion
 
To build our brands, we must effectively communicate with three distinct audiences: distributors, retail trade and end consumers. Advertising, marketing and promotional activities help to establish and reinforce the image of our brands in our efforts to build substantial brand value. In the spirits category, consumers “drink the image,” so brand identity is paramount.
 
We have shifted our marketing model from an exclusive external partnership to internal marketing overseen by our Chief Branding Officer and Chief Executive Officer. We have focused our marketing methodology to conducting quantitative external reviews based on consumer research for all brand and product development. We have developed our fundamental strategy to “position and proof” – position brands and products through quantitative research and then market test to build a “proof of concept” prior to regional or national launch. We have partnered with the Studios of Neil Powell to create, build and produce product packaging and support material.
 
We are implementing a micro-guerilla marketing strategy that drives tactics to build brand equity and increase sales. We focus on “Impact Stacking” that combines advertising, price promotions, point-of-sale materials, event sponsorship, in-store and off-premise promotions, public relations, and social media marketing to deliver the biggest impact to our target audience and make the most of our limited resources. We have reduced the cost of external partnerships to manage all marketing by (a) extending research to quantitative methodology that better predicts success, (b) leveraging internal marketing expertise that is more cost effective, (c) better positioning brands to include both consumer values and product attributes, and (d) more optimal utilization of resources with focus and elimination of waste.
 
We now focus on building the spirits portfolio strategy and architecture to better focus and align our brands and products. We also employ a more classical approach to branding based on the capability of our new Chief Branding Officer (“CBO”) and new CEO. Our new CBO has decades of experience in building brands and transforming spirits brands working with advertising agencies and strategic brand consultants. Our CEO has extensive experience in beverage innovation, strategic brand building and micro marketing techniques with a proven track record of value creation in the beverage category.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Trademarks are an important aspect of our business. We sell our products under a number of trademarks which we own. Our brands are protected by trademark registrations or are the subject of pending applications for trademark registration in the U.S. where we distribute, or plan to distribute, our brands. The trademarks may be registered in the names of our subsidiaries. In the U.S., trademark registrations need to be renewed every ten years. We expect to register our trademarks in additional markets as we expand our distribution territories.

12
--

Seasonality
 
Our business has historically followed the spirits industry seasonality trends with peak sales generally occurring in the fourth calendar quarter in spirits, primarily due to seasonal holiday buying. Our Craft C+B business typically has peak sales mid to late summer. However, as our business has evolved and as we continue to expand our footprint in the national distribution platform, our sales growth has been more dependent on the timing of successful sales efforts and shipment of product to customers, but there remains a concentration of buying and stocking our chains ahead of the holiday season.
Competition
 
In spirits, our industry is highly fragmented and very competitive. The threat of new entrants is high; however, the craft spirits segment in the United States is estimated to be down 40% in revenue in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of craft distilleries is also down from 2,000 to an estimated 1,200. The next three years will produce significant growth for craft spirits off of a lower base.
 
We believe that Eastside Distilling will compete on the basis of quality, authenticity, sustainability, artisanal and experiential. Our premium brands compete with other alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages for market share. We compete with numerous tier 1 multinational producers and distributors of beverage alcohol products, many of which have greater resources than us.
 
Over the past ten years, the U.S. wine and spirits industry has undergone dramatic consolidation and realignment of brands and brand ownership. The number of major importers in the U.S. has declined significantly. Today, we believe eight major companies dominate the market: Diageo PLC, Pernod Ricard S.A., Bacardi Limited, Brown-Forman Corporation, Beam Suntory Inc., Davide Campari-Milano S.p.A., and Rémy Cointreau S.A. These competitors have substantially greater resources than we do.
 
We believe we are a meaningful tier 2 participant that is in a prime position to build our platform and potentially partner with small-to-mid-size spirit brands as opposed to the major importers and tier 1 multinationals. Given our size relative to our major tier 1 competitors, most of which have multi-billion dollar operations, we believe that we can provide greater focus on smaller brands and tailor transaction structures based on individual brand owner preferences. However, our relative capital position and resources may limit our marketing capabilities, our ability to expand into new markets and our negotiating ability with our distributors.
 
By focusing on the premium and super-premium segments of the market, which typically have higher prices per case and gross profit margins, and having an established, experienced marketing & sales force, we believe we are able to gain relatively significant attention from our distributors for a company of our size. Also, the continued consolidation among the major companies, and the downsizing of craft distilleries due to the COVID-19 pandemic are expected to create opportunities for small to mid-size wine and spirits companies to expand and increase market share.
 
The mobile canning and bottling industry is highly fragmented and very competitive. The threat of new entrants is high. Moreover, we compete at the hyper-local scale, where we have a few concentrated customers. One of our greatest threats associated with losing customers is the customer’s own growth and success. As new brewers grow, they are able to afford the investment in their own canning line. We believe the mobile canning industry is in the very early stages of development.
 
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act, U.S. Customs laws, and the Alcoholic Beverage Control laws of all fifty states, among many other regulations.

13
--


The U.S. Treasury Department’s Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau regulates the production, blending, bottling, sales and advertising and transportation of alcohol products. Also, each state regulates the advertising, promotion, transportation, sale and distribution of alcohol products within its jurisdiction. We are also required to conduct business in the U.S. only with holders of licenses to import, warehouse, transport, distribute and sell spirits.
 
We are subject to U.S. regulations on the advertising, marketing and sale of beverage alcohol. These regulations range from a complete prohibition of the marketing of alcohol in some states to restrictions on advertising style, media and messages.
 
Labeling of spirits is also regulated in many markets, varying from health warning labels to importer identification, alcohol strength and other consumer information. All beverage alcohol products sold in the U.S. must include warning statements related to risks of drinking beverage alcohol products.
 
In the U.S. control states, the state liquor commissions act in place of distributors and decide which products are to be purchased and offered for sale in their respective states. Products are selected for purchase and sale through listing procedures which are generally made available to new products only at periodically scheduled listing interviews. Consumers may purchase products not selected for listings only through special orders, if at all.
 
The distribution of alcohol-based beverages is also subject to extensive federal and state taxation in the U.S. and internationally. Most foreign countries impose excise duties on wines and distilled spirits, although the form of such taxation varies from a simple application on units of alcohol by volume to intricate systems based on the imported or wholesale value of the product. Several countries impose additional import duty on distilled spirits, often discriminating between categories in the rate of such tariffs. If we begin distributing our products internationally, import and excise duties could have a significant effect on our sales, both through reducing the consumption of alcohol and through encouraging consumer switching into lower-taxed categories of alcohol.
