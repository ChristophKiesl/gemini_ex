Item 1. Business
Introduction
We are a blank check company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on July 23, 2020. We were formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to as a “target business.” We may pursue a business combination opportunity in any business or industry we choose and intend to target businesses with enterprise values of approximately $500 million to $2.5 billion.
Our Sponsor is OTR Acquisition Sponsor LLC (the “Sponsor”), a Delaware limited liability company. Our Sponsor is controlled by affiliates of Nicholas J. Singer, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Purchase Capital LLC, an investment firm founded by Mr. Singer. Purchase Capital serves as Mr. Singer’s family office and Sponsor to leading institutional investors and third-party family offices. The registration statement on Form S-1 for our initial public offering (the “Initial Public Offering”) was declared effective on November 17, 2020. On November 19, 2020, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 10,000,000 units (the “Units” and, with respect to the Class A common stock included in the Units, the “Public Shares”), at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $100.0 million. The underwriters were granted a 45-day option from the date of the final prospectus relating to the Initial Public Offering to purchase up to 1,500,000 additional Units (the “Over-Allotment Units”) to cover over-allotments, if any, at $10.00 per Unit. On November 19, 2020, the underwriters partially exercised their over-allotment option resulting in the purchase of an additional 447,350 Units. The underwriters waived their right to exercise the remaining over-allotment option on December 21, 2020.
Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) of 5,650,000 warrants (each, a “Private Placement Warrant” and collectively, the “Private Placement Warrants”) to our Sponsor, each exercisable to purchase one share of Class A common stock at $11.50 per share, at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to us of $5.7 million. In connection with the partial exercise of the underwriter’s over-allotment option, our Sponsor purchased an additional 167,757 Private Placement Warrants at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating additional gross proceeds of $167,757.
Upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement (including the additional Units and additional Private Placement Warrants sold in connection with the partial exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option), $107.1 million ($10.25 per Unit) of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement were placed in a Trust Account (“Trust Account”) located in the United States at JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee.
If we are unable to complete an initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, or May 19, 2022, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining stockholders and the board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.
Pending Business Combination
On January 31, 2022, the Company and Comera Life Sciences, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Comera”), jointly issued a press release announcing the execution of a business combination agreement (the “Business Combination Agreement”) among Comera Life Sciences Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Holdco”), CLS Sub Merger 1 Corp., a Delaware corporation and newly formed, wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdco (“Comera Merger Sub”), CLS Sub Merger 2 Corp., a Delaware corporation and newly formed, wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdco (“OTR Merger Sub”), the Company and Comera Life, pursuant to which, assuming the Business Combination Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby are adopted and approved by Comera’s stockholders and OTR’s stockholders, and the business combination is subsequently completed, (i) Comera Merger Sub will be merged with and into Comera, with Comera surviving such merger as a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdco (the “Comera Merger”) and (ii) OTR Merger Sub 

1



will be merged with and into OTR, with OTR surviving such merger as a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdco (the “OTR Merger”) (collectively with the other transactions described in the Business Combination Agreement, the “Business Combination”).
Comera is a biotechnology company dedicated to promoting a compassionate new era in medicine by applying a deep knowledge of formulation science and technology to transform essential biologic medicines from intravenous to subcutaneous forms. This transformation in administration provides patients and families the freedom of self-injectable care. Without the need to receive intravenous treatment at a medical facility, patients can more fully realize the potential of biologic treatments and to enjoy the potential of their own lives.
The Comera Merger will become effective by the filing of a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and will be effective immediately upon such filing or upon such later time as may be agreed by the parties and specified in such certificate of merger (such time, the “Comera Merger Effective Time”). The OTR Merger will become effective by the filing of a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and will be effective immediately upon such filing or upon such later time as may be agreed by the parties and specified in such certificate of merger (such time, the “OTR Merger Effective Time”). The closing of the Business Combination (the “Closing”) will take place within three business days following the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent such waiver is permitted by applicable law) of the conditions set forth in the Business Combination Agreement (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at such time), or on such other date, time or place as OTR, Comera and Holdco may mutually agree.
At the Comera Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Comera Merger and without any action on the part of Comera, Holdco, Comera Merger Sub or the holders of any of the following securities:

● | Immediately prior to the Comera Merger Effective Time, each share of Comera preferred stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Comera Merger Effective Time will be converted into an equal number of shares of Comera common stock in accordance with a written consent by certain Comera stockholders holding the requisite number of Comera voting securities necessary to approve the Business Combination approved and adopted the Business Combination and related transactions and with the terms of Article Fourth, Section (B)(5) of the Comera Certificate of Incorporation (the “Conversion”), and each converted share of Comera preferred stock will no longer be outstanding and will cease to exist, such that each holder of Comera preferred stock will thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such Comera preferred stock, but hold Comera common stock;

● | Each Comera unvested option and each Comera vested out-of-the-money option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Comera Merger Effective Time, will be converted into the number of options to purchase shares of Holdco Common Stock (such options, the “Exchanged Options”) in accordance with the Payment Spreadsheet. Except as specifically provided in the Business Combination Agreement, following the Comera Merger Effective Time, each Exchanged Option

will continue to be governed by the same terms and conditions (including vesting and exercisability terms) as were applicable to the corresponding former Comera option immediately prior to the Comera Merger Effective Time.

At the OTR Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the OTR Merger and without any action on the part of OTR, Holdco, OTR Merger Sub or the holders of any of the following securities:

● | Immediately prior to the OTR Merger Effective Time, the Class A common stock and the Public Warrants comprising each issued and outstanding Unit immediately prior to the OTR Merger Effective Time will be automatically separated (the “Unit Separation”) and the holder thereof will be deemed to hold one share of Class A common stock and one-half of one Public Warrant, provided that no fractional Public Warrants will be issued in connection with the Unit Separation such that if a holder of Units would be entitled to receive a fractional Public Warrant upon the Unit Separation, the number of Public Warrants to be issued to such holder upon the Unit Separation will be rounded down to the nearest whole number of Public Warrants;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Following the OTR Class B Conversion and Unit Separation, each share of Class A common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the OTR Merger Effective Time will automatically be converted into and become the right to receive one (1) share of Holdco Common Stock;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | All shares of the Company’s common stock held in the Company’s treasury will be canceled without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution will be made with respect thereto; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Each share of common stock of OTR Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the OTR Merger Effective Time will be converted into and become the right to receive one (1) validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company as the surviving corporation of the OTR Merger.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement is subject to customary conditions, representations, warranties and covenants in the Business Combination Agreement, including, among others, approval by our stockholders, the effectiveness of a registration statement on Form S-4 (the “Form S-4”), which was initially confidentially submitted with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on February 3, 2022, in connection with the Business Combination, and other customary closing conditions, including the receipt of certain regulatory approvals.

We believe the expertise and experience of our officers, directors and advisors in sourcing and creating unique opportunities as well as structuring complex transactions involving creative capital deployment, will make us a partner of choice for potential business combination targets. We intend to focus our efforts on evaluating business combination targets by leveraging the management team and board of directors’ deep network of public and private enterprises, experienced operators, restructuring advisors, attorneys, accountants, family offices, hedge funds, and private equity firms.
Business Strategy
We intend to focus our search for an initial business combination on OTR private companies that have either positive operating cash flow or compelling unit economics combined with a clear path to positive operating cash flow, tangible or intangible assets with significant barriers to entry, and experienced incentivized management teams. Our selection process is expected to leverage a unique set 

5



of relationships with proven deal-sourcing capabilities to provide us with a strong pipeline of potential targets. We expect to distinguish ourselves with our ability to:

● | Leverage our Extensive Network of Relationships to Create a Significant Pipeline of OTR Acquisition Opportunities. We believe the combination of our officers’, directors’ and advisors’ broad investment and operating experience in addition to our ability to access a deep network of public and private enterprises, experienced operators, restructuring advisors, attorneys, accountants, family offices, hedge funds, and private equity firms will enable us to identify and evaluate compelling target businesses.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Employ a Rigorous Systematic Process of Identifying Target Companies and Acquiring a Business that will be Well-Received by the Public Markets. We believe that our management’s strong M&A and investment track record in both private and public markets, combined with extensive public market trading experience, will provide a distinct advantage for identifying, valuing and completing a business combination that will meet our investors’ expectations.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Providing an Alternative Path to Becoming Public. We believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to prospective target businesses that desire to become a publicly listed company. A merger with us will offer a target business an alternative process to a public listing rather than the traditional initial public offering process. We believe that target businesses may favor this alternative, which we believe is less expensive, while offering greater certainty of execution than the traditional initial public offering. Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is approved by our stockholders and the transaction is consummated, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions that could prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would have greater access to capital and additional means of creating management incentives that are better aligned with stockholders’ interests than it would as a private company. A public company can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented management. With public company corporate governance standards, a target business may become attractive to public investors.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Strong and Stable Financial Position with Flexibility. With funds in the Trust Account of $107.1 million available to use for a business combination, we offer a target business a variety of options such as providing the owners of a target business with shares in a public company and a public means to sell such shares, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to consummate our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Acquisition Criteria
Consistent with our strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines which we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We will use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities and will initially target businesses with enterprise values of approximately $500 million to $2.5 billion, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. We intend to acquire one or more businesses that we believe has the following characteristics:

● | Benefits from a Public Currency and Access to Public Equity Markets. Access to the public equity markets could allow the target company to utilize additional forms of capital, enhancing its ability to pursue accretive acquisitions, high-return capital projects, and/or strengthen its balance sheet and recruit and retain key employees through the use of publicly-traded equity compensation.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Has a Strong Competitive Position and Growing Platform. We will seek to invest in companies that we believe possess not only established business models and sustainable competitive advantages, but also a growing platform for equity investors;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6




● | Operated by a Talented and Incentivized Management Team. We will focus on companies with strong and experienced management teams that desire a significant equity stake in the post-business combination company. We will seek to partner with a management team and/or seller who is well-incentivized and aligned in an effort to create stockholder value.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Benefits from Our Ability to Uniquely Structure Transaction to Unlock and Maximize Value. We will look for situations where our extensive experience and creativity can architect a win-win solution for both sides of the transaction.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our stockholder communications related to our initial business combination, which, as discussed in this prospectus, would be in the form of tender offer documents or proxy solicitation materials that we would file with the SEC.
Initial Business Combination
Nasdaq rules require that we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the Trust Account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target’s assets or prospects.
We will have until 18 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering to consummate an initial business combination. We anticipate structuring our initial business combination either (i) in such a way so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses, or (ii) in such a way so that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders, or for other reasons. However, we will only complete an initial business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the “Investment Company Act”. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the initial business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of Nasdaq’s 80% of net assets test. If the initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the transactions and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking stockholder approval, as applicable.
Our Business Combination Process
In evaluating prospective business combinations, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review process that will encompass, among other things, a review of historical and projected financial and operating data, meetings with management and their advisors (if applicable), on-site inspection of facilities and assets, discussion with customers and suppliers, legal reviews and other reviews as we deem appropriate. We will also seek to utilize the expertise of our management team in evaluating operating projections, financial projections and determining the appropriate return expectations given the risk profile of the target business.

We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with the Sponsor or our officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with the Sponsor or our officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that our initial business combination is fair to our Company from a financial point of view.
Certain of our officers and directors presently have fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations to present the opportunity to such entity, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such entity. We believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will not materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our Company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue, and to the extent the director or officer is permitted to refer that opportunity to us without violating another legal obligation.
Each of our officers has agreed not to become an officer of any other special purpose acquisition company that has publicly filed a registration statement for its initial public offering until we have entered into a definitive agreement regarding our initial business combination or we have liquidated the Trust Account.
Sources of Target Business
We anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers and investment professionals. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us by calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read this prospectus and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as the Sponsor and their respective affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition, we expect to receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the business relationships of our officers and directors and our Sponsor and their affiliates. While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, we may engage these firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee, advisory fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will engage a finder only to the extent our management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of finder’s fees is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the Trust Account. In no event, however, will the Sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or any entity with which the Sponsor or our officers or directors are affiliated, be paid any finder’s fee, reimbursement, consulting fee, monies in respect of any payment of a loan or other compensation by the Company prior to, or in connection with any services rendered for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). None of the Sponsor, executive officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, will be allowed to receive any compensation, finder’s fees or consulting fees from a prospective business combination target in connection with a contemplated initial business combination. We have agreed to pay an affiliate of the Sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support and to reimburse the Sponsor for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating and completing an initial business combination. Some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the post-transaction company following our initial business combination. The presence or absence of any such fees or arrangements will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an initial business combination candidate.
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with an initial business combination target that is affiliated with the Sponsor or our officers or directors or making the initial business combination through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with the Sponsor or our officers or directors. Although we will not be specifically focusing on, or targeting, any transaction with any affiliated entities, we would pursue such a transaction if we determined that such affiliated entity met our criteria for an initial

business combination and such transaction was approved by a majority of our disinterested directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with an initial business combination target that is affiliated with the Sponsor or our officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that such an initial business combination is fair to our Company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.
Competition
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic business combinations. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the initial business combination of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
Human Capital Resources
We currently have two officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the initial business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination.

Periodic Reporting and Audited Financial Statements
We have registered our units, Class A common stock and Public Warrants under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.
We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, these financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with, or reconciled to, GAAP, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential targets we may conduct an initial business combination with because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential business combination candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above.
To the extent that these requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential business combination candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.
We evaluated our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth

company, will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such business combination. On November 16, 2020 we filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination.
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of the Initial Public Offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our shares of Class A common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.
