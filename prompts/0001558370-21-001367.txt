ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
Through SkyWest Airlines, we offer scheduled passenger service to destinations in the United States, Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean. Substantially all of our flights are operated as Delta Connection, United Express, American Eagle or Alaska Airlines flights under code-share arrangements (commercial agreements between airlines that, among other things, allow one airline to use another airline’s flight designator codes on its flights) with Delta, United, American or Alaska, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we offered approximately 1,770 daily departures, of which approximately 620 were Delta Connection flights, 740 were United Express flights, 260 were American Eagle flights and 

3



150 were Alaska Airlines flights. The number of flights we operated during 2020 was negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. See the section entitled “Competition and Economic Conditions” below for additional information regarding the COVID-19 impact on our operations. 
We generally provide regional flying to our major airline partners under long-term, fixed-fee, code-share agreements. Under these fixed-fee agreements (commonly referred to as “capacity purchase agreements”), our major airline partners generally pay us fixed rates for operating the aircraft primarily based on the number of completed flights, flight time and the number of aircraft under contract. The major airline partners either directly pay for or reimburse us for specified direct operating expenses, including fuel expenses. Our operations are conducted principally at airports that support our major airline partners’ route network, including Chicago (O’Hare), Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, Phoenix, Salt Lake City, San Francisco and Seattle. 
SkyWest has been flying since 1972. During our long operating history, we have developed an industry-leading reputation for providing quality regional airline service. As of December 31, 2020, we had 601 total aircraft in our fleet, including 452 aircraft in scheduled service under our code-share agreements, summarized as follows:

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​

*As of December 31, 2020, these aircraft have been removed from service and are in the process of being placed under a leasing arrangement with a third party, are aircraft transitioning between code-share agreements with our major airline partners and being used as supplemental spare aircraft, are available for future code-share agreements or are in the process of being parted out. 
​
As of December 31, 2020, our fleet scheduled for service consisted of aircraft manufactured by Bombardier Aerospace (“Bombardier”) and Embraer S.A. (“Embraer”) summarized as follows:

 | ​ | | ​ | 
-------------+---+---------------+---+-------------------
Manufacturer | ​ | Aircraft Type | ​ | Seat Configuration
Bombardier | | CRJ900s | ​ | 70-76 
Bombardier | | CRJ700s | ​ | 65-70 
Bombardier | | CRJ200s | ​ | 50 
Embraer | | E175s | ​ | 70-76 

​
Bombardier and Embraer are the primary manufacturers of regional jets operated in the United States and offer many of the amenities of larger commercial jet aircraft, including flight attendant service, a stand-up cabin, overhead and under seat storage, lavatories and in-flight snack and beverage service. The Bombardier CRJ900 and CRJ700 aircraft and the Embraer E175 (“E175”) aircraft we operate are configured with a first-class seating section. The Bombardier CRJ200 aircraft we operate are configured with single-class seating. The speed of Bombardier and Embraer regional jets is comparable to larger aircraft operated by major airlines, and they have a range of approximately 1,600 miles and 2,100 miles, respectively.
We were incorporated in Utah in 1972. Our principal executive offices are located at 444 South River Road, St. George, Utah 84790, and our primary telephone number is (435) 634-3000. We maintain an internet website at inc.skywest.com, which provides links to our annual, quarterly and current reports and any amendments to those reports filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The information on our website does not constitute part of this Report. In addition, we provide electronic or paper copies of our SEC filings free of charge upon request.

We conduct our code-share operations with our major airline partners pursuant to the following agreements:

Major airline partner | | Agreement 
United | ​ | “United Express Agreements” and “United Express Prorate Agreement” 
Delta | ​ | “Delta Connection Agreement” and “Delta Connection Prorate Agreement”
American | ​ | “American Agreement” 
Alaska | ​ | “Alaska Agreement” 

A summary of the terms for each of our code-share agreements is provided under the heading “Code-Share Agreements” below on page 7.
SkyWest Leasing
SkyWest Leasing is a reportable segment which includes revenue associated with our financing of new aircraft with debt under our capacity purchase agreements, currently consisting of our E175 dual-class regional jet aircraft, and the depreciation and interest expense of our E175 aircraft. The SkyWest Leasing segment additionally includes the revenue and expense from leasing aircraft and engines to third parties. The SkyWest Leasing segment’s total assets and capital expenditures include the acquired E175 aircraft, and aircraft and engines leased to third parties. 
As of December 31, 2020, SkyWest Leasing leased two CRJ200 aircraft, 34 CRJ700 aircraft and five CRJ900 aircraft and regional jet aircraft engines to third parties. 
ExpressJet
ExpressJet was a reportable segment prior to our sale of ExpressJet in January 2019. ExpressJet’s operations were conducted principally from airports located in Atlanta, Chicago (O’Hare), Houston, Newark and New York. 
Competition and Economic Conditions
The airline industry is highly competitive. SkyWest competes principally with other regional airlines. Our operations extend throughout most major geographic markets in the United States. Our competition includes, therefore, nearly every other domestic regional airline. Our primary competitors include Air Wisconsin Airlines Corporation (“Air Wisconsin”); Endeavor Air, Inc. (“Endeavor”) (owned by Delta); Envoy Air Inc. (“Envoy”), PSA Airlines, Inc. (“PSA”) and Piedmont Airlines (“Piedmont”) (Envoy, PSA and Piedmont are owned by American); Horizon Air Industries, Inc. (“Horizon”) (owned by Alaska Air Group, Inc.); GoJet Airlines, LLC, Mesa Air Group, Inc. (“Mesa”); and Republic Airways Holdings Inc. (“Republic”). Major airlines typically award code-share flying arrangements to regional airlines based primarily upon the following criteria: ability to fly contracted schedules, availability of labor resources, including pilots, low operating cost, financial resources, geographical infrastructure, overall customer service levels relating to on-time arrival and flight completion percentages and the overall image of the regional airline. Additionally, each major airline may be limited in the number and type of regional aircraft it may use in its network due to agreements the major airline has with its own labor groups, commonly referred to in the industry as “scope limitations.” Given our major airline partners’ scope limitations, we currently do not operate a regional aircraft configured with more than 76 seats. 
The principal competitive factors for regional airline code-share arrangements include labor resources, code-share agreement terms, reliable flight operations, operating cost structure, ability to finance new aircraft, certification to operate certain aircraft types and geographical infrastructure supporting markets and routes served. 
Our operations represent the largest regional airline operations in the United States. However, regional carriers owned by major airlines may have access to greater resources than we do through their parent companies.
Generally, the airline industry is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions. Economic downturns, combined with competitive pressures, have contributed to a number of reorganizations, bankruptcies, liquidations and business combinations among major and regional carriers. The effect of economic downturns may be somewhat mitigated by our predominantly contract-based flying arrangements. If, however, any of our major airline partners experience a prolonged decline in the number of passengers or are negatively affected by low ticket prices or high fuel prices, they may seek rate reductions in future code-share agreements, or materially reduce scheduled flights in order to 

5



reduce their costs. In addition, adverse weather conditions can impact our ability to complete scheduled flights and can have a negative impact on our operations and financial condition. Also, major airline scope limitations may restrict growth opportunities for the regional carriers.
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic 
​
COVID-19, which was declared a global health pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, has continued to spread around the world and driven the implementation and continuation of significant, government-imposed measures to prevent or reduce its spread, including travel restrictions, closing of borders, “shelter in place” orders and business closures. Consequently, we and our major airline partners have experienced an unprecedented decline in the demand for air travel, which has materially and adversely affected our revenues, particularly under our prorate arrangements (as defined below). The continued spread of the virus and the ongoing global pandemic has affected nearly all of the domestic and international networks of our major airline partners for whom we conduct flight operations and rely on to set our flight schedules. While the length and severity of the reduction in demand due to COVID-19 is uncertain, we presently expect a continued negative impact on our results of operations in 2021 and possibly thereafter.
​
In response to these developments, we have implemented measures to focus on the personal safety of our passengers and employees, while at the same time seeking to mitigate the impact on our financial position and operations. These measures include, but are not limited to, the following:
​
Focus on the Personal Safety of Passengers and Employees. The safety and well-being of our passengers and employees are our priorities in every decision we make. As the COVID-19 pandemic has developed, we have taken numerous steps to help passengers and employees take appropriate safety measures on the ground and in the air in keeping with current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations, including:
​

● | Working with our major airline partners to enhance our aircraft cleaning procedures.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Working with our major airline partners to provide masks for crewmembers and ensuring that all fleet service personnel have the necessary personal protective equipment for disinfecting the aircraft.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Providing a number of options to employees who are diagnosed with COVID-19, including pay protection and extended leave options.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Implementing workforce social distancing and protection measures, and enhanced cleaning of our facilities, including training facilities, using methods and products similar to what we are using on our aircraft.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Capacity Reductions. Beginning in March 2020, we and our major airline partners experienced an unprecedented decrease in demand for air travel and expect this decline from pre-COVID-19 flight levels to continue throughout 2021 and possibly thereafter. We depend on our major airline partners to contract with us to operate scheduled flights. Therefore, in response to this decreased demand, we have significantly reduced our capacity. 
​
Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we anticipated operating approximately 2,400 to 2,500 daily departures on average during each quarter of 2020. Due to COVID-19 related scheduled reductions, we operated approximately 2,300, 900, 1,500 and 1,700 average daily departures during the three months ended March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31, 2020, respectively. We anticipate the number of daily scheduled flights we operate may not return to pre-COVID-19 levels by the end of 2021. We continue to work with our major airline partners regarding future schedules and make further demand-driven adjustments to our capacity as needed. 
​
During 2020, we removed 55 CRJ200 regional aircraft from the SkyWest Airlines Delta Connection Agreement. These 55 aircraft had scheduled contract expirations in 2020 and were not extended due to decreased demand. We also terminated our American Prorate Agreement on seven CRJ200 aircraft in the second quarter of 2020 and we may have further reductions in the number of CRJ200 aircraft operating under our prorate agreements with our other major airline partners. These 62 CRJ200 aircraft removed from the aforementioned Delta and American agreements were fully depreciated upon removal from service and had no outstanding financing. We may receive requests by our major airline partners to defer deliveries of new or used aircraft that were previously scheduled for delivery in 2021 and 2022.

6



Cost Reductions. With the reduction in revenue, we have, and may continue to implement, cost saving initiatives, including:
​

● | Reducing employee-related costs including by:
--+----------------------------------------------


o | Offering voluntary unpaid leave to employees.
--+----------------------------------------------


o | Temporarily suspending all non-scale pay increases.
--+----------------------------------------------------


o | Temporarily instituting a company-wide hiring freeze.
--+------------------------------------------------------


o | Furloughed various employees in administrative and overhead positions.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Delaying non-essential projects and reducing or suspending other discretionary spending.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Although future passenger demand in 2021 and beyond is currently uncertain, given the directional increases in our scheduled flight levels from April 2020 through January 2021, we believe it is an important long-term strategy to retain our pilots, flight attendants and mechanics when reasonably possible, to enhance our ability to respond to increased demand from our major airline partners in 2021. We will continue to evaluate our labor strategy in 2021.
​
Liquidity. At December 31, 2020, we had $1,530.4 million in total available liquidity, consisting of $825.9 million in cash and marketable securities, $39.5 million available under SkyWest Airlines’ line of credit and an additional $665.0 million related to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) under our secured loan and guarantee agreement (the “Treasury Loan Agreement”) with the U.S. Department of the Treasury (“Treasury”). See Note 2 “Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic,” to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the Treasury Loan Agreement.
Industry Overview
Majors, Low-Cost Carriers and Regional Airlines
The airline industry in the United States has traditionally been comprised of several major airlines, including Alaska, American, Delta and United. The major airlines offer scheduled flights to most major U.S. cities, numerous smaller U.S. cities, and cities throughout the world through a hub and spoke network.
Low-cost carriers, such as Southwest Airlines Co. (“Southwest”) and JetBlue Airways Corporation (“JetBlue”), generally have lower cost structures than major airlines, which permits them to offer flights to and from many of the same markets as the major airlines, but at lower prices. Low-cost carriers typically operate using a point-to-point network strategy, rather than a hub and spoke network.
Regional airlines, including SkyWest, typically operate smaller aircraft on shorter routes than major and low-cost carriers. Several regional airlines, including Endeavor, Envoy, Horizon, Piedmont and PSA, are wholly-owned subsidiaries of major airlines.
Regional airlines generally do not try to establish an independent route system and compete with the major airlines. Rather, regional airlines typically enter into agreements with one or more major airlines, pursuant to which the regional airline agrees to use its smaller, lower-cost aircraft to carry passengers booked and ticketed by the major airline between a hub of the major airline and a smaller outlying city. In exchange for such services, the major airline pays the regional airline either fixed fees to operate the flight, termed “capacity purchase agreement,” “capacity purchase contract,” “contract” or “fixed-fee” flights, or the regional airline receives a percentage of applicable passenger ticket revenues on designated flights operated by the regional airline, termed “prorate” or “revenue-sharing” flights, as described in more detail below.
Code-Share Agreements
Regional airlines generally enter into code-share agreements with major airlines, pursuant to which the regional airline is authorized to use the major airline’s two-letter flight designator codes to identify the regional airline’s flights and fares in the central reservation systems, to paint its aircraft with the colors and/or logos of the major airline and to market and advertise its status as a carrier for the major airline. Code-share agreements also generally obligate the major airline to provide services such as reservations, ticketing, ground support and gate access to the regional airline, and the major airline often coordinates marketing, advertising and other promotional efforts. In exchange, the regional airline provides a designated number of low-capacity (usually between 50 and 76 seats) flights between larger airports served 

7



by the major airline and surrounding cities, usually in lower-volume markets. The financial arrangements between the regional airlines and their code-share partners usually involve either capacity purchase arrangements or prorate arrangements as explained below:

● | Capacity Purchase Arrangements. Under a capacity purchase arrangement (also referred to as a “capacity purchase agreement,” “capacity purchase contract,” “flying contract,” “fixed-fee arrangement,” or a “fixed-fee contract,”), the major airline generally pays the regional airline a fixed-fee for each departure, flight hour (measured from takeoff to landing, excluding taxi time) and block hour (measured from takeoff to landing, including taxi time), and an amount per aircraft in service each month with additional incentives based on completion of flights, on-time performance and other operating metrics. The regional airline typically acquires or finances the aircraft used under the capacity purchase arrangement, which is accounted for as a lease of the aircraft to our major airline partner. In addition, under a capacity purchase arrangement, the major airline bears the risk of fuel price fluctuations and certain other costs. Regional airlines benefit from capacity purchase arrangements because they are protected from some of the elements that typically cause volatility in airline financial performance, including variations in ticket prices, number of passengers onboard each flight and increasing fuel prices. However, regional airlines in capacity purchase arrangements generally do not benefit from positive trends in ticket prices, ancillary revenue, such as baggage and food and beverage fees, the number of passengers enplaned or decreasing fuel prices, because the major airlines retain passenger fare volatility risk and fuel costs associated with the regional airline flight. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Prorate Arrangements. Under a prorate arrangement (also referred to as a “prorate agreement” or “revenue-sharing” arrangement), the major airline and regional airline negotiate a passenger fare proration formula for specifically identified routes, pursuant to which the regional airline receives a percentage of the ticket revenues for those passengers traveling for one portion of their trip on the regional airline and the other portion of their trip on the major airline. On the other hand, the regional airline receives all of the passenger fare when a passenger purchases a ticket on a route solely operated by the regional airline. Substantially all costs associated with the regional airline flight are borne by the regional airline. In a prorate arrangement, the regional airline may realize increased profits as ticket prices and passenger loads increase or fuel prices decrease and, correspondingly, the regional airline may realize decreased profits as ticket prices and passenger loads decrease or fuel prices increase. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have code-share agreements with Delta, United, American and Alaska. During the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 87% of our flying agreements revenue related to capacity purchase agreement flights, where Delta, United, American and Alaska controlled scheduling, ticketing, pricing and seat inventories. The remainder of our flying agreements revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020 related to prorate flights for Delta, United or American, where we controlled scheduling, pricing and seat inventories, and shared passenger fares with Delta, United or American according to prorate formulas. We ceased operating under a prorate agreement with American during the 2020 calendar year. The routes placed under our prorate arrangements typically include flight service between one of our partners’ hub cities and a city not served under our capacity purchase arrangements.
Under our capacity purchase arrangements, our major airline partners compensate us for our costs of owning or leasing the aircraft on a monthly basis. The aircraft compensation structure varies by agreement but is intended to cover either our aircraft principal and interest debt service costs, our aircraft depreciation and interest expense or our aircraft lease expense costs while the aircraft is under contract. The number of aircraft under our capacity purchase arrangements and our prorate arrangements as of December 31, 2020 is reflected in the summary below. The following summaries of our code-share agreements with our major airline partners do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the applicable agreement.

Training and Aircraft Maintenance
SkyWest provides substantially all training to our crew members and maintenance personnel at our training facilities. Our employees perform routine airframe and engine maintenance along with periodic inspections of equipment at our maintenance facilities. We also use third-party vendors for certain airframe and engine maintenance work.
Fuel
Our capacity purchase agreements with Delta, United, American and Alaska require the respective major airline partner to pay for fuel costs, either directly to the fuel vendor or reimburse us for the fuel costs we incur under those agreements, thereby reducing our exposure to fuel price fluctuations. Under our prorate agreements with Delta and United, we are responsible for the costs to operate the flights, including fuel costs, and therefore we are exposed to fuel price fluctuations for flights operated under our prorate agreements. During the year ended December 31, 2020, United, Delta and American purchased the majority of the fuel for our aircraft flying under their respective capacity purchase agreements directly from their fuel vendors. Historically, we have not experienced problems with the availability of fuel and believe we will be able to obtain fuel in quantities sufficient to meet our existing and anticipated future requirements at competitive prices. Standard industry fuel purchase contracts generally do not provide protection against fuel price increases, nor do they ensure availability of supply. We typically purchase fuel from third-party suppliers for our prorate agreements. A substantial increase in the price of jet fuel for flights we operate under our prorate agreements, or the lack of adequate fuel supplies in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
Human Capital Resources
Employee Profile
As of December 31, 2020, we employed 12,502 full-time equivalent employees, consisting of 5,090 pilots, 3,834 flight attendants, 961 airport operations personnel, 1,269 mechanics, 777 other maintenance personnel, 162 dispatchers and 409 operational support and administrative personnel. All our employees are employed by SkyWest Airlines. Certain SkyWest Airlines employees also provide administrative support to the SkyWest Leasing segment. Approximately 90.5% of these employees were represented by in-house labor associations that have entered into collective bargaining agreements regarding employee compensation and work rules. None of these employees are currently represented by an outside union. Outside union organizing efforts among our employees do occur from time to time and may continue in the future. If unionization efforts are successful, we may be subjected to increased risks of work interruption or stoppage and/or incur additional expenses associated with a change in labor representation of our employees. SkyWest Airlines has never experienced a work stoppage due to a strike or other labor dispute, and we consider our relationships with our employees to be good.
Our relations with labor are governed by the Railway Labor Act (the “RLA”), the federal law governing labor relations between air carriers and their employees. Under the RLA, a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor representative does not expire, but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date. If either party wishes to modify the terms of any such agreement, it must notify the other party in the manner prescribed by the RLA and/or described in the agreement. After receipt of such notice, the parties must meet for direct negotiations, and if no

agreement is reached, either party may request the National Mediation Board to initiate a process including mediation, arbitration, and a potential “cooling off” period that must be followed before either party may engage in “self-help.” “Self-help” includes, among other things, a strike by the representative or the imposition of proposed changes to the collective bargaining agreement by the airline. The U.S. Congress and the President have the authority to prevent “self-help” by enacting legislation that, among other things, imposes a settlement on the parties. SkyWest Airlines respects all employees’ legal rights, including the rights to free association and collective bargaining. This includes the right to decide whether to be represented by a union. Our employees are covered by the RLA. Under the RLA, employees have the right to decide whether they wish to be represented by a union. They also have the right to reject union representation. 
​
Health & Safety
​
Safety is the primary focus and foundation of culture with our first guiding principle being Health and Safety First. We expect our employees to think, plan communicate and act appropriately to prevent injury, illness or harm to themselves, fellow employees, passengers and aircraft. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic SkyWest launched various programs and initiatives to enhance the health and safety for employees, including: 
​

● | Enhanced cleaning and sanitization protocols across all aircraft and facilities
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Establishing social distancing procedures for employees
--+--------------------------------------------------------


● | Implementing mask requirement protocols
--+----------------------------------------


● | Providing gloves, masks and other personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Requiring daily health assessments for on-duty employees
--+---------------------------------------------------------


● | Implementing protocols to address COVID-19 cases and potential exposure
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Adding work-from-home flexibility for administrative employees
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


● | Regular, ongoing communication regarding impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including health and safety protocols and procedures
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
We have also implemented a Safety Management System (“SMS”) that is designed to identify, track and help mitigate potential safety risks before an incident or accident occurs. Our employees receive required SMS training to stay current with all SMS resources provided by our safety department. Employees are encouraged to participate in our voluntary programs to report potential safety concerns or violations to reduce safety risk, including, but not limited to our Aviation Safety Action Program and Safety Concern Report.
​

● | Aviation Safety Action Program is a non-punitive program that allows employees in participating work groups to self-disclose violations of policies and procedures. Each report is reviewed by an Event Review Committee who helps identify any potential trends and whether corrective actions have been put into place to prevent the problem from occurring in the future.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Safety Concern Report is a confidential program that allows all employees to identify potential safety risks within the operation. Each is reviewed and investigated, as needed, by the Safety and Quality Department. Employees may also report safety concerns to their direct manager, the facility manager, a facility safety committee member or confidentially through our safety hotline.

professional development leads, investment in targeted advertising, social media outreach, employee referrals and relationships with community-based organizations and educational institutions. 
School Partnerships and Development
We maintain relationships with numerous flight schools and educational institutions across the country that are focused on developing the next generation of aviation professionals. We typically recruit pilots and maintenance technicians that have completed required coursework from an accredited flight or maintenance school, respectively, and have obtained other applicable certifications. We also provide other programs to enhance our recruiting efforts towards individuals who are in process of completing their training, including a Pilot Pathway Program and a Maintenance Apprentice Program.

Participants benefit from the SkyWest Pilot Pathway Program through accelerated starting seniority at SkyWest, final interview privileges and access to pilot mentors. The Pilot Pathway Program allows students to remain at their campus to complete their flight training until they meet SkyWest's Airline Transport Pilot standards and achieve their required minimum hours of flight time. Each participant may also participate in SkyWest recruiting events and outreach programs on their way to fulfilling commercial pilot jobs.

Employee Reporting
Our Code of Conduct contains general guidelines for conducting business in an ethical manner. We are committed to a working environment that is safe and supports open and honest communication. We have established a reporting system for any SkyWest employee to report a violation of company policy including harassment, discrimination, drug and alcohol use, questionable financial practice, or a breach involving safety or security. A general grievance may also be filed even if an employee has already utilized their chain of command or chooses to remain anonymous. Reports can be filed using a toll-free ethics and grievance hotline or by using on online reporting system on SkyWest’s intranet.
​
Government Regulation
All interstate air carriers, including SkyWest, are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation (the “DOT”), the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (the “FAA”) and other governmental agencies. Regulations promulgated by the DOT primarily relate to economic aspects of air service. The FAA requires operating, air worthiness and other certificates; approval of personnel who may engage in flight, maintenance or operating activities; record-keeping procedures in accordance with FAA requirements; and FAA approval of flight training and retraining programs. Generally, governmental agencies enforce their regulations through, among other methods, certifications, which are necessary for the continued operations of SkyWest, and proceedings, which can result in civil or criminal penalties or revocation of operating authority. The FAA can also issue maintenance directives and other mandatory orders relating to, among other things, grounding of aircraft, inspection of aircraft, installation of new safety-related items and the mandatory removal and replacement of aircraft parts.
We believe SkyWest is in compliance in all material respects with FAA regulations and holds all operating and airworthiness certificates and licenses which are necessary to conduct our operations. We maintain current certifications and otherwise comply with the laws, rules and regulations to which we are subject. Our flight operations, maintenance programs, recordkeeping and training programs are conducted under FAA approved procedures. All air carriers operating in the United States are required to comply with federal laws and regulations pertaining to noise abatement and engine emissions. All such air carriers are also subject to certain provisions of the Federal Communications Act of 1934, as amended, because of their extensive use of radio and other communication facilities. SkyWest is also subject to certain federal and state laws relating to protection of the environment, labor relations and equal employment opportunity. We believe SkyWest is in compliance in all material respects with these laws and regulations.
Environmental Matters
We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental protection matters. These laws and regulations govern such matters as environmental reporting, storage and disposal of materials and chemicals and aircraft noise. We are, and expect in the future to be, involved in various environmental matters and conditions at, or related to, our properties. We are not currently subject to any environmental cleanup orders or actions imposed by regulatory authorities. We are not aware of any active material environmental investigations related to our assets or properties.
As the largest regional airline in the United States, we remain committed to lowering our environmental footprint while continuing to offer the best service to our customers and the communities we serve. Our board of directors has oversight of our environment-related performance. Through the use of software and training, we heavily monitor and manage our fuel trends and fuel consumption which leads to better fuel conservation and reductions in emissions. When possible, we try to mitigate the use of fuel, including by taxiing with the use of a single engine, taking 

14



steps to improve the efficiency of aircraft routing and using ground power when the plane is parked at the gate. We participate with our major airline partners in recycling programs, and we have implemented recycling initiatives in our facilities to reduce the amount of paper, plastic and other recyclables going to landfills. We have worked aggressively to reduce our reliance on paper manuals and have converted, or are in the process of converting, our manuals and our maintenance logs into electronic form, further eliminating unnecessary waste while increasing efficiencies.
Safety and Security
We are committed to the safety and security of our passengers and employees. We have taken many steps, both voluntarily and as mandated by governmental authorities, to increase the safety and security of our operations. Some of the safety and security measures we have taken with our major airline partners include: aircraft security and surveillance, aircraft cleaning procedures, positive bag matching procedures, enhanced passenger and baggage screening and search procedures, and securing of cockpit doors. We are committed to complying with future safety and security requirements.
Insurance
We maintain insurance policies we believe are of types customary in the industry and in amounts we believe are adequate to protect against material loss. These policies principally provide coverage for public liability, passenger liability, baggage and cargo liability, property damage, including coverage for loss or damage to our flight equipment, and workers’ compensation insurance. 
Seasonality
Our results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year, in part because the airline industry is subject to seasonal fluctuations and changes in general economic conditions. Our operations are somewhat favorably affected by pleasure travel on our prorate routes, historically contributing to increased travel in the summer months, and are unfavorably affected by decreased business travel during the months from November through January and by inclement weather which can result in cancelled flights, principally during the winter months. Additionally, a significant portion of our capacity purchase arrangements is based on completing flights and we typically have more scheduled flights during the summer months. We generally experience a significantly higher number of weather cancellations during the winter months, which negatively impacts our revenue during such months.
