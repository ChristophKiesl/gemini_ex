Overview
 
Hestia Insight Inc. (“Hestia”, “Hestia Insight”, or the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 19, 2003 under the name Luxshmi Investments, Inc. (“Luxshmi Investments”) until it changed its name on March 27, 2019. Luxshmi Investments ceased its operations in 2015. On November 9, 2018, the Eighth Judicial District Court of Nevada appointed Custodian Ventures, LLC (“Custodian Ventures”) as custodian for the Company, with proper notice having been given to the officers and directors of the Company, to which there was no opposition. On November 13, 2018, the Company filed a Certificate of Reinstatement with the State of Nevada, and Custodian Ventures appointed David Lazar the Company’s sole officer and director. On December 07, 2018, the Company created 5,000,000 shares of Series B common stock, par value $0.001 per share, out of the Company’s then 200,000,000 authorized shares of common stock, which such Series B Common Stock had the same powers, designation, preferences and relative participating, optional and other special rights, qualifications, limitations and restrictions as the Company’s authorized shares of common stock, except that the holder of each share of Series B Common Stock had the right to forty-one (41) votes for each share of Series B common Stock. On December 12, 2018, the Company issued 5,000,000 shares of Series B common stock (the “Series B Common Stock”) to Custodian Ventures LLC in exchange for the settlement of a portion of related party debt owed to Custodian Ventures. On February 26, 2019, the Company filed a Certificate of Designation with the State of Nevada to create Series A Preferred Stock consisting of 10,000,000 shares (the “Series A Preferred Shares”), which such Series A Preferred Shares were concurrently issued to Custodian Ventures. On March 6, 2019, Custodian Ventures transferred its Series B Common Stock and Series A Preferred Shares to Hestia Investments Inc., a Wyoming corporation (“Hestia Investments”), resulting in a change of control of the Company, concurrently upon which David Lazar resigned as the Company’s sole officer and director and Edward Lee was appointed as the sole officer and director of the Company. On March 12, 2019, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation authorizing 300,000,000 shares of capital stock, comprised of 290,000,000 shares of common stock, par value per share (the “Common Stock”) and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.00001 per share (the “Preferred Stock”). On March 27, 2019, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation (i) effecting a name change from Luxshmi Investments, Inc. to Hestia Insight Inc., and (ii) effecting a 50-to-1 reverse stock split of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock (the “Reverse Stock Split”). The Reverse Stock Split did not impact the Company’s authorized shares of common stock or preferred stock, or its par value. On May 16, 2019 the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with Hestia Investments to exchange, on a 1-for-1 basis, 27,614,200 shares of the Company’s common stock in exchange for 27,614,200 shares of Hestia Investments which were owned by 100% of the then-shareholders of Hestia Investments (the “Share Exchange Transaction”). As a result of the Share Exchange Transaction, Hestia Investments became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. On November 21, 2019, Hestia Investments returned to the Company for cancellation 4,500,000 of its 5,000,000 shares of Series B Common Stock and, accordingly, the Company cancelled the 4,500,000 shares of Series B Common Stock. On March 1, 2021, Hestia Investments returned to the Company for cancellation its remaining 500,000 shares of Series B Common Stock and, accordingly, the Company cancelled the remaining outstanding 500,000 shares of Series B Common Stock. As of March 15, 2021: (i) there are no authorized or outstanding shares of Series B common Stock, and (ii) there are 300,000,000 authorized shares of capital stock, comprised of 290,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock.

We will also consider a third avenue of investing in certain technologies. The Company entered the healthcare sector to explore emerging healthcare technologies, especially growth companies that own and develop unique sciences and technologies.

Intellectual Property
 
The Company owns no patents. We have not applied for or received patent protection in the US or any other country, and, as a result, there is a distinct risk that we will not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights in these countries. We own and control a variety of trade secrets, confidential information, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights that, in the aggregate, are of material importance to our business. We consider our trademarks, service marks, and other intellectual property to be proprietary, and rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, trade secret, non-disclosure, and contractual safeguards to protect our intellectual property rights.

Competition
 
In our current consulting business, we compete with a number of advisory firms offering similar service including consulting and strategy firms; market research, data, benchmarking, and forecasting providers; technology vendors and services firms; health care information technology firms; technology advisory firms; outsourcing firms; and specialized providers of advisory services. Other organizations, such as state and national trade associations, group purchasing organizations, non-profit think-tanks, and database companies, also may offer research, consulting, tools, and advisory services to health care organizations.
 
We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include quality and timeliness of our services, strength and depth of relationships with our clients, ability to meet the changing needs of current and prospective clients, measurable returns on customer investment, and service and affordability.
 
As our business develops and we expand through joint ventures, acquisitions and strategic partnerships in the U.S., we will have competition with other direct service providers, emerging technologies and medical communication platforms. The Company will seek to maintain a competitive advantage through intellectual property, superior quality management and cutting-edge technology.
 
Government Regulation
 
The health care industry in the U.S. is highly regulated and subject to changing political, legislative, regulatory, and other influences. Further, the healthcare industry is currently undergoing rapid change. We are uncertain how, when or in what context these new changes will be adopted or implemented. These new regulations could create unexpected liabilities for us, could cause us or our members to incur additional costs and could restrict our or our clients’ operations. Many of the laws are complex and their application to us, our clients, or the specific services and relationships we have are not always clear. Our failure to anticipate accurately the application of these laws and regulations, or our other failure to comply, could create liability for us, result in adverse publicity, and otherwise negatively affect our business. 
Employees
 
The Company has one employee. We otherwise rely on the services of independent contractors.
 
Our Offices
 
Our principal executive office is located at 400 S. 4th Street, Suite 500, Las Vegas, NV 89101.
