ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Macquarie Infrastructure Holdings, LLC ("MIH") is a Delaware limited liability company formed on February 5, 2021 and the registrant since September 22, 2021. MIH is the successor to Macquarie Infrastructure Corporation ("MIC"), a Delaware corporation formed on May 21, 2015. MIC’s predecessor, Macquarie Infrastructure Company LLC, was formed on April 13, 2004. Except as otherwise specified, all references in this Form 10-K to “MIH”, “we”, “us”, “our” and "Company" refer to Macquarie Infrastructure Holdings, LLC and its subsidiaries, or as necessary when referring to previous reporting periods or the period prior to September 22, 2021, MIC and its subsidiaries. The terms "unit", "equity interest", "stock", "security", or "shares" refers to shares of MIC prior to the Reorganization on September 22, 2021, and "units" in MIH thereafter. 
Strategic Alternatives 
In October 2019, along with actively managing our existing portfolio of businesses, our Board resolved to pursue strategic alternatives including the potential sale of our Company or its then three operating businesses as a means of unlocking additional value for equity holders. In December 2020, we completed the sale of IMTT ("IMTT Transaction").
On June 7, 2021, we entered into an agreement for the sale of our Atlantic Aviation business to KKR Apple Bidco, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company controlled by funds affiliated with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. (“KKR”), for $4.475 billion including cash and the assumption of debt and other transaction and reorganization related obligations (the "AA Transaction").
On June 14, 2021, we entered into a Merger Agreement with AMF Hawaii Holdings, LLC ("AMF Parent"), a Delaware limited liability company affiliated with Argo Infrastructure Partners, LP ("Argo"), and AMF Hawaii Merger Sub, LLC ("AMF Merger Sub"), a recently formed Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned direct subsidiary of AMF Parent (the "Merger"). Upon completion of the Merger, each of the MIH common units (excluding common units held by AMF Parent or AMF Merger Sub or common units held by MIH in treasury and common units held by any subsidiary of MIH or AMF Parent (other than AMF Merger Sub)), will be converted into the right to receive $3.83 in cash, without interest; or, if the Merger is consummated after July 1, 2022, then each such unit will be converted into the right to receive $4.11 in cash, without interest.
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, at closing, AMF Parent will pay the merger consideration to unitholders and fund transaction costs and a disposition payment to our Manager of $81.7 million if the Merger closes on or before July 1, 2022 or $56.7 million if the Merger closes after this date.
On September 21, 2021, we conducted a Special Meeting of Shareholders during which shareholders voted on and approved the AA Transaction and the Merger. As a result of the approval, we classified our Atlantic Aviation business as a discontinued operation. 
On September 22, 2021, shareholders of Macquarie Infrastructure Corporation became unitholders of Macquarie Infrastructure Holdings, LLC, a limited liability company treated as a partnership for tax purposes, on a one-for-one basis without an exchange of certificates. Commencing September 23, 2021, units of Macquarie Infrastructure Holdings, LLC traded on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the same symbol (NYSE: MIC) and with the same CUSIP number (55608B105) as previously associated with shares of Macquarie Infrastructure Corporation.
As part of the reorganization, the entity holding the businesses comprising our MIC Hawaii segment was distributed to and became a direct subsidiary of Macquarie Infrastructure Holdings, LLC. For tax purposes, the distribution was deemed to be a sale and unitholders were deemed to have received a distribution of the fair market value of the equity of MIC Hawaii.
On September 23, 2021, we completed the AA Transaction, and received $3.525 billion. Our Board elected to return certain proceeds from the AA Transaction to unitholders, declaring a one-time distribution of $37.386817 per common unit, paid on October 7, 2021 to unitholders of record as of the close of trading on October 4, 2021. The Company's common units traded with due-bills attached from October 1, 2021 through October 7, 2021 pursuant to relevant NYSE rules. In addition, MIH made a disposition payment to the Manager of $228.6 million. 
 The Merger is expected to be completed in the first half of 2022 subject to approval by the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission ("HPUC") and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions for this type of transaction. Upon the consummation of the Merger, our Company will no longer be a publicly traded entity.
Our Strategy
Our strategy is to realize value for our unitholders by completing the Merger, or an alternate transaction to the extent that the Merger is not ultimately successful. 
From an operational perspective, our strategy centers on ensuring that we continue to provide quality products to our customers in a safe and reliable manner that over the long term is consistent with Hawaii’s goals of carbon neutrality by 2045.

Our Manager
Macquarie Infrastructure Management (USA) Inc. (our "Manager") serves as the external manager of our Company. Together we are parties to a Management Services Agreement (see Exhibit 10.1 of this Form 10-K) pursuant to which our Manager provides corporate headquarters functions and services to the Company. Our Manager is a member of the Macquarie Group, a diversified international provider of financial, advisory, and investment services. The Macquarie Group is headquartered in Sydney, Australia and is a global leader in the management of infrastructure investment vehicles on behalf of third-party investors and an advisor on the acquisition, disposition, and financing of infrastructure assets.
We pay our Manager a monthly base management fee of 1/12th of 1% of our equity market capitalization less any cash balances at the holding company. For this, in accordance with the Management Services Agreement, our Manager provides normal ongoing corporate headquarters functions such as executive management, facilities, technology, employee benefits and access to services including human resources, legal, finance, tax and accounting, among others. Our Manager is responsible for and oversees the management of our business, subject to the oversight and supervision of our Board.

In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, on June 14, 2021, the Company and the Manager entered into an amendment to the Disposition Agreement providing for the calculation of the disposition payment payable to the Manager with respect to the Merger, and providing that the Management Services Agreement will terminate concurrent with the closing of the Merger and payment of all amounts payable to the Manager under the Disposition Agreement. 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Our Business
Industry Overview 
According to the Energy Information Administration, energy consumption in Hawaii is split approximately equally between the transportation market and the industrial/commercial/residential markets. Gas has an approximately 2% share of the Hawaii energy market and is used primarily by the industrial/commercial/residential markets with applications including water heating, commercial laundry service, cooking, emergency power generation, and other select uses.
Beginning with the Hawaii Clean Energy Initiative in 2008, the State of Hawaii embarked on a program to be a leader in the development and deployment of clean energy solutions. We have invested in a number of clean energy projects including a renewable natural gas facility that captures and purifies wastewater biogas for injection into the Hawaii Gas utility pipeline on Oahu. We are pursuing additional growth opportunities in support of Hawaii’s clean energy goals.
Business Overview
Our business comprises Hawaii Gas and smaller operations collectively engaged in efforts to reduce the cost and improve the reliability and sustainability of energy in Hawaii. Founded in 1904, Hawaii Gas is a combination of Hawaii’s only government-franchised gas utility and an unregulated liquefied petroleum gas ("LPG") distribution business. Hawaii Gas serves the State’s approximately 1.4 million residents and approximately 6.8 million and 2.7 million visitors in 2021 and 2020, respectively, across Oahu, Hawaii, Maui, Kauai, Molokai, and Lanai (the main islands). Visitor arrivals for 2021 and 2020 were substantially lower than in prior years due to the outbreak of COVID-19. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations” for further discussions. 
Hawaii Gas’ utility business includes the processing, distribution, and sale of synthetic natural gas ("SNG") and renewable natural gas ("RNG") and the distribution and sale of regasified liquefied natural gas ("LNG") on the island of Oahu, as well as the distribution and sale of LPG via pipeline on all of the main islands. Hawaii Gas’ unregulated business distributes LPG by truck to individual tanks located on customer sites or distributes LPG in cylinders filled at central locations to customers on all the main islands. Customers include a wide variety of industrial, commercial, residential, hospitality, military, public sector, and wholesale users.
Hawaii Gas’ primary products consist of:
Synthetic Natural Gas: The business converts a light hydrocarbon feedstock (naphtha) into SNG, predominantly comprised of methane and hydrogen, having a similar heating value to natural gas. Hawaii Gas operates the only SNG processing capability in Hawaii at its plant located on the island of Oahu. SNG is delivered by underground pipelines to utility customers throughout Oahu.
Liquefied Natural Gas: LNG is transported to Hawaii in conventional intermodal cryogenic containers from the U.S. mainland. Hawaii Gas is authorized to substitute up to 30% of its SNG production with LNG to supply customers of the regulated utility on Oahu. 
Liquefied Petroleum Gas: LPG is a generic name for a mixture of hydrocarbon gases, typically propane and butane. LPG liquefies at a relatively low pressure under normal temperature conditions and can be efficiently transported in various quantities. LPG is typically stored in cylinders or tanks and Hawaii Gas maintains the largest network of LPG storage in Hawaii. Industrial/commercial/residential applications of LPG are similar to those of natural gas and SNG. 
Renewable Natural Gas: Hawaii Gas collects, purifies, and injects biogas from the Honouliuli Wastewater Treatment Plant into the utility pipeline distribution system on Oahu. The business is evaluating a range of additional renewable natural gas sources including other wastewater treatment plants, landfills, and locally produced biomass. 
Customers
Our business provides services to industrial, commercial, residential, hospitality, military, public sector, wholesale and governmental customers and do not depend on any single customer, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on the business.
Regulation
Our utility operations are regulated by the HPUC. The HPUC exercises broad regulatory oversight and investigative authority over all public utilities in Hawaii.
Rate Regulation. The HPUC establishes the rates that Hawaii Gas can charge its utility customers via cost of service regulation. Although the HPUC sets the base rate for the gas sold by Hawaii Gas’ utility business, Hawaii Gas is permitted to pass through changes in its fuel (feedstock) costs by means of a monthly fuel adjustment charge.
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Our utility rates are established by the HPUC in periodic rate cases typically initiated by Hawaii Gas. We initiate a rate case by submitting a request to the HPUC for an increase in rates based upon, for example, increased costs related to providing services. Following initiation of the rate increase request and submissions by other intervening parties of their positions on the rate request, and potentially an evidentiary hearing, the HPUC issues a decision establishing the revenue requirements and the resulting rates that our utility will be allowed to charge.
Other Regulations. In addition to regulating utility rates, the HPUC acts on requests for the acquisition, the sale, disposition, or other exchange of utility properties, including mergers and consolidations, acts on requests for financings and approves material supply contracts.
Our operations are also regulated by agencies including the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, Department of Transportation, Environmental Protection Agency, Hawaii Department of Health, and state and local environmental agencies. 
Competition
Depending upon the end-use, Hawaii Gas competes with electricity producers and distributors as well as other gas providers, diesel, and other alternative energy sources. Electricity in Hawaii is generated by four electric utilities, various independent power producers, and commercial and residential solar installations.
Utility Operations. Hawaii Gas holds the only government franchise for utility gas services in Hawaii. This enables Hawaii Gas to utilize public easements for its pipeline distribution systems. This franchise also provides for the exclusive use of extensive below-ground distribution infrastructure that Hawaii Gas owns and maintains. Hawaii Gas competes based on price, reliability, and the energy preferences of its customers.
Non-Utility Operations. Hawaii Gas sells LPG in an unregulated market on the main islands of Hawaii. There are several other wholesale and smaller retail distributors that compete in the LPG market. Hawaii Gas believes it has a competitive advantage because of its established customer base, substantial storage facilities, distribution network, and reputation for reliable service.
Fuel Supply, SNG Plant, and Distribution System
Fuel Supply
Hawaii Gas sources naphtha feedstock for its SNG plant from Par Hawaii Refining, LLC pursuant to a contract that expires in December 2023. The majority of Hawaii Gas’ LPG is purchased from an off-island supplier pursuant to a contract that expires in December 2024. Hawaii Gas sources LNG from a U.S. mainland supplier pursuant to a contract that expired in July 2021, for which an extension is currently being negotiated. RNG feedstock is purchased from the City and County of Honolulu under a fixed rate contract that expires in December 2024.
SNG Plant and Distribution System (Utility)
Hawaii Gas processes and distributes SNG from a plant located on the west side of Oahu. A 22-mile transmission pipeline links the SNG plant to a distribution system consisting of approximately 900 miles of distribution and service pipelines transports gas to customers. On islands other than Oahu, LPG is distributed by direct deliveries from an off-island shipper and by barge from Oahu to holding facilities or baseyards on those islands. It is then distributed via pipelines to utility customers. Approximately 90% of the Hawaii Gas pipeline system is on Oahu.
Distribution System (Non-Utility)
The non-utility operation of Hawaii Gas provides LPG to customers that are not connected to Hawaii Gas’ utility pipeline system on each of the main islands. The majority of Hawaii Gas’ non-utility customers are on islands other than Oahu. LPG is transported to these islands by direct deliveries from an off-island shipper and by barge from Oahu. Hawaii Gas also owns the infrastructure by which it distributes LPG to its customers, including harbor pipelines, trucks, several holding facilities, and storage baseyards on Kauai, Maui, and Hawaii.
Environmental Permits
We require environmental operating permits, the most significant of which are air and wastewater permits required for the Hawaii Gas SNG plant.
Human Capital Management
As of December 31, 2021, we employed 354 employees, of which 215 employees, or 61%, were subject to collective bargaining agreements. We believe relations with both union and non-union employees are generally good, that these employees drive the success of our business and that supporting our employees is a foundational value of the Company. 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Our ultimate parent company has no employees as our Manager employs and seconds those individuals who serve as our chief executive officer and chief financial officer on a full-time basis and makes other personnel available as required. 
Business ethics. Our continued success relies on the preservation of our good reputation. Our Code of Business Conduct sets forth our commitment to safe, ethical, and legally compliant business practices, and outlines the values by which all employees are expected to be guided. 
Health and safety. We promote a “zero harm” culture. The workplace health and safety performance of our business is reported regularly to our board of directors. Our business has implemented comprehensive safety training programs for employees and regularly review and enhance safety protocols. In 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our business implemented pandemic response plans including remote working where possible and deployment of personal protective equipment and provided continuous communication to employees regarding steps they could take to protect themselves. To the extent permitted/possible, we are facilitating the vaccination of our employees against COVID-19.
Compensation and benefits. Our business offers market competitive compensation programs in order to attract and retain superior talent, including bonus opportunities, health and welfare benefits, wellness initiatives, time-off, employee assistance programs, and opportunities to give back to our communities through donations of time and money. 
Culture and inclusion. We are an equal opportunity employer, and we are committed to fostering a diverse, inclusive, and empowered workforce. We have established a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion committee and a women's network committee. These committees have been responsible for, among other things, conducting surveys of various employee groups on issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion and educating employees at all levels about the importance of having an employee and management team that reflect the composition of the communities they serve.
