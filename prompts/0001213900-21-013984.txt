Corporate Overview of Ondas Holdings Inc.



Ondas Holdings Inc. (the “Company”) was originally incorporated in Nevada on December 22, 2014 under the name of Zev Ventures Incorporated. On September 28, 2018, we consummated a reverse acquisition transaction to acquire a privately-held company, Ondas Networks Inc., and changed our name from “Zev Ventures Incorporated” to “Ondas Holdings Inc.” As a result, Ondas Networks Inc. (“Ondas Networks”) became our wholly owned subsidiary. We refer to this transaction as the “Acquisition.” In connection with the closing of the Acquisition, we discontinued the prior business of Zev Ventures as a reseller of sporting and concert tickets and our sole business became that of Ondas Networks.



This Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Form 10-K”) reports our business and financial results on a consolidated basis and therefore, the use of the words “we,” “our,” the “Company” and “Ondas Holdings” means Ondas Holdings Inc. and its subsidiaries. Where necessary for clarification purposes, Ondas Holdings, Ondas Networks or Zev Ventures may be used independently.



Corporate Overview of Ondas Networks Inc.



Ondas Networks was originally incorporated in Delaware on February 16, 2006 under the name of Full Spectrum Inc. On August 10, 2018, the name was changed to Ondas Networks Inc.




Ondas Networks provides wireless connectivity solutions enabling mission-critical Industrial Internet applications and services. We refer to these applications as the Mission-Critical Internet of Things (“MC-IoT”). The Company’s wireless networking products are applicable to a wide range of MC-IoT applications, which are most often located at the very edge of large industrial networks. These applications require secure, real time connectivity with the ability to process large amounts of data at the edge of large industrial networks. Such applications are required in all of the major critical infrastructure markets, including rail, electric grids, drones, oil and gas, and public safety and government, where secure, reliable and fast operational decisions are required in order to improve efficiency and ensure a high degree of safety and security. We design, develop, manufacture, sell and support FullMAX, our patented, Software Defined Radio (“SDR”) platform for secure, licensed, private, wide-area broadband networks. Our customers install FullMAX systems in order to upgrade and expand their legacy wide-area network (“WAN”) infrastructure. Our MC-IoT intellectual property has been adopted by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (“IEEE”), the leading worldwide standards body in data networking protocols, and forms the core of the IEEE 802.16s standard. Because standards-based communications solutions are preferred by our mission-critical customers and ecosystem partners, Ondas has taken a leadership position in IEEE as it relates to wireless networking for industrial markets. As such, management believes this standards-based approach supports the adoption of the Company’s technology across a burgeoning ecosystem of partners and end markets.



Our FullMAX SDR platform is an important and timely upgrade solution for privately-owned and operated wireless WANs, leveraging Internet Protocol-based communications to provide more reliability and data capacity for our mission-critical infrastructure customers. Critical infrastructure markets throughout the globe have reached an inflection point where legacy serial and analog based protocols and network transport systems no longer meet industry needs. In addition to offering enhanced data throughput, FullMAX is an intelligent networking platform enabling the adoption of sophisticated operating systems and equipment supporting next-generation MC-IoT applications over wide field areas. These new MC-IoT applications and related equipment require more processing power at the edge of large industrial networks and the efficient utilization of network capacity and scarce bandwidth resources which can be supported by the “Fog-computing” capability integrated in our end-to-end network platform. Fog-computing utilizes management software to enable edge compute processing and data and application prioritization in the field enabling our customers more reliable, real-time operating control of these new, intelligent MC-IoT equipment and applications at the edge.

We sell our products and services globally through a direct sales force and value-added sales partners to critical infrastructure providers including major rail operators, commercial and industrial drone operators, electric and gas utilities, water and wastewater utilities, oil and gas producers and pipeline operators, and for other critical infrastructure applications in areas such as homeland security and defense, and transportation. We continue to develop our value-added reseller relationships which today include a major strategic partnership with Siemens Mobility for the development of new types of wireless connectivity for the North American Rail. In addition, Ondas and JVCKenwood, a global supplier of Land Mobile Radio (LMR) systems, have jointly responded to a request from the rail industry for the design and delivery of a next generation data and voice platform.  We believe our Siemens’ partnership and our joint effort with JVCKenwood are indicative of the potential for additional Tier 1 partnerships in our other vertical markets including securing reseller relationships with major suppliers to the worldwide government and homeland security markets. These partnerships are being driven by the flexibility of our FullMAX software to support legacy industrial protocols (e.g. Push to Talk Voice, Dial-up Serial Data Communications, and Advanced Train Control System – ATCS) while simultaneously operating our state of the art MC-IoT protocols. This dual and multi-mode software capability provides major industrial customers with a seamless migration path to advanced internet-protocol-based networks. Over time, these legacy functions, like Push to Talk Voice and ATCS, are transformed into just several of many new data applications we can support.



Background



The Internet of Things (“IoT”) is transforming the way businesses and industries function with a massive shift from on-premise locally executed software to cloud computing. IoT is applicable across all global consumer, enterprise, industrial and government markets. By storing and processing data using cloud technology, there is now an ability to access, analyze and utilize vast amounts of information and liberate operators from accessing data in limited amounts. Cloud computing has enabled the access of additional features on IoT devices such as smartphones, computers and laptops without the need for investing in additional computing power or memory.



However, specific areas of IoT, particularly the mission-critical industrial markets, have additional requirements when compared to enterprise and consumer markets. With industrial markets, the bulk of the critical assets are dispersed over vast field area operations and varying geographical locations. This wide dispersion of assets shifts the emphasis from the centralized private Cloud to the network edge and Fog which requires reliance on edge computing and the processing of data in the field, closer to the source of the data generation. The primary benefit of Fog networks is to enable the execution of mission-critical functions and manage and operate intelligent field equipment and systems many of which require real-time decision-making. Edge computing is required for low-latency applications where real-time performance is critical for safety and efficient systems performance. In addition, processing data closer to the source improves reliability and offers security benefits. The Fog and edge computing advantages enabled by our FullMAX technology are now driving the adoption of our connectivity solutions by some of the largest industrial companies worldwide including the major North American freight rail operators.



In a MC-IoT wide-area network, a Fog-computing architecture requires an intelligent communications system able to manage all network resources, including edge remotes, smart equipment and machinery and other network elements such as sensor networks. Importantly, advanced MC-IoT applications require highly reliable network performance over the air with customized Quality of Service (“QoS”) standards which are not available in legacy narrowband wireless networks. The intelligent communications system is coordinated via base stations which contain network management software algorithms designed to control critical operations and distribute bandwidth across multiple edge computing applications required by customers. The Fog-computing environment can be further enhanced by high-power edge remote radios with embedded computing power and software providing the ability to host MC-IoT software applications or to reliably interface with intelligent equipment and sensor networks deployed across the field of operations. The interplay between base stations and remote edge radios requires a robust software communications layer to ensure that network performance and operating data is properly communicated to the corporate cloud located in the network operations center.

For example, the North American freight rail operators are seeking to deploy new, on-locomotive and wayside MC-IoT technologies along the track in order to reliably enhance safety and improve efficiency and profitability of train operations. These rail operators currently operate antiquated legacy communications systems utilizing serial based narrowband wireless technologies for voice and data communications. These legacy wireless networks have limited data capacity and are unable to support the adoption of new, intelligent train control and management systems. In addition to data capacity challenges, rail operators need to reliably cover the vast and often remotely located rail track and related infrastructure which extends nationwide over 140,000 miles. The rail operators require a next-generation, robust broadband system with significantly increased data throughput capacity and Fog networking capability. A transition to integrated Fog-computing communications wireless systems will enable the rail operators to drive more intelligence to the edge of their operating environments enabling real time automation and better operator control of many critical operating systems related to train control, crossing safety, train and track integrity and drone operations. This upgrade cycle is being driven by a recent key event which occurred in May 2020 in which the Class 1 rail systems in the U.S. were awarded new nationwide “greenfield” wideband radio spectrum by the Federal Communications Committee (“FCC”). As part of the award, the rail operators are required, over the next three years, to vacate a series of legacy narrowband channels. The completion of this multiyear negotiation between the FCC and other licensed users is projected to generate a major network upgrade cycle for the rail industry.



There are many other mission-critical industries across the globe operating private networks that are similarly constrained by their legacy narrowband wireless communications systems. The lack of bandwidth, appropriate software and integrated edge computing and Fog capability are a bottleneck for the adoption of next-generation MC-IoT applications and intelligent equipment that can serve to create more efficient, profitable, and safer operations. This can be seen in Land Mobile Radio (“LMR”) markets where legacy critical voice networks lack increasingly valuable data capacity and next generation networks such as FullMAX can provide voice over IP as a data application. Similarly, the adoption of smart grid technologies by electric utilities, well pump automation systems by oil producers and new navigation systems for commercial and industrial drones require new, robust wireless network platforms such as FullMAX that can also offer the capability of Fog-computing architectures.



COVID-19



In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) was identified in Wuhan, China, and has subsequently spread to other regions of the world, and has resulted in increased travel restrictions, business disruptions and emergency quarantine measures across the world including the United States.

The Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations were impacted from the COVID-19 pandemic for the year ended December 31, 2020 as follows:




● | sales and marketing efforts were disrupted as our business development team was unable to travel to visit customers and customers were unable to receive visitors for on-location meetings; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | field activity for testing and deploying our wireless systems was delayed due to the inability for our field service team to install and test equipment for our customers; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | supply chain disruptions led to component shortages and inefficiencies in and delays in producing and delivering equipment for certain purchase orders; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | delays in fulfilling purchase orders reduced our cash flow from operations. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




In the first quarter of 2020, we reduced our business activity to critical operations only, and furloughed 80% of our workforce. Per orders issued by the Health Officer of the County of Santa Clara, our corporate offices and facilities were closed, except for functions related to the support of remote workers and product support related to the essential transportation sector. On May 13, 2020, we reopened our corporate offices and headquarters and as of December 31, 2020 we have no employees remaining on furlough. Of the 18 employees previously furloughed, 14 are currently employed by us.



On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) was enacted. The CARES Act is an approximately $2 trillion emergency economic stimulus package in response to the Coronavirus outbreak, which among other things contains numerous income tax provisions. Some of these tax provisions are expected to be effective retroactively for years ending before the date of enactment. The Company applied for, and received, funds under the Paycheck Protection Program in the amount of $666,091. The application for these funds requires the Company to, in good faith, certify that the current economic uncertainty made the loan request necessary to support operations of the Company. This certification further requires the Company to consider its current business activity and ability to access other sources of liquidity sufficient to support ongoing operations in a manner that is not significantly detrimental to the business. The receipt of these funds, and the forgiveness of the loan related to these funds, is dependent on the Company having initially qualified for the loan and qualifying for the forgiveness of such loan based on our future adherence to the forgiveness criteria. The Company is in discussion with the lender regarding the forgiveness of the loan, however no determination has been made at the time of the filing of this Form 10-K.



The Company expects its business, financial condition and results of operations will be impacted from the COVID-19 pandemic during 2021, primarily due to the slowdown of customer activity during 2020 and 2021. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing and remains an unknown risk for the foreseeable future. The extent to which the coronavirus may impact our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus. As a result, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the full extent of the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic on its future business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if the Company were to experience any new impact to its operations or incur additional unanticipated costs and expenses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, such operational delays and unanticipated costs and expenses there could be a further adverse impact on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations during 2021.



Although COVID-19 has had an immediate near-term impact on our business operations, we also believe the one outcome of the pandemic will be to reinforce the need for more reliable private commercial and industrial communications. This can be seen specifically in the need for new Unmanned Aerial Systems (“UAS”) solutions including the safe command and control of drones as remote delivery method. In a recent filling at the FCC, the Drone Responders Public Safety Alliance stated, (the) “current COVID-19 pandemic only emphasizes this need, as remote methods of commercial delivery will only become more essential to serve the public good. In light of the current COVID-19 crisis, UAS have the potential to deliver payloads of medical equipment and supplies.”



Our Strategy



Our goal is to be a global leader in providing secure wireless connectivity solutions enabling high-bandwidth, mission-critical Industrial Internet applications and services. We intend to leverage our patented FullMAX technology and the IEEE 802.16s standard to achieve this goal. We have adopted a “Deep and Wide” marketing strategy designed to drive adoption of our mission-critical connectivity solutions into global critical infrastructure end markets. Our strategy is to deeply penetrate the Class 1 Freight Rail, government and aviation markets while continuing the expansion of our distribution and support capabilities alongside ecosystem partners such as Siemens into adjacent vertical end markets such as oil and gas, electric, gas and water utilities and military sectors.



The key elements of our growth strategy include the following:




● | Deliver on sales pipeline opportunities. Our marketing efforts have generated the potential for significant sales in our targeted end markets. Our sales activity in the North American Class 1 Railroad sector has resulted in several pilot programs for multiple railroad operators. Once we successfully complete field testing, we expect to work with our customers to design and develop a network deployment strategy which we expect to lead to purchase orders for equipment and services. We have similar field testing and initial system deployments planned in the UAS markets, security, electric and gas utilities, and oil and gas markets.

● | Secure additional marketing partnerships and OEM relationships. We service blue chip customers in critical infrastructure sectors with standards-based, mission-critical connectivity solutions. Those customers value the experience and resources provided by additional ecosystem partners that help support the growth of the MC-IoT end markets. As we have done with Siemens Mobility, we intend to pursue marketing and OEM partnership agreements with other Tier 1 global industrial and communications equipment suppliers that have extensive reach and domain expertise in our targeted end markets. These relationships will offer customers greater choice, expanded levels of after-market support and services, and the potential for greater product integration with intelligent equipment, and systems that are increasingly being deployed by our critical infrastructure customers. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Develop new products and features to continuously improve our customer value. We introduced our Mercury remote radio in the first quarter of 2020 in order to address the expanding MC-IoT market for high volume, lower cost endpoint radios. Our Mercury radios are integrated into our existing FullMAX private network solutions, are compliant with IEEE 802.16s and can be utilized in both Tier 1 and Tier 2 network configurations. We will continue to enhance our SDR capabilities to aggregate non-contiguous channels with a focus on traditional licensed LMR frequency bands to provide IP data networking solutions in historically analog push-to-talk (PTT) bands. We will also work with ecosystem partners to develop dual-mode products to assist in the migration from legacy networks to our next-generation FullMAX platform.

● | Expand our MC-IoT capabilities via partnerships, joint ventures, or acquisitions. In addition to internal investment and development, we will actively pursue external opportunities to enhance our product offerings and solutions for our critical infrastructure customers via joint ventures, partnerships, and acquisitions. This activity will be focused on companies with complementary technologies or product offerings or synergistic distribution strategies. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




In executing our go-to-market strategy, we intend to monetize our software-based intellectual property and grow revenue and cash flow with embedded FullMAX software sales, Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) arrangements, IP royalties based on Ondas software and through additional services provided to customers and ecosystem partners. Customers deploy our connectivity and Fog-computing platform in private networks that designed for lifetimes of 10 – 15 years or even longer. Our FullMAX platform is software-defined and offers customers flexibility to expand capacity and evolve network utilization. Similarly, our ecosystem partners often integrate our FullMAX software and wireless capability into their own equipment and systems which their customers purchase and deploy are also designed for long lifetimes. As such, we believe our software solutions provide ongoing revenue opportunities and sales models both related to both connectivity value and edge computing capability. Customers and ecosystem partners will require ongoing FullMAX system and security enhancements and for us to design additional features which create opportunities for additional, recurring revenue and profit streams. Our monetization strategies include:



Systems sales: Our FullMAX deployments are typically large, mission-critical wide-area networks deployed and privately operated by our industrial and government customers. These end-to-end system deployments involve sales consisting of both base stations and edge radio end points with embedded FullMAX software and network management software and tools.



Software and hardware maintenance agreements: Our customers contract for extended software and hardware maintenance which provide them with critical ongoing support for their installed network. These SaaS contracts provide revenue to Ondas in the year following an initial installation. Software maintenance licenses entitle the customer to ongoing software and security upgrades as well as enabling the provision of additional system features. Similarly, hardware maintenance programs provide customers extended equipment warranty terms for an installed network. These SaaS maintenance arrangements allow our customers to continue to maintain a modern, flexible and upgradeable network over a long period of time. These agreements may extend for multiple years given the long average life of the installed and growing network.



Licensing / Royalties: In certain system deployments, our ecosystem partners will choose to embed FullMAX software into their own hardware and software platforms providing Ondas with an ongoing per device multi-year revenue stream. Licensing is an effective way for an ecosystem partner to jumpstart customer activity. Alternatively, a partner may choose to develop software based on our intellectual property generating royalty revenue.



Other Services: We provide ancillary services directly related to the sale of our wireless communications products which include wireless network design, systems engineering, radio frequency planning, software configuration, product training, installation, and onsite support. Furthermore, we also provide engineering and product development services to ecosystem partners who are interested in integrating their intelligent equipment with our FullMAX SDR platform and need our expertise to do so.



The Siemens Partnership



In April 2020, we entered into a strategic partnership with Siemens Mobility, a separately managed company of Siemens AG (“Siemens”), to jointly develop wireless communications products for the North American Rail Industry based on Siemens’ Advanced Train Control System (“ATCS”) protocol and our MC-IoT platform. These dual-mode ATCS/MC-IoT radio systems will support Siemens’ extensive installed base of ATCS radios as well as offer Siemens’ customers the ability to support a host of new advanced rail applications utilizing our MC-IoT wireless system. These new applications, including Advanced Grade Crossing Activation and Monitoring, Wayside Inspection, Railcar Monitoring and support for next generation signaling and train control systems, are designed to increase railroad productivity, reduce costs and improve safety. The new ATCS-compatible products will be introduced in two phases, including a field-selectable ATCS or MC-IoT remote radio and a related MC-I0T base station, both which will be available by the end of the first quarter of 2021 available in the first quarter of 2021. Furthermore, Siemens has begun to market and sell Siemens-branded MC-IoT wireless systems based on our technology platforms.

The North American Rail Network is vast in scale, consisting of 140,000 miles of track, 25,000 locomotives, and 1.6 million railcars. Within this large footprint, we believe there are 200,000 highway crossings, with at least 65,000 of the crossings equipped with electronic systems today, a number which is expected to increase in the coming years. A significant portion of the communications infrastructure has been in operation for more than 20 years and now requires a technological upgrade to support new applications and increased capacity requirements. Our MC-IoT platform offers an excellent migration path for these applications. The Class I Railroads value the ability of the Ondas’ frequency-agnostic SDR architecture to enable a substantial capacity increase utilizing the railroad’s existing wireless infrastructure and dedicated FCC licensed radio frequencies, as well as the flexibility to adapt to and take advantage of future changes in spectrum availability.



We believe the Siemens partnership validates our wireless connectivity solutions and will accelerate the adoption of our wireless technology in the North American Class I Railroad market. We believe Siemens has both the sales and marketing reach and support to drive our technology to wide scale acceptance. Siemens also brings Ondas access to the North American transit market where our technology has broad potential. In addition to our strategic partnership with Siemens Mobility, we expect to establish additional formal sales and marketing partnerships and OEM relationships with other leading Tier 1 vendors of industrial equipment in 2021.



The Market for Our Products



Our FullMAX system of Software Defined Radios, base stations, fixed and mobile edge radios and supporting technology is designed to enable highly secure and reliable Industrial-grade connectivity for truly mission-critical applications. We offer a range of products with different options for narrowband and broadband applications. Our SDR platforms offer unmatched flexibility with respect to the radio frequencies in which they operate (ranging from 70 MHz to 6 GHz) and channel size configurations (ranging from 12.5 kHz to 10 MHz).




The global end markets for our MC-IoT solutions are established, large, and we believe, poised to grow rapidly given the key role connectivity will play in next generation IoT-type applications. Firms like Cisco Systems, Inc. and Gartner, Inc. say that there are billions of connected IoT devices installed throughout the economy; many of which are deployed for industrial applications. Dell’Oro Group, Inc. estimates that Wide Area IoT spending, including low power WAN deployments with which we compete, will reach $33.0 billion for carriers and infrastructure vendors by 2022, growing approximately 2.5Xs from 2017. In many of our industrial end markets, we believe the adoption of low-cost edge computing and increased penetration of “smart machinery” is driving demand for next-generation networks for IoT applications such as those powered by FullMAX. Demand for edge computing solutions is growing rapidly and adopting edge computing applications can help our customers run their businesses more efficiently, profitably, and safely. According to MarketsandMarkets the market for global edge computing solutions is expected to grow over 34% per year from $3.6 billion in 2020 to $15.7 billion by 2025. Ondas is leveraging its industry expertise and FullMAX connectivity and Fog-computing platform to develop an enhanced range of products to capitalize on this expanding opportunity with the goal of becoming the leading supplier of private industrial networks.

According to research firm MarketsandMarkets, worldwide spending on communications by the electric utility sector is estimated to grow over 15% per year and is expected to reach $15.4 billion annually by 2021. This growth is being driven by distributed and renewable power generation projects and regulatory requirements for secure and reliable power generation and distribution as the industry deals with aging infrastructure. Market forecasts for oil and gas producers, water and wastewater utilities, homeland security, transportation and other critical infrastructure segments are similarly large. According to Market Reports World, the global LMR market is expected to reach $32.2 billion by 2027. In oil and gas, MarketsandMarkets forecasts that spending on oilfield communications will reach $4.5 billion by 2022, which would represent an annual growth of 7.9% from today. In addition, the U.S. Railroad sector is expected to spend over $10.0 billion in aggregate by 2020 to fully implement Positive Train Control (“PTC”) safety functions as required by Federal regulations according to the American Association of Railroads. We estimate the addressable market for our FullMAX solution with the North American Class 1 Railroads is over $1.5 billion. Our innovative, standards-based FullMAX system offers Unmanned Aircraft Systems (“UAS”) operators and users a high-performing, cost-effective solution for reliable command and control of drones. The end market opportunity for UAS network solutions is large and rapidly growing. According to analysts at Barclays Capital, spending on commercial drones will rise more than 10-fold over five years from $4 billion to nearly $43 billion in 2024. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) raised its forecast in 2019 and now expects over 450,000 commercial drones flying in the U.S. by 2022, a four-fold increase from 2017. Improvements in drone navigation capability allowing for the safe command and control of industrial UAS beyond visual line of sight (“BVLOS”) will be a key enabler driving the growth of the UAS market. Industrial UAS applications offer significant value to our core critical infrastructure markets and the economy at large, which supports the growth outlook for this market. In addition to broad use by government agencies and agriculture markets, utilities, railroads, and oil and gas industries are actively evaluating, or are in the process of incorporating, the extensive use of drones into their business operations. These critical infrastructure sectors can realize substantial savings and improved reliability in operations from deploying drones to monitor and inspect their remote infrastructure and assets.



Our Products and Services



Ondas was founded in 2006 to develop a new type of radio platform specifically to meet the evolving data needs of large industrial and government customers and markets.  These markets are differentiated from consumer markets in that the customers assets are dispersed over very wide and remote geographies with specific challenges to installation, maintenance, and upgrades. These challenges led us to design a new type of software-based radio platform capable of supporting a long useful life to the network hardware.  Instead of using low cost, off the shelf, dedicated communications chipsets (“ASICs”), we selected powerful programmable embedded general-purpose processors, DSPs, and FPGAs, all of which are software upgradable. Our software defined radio (“SDR”) architecture, with more than 12 years in development and supported by a team of 45 software engineers, allows us to customize almost any aspect of the air interface protocol, the key components of which are patented and have been incorporated into new IEEE wireless standards. The ability to constantly improve customer networks and hosted software applications with flexible, over-the-air software upgrade creates customer stickiness with high switching costs.



FullMAX Software: Our FullMAX SDR platform is designed to enable highly secure and reliable industrial-grade connectivity for truly mission-critical applications. An end-to-end FullMAX network consists of connected wireless base stations, fixed and mobile edge radios and supporting technology all enabled by critical software developed and owned by Ondas. The target customers for our products operate in critical infrastructure sectors of the global economy. Private wireless networks are typically the preferred choice of these large industrial customers with business operations spanning large field areas. Private networks provide enhanced protection against cyber terrorism, as well as natural and man-made disasters, and the ability for the operator to maintain and control their desired quality of service.



In many of our industrial end markets, the adoption of low-cost Edge computing and increased penetration of “smart machinery” and sensors is driving demand for higher bandwidth, next-generation networks for IoT applications such as those powered by FullMAX. These new technologies often require Fog-computing capabilities to maximize their utility to customers. The Fog-computing capability integrated in our end-to-end FullMAX SDR platform is valued by our customers and ecosystem partners as they seek to leverage the value of MC-IoT applications for improved safety, efficiency, and profitability. Our IEEE 802.16s compliant equipment is designed to optimize performance of unused or underutilized low frequency licensed radio spectrum and narrower channels. We do this through various patented software algorithms including via “spectrum harvesting” techniques which aggregate narrowband channels to create increased broadband network capacity. Our channel aggregation algorithms include the ability to aggregate hard to utilize, non-contiguous narrowband channels and are a hallmark feature of a FullMAX broadband system. Consequently, a FullMAX wireless network is significantly less expensive to build compared to traditional LTE and 5G networks given its ability to optimize the performance of lower cost, low frequency radio spectrum and provide much greater coverage and capacity.

The critical software algorithms powering our end-to-end FullMAX wireless SDR platform and related Fog-computing architecture have been developed by and are owned by Ondas. FullMAX is an intelligent networking system which integrates core network management systems with edge computing resources including computing hardware and MC-IoT software applications. In the MC-IoT Fog enabled by FullMAX, base stations are enabled with a highly configurable Quality of Service algorithms which coordinate the data traffic within the Fog for both the edge radio and the resident MC-IoT applications. The intelligent base stations control and manage all network resources including the Ondas edge remotes; dynamically allocating bandwidth, prioritizing data packets and managing edge applications. The intelligent software-managed base stations determine whether to process data at the edge, distribute data traffic across the Fog to other edge remote radios or to transport information to the corporate Cloud. Ondas’ Edge remotes have embedded compute capability and are able to host MC-IoT applications including those from third party vendors via virtualized software systems managed in docker / container architectures and can also manage data from intelligent equipment or sensor networks that interface with the edge remotes in the field. The Ondas software-managed edge remotes offer security via authentication, multi-layer encryption and virtual software firewalls which are requirements for mission-critical data networks.

FullMAX System: FullMAX base stations and edge radios are deployed by our customers to create wide-area wireless communication networks. A FullMAX network provides end-to-end IP connectivity, allowing critical infrastructure providers to extend their secure corporate networks into the far reaches of their service territories. A FullMAX network also provides more data capacity allowing our customers to transition legacy applications such as critical Push-to-Talk Voice operating in legacy LMR networks to Voice over IP data networks which provide network capacity for other data requirements alongside voice. We refer to these networks as Land Mobile Data Radio (LMDR) systems.



FullMAX radios can operate at high transmit power (up to 100 watts) at both the base station and edge remote sites providing fixed and mobile data connectivity up to 30 miles from the tower site. This results in up to 2,800 square miles of coverage from a single FullMAX tower compared with the 28 square miles typically supported by other 4G technologies and three-square miles by 5G technologies. This dramatically reduces the infrastructure cost of building and operating a private Fog network. For example, to cover a territory of over 10,000 square miles may require only four FullMAX towers compared with more than 350 typical 4G towers, depending on the topography of the region.

TARGET MARKETS AND APPLICATIONS







We are dedicated to promoting standards-based wireless connectivity solutions for our customers. Our FullMAX platform is compliant with the mission critical wireless Industrial Internet IEEE 802.16s. The specifications in the IEEE 802.16s standard are primarily based on our FullMAX technology, and many of our customers and industrial partners actively supported our technology during the IEEE standards-making process. In January 2020, a new working group was launched by the IEEE to establish IEEE 802.16t, a further evolution of this wireless standard. The IEEE 802.16t working group includes industry-leading trade organizations such as the Utilities Technology Council (UTC) and the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), as well as representation from world-leading transportation and oil and gas companies. We expect our technology to remain a prominent feature of this evolving standard.



We believe that the current standard and its evolution have been instrumental in broadening the appeal of our FullMAX platform globally across all critical infrastructure markets. Since the publishing of IEEE 802.16s in November 2017, there has been a significant increase in interest from customers in end markets including oil and gas, water and wastewater, transportation, aviation and homeland security, as well as for the command and control of industrial drones. We believe we are currently the only supplier able to offer IEEE 802.16s compliant systems and are actively working with customers and industry partners to help develop and support a multi-vendor MC-IoT industry ecosystem for this standard.



Our FullMAX system of wireless base stations, fixed and mobile remote radios and supporting technology is designed to enable highly secure and reliable industrial-grade connectivity for truly mission-critical applications. The target customers for our products operate in critical infrastructure sectors of the global economy. Private wireless networks are typically the preferred choice of these large industrial customers with business operations spanning large field areas. Private networks provide enhanced protection against cyber terrorism, as well as natural and man-made disasters, and the ability for the operator to maintain and control their desired quality of service. Our IEEE 802.16s compliant equipment is designed to optimize performance of unused or underutilized low frequency licensed radio spectrum and narrower channels. A FullMAX wireless network is significantly less expensive to build compared to traditional LTE and 5G networks given its ability to optimize the performance of lower cost radio spectrum (non-traditional LTE and 5G bands) and provide much greater coverage and capacity. In many of our industrial end markets, the adoption of low-cost edge computing and increased penetration of “smart machinery” and sensors is driving demand for higher bandwidth, next-generation networks for IoT applications such as those powered by FullMAX.

Effective April 24, 2020, we entered into a strategic partnership with Siemens Mobility, Inc., a separately managed company of Siemens AG (“Siemens”), to jointly develop wireless communications products for the North American Rail Industry by integrating Siemens’ Advanced Train Control System (“ATCS”) protocol with our MC-IoT platform to create (i) a dual-mode 900 MHz over-the-air ATCS compatible, MC-IoT capable base station radio and (ii) a dual-purpose 900 MHz, over-the-air ATCS compatible, MC-IoT capable wayside ratio. These dual-mode ATCS/MC-IoT radio systems will support Siemens’ extensive installed base of ATCS radios and offer Siemens’ customers the ability to support a host of new advanced rail applications utilizing Ondas’ MC-IoT wireless system. These new applications, including Advanced Grade Crossing Activation and Monitoring, Wayside Inspection, Railcar Monitoring and support for next generation signaling and train control systems, are designed to increase railroad productivity, reduce costs and improve safety. The new ATCS-compatible products will be introduced in two phases, including a field-selectable ATCS or MC-IoT remote radio and a related MC-IOT base station, both of which will be available by the end of the first quarter of 2021. Siemens began to market and sell Siemens-branded MC-IoT wireless systems based on our technology platforms to the North American Rail industry in the second quarter 2020.



Our FullMAX platform has been selected by Aura Network Systems (“Aura”) to be the connectivity backbone for the deployment of a nationwide wireless network for operators of UAS. Our technology was selected for its unique capabilities to operate with very high reliability and high throughput using narrowband licensed VHF frequencies. Our technology solves the need for robust command and control functionality which is required by the FAA to operate commercial, industrial and governmental drones beyond visual line of site (BVLOS). The network, once fully deployed, will be capable of supporting the simultaneous operation of tens of thousands of drones throughout US Airspace. We are currently working with Aura and expect to engage multiple Tier 1 ecosystem partners to fully commercialize the network. Organizations that have publicly announced their support for Aura’s network include Aerospace Industries Association (AIA) AeroVironment, Inc., AiRXOS Inc. (GE Aviation), the Commercial Drone Alliance, Crown Castle International Corp., the Edison Electric Institute, General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc., the National Public Safety Telecommunications Council (NPSTC) and Xcel Energy Services Inc.



Our FullMAX platform also addresses the increasing need for data capability in the private Land Mobile Radio (LMR) push-to-talk mission critical voice markets. Land mobile radio refers to the two-way mobile and handheld radio-based systems with the ability to offer seamless communication to field personnel working across industrial and governmental sectors. LMR systems have traditionally offered very limited data capacity (9.6 kbps) alongside voice-centric services. Our FullMAX platform offers the unique ability to utilize narrow and non-adjacent channels in traditional LMR radio spectrum bands with 300x or greater capacity creating a Land Mobile Data Radio (LMDR) platform. Our LMDR network platform simultaneously supports legacy voice services alongside the growing demand for data services. This advancement allows customers to deploy our FullMAX data platform where push-to-talk, critical voice services are provided as one of multiple data applications running on the network. LMR markets are seeing a growing demand for remote monitoring and control capabilities driven by the need for efficiencies (e.g., rail sensor bed networks) and new sensor-based networks to monitor climate conditions. We see the need to upgrade these networks across all industries and government users worldwide.



In addition to selling our FullMAX solutions for dedicated private wide area networks, we offer private mission-critical wireless services to industrial and governmental customers in select regions of the United States. In June 2019, we acquired 2 MHz of licensed spectrum in the 700 MHz band including the State of Alaska and four strategic industrial counties bordering the Gulf of Mexico.  These counties are gateways into the Gulf of Mexico for the industrial transport of goods (e.g., Liquid Natural Gas) and include the ports of Cameron Parish Port in Louisiana and Port Arthur and Port Lavaca in Texas.

Target Customers



The target customers for our products operate in critical infrastructure sectors of the global economy. Private wireless networks are typically the preferred choice of these large industrial customers with business operations spanning large field areas. Private networks provide enhanced protection against cyber terrorism, as well as natural and man-made disasters, and the ability for the operator to maintain and control their desired quality of service. The existing public carrier networks based on LTE and 5G technology are designed for mobile consumer usage and are not architected for MC-IoT applications. Wi-Fi-based IoT offerings have similar shortcomings related to security, availability, and reliability, which are likewise unacceptable for mission-critical functions.



Our FullMAX technology offers a next-generation upgrade path for existing private networks currently managed by our industrial customers. These networks will typically be deployed on the existing tower and backhaul infrastructure owned by our customers thereby reducing incremental infrastructure costs. We offer much faster data throughput and more efficient radio frequency utilization relative to existing private networks that are based largely on legacy, proprietary technologies. We believe the IEEE 802.16s standard, and its next iteration as 802.16t, are important catalysts for the MC-IoT upgrade cycle as our critical infrastructure customers increasingly prefer standards-based technology. Standards-based solutions offer a deeper ecosystem of suppliers resulting in more price and service competition and lower costs. The standard is relevant for all critical infrastructure providers with operations covering large field areas making the market potential sizeable enough to attract a deep ecosystem of hardware and software solutions providers along with ancillary service organizations to support our customers.



We believe our FullMAX powered WANs serve the high end of the value chain as compared to mass-market, low-powered, narrowband solutions such as LoRa, Sigfox and NB-IoT technologies which are being offered by public carriers. Our customers require wide-area coverage with broadband speeds and low latency performance for operating environments managed over large field areas, which we can provide cost effectively.





13











Customer Activity



We launched a business expansion plan in 2018 to leverage our world-class, standards based FullMAX platform and penetrate the large, fast-growing critical infrastructure end markets we target. We grew our dedicated sales resources to broaden our marketing efforts beyond the electric utility sector, which had historically been our primary end market. Since the second half of 2018, we have significantly increased customer engagement in the transportation, security, LMR and UAS end markets and our qualified pipeline has grown. A potential customer is included in our qualified pipeline after the potential customer expresses interest in our products and we have confirmed that the potential customer has an application for which our FullMAX platform would be well-suited.



We have multiple, ongoing testing and pilot programs with BNSF (Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway) and CSX Corporation, two North American Class I freight railroad operators in addition to lab testing with other rail operators. There are seven Class I freight railroad operators in North America, all of which run multiple, frequency-specific networks for different applications. Our FullMAX platform has the flexibility to operate in all these frequency bands and will allow these customers the opportunity to better utilize their radio spectrum and add more high-value, data-intensive applications to their operations. Our initial field work with these rail customers has been for applications related to train control systems in the 900 MHz frequency band where the FCC has recently awarded our railroad customers new radio spectrum in connection with the Anterix 900 Report and Order. We are working with Siemens to introduce our FullMAX platform and intelligent Fog-computing capability in the form of a shared network to the Class 1 railroads in the 900 MHz frequency band. We expect multiple rail customers to participate in extensive lab and field work in connection with the planning for a commercial rollout beginning in 2021. We expect a 900 MHz network upgrade cycle across all Class I railroad systems over the next few years in order to comply with FCC license requirements and meet business needs related to safety and profitability.





14







We are also currently lab testing with rail customers in the 160 MHz land mobile radio (LMR) network, which is where the Class I railroads run their legacy critical voice LMR applications. We believe the rails are exploring options to upgrade their legacy 160 MHz network to better utilize the frequency band and add additional network capacity for new data requirements related to MC-IoT applications. The Class 1 railroads would like this next-generation 160 MHz network to offer critical voice over IP in addition to carrying new data traffic. We believe our FullMAX platform meets these new, next-generation network requirements for a Land Mobile Data Radio (LMDR) system. We are also jointly developing with Siemens an on-locomotive wireless system with FullMAX embedded in Siemens Head-of-Train (“HOT”) on-train systems. The HOT wireless system will utilize the Class 1 railroads existing 450 MHz band for on-train telemetry data applications. Siemens will have worldwide marketing rights to this HOT product with our embedded FullMAX technology. Our activity with the freight railroads has led to similar network opportunities amongst Class II railroad operators. We expect large commercial-scale orders from Class I railroads in 2021.



We entered the aviation services market in late 2019 when we received a purchase order for base stations and remote radios from Aura, who plans to deploy a nationwide network for the command and control of commercial drones. We completed the fulfillment of that purchase order in July 2020 and Aura has completed the initial nationwide deployment to satisfy FCC license requirements. We are now working closely with Aura and ecosystem partners to fully commercialize an end-to-end system designed to develop an FAA-compliant industrial UAS navigation system. We received a purchase order for the next phase of commercialization in March 2021 and expect additional purchase orders in 2021 for development work related to system commercialization, testing equipment and demonstrations networks related to Aura servicing their end user customers.



We continue to target sales pipeline opportunities with large electric utility and oil and gas customers in order to secure significant reference customers in these important end markets. We continued to support customers in the government security sector, including through deployment of a network supporting a mobile maritime border security installation in the Caribbean for Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), a leading Israeli defense systems supplier. This radar-based security and intruder detection installation, integrated with a FullMAX network, can be replicated by sovereign nations globally.



In addition to selling our FullMAX solutions for dedicated private wide area networks, we intend to offer mission-critical wireless services to industrial customers and governmental users in the form of a Managed Private Network in Alaska and four strategic industrial counties bordering the Gulf of Mexico.  We are now offering mission-critical wireless connectivity and secured initial customers in these regions. In Alaska, we established mission-critical wireless service covering Anchorage and Fairbanks North Star, Alaska’s two most populated boroughs with more than half the State’s approximate 740,000 population. In the Gulf of Mexico region, we established service and coverage in coastal counties including Cameron Parish in Louisiana, and Victoria, Calhoun and Jefferson Counties in Texas.



In December 2018, we established a China-based subsidiary located in Chengdu, to market our products in China by targeting critical infrastructure industries. We explored the establishment of supply chain management and manufacturing operations for both local customers and for export. We expected to secure lower component costs via the further development of our supply chain in Asia for high volume production and planned to develop internal capabilities for product assembly and testing. However, in the fourth quarter of 2019, we revised our business strategy and withdrew our direct marketing and manufacturing efforts in China after determining that our customers, in particular those customers operating in the U.S., including electric utility and rail sectors, strongly preferred that our products be manufactured outside of China. Consequently, we have dissolved our China-affiliated subsidiary.



FullMAX Network Architecture



Sales and Marketing



We generate sales leads and new customers through direct sales efforts, third party resellers, customer referrals, consultant referrals, trade show attendance, general marketing efforts and public relations.





15







After basic qualification of the prospect, the typical sales process starts with the customer supplying us with key information regarding their network assets including the location of their existing radio tower sites and the remote locations where they require data connectivity. We use this information to generate radio frequency coverage maps based on our FullMAX technology. This information is formatted into a proposal which is then reviewed with the customer to determine the suitability of our solution. The next step typically involves a customer paid onsite lab evaluation of our products during which the customer tests for basic functionality, security and application compatibility. This is typically followed by a live, real world outdoor test in which the customer purchases additional equipment to communicate with a representative number of utility infrastructure control points.



Following the successful evaluation of the FullMAX product in a pilot network, the customer may choose, or be required, to complete a Request for Proposal (RFP) or Request for Quotation (RFQ) process to address the requirements of their entire network. We have participated in many such processes and have developed an extensive library of material and processes for responding effectively and efficiently in a timely manner.



If we are selected, we typically enter into contract negotiations with the customer based on our standard terms and condition of sale, software licensing agreement and warranty policy. The customer then generates a purchase order and we commence fulfillment of the order. Many purchase orders allow for or require phased delivery of products over several months or years.



Many of our customers are conservative in their decision-making process. Sales cycles for new customers can vary from one to three years depending on the complexity of the customer’s network, whether the customer is subject to state regulations, and annual budget cycles. We believe that the sales cycle will shorten as we build our market presence with successful FullMAX deployments which will serve as reference customers and as the IEEE 802.16s multi-vendor ecosystem develops.



Manufacturing, Availability and Dependence upon Suppliers



We design the printed circuit boards and enclosures for our radios and maintain the bill of materials for all of the products we manufacturer. A Bill of Materials (BOM) is a list of the raw materials, sub-assemblies, intermediate assemblies, sub-components, parts and the quantities of each needed to manufacture an end product. The physical manufacturing of FullMAX circuit boards is outsourced to best-in-class industrial contract manufacturers. The contract manufacturer is responsible for sourcing the majority of components in the BOM, assembling the components onto the printed circuit boards and then delivering the final boards to us. Once at our facility, the boards are tested, then placed into enclosures and programmed with the appropriate software. The radios are then configured according to the requirement of the network and run through system level tests before being packaged and shipped to the customer.



We have elected to outsource manufacturing in order to allow us to focus on designing, developing and selling our products. Furthermore, outsourced manufacturing allows us to leverage the economies of scale and expertise of specialized outsourced manufacturers, reduce manufacturing and supply chain risk and distribution costs. We maintain multiple contract manufacturers, both domestically and internationally, to ensure competitive pricing and to reduce the risk from a single manufacturer.



Customer Support



We supply our customers with installation manuals, user guides and system documentation as well as onsite training customized to their specific needs. We are also capable of supporting installation and commissioning services either internally or, for extensive projects, through subcontracted third-party specialists.



We provide remote support to our customers including radio configuration assistance, hardware and software troubleshooting, software updates and software enhancements. The original purchase price of all FullMAX radios includes a one-year hardware warranty and software maintenance plan. After one year, the customer may enter into an Annual Support Agreement with us in order to continue their hardware warranty and software maintenance.





16







Product Development



We retain a dedicated team of software and hardware engineers that are responsible for developing and maintaining various aspects of our FullMAX technology. The core technology is based on state-of-the-art digital signal processing (DSP) chipsets, field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and general-purpose processors. In wireless nomenclature, this concept is referred to as software defined radio (SDR) technology.



We believe FullMAX is one of the most flexible SDRs for private WANs on the market today. It can be viewed in contrast to most other commercial wireless technologies (e.g., LTE, Wi-Fi, etc.) which are based on dedicated communications chipsets with very limited flexibility. We have purposely designed the technology with a wide range of flexibility given the current and evolving requirements of industrial field area data networks. Specifically, we capable of accommodate legacy protocols that predate Internet Protocol (IP) and Ethernet while also supporting some of the most advanced protocols in the world including multiprotocol label switching (MPLS). This flexibility offers industrial and governmental a smooth migration path to our advanced technology. Our flexible hardware and software radio architecture ensures we can support the entire range of protocols as our customers evolve their networks and applications.



Our SDR technology also provides our customers with unmatched flexibility with respect to radio spectrum frequency bands and channel sizes. Our FullMAX radios work in frequency bands ranging from 70 MHz to 6 GHz and in channel sizes from 12.5 kHz to 10 MHz. This flexibility allows our customers to repurpose their existing underutilized spectrum assets or access new licensed radio spectrum at a lower cost.



FullMAX radios have three major software components: (i) general embedded Linux-based software, (ii) DSP software, and (iii) FPGA software. FullMAX Base Stations and Remote radios have distinct software packages which combine these three components. Also, different computer software tools are used to develop the source code for each of the components. Hardware design and development is completed using standard computerized hardware design tools.



Our product design process begins with detailed requirements supplied from current and prospective customers. These inputs then flow into our development roadmap, which is divided into six, 12 and 36-month plans. A majority of our ongoing development is software related which includes the following development process: (i) requirements specification, (ii) high level design, (iii) detailed design, (iv) coding, (v) unit test, (vi) integration tests, (vii) lab verification tests, and (viii) outdoor deployment verification.



Our FullMAX technology is a single-tier (Tier 1) point-to-multi-point broadband wireless system. Our FullMAX platform is available via: (1) our Venus Base Station and Remote Radio hardware platform with transmit power up to four watts; (2) our Mars Base Station hardware platform with enhanced processing power and up to 100 watts of transmit power and (3) our Mercury Remote hardware platform for ubiquitous low cost, wide area sensor based networks and for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS).



Research & Development



Our ability to develop state-of-the-art and cost-effective solutions relative to our competitors can only be achieved through our continued research and development efforts. Our research and development activities are headed by Menashe Shahar, our Chief Technology Officer, based in our Sunnyvale, California headquarters. Mr. Shahar is a co-founder of the Company and has over 30 years of telecommunications system development experience, including the design and implementation of broadband wireless data systems for top tier system integrators and service providers including WorldCom, Nortel and ADC. Mr. Shahar has been awarded multiple patents in the data communications industry and has been an active participant in major wireless standardization activities including IEEE 802.16. In addition to internal research and development efforts, we also engage third party consultants to assist us in our research and development activities.



Our research and development team works closely with our customer support team and incorporates feedback from our customers into our product development plans to improve our products and address emerging market requirements.





17







Our research and development expenses were approximately $3,587,000 and approximately $5,416,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.



Intellectual Property



We rely primarily on patent, trademark and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary technologies and intellectual property. As of this filing, we held a total of six issued patents in the U.S., seven pending patent applications in the U.S., and one international pending patent application. Our patents expire between 2030 and 2037, subject to any patent extensions that may be available for such patents. Our intellectual property centers around creating and maintaining robust, private, highly secure, broadband industrial wireless networks using our FullMAX radio technology for our mission critical customers’ networks. We view our patents as a key strategic advantage as the markets for industrial wireless connectivity grows and as these industries move to standardized solutions and will enable us to earn licensing fees and/or royalties for the use of our patents.



We have a policy of requiring our officers, employees, contractors and other service providers and parties with which we do business to enter into confidentiality, non-disclosure (“NDAs”) and assignment of invention agreements before disclosure of any of our confidential or proprietary information.



Seasonality



We do not believe that the industry in which we compete is subject to seasonal sales fluctuation; however, we do recognize that a typical sales cycle for new customers may take from one to three years depending on the complexity of their network and whether the customer is subject to state regulations and/or annual budget cycles.



Dependence on a Single Customer



Because we have only recently invested in our customer service and support organization, a small number of customers have accounted for a substantial amount of our revenue. During the year ended December 31, 2020, two customers accounted for approximately $1,012,000 and $1,005,000 of our revenue, or approximately 47% and 46%, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2019, three customers accounted for approximately $144,000, $115,000 and $56,000 of our revenue, or approximately 45%, 36% and 18%, respectively.



Competition



We compete with alternatives to wireless technology, public cellular data networks and private wireless networking products from other manufactures. We believe that each of these competing solutions has core weaknesses when compared to FullMAX, as described below.



Non-wireless technologies:




● | Leased Phone Lines – Analog lines are being retired by the phone companies and are not being replaced by new digital lines, especially where the grid assets are located. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Power Line Carrier – The transmit speeds supported by this technology are typically too low to meet the data rates of new applications. Furthermore, the service may not be available if there is an interruption in the grid (e.g. downed power lines); often the situation when communication is mission critical. 
● | Private Fiber – Fiber is a point-to-point technology which has many points of failure (e.g. accidental or malicious fiber cuts) and security vulnerabilities (e.g. tapping). Underground fiber is cost prohibitive in most cases and above ground is susceptible to the same failures as downed power lines. 






18







Alternate technologies:




● | Satellite Technologies — These technologies provide good coverage, but throughput is limited and latency is too high to support mission-critical applications for our customers. These technologies can be very costly as compared to our products and systems. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LP-WANs) — LP-WAN solutions such as LoRa, Sigfox and NB-IoT are architected with lower power, the purpose of which is to make these typically sensor-based networks lower-cost solutions. The low powered equipment means these systems have lower throughput and higher latency and are not reliable for mission-critical applications that require both monitoring and control functions. 




Public cellular data networks:




● | Public networks are vulnerable to cyber security attacks from anywhere in the world including denial of service attacks; private networks can operate independent of the public internet. Based on current and planned FAA rules, UAVs will be off-net without public Internet access. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Public networks are susceptible to prolonged outages during man-made and natural disasters (e.g. 9/11, Hurricane Sandy, etc.), exactly when utilities and mission critical entities require the greatest reliability. 
● | Public networks are typically designed for population coverage rather than the geographic areas required by critical infrastructure providers, which often include remote locations. 
● | Public networks are by definition oversubscribed, shared networks without the necessary prioritization service to support mission critical applications. 
● | Public networks typically use shared infrastructure including tower sites and long-haul fiber connections resulting in vulnerabilities at many points. 
● | Public networks are designed to support high capacity downloading and streaming applications with limited upload bandwidth available. Utilities typically require the reverse traffic flow, often uploading data from a large number of remote locations. 




Other private wireless products:




● | Unlicensed Point to Multipoint Wireless (e.g. Wi-Fi) — This equipment is very inexpensive to purchase but is subject to interference, has many security vulnerabilities, uses a contention-based protocol and transmits only over short range. Deploying Wi-Fi over wide areas is cost prohibitive. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Private Licensed Narrowband Wireless Radios — These networks can provide good coverage and range but are typically too slow and lack sufficient bandwidth to support new applications and the increased number of data connections required. 

Governmental Regulations



Our operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations including:




● | authorization from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for operation in various licensed frequency bands, 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FAA regulations unique to the navigation of commercial or industrial drones, 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | customers’ licenses from the FCC, 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | licensing, permitting and inspection requirements applicable to contractors, electricians and engineers, 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | regulations relating to worker safety and environmental protection, 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | permitting and inspection requirements applicable to construction projects, 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | wage and hour regulations, 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | regulations relating to transportation of equipment and materials, including licensing and permitting requirements, 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | building and electrical codes; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | special bidding, procurement and other requirements on government projects. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






19







We believe we have all the licenses materially required to conduct our operations, and we are in substantial compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. The operation of our manufactured products by our customers (network providers and service providers) in the U.S. or in foreign jurisdictions in a manner not in compliance with local law could result in fines, business disruption, or harm to our reputation. The changes to regulatory and technological requirements may also alter our product offerings, impacting our market share and business.  Failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating licenses, or could give rise to termination or cancellation rights under our contracts or disqualify us from future bidding opportunities.



Employees



As of March 8, 2021, we have 14 full-time employees and one part-time employee. Additionally, from time to time, we may hire temporary employees. We also utilize contractors to manufacture components, for certain research and development and for system deployment functions. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement and we are unaware of any union organizing efforts. We have never experienced a major work stoppage, strike or dispute. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Subsidiaries



We have one wholly owned operating subsidiary, Ondas Networks Inc., a Delaware corporation. Also, we have one wholly-owned subsidiary, FS Partners (Cayman) Limited, a Cayman Islands limited liability company, and one majority owned subsidiaries, Full Spectrum Holding Limited, a Cayman Islands limited liability company. Both FS Partners (Cayman) Limited and Full Spectrum Holding Limited were formed for the purpose of beginning operations in China. As described above, we revised our business strategy and are in the process of dissolving our China-affiliated subsidiaries. Once this process is complete, we will have only one wholly owned subsidiary, Ondas Networks Inc.
