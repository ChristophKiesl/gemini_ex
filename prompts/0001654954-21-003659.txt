  ITEM 1. BUSINESS
  
  Overview
  
  We are engaged in the research and development of targeted, non-systemic therapies for the treatment of patients with gastrointestinal (“GI”) diseases. Non-systemic therapies are non-absorbable drugs that act locally, i.e. in the intestinal lumen, skin or mucosa, without reaching an individual’s systemic circulation.
  
  We are currently focused on developing our pipeline of gut-restricted GI clinical drug candidates. Our lead drug candidate is MS1819, a recombinant lipase for the treatment of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (“EPI”) in patients with cystic fibrosis (“CF”) and chronic pancreatitis (“CP”), currently in two Phase 2 CF clinical trials. In 2021, we plan to launch two clinical programs using proprietary formulations of niclosamide, a pro-inflammatory pathway inhibitor; FW-1022, for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (“SARS-CoV-2,” or “COVID-19”) gastrointestinal infections, and FW-420, for Grade 1 Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor-Associated Colitis (“ICI-AC”) and diarrhea in oncology patients. Each drug candidate is described below.
  
  MS1819
  
  MS1819, a recombinant lipase enzyme for the treatment of EPI associated with CF and CP, is supplied as an oral non-systemic biologic capsule. MS1819 is derived from the Yarrowia lipolytica yeast lipase and breaks up fat molecules in the digestive tract of EPI patients so that they can be absorbed as nutrients. Unlike the standard of care, the MS1819 lipase does not contain any animal products.
  
  EPI is a condition characterized by deficiency of exocrine pancreatic enzymes, primarily lipase, resulting in a patient’s inability to digest food properly, or maldigestion. The deficiency of these enzymes can be responsible for greasy diarrhea, fecal urge, abdominal pain and weight loss. We believe that there are two principal therapeutic indications for EPI compensation by MS1819: (i) children and adults affected by CF, and (ii) adult patients with CP. There are more than 30,000 patients with EPI caused by CF according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and there are approximately 90,000 patients in the U.S. with EPI caused by CP according to the National Pancreas Foundation. Patients are currently treated with porcine pancreatic enzyme replacement (“PERT”) pills.
  
  We have determined to initially pursue the indication for adults in CF.
  
  Completed Phase 2 OPTION Bridging Dose Monotherapy Study
  
 In October 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) cleared our Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application for MS1819 in patients with EPI due to CF. In connection with the FDA’s clearance of the IND, we initiated a multi-center Phase 2 bridging dose safety study in the fourth quarter of 2018 in the U.S. and Europe (the “OPTION Bridging Dose Study”). We targeted enrollment of 30 to 35 patients and dosed the first patients in February 2019. In June 2019, we reached its enrollment target for the study and in September 2019, we announced positive results from the OPTION Bridging Dose Study.
  
 Results showed that the primary efficacy endpoint of coefficient of fat absorption (“CFA”) was comparable to the CFA in a prior Phase 2a study in patients with CP, while using the same dosage of MS1819. The dosage used in the OPTION Bridging Dose Study was 2.2 grams per day, which was determined in agreement with the FDA as a bridging dose from the highest safe dose used in the Phase 2a CP dose escalation study. Although the OPTION Bridging Dose Study was not powered for statistical significance, we believe the data demonstrated meaningful efficacy results, with approximately 50% of the patients showing CFA high enough to reach non-inferiority with standard PERTs. Additionally, the coefficient of nitrogen absorption (“CNA”) was comparable between the MS1819 and PERT arms, 93% vs. 97%, respectively, in the OPTION Bridging Dose Study. This important finding confirms that protease supplementation is not likely to be required with MS1819 treatment. A total of 32 patients, ages 18 or older, completed the OPTION Bridging Dose Study.
  
  Ongoing Phase 2b OPTION 2 Monotherapy Trial
  
  In October 2019, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Data Safety Monitoring Board (the “CFF DSMB”) completed its review of our final results of the OPTION Bridging Dose Study. It found no safety concerns for MS1819, and supported our plan to proceed to a higher 4.4 gram dose of MS1819 with enteric (delayed release) capsules in multi-center dose escalation Phase 2b clinical trial (the “OPTION 2 Trial”). In December 2019, we submitted the clinical trial protocol for the OPTION 2 Trial to the existing IND at the FDA. The clinical trial protocol was reviewed by the FDA with no comments. In April 2020, we received approval to conduct the OPTION 2 Trial in Therapeutics Development Network clinical sites in the U.S. as well as Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) approval to commence the OPTION 2 Trial.

  The OPTION 2 Trial was designed to investigate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of MS1819 (2.2 gram and 4.4 gram doses in enteric capsules) in a head-to-head manner versus the current standard of care, PERT pills. The OPTION 2 Trial was an open-label, crossover study, conducted in 15 sites in the U.S. and Europe. Enrollment included a total of 30 CF patients 18 years or older. MS1819 was administered in enteric capsules to provide gastric protection and test for optimal delivery of enzyme to the duodenum. Patients were initially randomized into two cohorts: to either the MS1819 arm, where they received a 2.2 gram daily oral dose of MS1819 for three weeks; or to the PERT arm, where they received their pre-study dose of PERT pills for three weeks. After three weeks, stools were collected for analysis of CFA. Patients were then crossed over for another three weeks of the alternative treatment. After three weeks of cross-over therapy, stools were again collected for analysis of CFA. A parallel group of patients were randomized and studied in the same fashion, using a 4.4 gram daily dose of MS1819. All patients were followed for an additional two weeks after completing both crossover treatments for post study safety observation. Patients were assessed using descriptive methods for efficacy, comparing CFA between MS1819 and PERT arms, and for safety.
  
 In November 2020, we announced that we would submit protocol amendment request to the FDA for the OPTION 2 Trial to add a study arm utilizing immediate release MS1819 capsules. In January 2021, we announced that we had initiated the additional study arm. This extension phase tested patients 18 years or older, who had already completed the cross-over phase, with immediate release capsules at higher 4.4 and 6.6 gram doses relative to the 2.2 gram capsules previously used in the OPTION Bridging Dose Study. The purpose of the additional study arm was to allow us to compare data from the existing crossover arm using enteric (delayed release) capsules with data from the new extension arm, to help us identify the optimal dose and delivery method for MS1819.
  
 In March 2021, we announced topline data results from the OPTION 2 Trial. The data demonstrated MS1819 to be safe and well-tolerated. In addition, we believe the data from the OPTION 2 Trial also demonstrates meaningful drug activity, as was also the case with our OPTION Bridging Dose Study and a prior Phase 2a study in patients with CP, and also with the interim data in our ongoing Combination Trial (as defined and discussed in further detail below). However, patients in the OPTION 2 Trial did not consistently meet the primary efficacy endpoint. Some patients were able to achieve CFA at levels beyond what is required to demonstrate non-inferiority with PERT therapies, but the majority did not. As such, we did not meet our primary endpoint for the trial.
  
 We believe that the underlying cause of the MS1819’s uneven efficacy performance in the OPTION 2 Trial lies with the enteric capsule formulation. While we believe the enteric coating protects the capsule from breaking down in the stomach acid, the trial data suggests it may dissolve too slowly in the small intestine to release the lipase enzyme in time to aid with proper digestion and nutrient absorption.
  
 As a result, we have announced plans to develop a new formulation for MS1819, employing a capsule filled with acid-resistant granules, or microbeads, similar to what is used in CREON®, ZENPEP® and other PERT therapies. These beads will be placed into immediate release capsules that are intended to dissolve in the stomach, dispersing the beads, which should then pass through to the small intestine and break down, releasing the lipase enzyme so that it thoroughly mixes with food as it is being digested.
  
 We are accelerating discussions with contract manufacturers to develop this new formulation. We believe we have sufficient capital on hand to fund this development and initiate a further Phase 2 study to evaluate the new formulation’s efficacy, without substantially delaying our development efforts in other areas.
 
  Ongoing Phase 2 Combination Therapy Trial
  
 In addition to the CF monotherapy studies, we launched a Phase 2 multi-center clinical trial (the “Combination Trial”) in Europe (Hungary and Turkey) to investigate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of escalating doses of MS1819, in combination with PERT, in order to increase CFA levels and relieve abdominal symptoms in CF patients who suffer from severe EPI but continue to experience clinical symptoms of fat malabsorption despite taking the maximum daily dose of PERTs.
  
 Ideally, a stable daily dose of PERT will enable CF patients to eat a normal to high-fat diet and minimize unpleasant gastrointestinal symptoms. In practice, however, approximately 25-30% of CF patients do not achieve normal absorption of fat with PERTs. Achieving an optimal nutritional status, including normal fat absorption levels, in CF patients is important for maintaining better pulmonary function, physical performance and prolonging survival. Furthermore, a decline of body mass index around the age of 18 years predicts a substantial drop in lung function. We believe a combination therapy of PERT and MS1819 has the potential to: (i) correct macronutrient and micronutrient maldigestion; (ii) eliminate abdominal symptoms attributable to maldigestion; and (iii) sustain optimal nutritional status on a normal diet in CF patients with severe EPI.
  
 The Combination Trial enrolled 18 patients, 12 years of age or older, with severe EPI, with CFA levels less than 80%. Patients enrolled in the study receive escalating doses of 700mg, 1200mg, and 2240mg of MS1819 once daily for 15 days per dosing level, in addition to their standard PERT dose. Baseline CFA is established by measuring CFA levels while on standard of care therapy only, before beginning combination therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint of the trial is improvement in CFA; secondary endpoints of the study are improvements in the stool weight, stool consistency, number of bowel movements, the incidence of steatorrhea, and increase of body weight.
  
 We dosed the first patients in the Combination Trial in Hungary in October 2019.
  
  We announced positive interim data on the first five patients in the Combination Trial in August 2020. The primary efficacy endpoint was met, with CFAs greater than 80% for all patients across all visits. For secondary efficacy endpoints, we observed that stool weight decreased, the number of stools per day decreased, steatorrhea improved, and body weight increased. Additionally, no serious adverse events were reported. In October 2020, we opened a total of five clinical sites in Turkey and dosed the first patients in November 2020.
  
 In March 2021, we announced that we completed enrollment of 18 patients and expect to report top-line data in the second quarter of 2021.
  
  Niclosamide
  
 Niclosamide, a pro-inflammatory pathway inhibitor, is a prescription small molecule drug that has been safely used on millions of patients. Niclosamide is listed as an essential medicine by the World Health Organization (WHO). In the U.S., niclosamide was approved by the FDA in 1982 for the treatment of intestinal tapeworm infections. Niclosamide’s activity as an antihelminthic result from direct action in the intestinal lumen where it disrupts parasite oxidative metabolism, killing parasites. Niclosamide has been commercially available worldwide for more than 50 years as 500mg tablets intended for use in pediatric and adult populations, at a dose rate of 2g per adult or child over six years of age. No safety issues have ever been identified. In addition to its antihelminthic activity, niclosamide has novel anti-inflammatory and anti-viral properties.

 We believe niclosamide, and more specifically the patented and proprietary micronized niclosamide formulation developed by First Wave, has the potential to be an ideal therapeutic to treat multiple GI indications due to the following favorable properties: (i) it has a reduced particle size (D(90) between 5 and 9 µM) as compared to regular non-micronized niclosamide (approximately D(90) ≥ 60µM) with greater surface to solvent ratio, (ii) low oral bio-availability with minimal systemic absorption / exposure, (iii) improved dissolution with broader distribution allowing for higher local GI concentrations (up to approximately 200 times based on preclinical study results), and (iv) it exhibits anti-inflammatory effects while avoiding steroid-related complications and adverse events.
  
  FW-1022: COVID-19 GI infections
  
  We are developing FW-1022, a small molecule medicinal product containing micronized niclosamide in an oral immediate release tablet formulation as treatment for SARS-CoV-2 intestinal infection in patients presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms of COVID-19 disease. The formulation to be used has been milled (micronized) to allow superior dissolution in the gut fluids. This in turn allows local niclosamide concentrations to reach anti-viral levels. Thus, FW-1022 has the potential to benefit COVID patients by decreasing viral load in the GI tract, treating infection symptoms and preventing transmission of the virus through fecal spread. Evidence of niclosamide’s antiviral properties is sufficient to expect a clinical pharmacodynamic response against viral replication and clinical benefit, justifying the proposed clinical study in COVID-19 patients and favorable benefit-risk assessment.
  
 An IND for FW-1022 micronized niclosamide for COVID-19 GI infections was cleared by the FDA in September 2020. We are currently preparing to initiate a two-part, two-arm, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial examining the safety and efficacy of niclosamide in patients with COVID-19 GI infections.
  
  FW-420: Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Colitis (ICI-AC)
  
  Immune checkpoint inhibitors (“ICIs”) are monoclonal antibodies that target down-regulators of the anti-cancer immune response and have revolutionized the treatment of a variety of malignancies. The global market for ICIs in in 2019 was estimated to be over $22 billion and growing rapidly. Approximately 44% of patients with advanced cancer tumors, or about 260,000 patients, are eligible to receive ICIs
  
  However, many immune-related adverse events, especially diarrhea and colitis, limit the use of ICIs. While Grade 1 colitis (less than four stools per day) is treated symptomatically as outpatients, about 30% or more of patients with Grade 1 colitis progress to Grade 2 or worse. Those patients must be taken off of the ICI being used for their cancer, risking relapse. Also, they receive aggressive immunosuppressive therapies, further aggravating their underlying cancer.
  
  The incidence of immune-mediated colitis (“IMC”) ranges from 1% to 25% depending on the type of ICI and whether they are without interruption used in combination. Approximately 30% of ICI patients develop diarrhea, which can progress to colitis. The onset of diarrhea in ICI-AC patients occurs within six to seven weeks and progressively worsens, and the progression to colitis is rapid and unpredictable. For example, in patients taking ipilimumab (Yervoy), between 25% and 30% of patients developed diarrhea and approximately 8% to 12% developed colitis. Moreover, the trend is towards the use of combination ICI therapies (e.g. Yervoy and Opdivo) which may lead to a concomitant increase in both diarrhea and colitis.
  
  Administration of corticosteroids, or treatment with certain immunosuppressive biologics, while withholding ICI therapy are recommended for Grade 2 or more severe colitis.  The impact of this colitis complication and treatment may reduce the goal of progression free cancer survival. An oral, non-absorbed treatment, such as niclosamide, for Grade 1 colitis (diarrhea) may prevent progression to Grade 2 disease. There currently is no approved treatment for Grade 1 colitis.

     FW-420 is a niclosamide based small molecule anti-inflammatory inhibitor therapy which we intend to use for the treatment of immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated colitis and diarrhea in metastatic cancer patients. FW-420 will be supplied in two formulations, as an oral immediate-release tablet and as a topical rectal enema foam. The standard care for treating inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s Disease is corticosteroids and 5-ASAs, which can cause problems when used for check point inhibitor patients due to their immunosuppressant effects.  FW-420 has the potential to safely treat Grade 1 ICI colitis and diarrhea and prevent its progression to more serious and potentially fatal later stages. The overall goal of early niclosamide treatment is to enable oncology patients to remain without interruption on, or spend minimal time off of, their ICI treatment programs.
  
  The primary objective of our planned Phase 1b/2a trial of niclosamide is to monitor patients receiving ICI treatment, and to intervene with niclosamide treatment at the first signs of diarrhea. The primary objective is to compare niclosamide oral, versus niclosamide oral plus rectal, versus standard of care, and to prevent Grade 1 colitis progressing to Grade 2 or worse. We anticipate the trial will need about 100 patients to provide a signal of efficacy.
  
  We plan to initiate the Phase 1b/2a clinical trial in the first half of 2021.

  Recent Developments
  
  License Agreement with First Wave Bio, Inc.
  
  On December 31, 2020, we entered into a License Agreement (the “First Wave License Agreement”) with First Wave Bio, Inc. (“First Wave”). Pursuant to the First Wave License Agreement, First Wave granted us a worldwide, exclusive right to develop, manufacture, and commercialize First Wave’s proprietary immediate release and enema formulations of niclosamide for the fields of treating ICI-AC and COVID-19 in humans (the “Niclosamide Product”). The Niclosamide Product uses First Wave’s proprietary formulations of niclosamide, a pro-inflammatory pathway inhibitor. We plan to commence in 2021 both a Phase 2 trial of the Niclosamide Product for COVID-19 in GI and a Phase 1b/2a trial for ICI-AC.
  
  In consideration of the license and other rights granted by First Wave, we paid First Wave a $9.0 million upfront cash payment and are obligated to make an additional payment of $1.25 million due on June 30, 2021. In addition, we are obligated to pay potential milestone payments to First Wave totaling up to $37.0 million for each indication, based upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones. Under the First Wave License Agreement we are obligated to pay First Wave royalties as a mid-single digit percentage of net sales of the Product, subject to specified reductions.
  
  In addition, on January 8, 2021, pursuant to the First Wave License Agreement we entered into a securities purchase agreement with First Wave (the “First Wave Purchase Agreement”) pursuant to which we issued to First Wave, on that same day, 3,290.1960 shares of Series C 9.00% Convertible Junior Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 (the “Series C Preferred Stock”), initially convertible into an aggregate of 3,290,196 shares of Common Stock, at an initial stated value of $750.00 per share and a conversion price of $0.75 per share, which was the equivalent of $3.0 million based upon the volume weighted average price of our Common Stock for the five-day period immediately preceding the date of the First Wave License Agreement, or $0.9118 per share. The First Wave Purchase Agreement contains demand and piggyback registration rights with respect to the Common Stock issuable upon conversion, which have not been requested by First Wave.
  
Pursuant to the First Wave Purchase Agreement, the shares of Series C Preferred Stock issued to First Wave were not convertible prior to us obtaining the approval of our stockholders to amend our certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of Common Stock above 150,000,000 and to comply with the applicable stockholder approval rules and regulations of the Nasdaq Stock Market (the “Stockholder Approval”). Upon receiving Stockholder Approval on February 24, 2021, we issued an aggregate of 3,329,138 shares of Common Stock to First Wave upon conversion of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock, which included 38,942 shares of Common Stock for accrued dividends of approximately $29,000.

  Registered Direct Offering and Private Placement
  
  On December 31, 2020, we entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Series C Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which we agreed to sell in a registered direct offering 5,333.333 shares of Series C Preferred Stock, at a price of $750 per share, initially convertible into an aggregate of 5,333,334 shares of Common Stock, at an initial stated value of $750.00 per share and a conversion price of $0.75 per share (the “Registered Direct Offering”). The Registered Direct Offering closed on January 6, 2021.
  
  Concurrently with the Registered Direct Offering, in a private placement offering pursuant to the Series C Purchase Agreement (the “Private Placement”), we agreed to sell an additional 5,333.3333 shares of Series C Preferred Stock at the same price as the Series C Preferred Stock offered in the Registered Direct Offering and convertible on the same terms and warrants (the “Investor Warrants”) to purchase up to an aggregate of 10,666,668 shares of Common Stock, with an exercise price of $0.80 per share and an expiration term of five and one-half years from the date of issuance.
  
  In connection with the Private Placement, we entered into a registration rights agreement, dated as of December 31, 2020, pursuant to which we filed a registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-252087) to register the shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock sold in the Private Placement and the exercise of the Investor Warrants. The registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on January 21, 2021.
  
  The aggregate gross proceeds from the Registered Direct Offering and the Private Placement, excluding the net proceeds, if any, from the exercise of the Investor Warrants, was approximately $8.0 million.
  
  The net proceeds to us from the Registered Direct Offering and the Private Placement, after deducting the placement agent’s fees and expenses and estimated offering expenses, was approximately $6.8 million. We used the net proceeds to fund the payment of cash consideration to First Wave under the First Wave License Agreement, and for other general corporate purposes.
  
  We paid the placement agent a cash fee equal to 8.0% and a management fee equal to 1.0% of the aggregate gross proceeds received by us in the Registered Direct Offering and the Private Placement, or approximately $700,000. We also agreed to issue to the placement agent or its designees warrants (the “December 2020 Placement Agent Warrants”) exercisable for up to 746,667 shares of Common Stock, which is equal to 7.0% of the amount determined by dividing the gross proceeds of the Registered Direct Offering and Private Placement by the offering price per share of Common Stock, or $0.75. The December 2020 Placement Agent Warrants have substantially the same terms as the Investor Warrants, except they are exercisable at $0.9375 per share, or 125% of the effective purchase price per share of the Series C Preferred Stock issued. We also reimbursed the placement agent $35,000 for non-accountable expenses, up to $125,000 for legal fees and expenses and other out-of-pocket expenses and $12,900 for clearing fees.
  
  On February 24, 2021, our stockholders approved certain proposals related to the Registered Direct Offering and the Private Placement and all outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock were converted to Common Stock.
  
 
  Amendment to Charter and Approved Reverse Stock Split
  
  On February 24, 2021, at our Special Meeting of Stockholders (“Special Meeting”), our stockholders approved an amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Charter”) to increase the number of authorized shares of Common Stock by 100,000,000 shares to 250,000,000 shares, and to authorize our Board of Directors (the “Board”) to effect a reverse stock split of both the issued and outstanding and authorized shares of Common Stock, at a specific ratio, ranging from one-for-five (1:5) to one-for-ten (1:10), any time prior to the one-year anniversary date of the Special Meeting, with the exact ratio to be determined by the Board.
  
  We filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Charter with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on February 24, 2021, to increase the number of authorized shares of Common Stock to 250,000,000 shares.
  
  March 2021 Common Stock and Warrant Offering
  
  On March 7, 2021, we entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “March 2021 Purchase Agreement”) with single institutional investor, pursuant to which we agreed to sell, in a registered direct offering (the “March 2021 Offering”) priced at the market under Nasdaq rules, (i) 5,800,000 shares of Common Stock, (ii) pre-funded warrants (the “March 2021 Pre-Funded Warrants”) to purchase up to 2,058,548 shares of Common Stock, with an exercise price of $0.01 per share and no expiration term and (iii) warrants (the “March 2021 Warrants”) to purchase an aggregate of 3,929,274 shares of Common Stock with an exercise price of $1.21 per share and an expiration term of five years from the date of issuance. The aggregate price per of the March 2021 Offering share was $1.2725.
  
  The aggregate gross proceeds from the March 2021 Offering, which closed on March 10, 2021 (the “March 2021 Closing Date”), excluding the net proceeds, if any, from the exercise of the March 2021 Warrants was approximately $10.0 million.
  
  The net proceeds to us from the March 2021 Offering, after deducting the placement agent’s fees and expenses and estimated offering expenses, was approximately $9.1 million. We intend to use the net proceeds to initiate its two niclosamide clinical programs in the first half of 2021, a Phase 2 clinical trial for COVID-19 GI infections and a Phase 1b/2a trial for ICI-AC, respectively, and for other general corporate purposes.
  
  We paid the placement agent a cash fee equal to 8.0% of the aggregate gross proceeds received by us in the March 2021 Offering, or approximately $800,000. We also agreed to issue to the placement agent or its designees warrants (the “March 2021 Placement Agent Warrants”) exercisable for up to 550,099 shares of Common Stock, which is equal to 7.0% of the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock placed in the March 2021 Offering. The March 2021 Placement Agent Warrants have substantially the same terms as the March 2021Warrants, except they are exercisable at $1.5906 per share, or 125% of the effective purchase price per share of Common Stock issued in the March 2021 Offering.

  In the March 2021 Purchase Agreement, we have agreed not to issue, enter into any agreement to issue or announce the issuance or proposed issuance of, any shares of Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock or file any registration statement or prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto for 50 days after the March 2021 Closing Date. In addition, we have agreed not to effect or enter into an agreement to effect any issuance of Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock involving a variable rate transaction (as defined in the March 2021 Purchase Agreement) until the one-year anniversary of the date of the March 2021 Purchase Agreement, subject to certain exceptions.
  
  Series B Most Favored Nations (MFN) Exchanges
  
  Under the Certificate of Designations for the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series B Certificate of Designations”), in the event we effect any issuance of Common Stock or Common Stock equivalents for cash consideration, or a combination of units thereof (a “Subsequent Financing”), each holder of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Series B Preferred Stock”), has the right to exchange the stated value, plus accrued and unpaid dividends (the “Exchange Amount”), of the Series B Preferred Stock for any securities issued in the Subsequent Financing, in lieu of any cash subscription payments therefor (the “Exchange Right”).
  
 On December 31, 2020, we entered into the Series C Purchase Agreement as part of the Registered Direct Offering and Private Placement, and the holders of our Series B Preferred Stock became entitled to exercise their Exchange Right to exchange into the Series C Preferred Stock and related Investor Warrants. As of March 29, 2021, holders of approximately 1,266.92 shares of Series B Preferred Stock with an aggregate Exchange Amount of approximately $9.8 million had previously elected to exercise their Series B Exchange Rights into Series C Preferred Stock, convertible into an aggregate of 13,087,843 shares of Common Stock (which conversion we elected to make in full on February 24, 2021, upon receipt of certain stockholder approvals), and additional Investor Warrants exercisable for up to an aggregate of 13,087,843 shares of Common Stock.
  
  As a result, as of March 29, 2021, we may be required to issue up to 13,028.698 additional shares of Series C Preferred Stock that are currently convertible up to 13,028,698 underlying shares of Common Stock, together with Investor Warrants to purchase up to an additional 13,028,698 shares of Common Stock, to any holders of Series B Preferred Stock who elect to exercise their Exchange Right. Any shares of Series C Preferred Stock to be issued pursuant to the Exchange Right would, upon issuance, be immediately converted into underlying shares of Common Stock.
  
  Exercises of Warrants
  
  From January 1, 2021 through March 29, 2021, we received gross proceeds of approximately $4.6 million from the exercise of warrants to purchase an aggregate of 6,640,588 shares of Common Stock, with exercise prices ranging from $0.001 to $1.42 per share. As of March 29, 2021, we had 44,930,105 shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding warrants, with a weighted average exercise price of $1.02 per share.
 Corporate History
  
  We were incorporated on January 30, 2014 in the State of Delaware. In May 2014, we entered into a stock purchase agreement with Protea Biosciences Group, Inc. (“Protea Group”) and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Protea Biosciences, Inc. (“Protea Sub” and, together with Protea Group, “Protea”), to acquire 100% of the outstanding capital stock of AzurRx SAS (formerly ProteaBio Europe SAS), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Protea Sub. In June 2014, we completed the acquisition in exchange for the payment of $600,000 and the issuance of shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series A Preferred”) convertible into 33% of our outstanding Common Stock and agreed to make certain milestone and royalty payments to Protea in connection with MS1819. In October 2016, we completed an initial public offering (“IPO”), which allowed us to list our shares of Common Stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market.
 Product Programs
  
 Our current therapeutic product pipeline consists of three clinical-stage programs, each of which are described below.
  
  MS1819
  
 MS1819 is the active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”), derived from Yarrowia lipolytica, an aerobic yeast naturally found in various foods such as cheese and olive oil that is widely used as a biocatalyst in several industrial processes. MS1819 is an acid-resistant secreted lipase naturally produced by Yarrowia lipolytica, known as LIP2, that we are developing through recombinant DNA technology for the treatment of EPI associated with CF and CP. Lipases are enzymes that help with the digestion of lipids and fat.
  
 We previously held the exclusive right to commercialize MS1819 in the U.S. and Canada, South America (excluding Brazil), Asia (excluding China and Japan), Australia, New Zealand and Israel pursuant to a sublicense from Laboratories Mayoly Spindler SAS (“Mayoly”) under the JDLA (as defined below), which also granted us joint commercialization rights for Brazil, Italy, China and Japan. In March 2019, we purchased all rights, title and interest in and to MS1819 from Mayoly pursuant to the Mayoly APA (as defined below), provided, however, Mayoly retained exclusive commercial rights in France and Russia.

  Background
  
 The pancreas is both an endocrine gland that produces several important hormones, including insulin, glucagon, and pancreatic polypeptide, as well as a digestive organ that secretes pancreatic juice containing digestive enzymes that assist the absorption of nutrients and digestion in the small intestine.
  
 The targeted indication of MS1819 is the compensation of EPI, which is observed when the exocrine functions of the pancreas are below 10% of normal. The symptomatology of EPI is essentially due to the deficiency of pancreatic lipase, an enzyme that hydrolyses triglycerides into monoglycerides and free fatty acids. The pancreatic lipase enzymatic activity is hardly compensated by extra-pancreatic mechanisms, because gastric lipase has nearly no lipolytic activity in the pH range of the intestine. On the other hand, when they are impaired, the pancreatic amylase and protease (enzymes that break up carbohydrates (starches) and proteins, respectively) activities can be compensated by the salivary amylase, the intestinal glycosidase, the gastric pepsin, and the intestinal peptidases, all of which are components of the gastric juice secreted by the stomach walls. Lipid maldigestion due to lipase deficiency is responsible for weight loss, steatorrhea featured by greasy diarrhea, and fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies (i.e. A, D, E and K vitamins).
  
 CP, the most common cause of EPI, is a long-standing inflammation of the pancreas that alters its normal structure and functions. In the U.S., its prevalence rate is of 42 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, resulting in approximately 132,000 cases. Approximately 60% of patients affected with CP display EPI, resulting in approximately 90,000 patients requiring substitution therapy in the U.S. In Western societies, CP is caused by chronic alcoholic consumption in approximately 55-80% of cases. Other relatively frequent etiologies include the genetic form of the disease that is inherited as an autosomal dominant condition with variable penetrance, pancreatic trauma and idiopathic causes.
  
 CF, another dominant etiology of EPI, is a severe genetic disease associated with chronic morbidity and life-span decrease of most affected individuals. In most Caucasian populations, CF prevalence is of 7-8 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, but is less common in other populations, resulting in more than 30,000 affected individuals in the U.S. and more than 70,000 affected individuals worldwide. CF is inherited as monogenic autosomal recessive disease due to the defect at a single gene locus that encodes the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator protein, or CFTR, a regulated chloride channel. Mutation of both alleles of this chloride channel gene results in the production of thick mucus, which causes a multisystem disease of the upper and lower respiratory tracts, digestive system, and the reproductive tract. The progressive destruction of the pancreas results in EPI that is responsible for malnutrition and contributes to significant morbidity and mortality. About 80-90% of patients with CF develop EPI, resulting in approximately 25,000-27,000 patients in the U.S. that require substitution therapy.
  
 Current treatments for EPI stemming from CP and CF rely on porcine (pig derived) pancreatic enzyme replacement therapies (PERTs), which have been on the market since the late 1800s. PERTs are typically comprised of three digestive enzymes; lipases, proteases, and amylases. The PERT market is well established with estimated sales of approximately $1.4 billion in 2019 in the U.S. and has been growing for the past five years at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 20%. In spite of their long-term use, however, PERTs suffer from poor stability, formulation problems, possible transmission of conventional and non-conventional infectious agents due to their animal origins, and possible adverse events at high doses in patients with CF and limited effectiveness.
  
  History of the Program
  
  In 1998, Mayoly, a European pharmaceutical company focusing primarily on gastroenterology disorders, launched a program for the discovery and characterization of novel lipases of non-animal origin that could be used in replacement therapy for EPI. The program was conducted in collaboration with INRA TRANSFERT, a subsidiary of the French academic laboratory, Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique, or National Institute for Agricultural Research (“INRA”). In 2000, Mayoly and INRA discovered that the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica secreted a lipase named LIP2. During the ensuing years, Mayoly investigated the in vitro enzymatic activities of LIP2 in collaboration with the Laboratory of Enzymology at Interfaces and Physiology of Lipolysis, a French public-funded research laboratory at the French National Scientific Research Centre laboratory ("CNRS"), which focuses on the physiology and molecular aspects of lipid digestion.
  
  Pre-Clinical Program
  
  The efficacy of MS1819 has been investigated in normal minipigs, which are generally considered as a relevant model for digestive drug development when considering their physiological similarities with humans and their omnivore diet. Experimental pancreatitis was induced by pancreatic duct ligation, resulting in severe EPI with baseline CFA around 60% post-ligature. CFA is a measurement obtained by quantifying the amount of fat ingested orally over a defined time period and subtracting the amount eliminated in the stool to ascertain the amount of fat absorbed by the body. Pigs were treated with either MS1819 or enteric-coated PERTs, both administered as a single-daily dose.

  At doses ranging from 10.5 to 211 mg, MS1819 increased the CFA by +25 to +29% in comparison to baseline (p<0.05 at all doses), whereas the 2.5 mg dose had milder activity. Similar efficacy was observed in pigs receiving 100,000 U lipase of enteric-coated porcine pancreatic extract. These findings demonstrate the in vivo activity of MS1819 in a relevant in vivo model at a level similar to the PERTs at dosages of 10.5mg or greater.
  
  To date, two non-clinical toxicology studies have been conducted. Both show that MS1819 lipase is clinically well tolerated at levels up to 1000mg/kg in rats and 250 mg/kg in minipigs up to 13 weeks. MS1819 is therefore considered non-toxic in both rodent and non-rodent species up to a maximum feasible dose of 1,000 mg/kg/day in the rats over six months of administration.
  
  Clinical Program
  
  We believe that there are two principal therapeutic indications for EPI compensation by MS1819: (i) children and adults affected by CF, and (ii) adult patients with CP. We have determined to initially pursue the indication for adults first in CF.
  
  During 2010 and 2011, a phase 1/2a clinical trial of MS1819 was conducted in conjunction with Mayoly in a single center in France. The study was an exploratory study mainly designed to investigate the safety of MS1819 (freeze-dried) and was a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel clinical trial in 12 patients affected with CP or pancreatectomy and severe EPI. The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was defined as the relative change in steatorrhea (an established surrogate biomarker of EPI correction) in comparison to baseline. The study found that MS1819 was well tolerated with no serious adverse events. Only two adverse events were observed: constipation (two patients out of eight with MS1819) and hypoglycemia (two patients out of eight with MS1819, and one patient out of four with placebo). A non-statistically significant difference of the primary endpoint, possibly due to the small group size, was found between the two groups both in intention-to-treat, a group that included three patients who received the in-patient facility study diet but did not fulfill the protocol’s inclusion criteria, and per-protocol analysis. This study was not designed, nor did it aim, to demonstrate statistically significant changes of CFA or steatorrhea under MS1819.
  
  We received regulatory approval in Australia and New Zealand in 2016, with the addition of a 2018 regulatory approval in France, to conduct a Phase 2 multi-center dose escalation study of MS1819 in CP and pancreatectomy. The primary endpoint of this study was to evaluate the safety of escalating doses of MS1819 in 11 CP patients. The secondary endpoint was to investigate the efficacy of MS1819 in these patients by analysis of the CFA and its change from baseline. In September 2018, we announced that in pre-planned analyses, both the study’s primary and secondary endpoints were reached with a statistically significant (p=0.002) improvement in the CFA of 21.8%, in a per protocol analysis, with the highest evaluated dose of 2,240 mg/day of MS1819. Statistical significance of the trial results is typically based on widely used, conventional statistical methods that establishes the p-value of the results. A p-value of 0.05 or less is required to demonstrate statistical significance. As such, these CFA levels are considered to be statistically significant.
  
 In October 2018, the FDA cleared our IND application for MS1819 in patients with EPI due to CF. In December 2018, we initiated the Phase 2 OPTION Bridging Dose Study to investigate MS1819 in CF patients with EPI and in February 2019, we dosed the first patients. The Phase 2 OPTION Bridging Dose Study investigated the safety, tolerability and efficacy of MS1819 in a head-to-head comparison against the current PERT standard of care. The OPTION Bridging Dose Study employed a six-week non-inferiority CFA primary efficacy endpoint comparing MS1819 to PERTs.
  
 In September 2019, we announced positive results from the OPTION Bridging Dose Study. Results showed that the primary efficacy endpoint of CFA was comparable to the CFA in a prior Phase 2 study in patients with CP, while using the same dosage of MS1819. The dosage used in the OPTION Bridging Dose Study was 2.2 grams per day, which was determined in agreement with the FDA as a bridging dose from the highest safe dose used in the Phase 2 CP dose escalation study. Although the study was not powered for statistical significance, the data demonstrated meaningful efficacy results, with approximately 50% of the patients showing CFAs high enough to reach non-inferiority with standard PERTs. Additionally, the CNA was comparable between the MS1819 and PERT arms, 93% vs. 97%, respectively, in the OPTION Bridging Dose Study. This important finding confirms that protease supplementation is not likely to be required with MS1819 treatment. A total of 32 patients, ages 18 or older, completed the OPTION Bridging Dose Study.
  
  In October 2019, the CFF DSMB completed its review of our final results of the OPTION Bridging Dose Study and found no safety concerns for MS1819 and supported our plan to proceed to the Phase 2b OPTION 2 Trial. In December 2019, we submitted the clinical trial protocol to the existing IND at the FDA, which has been reviewed by the FDA with no comments. In April 2020, we received approval to conduct the OPTION 2 Trial in Therapeutics Development Network clinical sites in the U.S. as well as IRB approval to commence the OPTION 2 Trial.

  The OPTION 2 Trial was designed to investigate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of MS1819 (2.2 gram and 4.4 gram doses in enteric capsules) in a head-to-head manner versus the current standard of care, PERT pills. The OPTION 2 Trial was an open-label, crossover study, conducted in 15 sites in the U.S. and Europe. Enrollment included a total of 30 CF patients 18 years or older ed. MS1819 was administered in enteric capsules to provide gastric protection and test for optimal delivery of enzyme to the duodenum. Patients will first be randomized into two cohorts: to either the MS1819 arm, where they receive a 2.2 gram daily oral dose of MS1819 for three weeks; or to the PERT arm, where they receive their pre-study dose of PERT pills for three weeks. After three weeks, stools will be collected for analysis of CFA. Patients will then be crossed over for another three weeks of the alternative treatment. After three weeks of cross-over therapy, stools will again be collected for analysis of CFA. A parallel group of patients will be randomized and studied in the same fashion, using a 4.4 gram daily dose of MS1819. All patients will be followed for an additional two weeks after completing both crossover treatments for post study safety observation. Patients will be assessed using descriptive methods for efficacy, comparing CFA between MS1819 and PERT arms, and for safety.
  
 In January 2021, we announced an additional study arm in OPTION 2 Trial using an immediate release MS1819 capsules in order to identify the optimal dose and delivery method of MS1819. This extension phase tests patients 18 years or older, who have already completed the crossover phase, at higher doses relative to the previously conducted OPTION Bridging Dose Study, this allowing us to compare data from the existing crossover arm using enteric (delayed release) capsules with data from the new extension arm, and ultimately select the optimal delivery method for a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial.
  
 We launched the Phase 2 Combination Trial in Hungary in July 2019 to investigate MS1819 in combination with PERT, for CF patients who suffer from severe EPI, but continue to experience clinical symptoms of fat malabsorption despite taking the maximum daily dose of PERTs. The Combination Trial is designed to investigate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of escalating doses of MS1819 (700 mg, 1120 mg and 2240 mg per day, respectively), in conjunction with a stable dose of PERTs, in order to increase CFA and relieve abdominal symptoms. In October 2020, we opened a total of five clinical sites in Turkey and dosed the first patients in November 2020. In March 2021, we reached targeted enrollment of 18 patents. Topline data for the Combination Trial is currently expected in the second quarter of 2021.
  
  We announced positive interim data on the first five patients in the Combination Trial in August 2020. The primary efficacy endpoint was met, with CFAs greater than 80% for all patients across all visits. For secondary efficacy endpoints, we observed that stool weight decreased, the number of stools per day decreased, steatorrhea improved, and body weight increased. Additionally, no serious adverse events were reported.
  
 We believe a combination therapy of PERT and MS1819 has the potential to: (i) correct macronutrient and micronutrient maldigestion; (ii) eliminate abdominal symptoms attributable to maldigestion; and (iii) sustain optimal nutritional status on a normal diet in CF patients with severe EPI.
  
  Niclosamide
  
 Niclosamide, a pro-inflammatory pathway inhibitor, is a prescription small molecule drug that has been safely used on millions of patients. Niclosamide is listed as an essential medicine by the World Health Organization (WHO). In the U.S., niclosamide was approved by the FDA in 1982 for the treatment of intestinal tapeworm infections. Niclosamide’s activity as an antihelminthic result from direct action in the intestinal lumen where it disrupts parasite oxidative metabolism, killing parasites. Niclosamide has been commercially available worldwide for more than 50 years as 500mg tablets intended for use in pediatric and adult populations, at a dose rate of 2g per adult or child over six years of age. No safety issues have ever been identified. In addition to its antihelminthic activity, niclosamide has novel anti-inflammatory and anti-viral properties.
  
 We believe niclosamide, and more specifically the patented and proprietary micronized niclosamide formulation developed by First Wave, has the potential to be an ideal therapeutic to treat multiple GI indications due to the following favorable properties: (i) it has a reduced particle size ((D(90) between 5 and 9 µM) as compared to regular non-micronized niclosamide (approximately D(90) ≥ 60µM) with greater surface to solvent ratio, (ii) low oral bio-availability with minimal systemic absorption / exposure, (iii) improved dissolution with broader distribution allowing for higher local GI concentrations (up to approximately 200 times based on preclinical study results), and (iv) it exhibits anti-inflammatory effects while avoiding steroid-related complications and adverse events.

  Background
  
  FW-1022: COVID-19 GI infections
  
  The COVID-19 pandemic is a global public health emergency caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. An increasing volume of convergent evidence indicates that GI infection and fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 are important factors in the clinical presentation, virology and epidemiology of COVID-19. There is currently no etiological treatment for COVID-19 GI effects. We believe our FW-1022 micronized niclosamide formulation will be the only one being tested in clinical trials for a COVID-19 GI indication. Given the potentially critical role of COVID GI infections we believe there is a clear unmet therapeutic need.
  
  Drug repurposing and/or repositioning aimed at identifying new therapeutic applications for existing clinically approved drugs is a critical strategy to accelerate drug discovery for the COVID-19 pandemic. Multiple companies and laboratories have identified and validated niclosamide to have potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2.
  
  A study published in July 2020 in Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, an American Society for Microbiology journal (Jeon et. al, 2020) examined a small set (n=49) of FDA-approved drugs that were selected based on either having known activity against SARS-CoV or being recommended by infectious disease experts for activity against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Results from this study indicated that niclosamide was the most potent of all agents tested in a Vero cell cytopathic assay with an IC50 value of 0.28 µM. For comparison, in terms of potency, niclosamide out-performed reference compounds chloroquine, lopinavir, and remdesivir with IC50 values of 7.28, 9.12, and 11.41 µM, respectively. IC50 is a quantitative measure that indicates how much of a particular inhibitory substance (e.g. a drug) is needed to inhibit, in vitro, a given biological process or biological component by fifty percent. Thus, niclosamide is approximately 25-fold more potent in vitro than VEKLURY® (remdesivir), an antiviral drug marketed by Gilead Sciences Inc. that received FDA approval in October 2020 for use in adult and pediatric patients for the treatment of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization.
  
  Following oral administration, niclosamide is poorly absorbed, which results in a majority of the administered dose remaining in the GI tract. We believe this basic property of niclosamide, when combined with FW-1022 the micronized niclosamide FW-1022 in the drug product developed by First Wave to accelerate dissolution, allows this drug product to achieve pharmacologically effective concentrations of niclosamide in the GI tract while having almost no bioavailability, potentially enhancing efficacy and safety. We believe these properties make our FW-1022 micronized niclosamide formulation an ideal and differentiated therapeutic for treating COVID-19 infections and GI symptoms.
  
  There are multiple other late-stage clinical trials evaluating the standard (non-micronized) formulation of niclosamide in COVID-19. We believe this further indicates that available data on niclosamide’s antiviral properties against SARS-CoV-2 is considered by others to be sufficient to proceed with clinical testing.
  
  We are developing FW-1022, a medicinal product containing micronized niclosamide in an immediate release tablet formulation as treatment for SARS-CoV-2 intestinal infection in patients presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms of COVID-19 disease. Evidence of niclosamide’s antiviral properties is sufficient to expect a clinical pharmacodynamic response against viral replication and clinical benefit, justifying the proposed clinical study in COVID-19 patients and favorable benefit -risk assessment.
  
  FW-420: Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Colitis (ICI-AC)
  
  Immune checkpoint inhibitors (“ICIs”) are monoclonal antibodies that target down-regulators of the anti-cancer immune response and have gained increasing popularity and have revolutionized the treatment of a variety of malignancies. However, many immune-related adverse events, especially diarrhea and colitis, limit their use. A 2019 study titled, “Immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced colitis: A comprehensive review,” published in World Journal of Clinical Cases (Sol et.al, 2019) estimated the incidence of IMC ranges from 1% to 25% depending on the type of ICI and whether they are used in combination. A 2017 study titled “Incidence of immune checkpoint inhibitor-related colitis in solid tumor patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis” published in Oncoimmunology (Wang and Zhao et.al, 2017) estimated that approximately 44%, or 260,000 patients with advanced and metastatic tumors were eligible to receive ICIs. Further, approximately 30% of ICI patients develop diarrhea, which can progress to colitis. The onset of diarrhea in ICI-AC patients occurs within six to seven weeks and progressively worsens, and the progression to colitis is rapid and unpredictable.
  
 
   
-10-



 
 

  In patients taking Yervoy® (ipilimumab) marketed by Bristol Myers Squibb, between 25% to 30% developed diarrhea and approximately 8% to 12% developed colitis, as reported in a peer-reviewed article, “Immune-checkpoint inhibitor-induced diarrhea and colitis in patients with advanced malignancies: retrospective review at MD Anderson” published in the Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer (Wang et. al,, 2018). Moreover, there is a treatment trend towards the use of combination ICI therapies (for example combining Yervoy® and Opdivo®), which is believed to lead to a concomitant increase in both diarrhea and colitis.
  
  We believe there currently is no approved treatment for Grade-1 colitis. The recommended treatment for Grade 2 or more severe colitis is administration of corticosteroids, or treatment with certain immunosuppressive biologics, while withholding ICI therapy (National Cancer Institute, 2020). The impact of this colitis complication and treatment may reduce the goal of progression free cancer survival. We believe there is an unmet medical need and an oral, non-absorbed therapeutic, such as our FW-420 micronized niclosamide, for Grade-1 colitis (diarrhea) may prevent progression to Grade-2 disease.
  
  Clinical Development
  
  Recent discoveries in immune cell metabolism have opened up the possibility of selectively targeting disease-causing immune cells to treat inflammatory diseases without unwanted side effects such as broad immunosuppression. Prior to entering into the First Wave License Agreement, First Wave had developed a suite of drug candidates, gut-restricted small molecules that target the metabolism of disease-causing Th17 cells. First Wave’s first clinical program, FW-424, had encouraging data from a study Phase 1b/2a study in patients with mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis.
  
 In addition, First Wave submitted an IND for FW-1022 micronized niclosamide for COVID-19 GI infections that was cleared by the FDA in September 2020.
  
  Following the entry into the First Wave License Agreement, we plan to commence both a Phase 2 trial for COVID-19 GI infections as well as a Phase 1b/2a trial for ICI-AC.
  
  Agreements and Collaborations
  
  License Agreement with First Wave Bio, Inc.
  
  On December 31, 2020, we entered into the First Wave License Agreement, pursuant to which First Wave granted us a worldwide, exclusive right to develop, manufacture, and commercialize First Wave’s proprietary immediate release and enema formulations of niclosamide for the fields of treating ICI-AC and COVID-19 in humans (the “Niclosamide Product”). We plan to commence in 2021 both a Phase 2 trial of the Niclosamide Product for COVID-19 in GI and a Phase 1b/2a trial for ICI-AC.
  
  In consideration of the license and other rights granted by First Wave, we agreed to pay First Wave a $9.0 million upfront cash payment due within 10 days and are obligated to make an additional payment of $1.25 million due on June 30, 2021. In addition, we are obligated to pay potential milestone payments to First Wave totaling up to $37.0 million for each indication, based upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones. Under the First Wave License Agreement we are obligated to pay First Wave royalties as a mid-single digit percentage of net sales of the Niclosamide Product, subject to specified reductions. We are also obligated to issue to First Wave junior convertible preferred stock, initially convertible into $3.0 million worth of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Common Stock”), based upon the volume weighted average price of the Common Stock for the five-day period immediately preceding the date of the License Agreement, or $0.9118 per share. The preferred stock will convert automatically into Common Stock upon the stockholder approval.
  
  In addition, on January 8, 2021, pursuant to the First Wave License Agreement we entered into a securities purchase agreement with First Wave (the “First Wave Purchase Agreement”) pursuant to which we issued to First Wave 3,290.1960 shares of Series C Preferred Stock, initially convertible into an aggregate of 3,290,196 shares of Common Stock, at an initial stated value of $750.00 per share and a conversion price of $0.75 per share, which was the equivalent of $3.0 million at $0.9118 per share. The First Wave Purchase Agreement contains demand and piggyback registration rights with respect to the Common Stock issuable upon conversion.
  
  We are now solely responsible, and has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts, for all development, regulatory and commercial activities related to the Niclosamide Products in the ICI-AC and COVID-19 fields.

  Protea Stock Purchase Agreement and Asset Sale and Purchase Agreement
  
  In May 2014, we entered into a stock purchase agreement (the “Protea SPA”) with Protea to acquire 100% of the outstanding capital stock of ProteaBio Europe SAS (the “Protea Acquisition”). In June 2014, we completed the Protea Acquisition in exchange for the payment to Protea of $600,000 and the issuance of shares of our Series A Preferred convertible into 33% of our outstanding Common Stock. Pursuant to the Protea SPA, Protea Sub assigned (i) to Protea Europe all of its rights, assets, know-how and intellectual property rights in connection with program PR1101 and those granted under that certain Joint Research and Development Agreement (the “JDLA”), by and among Protea Sub, Protea Europe and Mayoly, dated March 22, 2010; and (ii) to us all amounts, together with any right of reimbursement, due to Protea Sub in connection with outstanding stockholder loans.
  
  Pursuant to the Protea SPA, we were obligated to pay certain other contingent consideration upon the satisfaction of certain events, including (a) a one-time milestone payment of $2.0 million due within ten days of receipt of the first approval by the FDA of a New Drug Application (“NDA”) or Biological License Application (“BLA”) for a Business Product (as such term is defined in the Protea SPA); (b) royalty payments equal to 2.5% of net sales of Business Product up to $100.0 million and 1.5% of net sales of Business Product in excess of $100.0 million; and (c) 10% of the transaction value (as defined in the Protea SPA) received in connection with a sale or transfer of the pharmaceutical development business of Protea Europe.
  
  In December 2018, we entered into a purchase agreement (the “Protea Purchase Agreement”) with Protea Biosciences Group, Inc. and Protea, its wholly owned subsidiary, pursuant to which we agreed to purchase the rights to any milestone payments, royalty payments, and transaction value consideration due from us to Protea now or in the future, arising from the Protea SPA (the “Purchased Assets”). In accordance with the terms of the Protea Purchase Agreement, we purchased the Purchased Assets from Protea for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.6 million. We paid approximately $0.3 million of the purchase price in cash, and the remaining approximately $1.3 million was paid by the issuance of shares of Common Stock, at a price of $1.77 per share, resulting in the issuance of 734,463 shares of Common Stock to Protea.
  
  Mayoly JDLA and Subsequent Asset Purchase Agreement
  
  In March 2010, Protea and AzurRx SAS entered into the JDLA with Mayoly pursuant to which Mayoly sublicensed certain of its exclusive rights to a genetically engineered yeast strain cell line on which our MS1819 is based that derive from a Usage and Cross-Licensing Agreement dated February 2, 2006 between Mayoly and INRA, in charge of patent management acting for and on behalf of CNRS and INRA.
  
  In January 2014, Protea entered into an amended and restated JDLA with Mayoly (the “Mayoly Agreement”), pursuant to which Protea acquired the exclusive right to Mayoly patents and technology, with the right to sublicense, develop, manufacture and commercialize human pharmaceuticals based on the MS1819 lipase within the following territories: U.S. and Canada, South America (excluding Brazil), Asia (excluding China and Japan), Australia, New Zealand and Israel.

      Asset Purchase Agreement with Mayoly
  
  In March 2019, the Company and Mayoly entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement and associated Assignment Agreement and Delegation and Set-off Agreement (together, the “Mayoly APA”), pursuant to which we purchased all remaining rights, title and interest in and to MS1819. Upon execution of the Mayoly APA, the JDLA previously executed by AzurRx SAS and Mayoly was assigned to us. In addition, the Company executed a Patent License Agreement with Mayoly pursuant to which we granted to Mayoly an exclusive, royalty-bearing right to revenue received from commercialization of MS1819 within France and Russia. We have exclusive rights to MS1819 in all other global territories.
  
  In accordance with the Mayoly APA and related transaction documents, we provided to Mayoly the following consideration:

 
  (i)
   we assumed certain of Mayoly’s liabilities with respect to MS1819;

 
  (ii)
   we assumed all amounts currently owed to AzurRx SAS by Mayoly under the JDLA;

 
  (iii)
   we agreed to pay, within 30 days after the execution of the Mayoly APA, all amounts incurred by Mayoly for the maintenance of patents related to MS1819 from January 1, 2019 through the date of the Mayoly APA;


  (iv)
 we made an initial payment to Mayoly of €800,000, which amount was paid by the issuance of 400,481 shares of Common Stock at a price of $2.29 per share (the “Closing Payment Shares”); and

 
  (v)
   we agreed to pay to Mayoly an additional €1,500,000, payable in a mix of cash and shares of Common Stock as follows (the “ Milestone Payments”): (i) on December 31, 2019, a cash payment of €400,000 and 200,240 shares of Common Stock (the “2019 Escrow Shares”) and (ii) on December 31, 2020, a cash payment of €350,000 and 175,210 shares of Common Stock (the “2020 Escrow Shares” and, together with the 2019 Escrow Shares, the “Escrow Shares”).

 
  The Closing Payment Shares and the Escrow Shares were all issued upon execution of the Mayoly APA; provided, however, per the terms of the Mayoly APA, the Escrow Shares will be held in escrow until the applicable milestone payment date, at which time the respective Escrow Shares will be vested and released to Mayoly (See Note 14).

  TransChem Sublicense
  
  In August 2017, we entered into the TransChem Sublicense Agreement pursuant to which TransChem granted to us an exclusive license to certain patents (the “TransChem Licensed Patents”) relating to H. pylori 5’methylthioadenosine nucleosidase inhibitors. The Sublicense Agreement and the licenses granted therein may be terminated by us for any reason and without further liability on 60 days’ notice. Unless terminated earlier, the Sublicense Agreement will expire upon the expiration of the last Licensed Patents. Upon execution, we paid an upfront fee to TransChem and agreed to reimburse TransChem for certain expenses previously incurred in connection with the preparation, filing, and maintenance of the Licensed Patents. We also agreed to pay TransChem certain future periodic sublicense maintenance fees, which fees may be credited against future royalties. We may also be required to pay TransChem additional payments and royalties in the event certain performance-based milestones and commercial sales involving the Licensed Patents are achieved. The TransChem Licensed Patents allowed us to develop compounds for treating gastrointestinal, lung and other infections that are specific to individual bacterial species. H. pylori bacterial infections are a major cause of chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, gastric cancer and other diseases.
  
  In March 2020, we provided TransChem with sixty (60) days prior written notice of its intent to terminate the TransChem Sublicense Agreement.
  
  Intellectual Property
  
  Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our drug candidates, formulations, processes, methods and any other proprietary technologies, preserve our trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States and in other countries. Our policy is to actively seek to obtain, where appropriate, the broadest intellectual property protection possible for our current drug candidates and any future drug candidates, proprietary information and proprietary technology through a combination of contractual arrangements and patents, both in the United States and abroad. However, patent protection may not afford us with complete protection against competitors who seek to circumvent our patents.
  
  We also depend upon the skills, knowledge, experience and know-how of our management and research and development personnel, as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other contractors. To help protect our proprietary know-how, which is not patentable, and for inventions for which patents may be difficult to enforce, we currently rely and will in the future rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. To this end, we require all of our employees, consultants, advisors and other contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business.
  
  MS1819
  
  The MS1819 program is protected by the following issued patents that we have licensed under the Mayoly Agreement:
  
  ●
  PCT/FR2006/001352 patent family (including the patent EP2035556 and patent US8,334,130 and US8,834,867) “Method for producing lipase, transformed Yarrowia lipolytica cell capable of producing said lipase and their uses” describes a method for producing Yarrowia lipolytica acid-resistant recombinant lipase utilizing a culture medium without any products of animal origin or non-characterized mixtures such as tryptone, peptone or lactoserum, in addition to its uses. The European patents expire June 15, 2026, U.S. patent 8,334,130 expires September 11, 2028, and U.S. patent 8,834,867 expires September 15, 2026.

 
  In addition, a provisional application was filed in 2020 directed to our proprietary formulation of MS1819. Any patent application claiming priority to this provisional application upon issuance will have an expected expiration in 2041.

  Niclosamide
  
 Our FW-420 and FW-1022 niclosamide programs are protected by patent filings licensed under the First Wave License Agreement that include the following:
  
  ●
 US10,912,746; US10,905,666;US10,292,951; US10,772,854; US10,744,103; US10,799,468; US10,849,867; and U.S. Patent Application Publication US20200276140 as well as corresponding worldwide patent filings all entitled “Methods and Compositions for Treating Conditions Associated with an Abnormal Inflammatory Process.” The expiration date of the issued patents is September 1, 2036;
 
  ●
  A series of provisional and yet unpublished applications all filed in 2020, including U.S. Application Serial No. 16/835,307, directed to the use of niclosamide for the treatment of COVID-19 gastrointestinal infections, which has been allowed and upon issuance will have an expiration date in 2040.

 
  Manufacturing
  
 We currently outsource all manufacturing, and we intend to use our collaborators and contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs) for the foreseeable future. However, certain members of our team have broad experience in manufacturing, which we believe may provide a competitive advantage.
  
  MS1819
  
 MS1819 API is obtained by fermentation in bioreactors using our engineered and proprietary Yarrowia lipolytica strain. The proprietary yeast cell line from which the API is derived is kept at a storage facility maintained by Charles River. MS1819 drug substance is currently manufactured at a contract facility located in Capua, Italy owned by Olon SpA. MS1819 drug product is currently manufactured at a contract facilities located in Reims, France and Craigavon, United Kingdom owned by Delpharm and Almac Pharma Services. We believe there are multiple alternative contract manufacturers capable of producing the product we need for clinical trials. We are in the process of establishing alternative manufacturers and manufacturing sites for the product; however, there is no guarantee that the processes are easily reproducible and transferrable. In December 2020, we entered into a master service agreement with Asymchem to initiate the transfer of the manufacturing process for both drug substance and drug product.
  
  Niclosamide
  
 Niclosamide API is obtained by chemical synthesis and is currently manufactured by Olon SpA at a facility in Murcia, Spain. Niclosamide drug product is currently manufactured at a contract facility located in Milan, Italy owned by Monteresearch. We believe there are multiple alternative contract manufacturers capable of producing the product we need for clinical trials; however, there is no guarantee that the processes are easily reproducible and transferrable.
 Competition
  
 The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition. Many companies of all sizes, including major pharmaceutical companies and specialized biotechnology companies, are engaged in the development and commercialization of therapeutic agents designed for the treatment of the same diseases and disorders that we target. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources, larger research and development staff and more experience in the regulatory approval process. Moreover, potential competitors have or may have patents or other rights that conflict with patents covering our technologies.
  
  MS1819
  
 With respect to MS1819, we will compete with PERTs (pancrelipase), a well-established market that is currently dominated by a few large pharmaceutical companies, including CREON® marketed by AbbVie Inc., ZENPEP® sold to Nestlé S.A. by Allergan plc. in January 2020, PANCREAZE® marketed by VIVUS, Inc. and PERTZYE® marketed by Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A. There are currently six PERT products that have been approved by the FDA for sale in the U.S. We believe our ability to compete in this market, if we are successful in developing and obtaining regulatory approval to market MS1819, will depend on our ability (or that of a future corporate partner) to convince patients, their physicians, healthcare payors and the medical community of the benefits of using a non-animal-based product to treat EPI, as well as by addressing other shortcomings associated with PERTs, including a large pill burden.

  Niclosamide
  
 With respect to FW-1022, micronized niclosamide for COVID-19 GI infections, if approved, we will compete with currently approved antivirals, including VEKLURY® (remdesivir) marketed by Gilead Sciences, Inc. and vaccines, including those marketed by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE, Moderna, Inc. Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca plc. There are also several therapeutic and vaccine candidates in various stages of development that may obtain regulatory approval for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19 infections. Additionally, there are currently ongoing clinical studies using niclosamide by ANA Therapeutics (acquired by NeuroBo Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), Daewoong Pharmaceuticals Co Ltd, and Union Therapeutics A/S, among others at various stages of development. We believe our approach to target COVID-19 GI infections is differentiated. We believe our ability to compete in this market, if we are successful in developing and obtaining regulatory approval to market FW-1022, will depend on our ability (or that of future corporate partners) to convince patients, their physicians, healthcare agencies and payors and the medical community of the benefits of using a GI restricted FW-1022 to treat COVID-19 infections with GI symptoms.
  
 With respect to FW-420, micronized niclosamide for ICI-AC, we will compete with both oral and intravenous administered steroids as well as hospital-based infusions of biologics, including infliximab and vedolizumab. We believe our ability to compete in this market, if we are successful in developing and obtaining regulatory approval to market FW-420, will depend on our ability (or that of future corporate partners) to convince patients, their physicians, healthcare agencies and payors and the medical community of the benefits of using a non-steroidal, non-biologic therapeutic option for the treatment of ICI-AC.
  
  Government Regulation and Product Approval
  
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. To date, our internal research and development efforts have been conducted in France. We expect to continue to perform substantially all of our basic research activities in France in order to leverage our human capital expertise as well as to avail ourselves of tax credits (CIR) awarded by the French government to research companies that perform research activities in France. We expect to continue to conduct early stage development work in France, with late stage development work, including Phase 2b and Phase 3 clinical trials for MS1819 in both the United States and Europe, as North America is our principal target market for MS1819 and any other drug candidates that we may successfully develop.  
 U.S. Government Regulation 
  
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations, and biologics under the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and its implementing regulations. FDA approval is required before any new unapproved drug or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the United States. Drugs and biologics are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements at any time during the drug development process, clinical testing, the approval process or after approval, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA's refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, placement on Import Alerts, debarment of personnel, employees or officers, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.
  
 
   
-16-



 
 
  The process required by the FDA before drug candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
  
  ●
  completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests, preclinical animal studies, and toxicity data, all performed in accordance with the good laboratory practices, or GLP, regulations;

 
  ●
  submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin;

 
  ●
  approval by an independent IRB or ethics committee representing each clinical site before each clinical study may be initiated;

 
  ●
  performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies to establish the safety and efficacy, or in the case of a biologic, the safety, purity and potency, of the drug candidate for each proposed indication;

 
  ●
  preparation of and submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA, or biologics license application, or BLA, after completion of all pivotal clinical studies;

 
  ●
  review of the product application by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate and if applicable;

 
  ●
  a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA or BLA to file the application for review;

 
  ●
   satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities where the drug candidate is produced to assess compliance with cGMP; and

  
  ●
  FDA review and approval of an NDA or BLA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug or biologic in the United States.

 
 An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational new drug. An IND must become effective before human clinical studies may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to the proposed clinical studies. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before clinical studies can begin. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in the FDA allowing clinical studies to commence.
  
  Clinical Studies
  
 Clinical studies involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical studies are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, and the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical study and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Additionally, approval must also be obtained from each clinical study site's IRB before the studies may be initiated, and the IRB must monitor the study until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

  The clinical investigation of a drug or biologic is generally divided into three or four phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined.
  
  ●
  Phase 1 . The drug or biologic is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the investigational new drug in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.

 
  ●
  Phase 2 . The drug or biologic is administered to a limited patient population to evaluate dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks and preliminarily evaluate efficacy.

 
  ●
  Phase 3 . The drug or biologic is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical study sites to generate enough data to statistically evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.

 
  ●
  Phase 4 . In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA or BLA for a drug candidate on the sponsor's agreement to conduct additional clinical studies after approval. In other cases, a sponsor may commit to conducting or voluntarily conduct additional clinical studies after approval to gain more information about the drug. Such post-approval studies are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical studies.

 
  A confirmatory or pivotal study is a clinical study that adequately meets regulatory agency requirements for the evaluation of a drug candidate's efficacy and safety such that it can be used to justify the approval of the product. Generally, pivotal studies are Phase 3 studies, but the FDA may accept results from Phase 2 studies if the study design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in situations where there is an unmet medical need and the results are sufficiently robust. In such cases, FDA may require post-market studies for safety and efficacy to be conducted for the drug candidate. The FDA may withdraw the approval if the results indicate that the approved drug is not safe or effective. 
  
  The FDA, the IRB or the clinical study sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Additionally, some clinical studies are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical study based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate. 
  
  Submission of an NDA or BLA to the FDA
  
  Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed investigational new drug product information is submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs and BLAs is subject to a substantial application user fee. Applications for orphan drug products are exempted from the NDA and BLA application user fees. 
  
  An NDA or BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product's chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA.
  
  Once an NDA or BLA has been submitted, the FDA's goal is to review the application within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
  
 
   
-18-



 
 
  Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP.
  
  The FDA is required to refer an application for an investigational drug or biologic to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the investigational product application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions and typically follows such recommendations.
  
  The FDA's Decision on an NDA or BLA 
  
 After the FDA evaluates the NDA or BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug or biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical study(ies), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical studies, preclinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA could also approve the NDA or BLA with a REMS to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications or a commitment to conduct one or more post-market studies or clinical studies. Such post-market testing may include Phase 4 clinical studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product's safety and effectiveness after commercialization. The FDA may have the authority to withdraw its approval if post-market testing fails to verify the approved drug's clinical benefit, if the applicant does not perform the required testing with due diligence, or if the any other evidence demonstrates the approved drug is not safe or effective, among other reasons. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA's policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.
  
  Expedited Review and Accelerated Approval Programs 
  
 The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, accelerated approval, regenerative medicine advanced therapy and priority review, that are intended to expedite the development and approval of new drugs and biologics that address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases and conditions. To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. The FDA may review sections of the NDA for a fast-track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA. 
  
 The FDA may give a priority review designation to drugs that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current. These six and ten-month review periods are measured from the "filing" date rather than the receipt date for NDAs for new molecular entities, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission. Most products that are eligible for fast-track designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review.
  
 In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may be eligible for accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical studies establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoint, and the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures. 
  
 
   
-19-



 
 
 Moreover, under the provisions of the FDA Safety and Innovation Act passed in July 2012, a sponsor can request designation of a drug candidate as a "breakthrough therapy." A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug or biologic that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for the other expedited review and approval programs, including accelerated approval, priority review, regenerative medicine advanced therapy, and fast-track designation. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. 
  
 In addition, the 21st Century Cures Act in 2016 made the Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy, or RMAT, designation available for investigational drugs that are intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious condition, with preliminary clinical evidence indicating that the drug has the potential for addressing unmet medical needs for such condition. The RMAT designation is available for cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering products, human cell and tissue products, and combination products that use such therapies or products. The advantages of RMAT designation include those of breakthrough and fast track designations, such as early interactions with FDA and rolling review of applications, and the drug candidate with the RMAT designation may be eligible for accelerated approval. Requests for RMAT designations should be made with the IND application (if preliminary clinical evidence is available), but no later than the end-of-phase-2 meeting. 
  
 Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
  
  Post-Approval Requirements 
  
 Drugs and biologics marketed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements. 
  
 Manufacturers are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. 
  
 Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA or BLA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA's policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development. 
  
 
   
-20-



 
 
 The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things. 
  
  ●
  restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product;

 
  ●
  complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;

 
  ●
  fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies;

 
  ●
  refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or BLAs or supplements to approved NDAs or BLAs, or suspension or revocation of product licenses or approvals;

 
  ●
  product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or

 
  ●
  injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.

 
  The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. 
  
  Orphan Designation and Exclusivity 
  
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a disease or condition with a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 individuals in the United States and when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug or biologic in the United States will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA or NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.
  
 If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for a particular active ingredient for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product marketing exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same biologic for the same use or indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA or NDA application user fee. 
  
 A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or, as noted above, if the second applicant demonstrates that its product is clinically superior to the approved product with orphan exclusivity or the manufacturer of the approved product is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. 
  
  Biosimilars and Exclusivity 
  
  The Affordable Care Act, signed into law in 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. To date, only a handful of biosimilars have been licensed under the BPCIA, although numerous biosimilars have been approved in Europe. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars. 
  
 
   
-21-



 
 
  Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, human PK and PD studies, clinical immunogenicity assessments, animal studies and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. However, complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA. 
  
  Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant's own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical studies to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed "interchangeable" by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law. 
  
  A biological product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued "Written Request" for such a study. 
  
  The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, recent government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation, and impact of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty. 
  
  Hatch-Waxman Amendments and Exclusivity 
  
  Section 505 of the FDCA describes three types of marketing applications that may be submitted to the FDA to request marketing authorization for a new drug. A Section 505(b)(1) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy. A 505(b)(2) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. This regulatory pathway enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA's prior findings of safety and efficacy for an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application. Section 505(j) establishes an abbreviated approval process for a generic version of approved drug products through the submission of an ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a generic drug product that has the same active ingredients, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, performance characteristics and intended use, among other things, to a previously approved product. ANDAs are termed "abbreviated" because they are generally not required to include preclinical (animal) and clinical (human) data to establish safety and efficacy. Instead, generic applicants must scientifically demonstrate that their product is bioequivalent to, or performs in the same manner as, the innovator drug through in vitro, in vivo or other testing. The generic version must deliver the same amount of active ingredients into a subject's bloodstream in the same amount of time as the innovator drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the reference listed drug. In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant's drug or a method of using the drug. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA. 
  
  Upon submission of an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA, an applicant must certify to the FDA that (1) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (2) such patent has expired; (3) the date on which such patent expires; or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. Generally, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA cannot be approved until all listed patents have expired, except where the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant challenges a listed patent through the last type of certification, also known as a paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA application will not be approved until all of the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. 
  
 
   
-22-



 
 
  If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the paragraph IV certification. If the paragraph IV certification is challenged by an NDA holder or the patent owner(s) asserts a patent challenge to the paragraph IV certification, the FDA may not approve that application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the notice of the paragraph IV certification, the expiration of the patent, when the infringement case concerning each such patent was favorably decided in the applicant's favor or settled, or such shorter or longer period as may be ordered by a court. This prohibition is generally referred to as the 30-month stay. In instances where an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant files a paragraph IV certification, the NDA holder or patent owner(s) regularly take action to trigger the 30-month stay, recognizing that the related patent litigation may take many months or years to resolve. 
  
  The FDA also cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until all applicable non-patent exclusivities listed in the Orange Book for the branded reference drug have expired. For example, a pharmaceutical manufacturer may obtain five years of non-patent exclusivity upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity, or NCE, which is a drug containing an active moiety that has not been approved by FDA in any other NDA. An "active moiety" is defined as the molecule responsible for the drug substance's physiological or pharmacologic action. During that five-year exclusivity period, the FDA cannot accept for filing (and therefore cannot approve) any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug or any 505(b)(2) NDA that relies on the FDA's approval of the drug, provided that that the FDA may accept an ANDA four years into the NCE exclusivity period if the ANDA applicant also files a Paragraph IV certification. 
  
  A drug, including one approved under Section 505(b)(2), may obtain a three-year period of exclusivity for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new formulation for a previously approved product, if one or more new clinical studies (other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies) was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted/sponsored by the applicant. Should this occur, the FDA would be precluded from approving any ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for the protected modification until after that three-year exclusivity period has run. However, unlike NCE exclusivity, the FDA can accept an application and begin the review process during the exclusivity period. 
  
  Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 
  
  Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physician sunshine laws and regulations. If their operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply, they may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and individual imprisonment. 
 Coverage and Reimbursement 
  
  Sales of any product depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations and the level of reimbursement for such product by third-party payors. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products, drugs and services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product and also have a material adverse effect on sales. Even after FDA approves a product, failure to have the product covered by third-party payors may have material adverse effect on sales. Federal and state governments continue to promulgate new policies and regulations; such policies and regulations may have material adverse effect on sales. These laws and regulations may restrict, prohibit, or preventing us from implementing a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing, promotion, sales commission, incentive programs, and other business activities. No uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement among third-party payors exists in the United States. Such payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy establishing their coverage and reimbursement policies. However, each payor makes independent and separate decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided.

  Healthcare Reform 
  
  In March 2010, former President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States, and significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act contains a number of provisions, including those governing enrollments in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement adjustments and fraud and abuse changes. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act increases the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1%; requires collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; requires manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program, under which they must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer's outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and imposes a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell "branded prescription drugs" to specified federal government programs. 
  
  Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the Affordable Care Act in the future. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year and reduced payments to several types of Medicare providers. Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, proposing to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. 
  
  Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
  
  Our business activities may be subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and similar anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, regulations or rules of other countries in which we operate. The FCPA generally prohibits offering, promising, giving, or authorizing others to give anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to a non-U.S. government official in order to influence official action, or otherwise obtain or retain business. The FCPA also requires public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the corporation and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Our business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with public officials, including officials of non-U.S. governments. Additionally, in many other countries, the health care providers who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by their government, and the purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, our dealings with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA. There is no certainty that all of our employees, agents, suppliers, manufacturers, contractors, or collaborators, or those of our affiliates, will comply with all applicable laws and regulations, particularly given the high level of complexity of these laws. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, the closing down of facilities, including those of our suppliers and manufacturers, requirements to obtain export licenses, cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries, implementation of compliance programs, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries as well as difficulties in manufacturing or continuing to develop our products, and could materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, and our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition.
 European Union Drug Development
  
  In the European Union, our drug candidates may also be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can only be marketed if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained. 
  
  Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. Clinical trials of medicinal products in the European Union must be conducted in accordance with European Union, national regulations and international standards for good clinical practice, or GCP. 
  
 
   
-24-



 
 
  Clinical trials are currently governed by EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC that set out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the European Union. 
  
  To improve the current system, Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 on clinical trials on medicinal products for human use was adopted in 2014. The Regulation aims at harmonizing and streamlining the clinical trials authorization process, simplifying adverse event reporting procedures, improving the supervision of clinical trials, and increasing their transparency, notably via a clinical trial information system set up by the EMA. The new Regulation expressly provides that it will not be applied before six months after the publication of a notice delivered by the European Commission on the European Union clinical trial portal and database. As such notice requires a successful (partial) audit of the database and as that database is still under development, there is no scheduled application date yet. Pursuant to the transitory provisions of the new regulation, the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC will still apply for three years after the implementation of the European Union clinical trial portal and database. Thus, the sponsor has the possibility to choose between the requirements of the directive and the regulation for a period of three years from the entry into force of the regulation. 
  
  European Union Drug Review and Approval 
  
  In the EEA (which is comprised of the 28 Member States of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. MAs may be granted either centrally (Community MA) or nationally (National MA). 
  
  The Community MA is issued centrally by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the CHMP of the EMA and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products such as orphan medicinal products and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the European Union. 
  
  National MAs are issued nationally by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory. National MAs are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. We do not foresee that any of our current drug candidates will be suitable for a National MA as they fall within the mandatory criteria for the Centralized Procedure. Therefore, our drug candidates will be approved through Community MAs. 
  
  Under the above-described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. 
  
  The paediatric use marketing authorisation, or PUMA, is a dedicated marketing authorization for medicinal products indicated exclusively for use in the pediatric population, with, if necessary, an age-appropriate formulation. Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006 (The “Paediatric Regulation”), all PUMA applications for marketing authorization for new medicines must include to be valid, in addition to the particulars and documents referred to in Directive 2001/83/EC, the results of all studies performed and details of all information collected in compliance with a pediatric investigation plan agreed between regulatory authorities and the applicant, unless the medicine is exempt because of a deferral or waiver of the EMA.
  
  Before the EMA is able to begin its assessment of a Community MA application, it will validate that the applicant has complied with the agreed pediatric investigation plan. The applicant and the EMA may, where such a step is adequately justified, agree to modify a pediatric investigation plan to assist validation. Modifications are not always possible; may take longer to agree than the period of validation permits; and may still require the applicant to withdraw its marketing authorization application and to conduct additional non-clinical and clinical studies. Products that are granted a MA on the basis of the pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, are eligible for a six-month extension of the protection under a supplementary protection certificate (if any is in effect at the time of approval) or, in the case of orphan medicinal products, a two-year extension of the orphan market exclusivity. This pediatric reward is subject to specific conditions and is not automatically available when data in compliance with the PIP are developed and submitted.

  Orphan Drugs 
  
  In the European Union, Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of December 16, 1999 on orphan medicinal products, as amended, states that a drug shall be designated as an orphan drug if its sponsor can establish that the three following cumulative conditions are met:
  
  ●
  the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition;

 
  ●
  the prevalence of the conditions is not more than five in ten thousand persons in the European Union when the application is made, or that it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the European Union and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the drug in the European Union would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment; and

 
  ●
  that there is no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the European Union or, if such method exists, that the drug will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition.

 
  Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000 of April 27, 2000 laying down the provisions for implementation of the criteria for designation of a medicinal product as an orphan medicinal product and definitions of the concepts "similar medicinal product" and "clinical superiority", an application for the designation of a drug as an orphan drug must be submitted at any stage of development of the drug before filing of a MA application. 
  
  The European Union offers incentives to encourage the development of designated orphan medicines (protocol assistance, fee reductions, etc.) and provides opportunities for market exclusivity. Pursuant to abovementioned Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000, products receiving orphan designation in the European Union can obtain market exclusivity for a certain number of years in the European Union following the marketing approval. 
  
  If a Community MA in respect of an orphan drug is granted, regulatory authorities will not, for a period of usually ten years, accept another application for a MA, or grant a MA or accept an application to extend an existing MA, for the same therapeutic indication, in respect of a similar drug. This period may however be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established, in respect of the drug concerned, that the above-mentioned criteria for orphan drug designation are no longer met, in other words, when it is shown on the basis of available evidence that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. 
  
  Pursuant to Regulation No. 1901/2006, for orphan medicinal products, instead of an extension of the supplementary protection certificate, the ten-year period of orphan market exclusivity should be extended to 12 years if the requirement for data on use in the pediatric population is fully met (i.e. when the request contains the results of all studies carried out under the approved PIP and when the declaration attesting the conformity of the request to this PIP is included in the MA). 
  
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a MA may be granted, for the same therapeutic indication, to a similar drug if:
  
  ●
  the holder of the MA for the original orphan drug has given its consent to the second applicant;

 
  ●
  the holder of the MA for the original orphan drug is unable to supply sufficient quantities of the drug; or

 
  ●
  the second applicant can establish in the application that the second drug, although similar to the orphan drug already authorized, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior.

 
 
  The abovementioned Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 provides for other incentives regarding orphan medicinal products.
  
  Post-Approval Controls 
  
  The holder of a MA must comply with EU requirements applicable to manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products. In particular, the holder of the MA must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance, or QPPV, who is responsible for oversight of that system and who will reside and operate in the EU. Key obligations include safety expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of periodic safety update reports, or PSURs. 
  
 
   
-26-



 
 
  All new MAs must include a risk management plan, or RMP, to submit to the EMA, describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the MA. Such risk-minimization measures or post-authorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs, or the conduct of additional clinical trials or post-authorization safety studies. RMPs and PSURs are routinely available to third parties requesting access, subject to limited redactions. All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved summary of product characteristics, and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is also prohibited in the European Union. Although general requirements for advertising and promotion of medicinal products are established under EU directives, the details are governed by regulations in each EU Member State and can differ from one country to another.
  
  Reimbursement 
  
  The European Union provides options for its Member States to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A Member State may approve a specific price for the medicinal product, or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. For example, in France, effective market access will be supported by agreements with hospitals and products may be reimbursed by the Social Security Fund. The price of medicines covered by national health insurance is negotiated with the Economic Committee for Health Products, or CEPS. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our drug candidates. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.
 Other European Regulatory Matters 
  
  French Regulatory Framework for Clinical Development
  
  In France, Directive No. 2001/20/EC has been implemented in French national law, establishing a system of prior authorization and requiring a prior favorable opinion from an ethics committee. 
  
  Parties to a clinical trial agreement, or CTA, must use a CTA template (“unique agreement” or convention unique) to organize the conduct of interventional clinical trials with commercial purpose, as well as specific template exhibits to this agreement. Once concluded, the CTA is communicated for information by the sponsor to the French national board of physicians (Ordre national des médecins) without delay. 
  
  The processing of personal data collected during clinical trials has to comply with the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 and Law No 2018-493 of June 20, 2018 on the protection of personal data, implementing the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 requirements. Regarding automatic processing operations for the purpose of research or clinical studies, formalities have to be completed before the French data protection authority, the Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés, or CNIL, so as to obtain the authorization to process personal data. However, there are simplified standards.
  
 
   
-27-



 
 
  Law No. 2011-2012 of December 29, 2011, or Loi Bertrand, aimed at strengthening the health safety of medicinal and health products, as amended (and its implementing decrees), introduced into French law provisions regarding transparency of fees received by some healthcare professionals from health product industries, i.e. companies manufacturing or marketing health products (Article L.1453-1 of the French Public Health Code). These provisions have been recently extended and redefined by Decree No. 2016-1939 of December 28, 2016, which clarified French "Sunshine" regulations. The decree notably provides that companies manufacturing or marketing health care products (medicinal products, medical devices, etc.) in France shall publicly disclose (mainly on a specific public website available at: https://www.entreprises-transparence.sante.gouv.fr) the advantages and fees paid to healthcare professionals amounting to €10 or above, as well as the agreements concluded with the latter, along with detailed information about each agreement (the precise subject matter of the agreement, the date of signature of the agreement, its end date, the total amount paid to the healthcare professional, etc.). Another declaration must also be filed to the competent healthcare professional body. Law No. 2011-2012 also reinforced the French anti-gift rules and Order No. 2017-49 of January 19, 2017 amended the law and expanded the scope of the general prohibition of payments from pharmaceutical and device manufacturers to healthcare professionals to broadly cover any company manufacturing or marketing health products, regardless of whether or not payment for the products is reimbursed under the French social security system (new Articles L. 1453-3 et seq. of the French Public Health Code). It also changed the procedure related to the prior submission to the national or departmental board of the relevant healthcare professional body. Moreover, the penalties incurred for non-compliance with the requirements of the Anti-Gift Law will be doubled to a fine of up to €750,000. The changes of the anti-gift rules will only enter into force after the publication of implementing measures.
