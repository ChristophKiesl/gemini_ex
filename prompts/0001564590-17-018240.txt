Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

 Unifi, Inc., a New York corporation formed in 1969 (together with its subsidiaries, “UNIFI,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”), is a multi-national company that manufactures and sells innovative synthetic and recycled products made from polyester and nylon primarily to other yarn manufacturers and knitters and weavers that produce fabric for the apparel, hosiery, home furnishings, automotive, industrial and other end-use markets. UNIFI’s polyester products include plastic bottle flake, polyester polymer beads (“Chip”), partially oriented yarn (“POY”), and textured, solution and package dyed, twisted, beamed and draw wound yarns. Each yarn product is available in virgin or recycled varieties, where the recycled varieties are made from both pre-consumer and post-consumer waste, including plastic bottles. UNIFI’s nylon products include textured, solution dyed and spandex covered yarns.
 UNIFI maintains one of the textile industry’s most comprehensive yarn product offerings that include specialized yarns, premium value-added (“PVA”) yarns and commodity yarns, with principal geographic markets in the Americas and Asia. 
 UNIFI has manufacturing operations in four countries and participates in joint ventures in Israel and the United States, the most significant of which is a 34% non-controlling partnership interest in Parkdale America, LLC (“PAL”), a significant unconsolidated affiliate that produces cotton and synthetic yarns for sale to the global textile industry and apparel market. We believe the investment in PAL provides strategic diversification for UNIFI’s overall business in response to global textile trends. PAL is a limited liability company treated as a partnership for income tax reporting purposes. 
 UNIFI has three reportable segments:
  
• | The Polyester Segment sells polyester-based products primarily to other yarn manufacturers and knitters and weavers that produce yarn and/or fabric for the apparel, hosiery, home furnishings, automotive, industrial and other end‑use markets. The Polyester Segment consists of sales and manufacturing operations in the United States and El Salvador. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Nylon Segment sells nylon-based products to knitters and weavers that produce fabric primarily for the apparel and hosiery markets. The Nylon Segment consists of sales and manufacturing operations in the United States and Colombia. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The International Segment sells polyester-based products to knitters and weavers that produce fabric for the apparel, home furnishings, automotive, industrial and other end-use markets primarily in South America and Asia. The International Segment includes a manufacturing location in Brazil and sales offices in Brazil, China and Sri Lanka. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Other information for UNIFI’s reportable segments is provided in Note 25, “Business Segment Information,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.  In addition to UNIFI’s reportable segments, UNIFI conducts certain ancillary operations that include for-hire transportation services, which comprise an All Other category. The ancillary operations classified within All Other are immaterial to UNIFI’s consolidated financial statements.
 Operating and Strategic Overview
 UNIFI reported net income of $32,875, or $1.81 per basic share, for fiscal 2017. Such results reflect growth in sales of PVA products, especially in the International Segment, which was partially offset by (i) a difficult domestic environment, (ii) increased selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses for strategic planning, talent acquisition and commercial expansion and (iii) lower earnings from equity affiliates. Additionally, in fiscal 2017, UNIFI faced periods of fluctuating virgin polyester raw material costs, temporarily depressing the Polyester Segment’s gross margins, but benefited from (a) the recognition of a benefit for bad debts, (b) a lower effective tax rate and (c) favorable foreign currency exchange rates. The International Segment continued strong performance and growth due to the global success of UNIFI’s PVA portfolio, along with the shutdown of a competitor in Brazil in early calendar 2016.  The Polyester and Nylon Segments both experienced a difficult domestic environment, challenged by weak retail selling seasons and cautious ordering patterns from brands and retailers.

We believe UNIFI’s successful performance during recent fiscal years reflects the strength of our global initiative to deliver PVA products and solutions to customers and brand partners throughout the world. Our supply chain has been developed and enhanced in multiple regions of the globe, particularly in the Americas and Asia, allowing us to deliver a diverse range of synthetic fibers and polymers to key customers in the markets we serve, especially apparel. These polyester and nylon products are supported by quality assurance, product development and other customer service teams across UNIFI’s operating subsidiaries. We have developed this successful operating platform by: improving operational and business processes; enriching the product mix by growing sales of higher-margin PVA products; and deriving value from sustainability-based initiatives, including polyester and nylon recycling.
 This platform has provided favorable results and growth in our core operations during recent fiscal years, and has been augmented by significant capital investments that support the production and delivery of sustainable and innovative solutions. In order to achieve further growth, UNIFI is committed to investing in four strategic and synergistic initiatives:
  
1. | Commercial expansion;
---+----------------------


2. | Technology and innovation;
---+---------------------------


3. | Strategic partnerships; and
---+----------------------------


4. | People and teams.
---+------------------

 Growth in commercial expansion involves capitalizing on the existing operational excellence and brand partnerships that underlie UNIFI’s core competencies. We believe that increasing the awareness for recycled solutions in applications across fibers and polymers, particularly with performance and aesthetic characteristics, and furthering sustainability-based initiatives with like-minded brand partners will be key to our future success. With leading technology for performance yarns and recycling that satisfies today’s consumers, UNIFI intends to continue to grow its commercial capabilities across global markets.
 Establishing the existing portfolio of technologies and capabilities was a significant accomplishment, allowing REPREVE® to grow into a premier synthetic fiber.  We believe that further commercial expansion will require a continued stream of new technology and innovation that generates products with consumer-meaningful benefits. Along with REPREVE®, the Company has significant yarn technologies that provide optimal performance characteristics for today’s marketplace, including moisture management, temperature moderation, and fire retardation. To achieve further growth, UNIFI plans to invest in expanding technology and innovation, bringing to market the next wave of fibers and polymers for tomorrow’s applications.
 Growth will also require strategic partnerships. With a changing retail landscape and a dynamic consumer, brands are demanding fast fashion and localized supply chains. In order to capitalize on these shifts, we expect to identify, qualify and execute partnerships that expand our global footprint in strategic regions. As Central America and Asia remain significant components of the global supply chain, UNIFI will be diligent in exploring partnerships that advance our existing growth platform in these regions.
 Properly executing on these initiatives will require investment in UNIFI’s people and teams. With a strong culture of quality and operational excellence, UNIFI will work to further train, develop and expand its teams in order to properly support growth initiatives for future success. We expect this to result in increased SG&A expenses as we invest across the organization and global subsidiaries.
 Executing on these initiatives is expected to drive expansion in gross margins and should lead to an increase in revenue and profitability.
 Further discussion of the significant components of UNIFI’s recent success and its capital allocation strategies is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this “Annual Report”).
 PVA Products and REPREVE®
 UNIFI remains committed to growing the business for its PVA products and believes its research and development work with brands and retailers continues to create new worldwide sales opportunities.  UNIFI’s goal is to continue to increase its global PVA sales by more than 10% per year to generate overall mix enrichment and margin gains.  UNIFI’s PVA products represented approximately 40% of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2017.  The Company’s strategy of enhancing its product mix through a focus on PVA products has helped establish UNIFI as an innovation leader in its core markets and provides some insulation from the pressures of low-priced commodity yarn imports.
 3

REPREVE®, the flagship brand in UNIFI’s PVA portfolio, is also our fastest growing PVA product line.  As part of our efforts to expand consumer brand recognition of REPREVE®, UNIFI has developed recycling-focused sponsorships with various franchises and entities that span across sporting, music and outdoor events. The increasing success and awareness of the REPREVE® brand continues to provide new opportunities for growth, allowing us to expand into new end-uses and markets for REPREVE®, as well as continuing to grow the brand with current customers.  UNIFI has gained traction with global brands and retailers who obtain value and lasting consumer interest from the innovation and sustainability aspects that REPREVE® provides.
 PVA Expansion and Capital Investments
 Beginning in fiscal 2015, UNIFI began a significant three-year capital investment plan to increase its PVA capabilities and capacity, expand its technological foundation and customize its asset base to improve its ability to deliver small-lot and high-value solutions.
 During fiscal 2017, we invested approximately $40,000 in capital projects (including amounts funded by a construction financing agreement). The most significant project was the completion of the REPREVE® Bottle Processing Center at UNIFI’s existing facility in Reidsville, North Carolina. This bottle processing plant is expected to convert 2 billion plastic bottles into 75 million pounds of plastic bottle flake annually, to support our growing focus on recycling and sustainability, especially with the REPREVE® brand and its expanding portfolio. In addition to ongoing maintenance, UNIFI also made investments towards (i) completing the fourth REPREVE® Recycling Center production line, (ii) installing bi-component spinning machinery to produce specialized high-value yarns and (iii) additional machinery modifications to meet the ever-changing demands of the market, in support of the PVA product portfolio. These investments were primarily for the Polyester Segment.
 In fiscal 2018, UNIFI expects to invest an additional $35,000 in capital projects, which include (i) placing equipment in Asia in support of our expanding product portfolio and growth opportunities in that region, (ii) completing the fourth production line in the REPREVE® Recycling Center, (iii) making further improvements in production capabilities and technology enhancements in the Americas and (iv) annual maintenance capital expenditures. 
 UNIFI intends to ensure maintenance capital expenditures are sufficient to allow continued high-efficiency production. Our goal for the REPREVE® Bottle Processing Center is to continue support of REPREVE® by securing a stream of high-quality raw materials. This, combined with technology advancements in recycling that will be incorporated into the REPREVE® Recycling Center, will enhance our ability to continue to grow REPREVE® into other markets, such as nonwovens, carpet fiber and packaging.
 In addition to UNIFI’s recent three-year capital investment plan, PAL completed two business combinations in fiscal 2015, in an effort to increase its regional manufacturing capacity and expand its product offerings and customer base. 
  
• | In August 2014, PAL paid $10,125 to acquire the remaining 50% ownership interest in a yarn manufacturer based in Mexico in which PAL was historically a 50% holder. PAL recorded acquired net assets of approximately $23,600 from the transaction.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In February 2015, PAL purchased two U.S. manufacturing facilities, plus inventory, for approximately $13,000 in cash, and entered into a yarn supply agreement with the seller. PAL recorded acquired net assets of approximately $19,400 from the transaction.

Stock Repurchases
 
In addition to capital investments, UNIFI may utilize excess cash for strategic stock repurchases. Pursuant to an initial $50,000 stock repurchase program approved by UNIFI’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) in January 2013, UNIFI began periodic strategic repurchases of its common stock.  That $50,000 repurchase program was completed in March 2014. In April 2014, the Board approved a second $50,000 stock repurchase program.  As of June 25, 2017, UNIFI had repurchased a total of 3,147 shares, at an average price of $23.01, under these programs, and $27,603 remained available for repurchases under the current program.  UNIFI will continue to evaluate opportunities to use excess cash flow from operations or existing borrowings to repurchase additional stock, while maintaining sufficient liquidity to support its operational needs and fund future strategic growth opportunities.
Developments in Principal Markets
 Leading up to fiscal 2017, apparel production experienced multi-year growth in the regions covered by the North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”) and the Dominican Republic—Central America Free Trade Agreement (“CAFTA-DR”), which comprise the principal markets for UNIFI’s Polyester and Nylon Segments. The share of synthetic apparel production for these regions as a percentage of U.S. retail stabilized at approximately 17% to 18%, while retail consumption grew, especially for apparel made with synthetic yarns. The CAFTA-DR region, which continues to be a competitive alternative to Asian supply chains for textile products, maintained its share of synthetic apparel supply to U.S. retailers. The share of synthetic apparel versus cotton apparel increased and provided growth for the consumption of synthetic yarns within the CAFTA-DR region. 
 In fiscal 2017, UNIFI’s operations in the NAFTA and CAFTA-DR regions experienced demand declines as the retail and apparel markets experienced difficult conditions characterized by reduced retail traffic, a weak winter selling season and growth in online sales channels. These factors combined to cause bankruptcies, store closures and other transformations for traditional retail enterprises. As consumers demand fast fashion, personalized experiences and omni-channel outlets, the retail market and its supply chain is expected to change. Transformational requirements for the supply chain are not yet clear but will be an integral part of UNIFI’s initiatives going forward.
 UNIFI’s Brazilian subsidiary is primarily impacted by price pressures from imported fiber, fabric and finished goods, the inflation rate in Brazil and changes in the value of the Brazilian Real.  In Brazil, UNIFI continues to (i) aggressively pursue mix enrichment by working with customers to develop programs using our differentiated products and our PVA yarns and (ii) implement process improvements and manufacturing efficiency gains to help lower per-unit costs.
 UNIFI’s Asian operations remain an important part of UNIFI’s global PVA strategy, enhancing our ability to service customers with global supply chains.  Interest and demand for UNIFI’s PVA products in Asia have helped support strong sales volumes in recent years. We are encouraged by programs undertaken with key brands and retailers that benefit from the diversification and innovation of our global PVA solutions. UNIFI’s operations in China and Sri Lanka experienced strong performance and growth in fiscal 2017. Looking ahead, certain brand partners have expressed additional interest in sourcing UNIFI’s products in Vietnam.
 As we expand our global operations, we will continue to evaluate the level of capital investment required to support the needs of our customers and intend to appropriately allocate our resources accordingly.
 Industry Overview
 UNIFI operates in the textile industry and, within that broad category, the respective markets for yarns, fabrics, fibers and end-use products, such as apparel and hosiery, automotive, industrial products and home furnishings.  Even though the textile industry is global, there are several distinctive regional or other geographic markets that often shape the business strategies and operations of participants in the industry.  Because of free trade agreements and other trade regulations entered into by the U.S. government, the U.S. textile industry, which is otherwise a distinctive geographic market on its own, is often considered in conjunction with other geographic markets or regions in North, South and Central America, such as the regions covered by NAFTA and CAFTA-DR.  The Company’s principal markets for its domestic operations are in the regions covered by NAFTA and CAFTA-DR, 
 5

which together include the countries of Canada, Mexico, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic and the United States.
 According to data compiled by PCI Xylenes & Polyesters, a global leader in research and analysis for the polyester and raw materials markets, global demand for polyester yarns, which includes both filament and staple yarns, has grown steadily since 1980, and, in calendar year 2003, polyester replaced cotton as the fiber with the largest percentage of worldwide sales.  In calendar year 2016, global polyester consumption accounted for an estimated 55% of global fiber consumption, and global demand is projected to increase by approximately 3% to 4% annually through 2020.  In calendar year 2016, global nylon consumption accounted for an estimated 5% of global fiber consumption.  Softness in the U.S. retail markets during fiscal 2017 had an unfavorable impact on UNIFI’s Nylon Segment. Additionally, due to the higher cost of nylon, the industry may transition certain products from nylon to polyester. The polyester and nylon fiber sectors together accounted for approximately 62% of North American textile consumption during calendar year 2016.
 According to the National Council of Textile Organizations, the U.S. textile industry’s total shipments were approximately $61.8 billion for calendar year 2016.  During that period, the U.S. textile and apparel industry exported nearly $26.3 billion of textile and apparel products, and exports have grown by approximately 30% since 2009, an increase of over $6.1 billion. The U.S. textile industry remains a large manufacturing employer in the United States.
 Trade Regulation and Rules of Origin
 The duty rate on imports into the United States of finished apparel categories that utilize polyester and nylon yarns generally range from 16% to 32%. For many years, imports of fabric and finished goods into the United States have increased significantly from countries that do not participate in free trade agreements or trade preference programs, despite duties charged on those imports. The primary drivers for that growth were lower overseas operating costs, foreign government subsidization of textile industries, increased overseas sourcing by U.S. retailers, the entry of China into the World Trade Organization and the staged elimination of all textile and apparel quotas. Although global apparel imports represent a significant percentage of the U.S. market, Regional FTAs (as defined below), which follow general “yarn forward” rules of origin, provide duty free advantages for apparel made from regional fibers, yarns and fabrics, allowing UNIFI opportunities to participate in this growing market.
 
A significant number of UNIFI’s customers in the apparel market produce finished goods that meet the eligibility requirements for duty-free treatment in the regions covered by NAFTA, CAFTA-DR, and the Colombia and Peru free trade agreements (collectively, the “Regional FTAs”). These Regional FTAs contain rules of origin requirements in order for covered products to be eligible for duty-free treatment. In the case of textiles such as fabric, yarn (such as POY), fibers (filament and staple) and certain garments made from them, the products are generally required to be fully formed within the respective regions. UNIFI is the largest filament yarn manufacturer, and one of the few producers of qualifying synthetic yarns, in the regions covered by these agreements. On May 18, 2017, the Trump Administration formally notified Congress of its intent to renegotiate NAFTA. The United States has a positive trade balance in the textile and apparel sector in NAFTA and the Company anticipates any modifications or updates to the agreement in this sector will not significantly impact textile and apparel trade in the NAFTA region.
 U.S. legislation commonly referred to as the “Berry Amendment” stipulates that certain textile and apparel articles purchased by the U.S. Department of Defense must be manufactured in the United States and must consist of yarns and fibers produced in the United States. UNIFI is the largest producer of synthetic yarns for Berry Amendment compliant purchasing programs.
 UNIFI refers to fibers sold with specific rules of origin requirements under the Regional FTAs and the Berry Amendment, as “Compliant Yarns.”  Approximately two-thirds of UNIFI’s sales within the Polyester and Nylon Segments are sold as Compliant Yarns under the terms of the Regional FTAs or the Berry Amendment.
 UNIFI believes the requirements of the rules of origin and the associated duty-free cost advantages in the Regional FTAs, together with the Berry Amendment and the growing demand for supplier responsiveness and improved inventory turns, will ensure that a portion of the existing textile industry will remain based in the Americas. UNIFI

expects that the NAFTA and CAFTA-DR regions will continue to maintain their share of apparel production as a percentage of U.S. retail. UNIFI believes the remaining synthetic apparel production within these regional markets is more specialized and defensible, and, in some cases, apparel producers are bringing programs back to the regions as part of a balanced sourcing strategy for some brands and retailers.  Because UNIFI is the largest of only a few significant producers of Compliant Yarns under these Regional FTAs, one of UNIFI’s business strategies is to continue to leverage its eligibility status for duty-free processing to increase its share of business with regional and domestic fabric producers who ship their products into these regions.
 Over the longer term, the textile industry in the NAFTA and CAFTA-DR regions is expected to continue to be impacted by Asian supply chains where costs are much lower and regulation is limited. However, during fiscal 2017, one of the first acts of the Trump Administration was to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, a free trade agreement that could have resulted in significant pressure on the Regional FTA supply chain. 
 Competition
 The industry in which UNIFI operates is global and highly competitive.  UNIFI competes not only as a global yarn producer, but also as part of a regional supply chain for certain textile products.  For sales of Compliant Yarns, UNIFI competes with a limited number of foreign and domestic producers of polyester and nylon yarns.  For sales of non-Compliant Yarns, UNIFI competes with a larger number of foreign and domestic producers of polyester and nylon yarns who can meet the required customer specifications of quality, reliability and timeliness. UNIFI is affected by imported textile, apparel and hosiery products, which adversely impact demand for UNIFI’s polyester and nylon products in certain of its markets.  Several foreign competitors in UNIFI’s supply chain have significant competitive advantages, including lower wages, raw material costs and capital costs, and favorable foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. Dollar, any of which could make UNIFI’s products, or the related supply chains, less competitive. While competitors have traditionally focused on high-volume commodity products, they are now increasingly focused on specialty and PVA products that UNIFI historically has been able to leverage to generate higher margins.
 UNIFI’s major competitors for polyester yarns are O’Mara, Inc. and NanYa Plastics Corp. of America (“NanYa”) in the United States; AKRA, S.A. de C.V. in the NAFTA region; and C S Central America S.A. de C.V. in the CAFTA-DR region.  UNIFI’s major competitor in Brazil is Avanti Industria Comercio Importacao e Exportacao Ltda., among other traders of imported yarns and fibers.  UNIFI’s operations in Asia face competition from multiple yarn manufacturers in that region and identification of them is not feasible. However, almost all of our portfolio in that region is advantaged by PVA products. 
 UNIFI’s major competitors for nylon yarns are Sapona Manufacturing Company, Inc. and McMichael Mills, Inc. in the United States.
 Raw Materials, Suppliers and Sourcing
 The primary raw material supplier for the Polyester Segment of Chip and POY is NanYa.  For the International Segment, Reliance Industries, Ltd. is the main supplier of POY.  The primary suppliers of POY for the Nylon Segment are HN Fibers, Ltd., U.N.F. Industries Ltd. (“UNF”), UNF America, LLC (“UNFA”), Invista S.a.r.l. (“INVISTA”), Universal Premier Fibers, LLC and Nilit US (“Nilit”).  Each of UNF and UNFA is a 50/50 joint venture between UNIFI and Nilit.  Currently, there are multiple domestic and foreign suppliers available to fulfill UNIFI’s sourcing requirements for its recycled products.
 UNIFI produces and buys certain of its raw material fibers for Compliant Yarns from a variety of sources in both the United States and Israel.  UNIFI produces a portion of its Chip requirements in its REPREVE® Recycling Center and purchases the remainder of its requirements from external suppliers for use in its spinning facility to produce POY.  In addition, UNIFI purchases nylon and polyester products for resale from various suppliers.  Although UNIFI does not generally have difficulty obtaining its raw material requirements, UNIFI has, in the past, experienced interruptions or limitations in the supply of certain raw materials.
 7

In addition to the expected benefits to UNIFI’s financial results, the bottle processing facility in Reidsville, North Carolina now provides a high-quality source of plastic bottle flake for the REPREVE® Recycling Center as well as for sale to external parties. Combined with recent technology advancements in recycling, we believe the bottle flake produced at the bottle processing facility will enhance our ability to grow REPREVE® into other markets, such as nonwovens, carpet fiber and packaging.
 The prices of the principal raw materials used by UNIFI continuously fluctuate, and it is difficult, and often impossible, to predict trends or upcoming developments.  During fiscal 2017, UNIFI operated during a predominantly increasing virgin polyester raw material cost environment.  During fiscal 2016, UNIFI experienced a general decline in raw material prices.  UNIFI believes that polyester raw material cost fluctuations during most of fiscal 2017 were a result of volatility in the crude oil markets. The continuing volatility in global crude oil prices is likely to impact UNIFI’s polyester and nylon raw material costs, but it is not possible to predict the timing or amount of the impact or whether the movement in crude oil prices will stabilize, continue or reverse. In any event, UNIFI monitors these dynamic factors closely.
 Products, Technologies and Related Markets
 UNIFI manufactures polyester yarn and related products in the United States, El Salvador and Brazil, and nylon yarns in the United States and Colombia, for a wide range of end-uses.  In addition, UNIFI purchases certain yarns and staple fiber for resale to its customers around the globe.  PVA products comprised approximately 40%, 35% and 30% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  UNIFI provides products to a variety of end-use markets, principally apparel, industrial, furnishings and automotive.
 The domestic apparel market, which includes hosiery, represents approximately 61% of UNIFI’s domestic sales.  Apparel retail sales, supply chain inventory levels and strength of the regional supply base are vital to this market.  
 The domestic industrial market represents approximately 18% of UNIFI’s domestic sales. This market includes medical, belting, tapes, filtration, ropes, protective fabrics and awnings.
 The domestic furnishings market, which includes both contract and home furnishings, represents approximately 9% of UNIFI’s domestic sales.  Furnishings sales are largely dependent upon the housing market, which in turn is influenced by consumer confidence and credit availability.
 The domestic automotive market represents approximately 7% of UNIFI’s domestic sales and has been less susceptible to import penetration because of the exacting specifications and quality requirements often imposed on manufacturers of automotive fabrics, along with just-in-time delivery requirements.  Effective customer service and prompt response to customer feedback are logistically more difficult for an importer to provide.
 UNIFI also adds value to the overall supply chain for textile products, and increases consumer demand for UNIFI’s own products, through the development and introduction of branded yarns and technologies that provide unique sustainability, performance, comfort and aesthetic advantages.  UNIFI’s branded portion of its yarn portfolio continues to provide product differentiation to brands, retailers and consumers, and it includes products such as:
  
• | REPREVE®, a family of eco-friendly products made from recycled materials. Since its introduction in 2006, REPREVE® has been UNIFI’s most successful branded product. UNIFI’s recycled fibers may also be enhanced, similarly to virgin products, to provide certain performance and/or functional properties to various types of fabrics and end products. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Sorbtek®, a permanent moisture management yarn primarily used in performance base-layer applications, compression apparel, athletic bras, sports apparel, socks and other non-apparel related items.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reflexx®, a family of stretch yarns that can be found in a wide array of end-use applications, from home furnishings to performance wear and from hosiery and socks to work wear and denim.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | XS, yarns that take advantage of a non-traditional cross-section construction created during the spinning process. The cross-section is able to provide certain performance and/or functional characteristics in multiple end-uses due to its resulting chemical and physical attributes.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cotton-like®, a soft, lofty yarn that looks and feels like cotton, but offers the superior performance of synthetic fibers and no fading.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A.M.Y. ®, a yarn with permanent antimicrobial properties for odor control.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 UNIFI’s branded yarns can be found in a variety of products of well-known brands, retailers and department stores, including Ford, Haggar, Polartec, The North Face, Patagonia, Quiksilver, Roxy, Volcom, Perry Ellis, General Motors, Pottery Barn, adidas, Reebok, Nike, New Era, MJ Soffe, Abercrombie & Fitch, Levi’s, H&M, TARGET, Express, Costco Wholesale, REI, Cabela’s, JCPenney, Macy’s, Kohl’s and Belk.
 In addition to the above brands and products, UNIFI combines its research and development efforts with the demands of customers and markets to develop innovative technologies that enhance yarn characteristics. Application of these technologies allows for various, separate benefits, including, among other things, water repellency, flame retardation, thermal regulation, enhanced color-fastness achieved with less water use and protection from ultra-violet rays.
 Customers
 UNIFI’s Polyester Segment has approximately 350 customers, its Nylon Segment has approximately 140 customers and its International Segment has approximately 700 customers, all in a variety of geographic markets.  UNIFI’s products are manufactured according to customer specifications and are shipped based upon customer order requirements.  Customer payment terms are generally consistent across the segments and are based on prevailing industry practices for the sale of yarn domestically or internationally.
 UNIFI’s consolidated net sales are not materially dependent on a single customer and no single customer accounts for 10% or more of UNIFI’s consolidated net sales. UNIFI’s top 10 customers accounted for approximately 32% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2017 and approximately 32% of receivables as of June 25, 2017.  UNIFI’s net sales within its Nylon Segment are materially dependent upon a domestic customer that accounted for approximately 35% of the Nylon Segment’s net sales for fiscal 2017.
 Sales and Marketing
 UNIFI employs an internal sales force of approximately 50 persons operating out of sales offices in the United States, Brazil, China, Sri Lanka, El Salvador, Colombia and Switzerland.  UNIFI relies on independent sales agents for sales in several other countries.  UNIFI seeks to create strong customer relationships and to build and strengthen those relationships throughout the supply chain.  Through frequent communications with customers, partnering with customers in product development and engaging key downstream brands and retailers, UNIFI has created significant pull-through sales and brand recognition for its products.  For example, UNIFI works with brands and retailers to educate and create demand for its PVA products, such as recent engagements involving REPREVE® at multiple events and venues in the United States.  UNIFI then works with key fabric mill partners to develop specific fabrics for those brands and retailers utilizing its PVA products.  In many of these regards, UNIFI draws upon and integrates the resources of its research and development personnel.  In addition, UNIFI is enhancing co-branding activations with integrated point-of-sale and online marketing with popular brands and retailers to further enable consumers to find REPREVE® and other PVA brands in multiple retail channels.  Based on the establishment of many commercial and branded programs, this strategy has been successful for UNIFI.
 Product Customization and Manufacturing Processes
 UNIFI uses advanced production processes to manufacture its high-quality products cost-effectively in North America, Central America and South America.  UNIFI believes that its flexibility and know-how in producing specialty polyester and nylon products provides important development and commercialization advantages, in addition to the recent ability to vertically integrate with post-industrial and post-consumer materials.

UNIFI produces plastic bottle flake, polyester Chip and polyester POY using recycled materials. In addition to its yarns manufactured from virgin polyester and nylon, UNIFI sells its recycled products externally or further processes them internally to add value for customers seeking recycled components. The REPREVE® Bottle Processing Center in Reidsville, North Carolina produces plastic bottle flake that can be sold externally, or further processed internally using our REPREVE® Recycling Center in Yadkinville, North Carolina. Recycled polyester Chip output from the REPREVE® Recycling Center can be sold externally, or further processed internally into polyester POY.
 Additional processing of UNIFI’s polyester yarn products includes texturing, package dyeing, twisting, beaming and draw winding.  The texturing process, which is common to both polyester and nylon, involves the use of high-speed machines to draw, heat and false-twist POY to produce yarn with different physical characteristics, depending on its ultimate end-use.  Texturing gives the yarn greater bulk, strength, stretch, consistent dye-ability and a softer feel, thereby making it suitable for use in the knitting and weaving of fabric.  Package dyeing allows for matching of customer-specific color requirements for yarns sold into the automotive fabrics, home furnishings and apparel markets.  Twisting incorporates real twist into filament yarns, which can be sold for a variety of uses, such as sewing thread, home furnishings and apparel.  Beaming places both textured and covered yarns onto beams to be used by customers in warp knitting and weaving applications.  The draw winding process utilizes heat and draws POY to produce mid-tenacity, flat yarns.
 Additional processing of UNIFI’s nylon yarn products primarily includes covering and texturing. Covering involves the wrapping or air entangling of filament or spun yarn around a core yarn, primarily spandex.  This process enhances a fabric’s ability to stretch, recover its original shape and resist wrinkles while maintaining a softer feel.
 UNIFI’s subsidiaries in Asia offer the same high-quality and innovative PVA products and technologies through contract manufacturing arrangements with local manufacturers. This asset-light model allows for seamless integration of our products into the global supply chain of our customers. As we expand our Asian operations to meet the needs of our global customers, we will continue to leverage the asset-light model where the existing Asian infrastructure can accommodate our highly technical processes, while continually evaluating the need for additional UNIFI assets in response to ever-changing market dynamics.
 Research and Development
 UNIFI employs approximately 90 persons who work closely with UNIFI’s customers and others to develop a variety of new yarns as well as improvements to the performance properties of existing yarns and fabrics. Among other things, UNIFI evaluates trends and uses the latest technology to create innovative specialty and PVA yarns that meet the needs of evolving consumer preferences.  Most of UNIFI’s branded yarns discussed above, including its flagship REPREVE® brand, were derived from its research and development initiatives.
 UNIFI also includes, as part of its research and development initiatives, the use of continuous improvement methodologies to increase its manufacturing and other operational efficiencies, both to enhance product quality and to derive cost savings.  
 For fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, UNIFI incurred $7,177, $6,907 and $8,113, respectively, in costs for research and development (including salaries and benefits of the personnel involved in those efforts).  In fiscal 2016, a portion of the activities traditionally attributed to research and development were allocated to certain of the significant, highly technical capital projects undertaken during that fiscal year.
 Intellectual Property
 UNIFI has numerous U.S. registered trademarks.  Due to its current brand recognition and potential growth opportunities, UNIFI believes that REPREVE® is its most significant trademark.  Ownership rights in U.S. registered trademarks do not expire if the trademarks are continued in use and properly protected.
 UNIFI licenses certain trademarks, including Dacron® and Softec™, from INVISTA.

Employees
 As of June 25, 2017, UNIFI had approximately 3,000 employees, along with approximately 150 individuals working under temporary labor contracts.  The number of employees in the Polyester Segment, Nylon Segment, International Segment and corporate office were approximately 1,800, 600, 500 and 100, respectively, at June 25, 2017.  While employees of UNIFI’s Brazilian operations are unionized, none of the labor force employed by UNIFI’s domestic or other foreign subsidiaries is currently covered by a collective bargaining agreement.  UNIFI believes that it has a good relationship with its employees.
Geographic Data
 Geographic information reported in conformance with generally accepted accounting principles is included in Note 25, “Business Segment Information,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.  Information regarding risks attendant to UNIFI’s foreign operations is included in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this Annual Report.
Seasonality
 UNIFI is not significantly impacted by seasonality; however, UNIFI typically experiences (i) its highest sales volumes in the third and fourth quarters of its fiscal years and (ii) its lowest gross margins in the first quarter of its fiscal years.  Excluding the effects of fiscal years with 53 weeks rather than 52 weeks, the most significant effects on UNIFI’s results of operations for particular periods during a year are due to planned manufacturing shutdowns by either UNIFI or its customers for certain holiday or traditional shutdown periods, which are not concentrated in any one particular season.
Backlog
 UNIFI’s level of unfilled orders is affected by many factors, including the timing of specific orders and the delivery time for specific products, as well as a customer’s ability or inability to cancel the related order.  As such, UNIFI does not consider the amount of unfilled orders, or backlog, to be a meaningful indicator of expected levels of future sales or to be material to an understanding of UNIFI’s business as a whole.
Working Capital
 UNIFI funds its working capital requirements through cash flows generated from operations, which it supplements with short-term borrowings, as needed.  For more detailed information, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Annual Report.
Inflation
 UNIFI expects costs to continue to rise for certain consumables used to produce and ship its products, as well as for its utilities and certain employee costs and benefits.  While UNIFI attempts to mitigate the impacts of such rising costs through increased operational efficiencies and increased selling prices, inflation could become a factor that negatively impacts UNIFI’s profitability.
Environmental Matters
 UNIFI is subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations limiting the use, storage, handling, release, discharge and disposal of a variety of hazardous substances and wastes used in or resulting from its operations (and to potential remediation obligations thereunder).  These laws include the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, the Clean Air Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (including provisions relating to underground storage tanks) and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, commonly referred to as “Superfund” or “CERCLA,” and various state counterparts to such laws.  UNIFI’s operations are also governed by laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health, principally the Occupational Safety and Health Act and regulations issued thereunder, which, among other things, establish 
 11

exposure standards regarding hazardous materials and noise standards, and regulate the use of hazardous chemicals in the workplace.
 UNIFI believes that it has obtained, and is in compliance in all material respects with, all significant permits required to be issued by federal, state or local law in connection with the operation of its business.  UNIFI also believes that the operation of its production facilities and its disposal of waste materials are substantially in compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations, and that there are no material ongoing or anticipated capital expenditures associated with environmental control facilities necessary to remain in compliance with such provisions.  UNIFI incurs normal operating costs associated with the discharge of materials into the environment, but does not believe that these costs are material or inconsistent with those of its domestic competitors.
 On September 30, 2004, UNIFI completed its acquisition of polyester filament manufacturing assets located in Kinston, North Carolina from INVISTA.  The land for the Kinston site was leased pursuant to a 99-year ground lease (the “Ground Lease”) with E.I. DuPont de Nemours (“DuPont”).  Since 1993, DuPont has been investigating and cleaning up the Kinston site under the supervision of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (“DEQ”) pursuant to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Corrective Action program.  The program requires DuPont to identify all potential areas of environmental concern (“AOCs”), assess the extent of containment at the identified AOCs and remediate the AOCs to comply with applicable regulatory standards.  Effective March 20, 2008, UNIFI entered into a lease termination agreement associated with conveyance of certain assets at the Kinston site to DuPont.  This agreement terminated the Ground Lease and relieved UNIFI of any future responsibility for environmental remediation, other than participation with DuPont, if so called upon, with regard to UNIFI’s period of operation of the Kinston site, which was from 2004 to 2008.  At this time, UNIFI has no basis to determine if or when it will have any responsibility or obligation with respect to the AOCs or the extent of any potential liability for the same.
 UNIFI continues to own property acquired in the 2004 transaction with INVISTA that has contamination from DuPont’s operations and is monitored by DEQ.  This site has been remediated by DuPont, and DuPont has received authority from DEQ to discontinue further remediation, other than natural attenuation.  Prior to transfer of responsibility to UNIFI, DuPont has a duty to monitor and report the environmental status of the site to DEQ. UNIFI expects to assume that responsibility in fiscal 2018 and will be entitled to receive from DuPont seven years of monitoring and reporting costs, less certain adjustments. At that time, UNIFI expects to assume responsibility for any future remediation of the site. At this time, UNIFI has no basis to determine if or when it will have any obligation to perform further remediation or the potential cost thereof.
 Joint Ventures and Unconsolidated Affiliates
 In addition to its 34% ownership in PAL, UNIFI participates in two joint ventures that supply raw materials to the Nylon Segment, with one located in the United States and one in Israel.  As of June 25, 2017, UNIFI had $119,513 recorded for these investments in unconsolidated affiliates.  For fiscal 2017, $4,230 of UNIFI’s $43,275 of income before income taxes was generated from its investments in these unconsolidated affiliates, of which $2,723 was attributable to PAL.  Other information regarding UNIFI’s unconsolidated affiliates is provided in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and in Note 22, “Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates and Variable Interest Entities,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report.
 On December 23, 2016, UNIFI, through a wholly owned foreign subsidiary, sold its 60% equity ownership interest in Repreve Renewables, LLC (“Renewables”), an entity focused on the development, production and commercialization of miscanthus grass for use in multiple potential markets, to its existing third-party joint venture partner for $500 in cash and release of certain debt obligations. UNIFI had no continuing involvement in the operations of Renewables subsequent to December 23, 2016. The corresponding results of Renewables, up through the date of sale, are reflected in continuing operations within the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
