ITEM 1 | BUSINESS
-------+---------

 
When we use the terms “Kid Castle,” “KDCE,” “we,” “us,” “our,” and “the company,” we mean Kid Castle Educational Corporation, a Delaware corporation.
 
Kid Castle Educational Corporation, a Delaware corporation, (“Kid Castle,” “the Company,” “We,” “KDCE,” "Us" or “Our’) intends to operate and manage biopharmaceutical, agricultural and "pure-play" CBD assets that are (or could be) vertically integrated and "2018 Farm Bill" compliant in the United States of America. Kid Castle engages in rollup and consolidation of CBD and Biopharma assets and operations.  The Company seeks make and sell pharmaceuticals and non-pharmaceutical CBD products across the United States of America.    A “Farm Bill” compliant business is one that strictly cultivates and utilizes “hemp” as specified by the Bill.  The 2018 Farm Bill legalized production of hemp for all … allowing for full-scale commercial production of hemp as provided in the Bill.  https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/HempExecSumandLegalOpinion.pdf. 
 
The current structure of the Company resulted from a purchase of voting control of the Company by Cannabinoid Biosciences, Inc. (CBDZ), which CBDZ spun out to its shareholders prior to becoming an operating subsidiary of Kid Castle.   
 
After the closing of the transaction, Cannabinoid Biosciences, Inc.’s board voted to spin the shares out to its shareholders.  Cannabinoid Biosciences, Inc. itself was then sold to the Company to become its operating subsidiary.  The Company bought 96% of outstanding shares of voting common stocks of Cannabinoid Biosciences, Inc. for $1.00.  The primary reason for the acquisition was to help the Company to gain entrance into the CBD industry. 
 
We used the acquisition method of accounting (also known as business combination accounting) for acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group method to account for the purchase of Cannabinoid Biosciences, Inc. The cost of the acquisition was measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange.
 
Prior to the above mentioned change of control transaction, Kid Castle used to be a Florida corporation until the company voluntarily dissolved its Florida registration with intention to simultaneously incorporate in Delaware and convert into a Delaware corporation.  Although the company immediately finalized its registration effort to convert into a Delaware Corporation, the company’s registered agent who was supposed to submit the registration package to the Delaware Secretary of State for certification, failed to make a timely submission.  Later in January 2019, when the company realized that the Delaware incorporation/registration package/process was never submitted to the Delaware Secretary of State nor completed in any other way or form, the Company went ahead and resubmitted the required registration package and was then formally re-incorporated in Delaware and convert into a Delaware corporation.   Thus, the company was formally incorporated in Delaware and converted into a Delaware Corporation in January 2019.
 
The re-incorporation in Delaware, which occurred in January 2019, has placed at risk, voidable and unenforceable, all and any liabilities that may have accrued, including any material agreements the Company may have executed during the period between March 22, 2011 and January 2019.  To the best of our knowledge, no such liabilities that were accrued and no material agreement were entered into by the company during the period between March 22, 2011 and January 2019.  In addition, there could be penalties or legal liabilities that may have accrued as a result of conducting business from 2011 to 2019 without properly registering with any State. To the best of our knowledge, as at November 27, 2020, no such penalties or liabilities has accrued to the company accrued as a result of conducting business from 2011 to 2019 without properly registering with any State. However, there is no guarantee that such penalties or liabilities would not accrue or arise in the future.
 
On January 21, 2020, we received notification about their decision to suspend trading in the securities of “Kid Castle Education Corporation (“KDCE” or “the company”) (CIK No. 1049011) due to questions and concerns about: (1) the adequacy and accuracy of publicly available information concerning KDCE’s current corporate control and its operations in the marketplace, including in filings with the Commission made on October 25, November 5, November 14, November 18, and November 27, 2019, as amended on December 6, 2019; and (2) recent, unusual and unexplained market activity in the company’s stock, including, but not limited to, activity between October 25 and October 28, 2019.”


 
Upon the receipt of the notification, we called the number listed on the letter to speak with the SEC staff listed.  We explained to them that our involvement with KDCE started on October 21, 2019 when gained control of KDCE, and that prior to that date, neither us nor any of our officers and shareholders own or sold shares of KDCE. We did not have any idea or information about whatever happened with KDCE and its common stock until October 21, 2019.  We explained that by the time on the unusual price movement in the stock, we did not even have access to the shareholders’ list and none of our officers or directors have any shares of KDCE to sell.  We spoke to three staff who told us to wait for a formal request from their office.  
 
We received the form letter from the Division of Enforcement on February 18, 2020 to immediately preserve, and voluntarily provide them with, the information and documents listed on the request.  We promptly complied with the request, gathered all the requested information and documents and submitted them to the SEC Division of Enforcement on March 2, 2020.
 
None of our current officers owned shares of KDCE prior to, and immediately after the transaction of October 21, 2019.  None of our officers sold shares of KDCE during the period in question.  Due diligence performed by our current officers and directors with respect to the acquisition of control of KDCE was limited to reading KDCE’s previously filed information on the SEC website. Our current officers and directors have no hand in the formation and corporate history until October 21, 2019.  Our current officers and directors did not own of trade shares, or participate in the events leading to the suspension order.
 

Corporate History
 
Kid Castle Educational Corporation (“KDCE”) was the result of a share exchange transaction, commonly referred to as a reverse merger, pursuant to which shareholders of an offshore operating company take control of a U.S. company that has no operations (commonly referred to as a shell company), and the offshore operating company becomes a subsidiary of the U.S. company. In KDCE case, the offshore company was Higoal Developments Ltd., which was the parent company of Kid Castle Internet Technologies Limited and Kid Castle Education Software Development Co. Limited, KDCE’s operating companies that run our English language instruction business. The U.S. or shell company, at the time of the share exchange, was King Ball International Technology Corporation.
 
The details of KDCE corporate history are as follows. KDCE was incorporated in Florida on July 19, 1985 as Omni Doors, Inc. From inception through June 30, 1998, our primary business was the assembly and distribution of industrial doors for sale to building contractors in the South Florida market. Until April 6, 1998, we were a wholly-owned subsidiary of Millennia, Inc., a publicly-owned Delaware corporation. On April 6, 1998, the Board of Directors of Millennia declared the payment of a stock dividend to Millennia’s stockholders. Millennia stockholders received one share of our common stock for each four shares of Millennia common stock. This distribution of approximately 570,000 shares of our company represented approximately 5% of the total issued and outstanding shares of our common stock.
 
Pursuant to a contract dated July 14, 1998, Millennia sold 10,260,000 shares (representing 90% of the total outstanding shares) of our common stock to an unrelated firm, China Economic Growth Investment Corp., LLC, which then distributed the shares to its three members, Yong Chen, Zuxiang Huang, and Zheng Yao.
 
On April 6, 2001, pursuant to a stock purchase agreement dated April 2, 2001, Halter Capital Corporation, a privately-owned Texas corporation, purchased 6,822,900 shares of our common stock from Zheng Yao, representing approximately 60% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock. Simultaneously with this change-in-control transaction, Sophia Yao, our then sole officer and director, resigned. Kevin B. Halter, Sr., as President and director, and Kevin B. Halter, Jr., as Secretary-Treasurer and director, were elected to replace her.


 
On June 19, 2002, pursuant to a stock purchase agreement dated June 6, 2002, Powerlink International Finance, Inc., a British Virgin Islands corporation, purchased 2,830,926 shares of our common stock from Halter Capital Corporation, representing approximately 57% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock. Simultaneously with the purchase, the officers and directors of the Company resigned. Chin-Chung Hsu, President, Treasurer, and Director; Wen-Hao Hsu, Secretary and Director; and Chien-Hwa Liu, Director, were elected to replace them.
 
On June 25, 2002, we changed our name to King Ball International Technology Corporation and, on August 22, 2002, we changed our name again to Kid Castle Educational Corporation. 
 
On March 29, 2010, the Company which has been a public reporting company registered with the Securities Exchange Commissioner (“SEC”), filed Form 15D, Suspension of Duty to Report.  As a result of filing Form 15D, the Company was no longer required to file any SEC forms since March 29, 2010.  Similarly, on March 22, 2011, the company voluntarily dissolved its Florida registration with intention to simultaneously incorporate in Delaware and convert into a Delaware corporation.   The Company has been dormant since March 22, 2011and non-operating since March 29, 2010. 
 
On October 21, 2019, pursuant to a stock purchase agreement dated October 2, 2019, Cannabinoid Biosciences, Inc., a California corporation, purchased one (1) million shares of its preferred shares (one preferred share is convertible 1,000 share of common stocks) of the Company, representing 97.82% of our total issued and outstanding voting shares of common stock and preferred stock. Simultaneously with the purchase, the officers and directors of the Company resigned. Frank I Igwealor, Chairman and CEO, Secretary, Treasurer, and Director; Patience C Ogbozor, Director; and Dr. Solomon SK Mbagwu, MD, Director, were elected to replace them. Following the share sales to Cannabinoid Biosciences, Inc., the purchaser converted 900,000 of the preferred shares for 900,000,000 shares of the Company's current outstanding shares of common stock.  
 
Cannabinoid Biosciences, Inc. (“CBDZ”), a California corporation was incorporated on May 6, 2014, to operate as a biotechnology and specialty pharmaceutical holding company that engages in the discovery, development, and commercialization of cures and novel therapeutics from proprietary cannabinoid, cannabidiol, endocannabinoids, phytocannabinoids, and synthetic cannabinoids product platform suitable for specific treatments in a broad range of disease areas. CBDZ engages in biopharmaceutical research and development operation with aim of identifying viable drug candidates to go into clinical trials and if successful, be submitted to the FDA for approval.   Because the Company is young and has limited or no resources, and the legal CBD industry is still in its infancy (following the 2018 Farm Bill), the Company lack of resources is likely to affect its ability to bring an industry-wide reform as contemplated above.  It would be difficult for the Company to raise the necessary capital to achieve its goals.
 
Following the consummation of the October 21, 2019 transactions, the Company decided to restart filing important information immediately.  The Company also decided to formally restart being a public reporting company following an audit of its financial statements by a PCAOB-registered auditor.
 
Business Overview
 
Kid Castle engages in rollup and consolidation of CBD and Biopharma assets and operations.  The Company seeks make and sell pharmaceuticals and non-pharmaceutical CBD products across the United States of America. The Company is focused on the legal CBD business: (1) Ownership interest in certain businesses that extract, purchase and distribute Bulk Pure CBD, Isolate, Hemp Oil, THC-free CBD Distillate and Crude CBD Oil; (2) Partnerships with local farmers to grow farm bill compliant hemp biomass; (3) Partnerships with extract facilities across the U.S. who manufacture hemp-based ingredients to meet specific medical needs. The Company would seeks to control the manufacturing/production and distribution of verities of consumer cannabidiol (CBD) formulation under private brands in the United States by controlling process through steps that include (a) ethanol extraction system, (b) winterization to remove fats; (c) multiple rounds of rotary evaporation are used to remove plant material and other unnecessary components; (d) extract decarboxylation to transform into a crystalline structure; and (e) get the extract tested by third-party laboratories, package it, and get it ready for shipment.


 
As at the date of this filing, the Company does not currently, nor does it intend, in the future to, maintain an ownership interest in any cannabis growing, marijuana dispensaries or production facilities. The Company only targets businesses that are focused on Hemp-based CBD products, which are “Farm Bill” compliant. The Company does not grow, process, own, handle, transport, or sell cannabis or marijuana as the Company is organized and directed to operate strictly in accordance with all applicable state and federal laws.  A “Farm Bill” compliant business is one that strictly cultivate and utilize “hemp” as specified by the Bill.  The 2018 Farm Bill legalized production of hemp for all … allowing for full-scale commercial production of hemp as provided in the Bill.  https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/HempExecSumandLegalOpinion.pdf 
 
In late 2019, the Company through its subsidiary CBDZ, acquired two CBD marketplaces (websites for e-commerce) that it intends to further develop and monetize in the near future.  One of the two marketplaces, www.cbdhempextra.com is down and awaiting updates, the second marketplace, www.cannabidiolhemp.net is up and running but has not been monetized and is currently generating no revenue.  We believe that lots of development work is still needed before we could monetize the site.  
 
We anticipate that once operational, these marketplaces would start conducting CBD products referral in which CBD manufacturers would pay the Company for referring customers.  We anticipate the marketplaces to become functional and revenue generating within 18 months of us having the capital to staff our e-commerce department.  We believe that the cost of staffing e-commerce department of two staff would cost $135,000 annually based on the going rate for webmasters in Southern California. 
 
While operating a CBD marketplace is important to our business plan, it is not a deal breaker.  In our acquisition plan, we intend to buy and consolidate viable revenue-generating CBD websites with a goal of consolidating and growing them.    
 
Furthermore, during the last quarter of 2019, we entered into nonbinding Letter of Intent (LOIs) with 5 CBD operations to acquire their businesses. None of these businesses sells or manages cannabis-related or marijuana related products.  The businesses are focused on “Farm Bill” compliant Hemp-based CBD products.  A “Farm Bill” compliant business is one that strictly cultivate and utilize “hemp” as specified by the Bill.  The 2018 Farm Bill legalized production of hemp for all… allowing for full-scale commercial production of hemp as provided in the Bill.  https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/HempExecSumandLegalOpinion.pdf.  Each of these businesses is producing revenue and each operation is profitable. These five revenue producing and profitable businesses would cost the Company about $33.4 million to consummate the acquisitions.  The five businesses comprise of: (1) a Colorado based CBD Affiliate Marketplace, which is a website that sells but does not manufacture CBD products, this website would cost the Company $300,000 to acquire; (2) a company that is owner of Hemp farms and extraction facilities Colorado and Kentucky, the seller owns the real estate on which the farms and extraction facilities are situated, purchasing this business with its real estate, farms and extraction facilities would cost the Company $30,000,000; (3) a Michigan based hemp farm and CBD extraction plant, the business owns the real estate on which the farms and extraction facilities are situated, purchasing this business with its real estate, farms and extraction facilities would cost the Company $1,600,000; 4) a North Carolina based Hemp grower and CDB extraction technology with real estate selling for $1,300,000; and (5) another CBD Affiliate Marketplace (website that sells CBD products for manufacturers for a percentage of the purchase price as referral fees), which would cost the Company $30,000 to acquire.  With the LOIs in hand, we approached some professional finance guys to help us raise the money for the acquisition. There is no guarantee that we could raise the capital needed for this acquisition or that the sellers would wait for us to raise the capital. 
 
Subsequently, as we were pulling together financing for the acquisition, COVID-19 exploded and crippled most business transactions across the world. As a result of the disruptions occasioned by COVID-19, the operations of our major financier coming from New York and London came under the lockdown.  We have informed the sellers about this situation and advised that they move on to other potential acquirers as we are completely uncertain about the where things would be after the end of COVID-19 pandemic.  
 
Because of COVID-19 we were unable to obtain the financing necessary to make the acquisition of the businesses mentioned above. There is no guarantee that we could be able to acquire one or more of those businesses. In addition, there is no guarantee that these businesses would still be available to us to acquire in the future, or at the initially contemplated price.  As at the date of this filing, we believe that above targeted acquisitions would no longer be probable because of the impact of COVID-19.


 
Completed Acquisitions
 
On November 15, 2019, for $499.00 in cash payment, Kid Castle Educational Corporation, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Cannabinoid Biosciences, Inc. completed the acquisition of CannabidiolHemp (CannabidiolHemp.net), a website for CBD quality aggregator and standard validator.  The company believes this acquisition would help it to build Kid Castle into a major “pure-play” CBD operation in the United States and Canada.  The Company hoped that CBD distribution channel, like CannabidiolHemp, would help it to become a vertically integrated “pure-play” CBD operation in the United States.  However, so far, the Company’s hopes and projections on establishing a vertically integrated “pure-play” CBD operation has not materialized because of the business disruptions caused by COVID-19.  Because of COVID-19 we were unable to obtain the financing necessary to make the acquisition of the businesses we needed to achieve our objective. And there is no guarantee that we could be able to acquire one or more businesses in the future.  So far, the acquisition of CannabidiolHemp had not resulted in any revenue or profit to the Company.
Our Business Objectives and Growth Strategies
 
Our principal business objective is to maximize stockholder returns through a combination of (1) acquisition and rollup of profitable CBD operations across the United States of America (2) sustainable long-term growth in cash flows from increased profits, which we hope to pass on to stockholders in the form of distributions, and (3) potential long-term appreciation in the value of our businesses through process optimization and financial engineering.

Mission Statement
 
Our vision is to manufacture and sell pharmaceuticals and non-pharmaceutical CBD products formulations and applications across the United States.  Our goal is to make and sell CBD products across the United States of America.  
 
There is no guarantee that we could successfully make and sell pharmaceuticals and non-pharmaceutical CBD products formulations and applications.  Our mission as stated above is only a guiding principle as we start our acquisition.  We have never made nor sold pharmaceuticals or non-pharmaceutical CBD products formulations and applications before.  Although we have a theoretical picture of what our mission called for, none of our staff have ever done it before.  As at the date of this filing, the Company does not currently maintain an ownership interest in any cannabis-related CBD production company, marijuana dispensaries or production facilities.  The Company only targets businesses that are focused on Hemp-based CBD products, which are “Farm Bill” compliant.

 STRATEGY
 
Keys to Success
 
Management Experience
 
Our experienced management team has a combined thirty-two years of successful experience in finance and legal Cannabis industry in California. Cannabinoid Biosciences intends to launch its array of investments and rollup in the CBD/Hemp industry across the United States as soon as it had raised enough capital to consummate an acquisition of a CBD operation that generates significant revenue.  
 
Early mover advantage
 
The CBD market in the US is very fragmented, lack established process control and protocols, and is without formulations standardization.  Through acquisition, the Company intend to enter the following areas of the legal CBD business: (1) Ownership interest in certain businesses that extract, purchase and distribute Bulk Pure CBD, Isolate, Hemp Oil, THC-free CBD Distillate and Crude CBD Oil; (2) Partnerships with local farmers to grow Farm- Bill compliant hemp biomass; (3) Partnerships with extract facilities across the U.S. who manufacture hemp-based ingredients to meet specific medical.
 
There are no guarantees that we would be able to raise the capital needed to make any acquisition of CBD operations, though. Because the Company has limited or no resources, and the legal CBD industry is still in its infancy (following the 2018 Farm Bill), the Company lack of resources is likely to affect its ability to accomplish its goals as contemplated above.  It would be difficult for the Company to raise the necessary capital to achieve its goals.
 Special Purpose Entities
 
When the Company does acquire businesses and operating assets, it intends to hold title to the properties through separate LLCs or through special purpose entities (“SPE’s”) holding several similar asset types. Each separate LLC or SPE will be a 100% wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. If a joint venture is undertaken, the Company will record a first position deed instead of holding actual title.

 | Each business/operation acquired is its own entity and is structured as its own business structure while Cannabinoid Biosciences, Inc. serves as the parent Company that bundles all the ownership interests into a single corporation. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Each business/operation is managed by Cannabinoid Biosciences, Inc. or its authorized agents. 

Leverage
 
Leverage represents an important vehicle for maximizing returns. The Company will evaluate the appropriate amount of debt based on market conditions, feasibility of the project, and determined risk. The Company does not have any credit agreements with any lender as at the date of this filing.  We may incur indebtedness in the form of bank borrowings, purchase money obligations to the sellers of properties and publicly or privately placed debt instruments or financing from institutional investors or other lenders. The indebtedness may be secured or unsecured. Security may be in the form of mortgages or other interests in our properties; equity interests in entities which own our properties or investments; cash or cash equivalents; securities; letters of credit; guarantees or a security interest in one or more of our other assets.
 
The Company may use borrowing proceeds to finance acquisitions of new businesses or operations, make other investments, trade in stocks, futures, options and forex, make payments to the officers and management, pay for capital improvements, repairs, refinance existing indebtedness, pay distributions or provide working capital. The form of our indebtedness may be long-term or short-term debt or in the form of a revolving credit facility.
 

 Our Financing Strategy
 
As part of our plan to finance our activities, we utilize proceeds from debt and equity offerings to fund acquisition, purchases and restructuring activities.  
 
We do not have positive operating cash flow.  However, we intend to make acquisitions that would generate positive operating cash flow in the near future.  We intend to meet our long-term liquidity needs through cash flow from operations and the issuance of equity and debt securities, including common stock and long-term notes. Where possible, we also may issue limited partnership interests in future Operating Partnership and use the proceeds to acquire businesses from existing owners. We expect to issue equity and debt securities at times when we believe that our stock price is at a level that allows for the reinvestment of offering proceeds in accretive business assets and property acquisitions. We may also issue common stock to permanently finance businesses that were previously financed by debt securities. However, since we have never done any of the above before, we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at times and on terms that are acceptable to us. Our ability to access the capital markets and to obtain other financing arrangements is also significantly limited by our involvement in the Hemp/CBD industry. 
 
We may file a shelf registration statement, which would subsequently be declared effective by the SEC, which may permit us, from time to time, to offer and sell common stock, preferred stock, warrants and other securities to the extent necessary or advisable to meet our liquidity needs.
 

Risk Management
 
We intend to embrace geographic and portfolio diversification at acquisitions as our main risk management strategy. We intend to diversify the investment size and location of our portfolio businesses in order to manage our portfolio-level risk. Over the long term, we intend that no single business will exceed 25% of our total assets. 
 
Above plan notwithstanding, we do not currently have any investment portfolio yet and there is no guarantee that we would be able to establish one in the future because the Company has limited or no resources at the present.  
 
Competition
 
The current market for CBD operations that meet our investment objectives is limited. In addition, we believe finding businesses that are appropriate for our specific purpose may be limited as more competitors enter the market.
 
These competitors may prevent us from acquiring desirable businesses or may cause an increase in the price we must pay for businesses. Our competitors may have greater financial and operational resources than we do and may be willing to pay more for certain assets or may be willing to accept more risk than we believe can be prudently managed. In particular, larger companies may enjoy significant competitive advantages that result from, among other things, a lower cost of capital and enhanced operating efficiencies. Our competitors may also adopt transaction structures similar to ours, which would decrease our competitive advantage in offering flexible transaction terms. In addition, due to a number of factors, the number of entities and the amount of funds competing for suitable investment CBD businesses may increase substantially, resulting in increased demand and increased prices paid for these businesses. If we pay higher prices for businesses, our profitability may decrease, and you may experience a lower return on our common stock. Increased competition for businesses may also preclude us from acquiring those businesses that would generate attractive returns to us.
 
Insurance
 
We carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our communities, with limits of liability customary within the multi-family businesses industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs. We are also insured, with limits of liability customary within the real estate industry, against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts necessary to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property, including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period.
 

 Our primary lines of insurance coverage are property, general liability and workers’ compensation. We believe that our insurance coverages adequately insure our multifamily businesses against the risk of loss attributable to fire, earthquake, hurricane, tornado, flood, terrorism and other perils, and adequately insure us against other risk. Our coverage includes deductibles, retentions and limits that are customary in the industry. We have established loss prevention, loss mitigation, claims handling and litigation management procedures to manage our exposure.
 
Seasonality
 
Our business has not been, and we do not expect it to become subject to, material seasonal fluctuations.
 
Trademarks
 
We do not own any trademark or patents As of December 31, 2020 and 2019.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2020, Cannabinoid Biosciences, Inc., an operating subsidiary of the Company’s employees comprised six (6) employees who managed the affairs of the parent corporation and the operations of the subsidiaries. On an as needed basis, the Company hires independent contractors to perform specific tasks related to the Company’s business interests.
