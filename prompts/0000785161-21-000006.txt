Item 1.Business. 
Overview of the Company
General
We are a leading provider of post-acute healthcare services, offering both facility-based and home-based patient care through our network of inpatient rehabilitation hospitals, home health agencies, and hospice agencies. As of December 31, 2020, our national footprint spans 39 states and Puerto Rico and includes 137 hospitals and 241 home health and 82 hospice locations. We are committed to delivering high-quality, cost-effective integrated patient care.
 Effective January 1, 2018, we changed our corporate name from HealthSouth Corporation to Encompass Health Corporation and the NYSE ticker symbol for our common stock from “HLS” to “EHC.” Our principal executive offices are located at 9001 Liberty Parkway, Birmingham, Alabama 35242, and the telephone number of the principal executive offices is (205) 967-7116. Our website address is www.encompasshealth.com.
On December 9, 2020, we announced a formal process to explore strategic alternatives for our home health and hospice business. A range of options are under consideration, including the full or partial separation of the home health and hospice business from Encompass Health through an initial public offering, spin-off, merger, sale or other transaction. No timetable has been established for the completion of the strategic review. 
In addition to the discussion here, we encourage the reader to review Item 1A, Risk Factors, Item 2, Properties, and Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, which highlight additional considerations about our company.
We manage our operations in two operating segments which are also our reportable segments: (1) inpatient rehabilitation and (2) home health and hospice. The table below provides selected operating and financial data for our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals, home health agencies, and hospice agencies. See Note 19, Segment Reporting, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for detailed financial information for each of our segments.

Inpatient Rehabilitation
We are the nation’s largest owner and operator of inpatient rehabilitation hospitals in terms of patients treated, revenues, and number of hospitals. We provide specialized rehabilitative treatment on predominantly an inpatient basis. We operate hospitals in 35 states and Puerto Rico, with concentrations in the eastern half of the United States and Texas. In addition to our hospitals, we manage four inpatient rehabilitation units through management contracts.
Our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals offer specialized rehabilitative care across an array of diagnoses and deliver comprehensive, high-quality, cost-effective patient care services. As participants in the Medicare program, our hospitals must be licensed and certified and otherwise comply with various requirements that are discussed below in the “Sources of Revenues—Medicare Reimbursement—Inpatient Rehabilitation” section. Substantially all (91%) of the patients we serve are admitted from acute care hospitals following physician referrals for specific acute inpatient rehabilitative care. Most of those patients have experienced significant physical and cognitive disabilities or injuries due to medical conditions, such as strokes, hip fractures, and a variety of debilitating neurological conditions, that are generally nondiscretionary in nature and require rehabilitative healthcare services in a facility-based setting. During the COVID-19 Pandemic (the “pandemic”), our hospitals have treated thousands of patients suffering or recovering from the COVID-19 virus. Our focus on specialized rehabilitative care also means that in many cases our hospitals are ideal settings for treating the debilitating effects of the COVID-19 virus, such as significant muscle weakness, cognitive impairments, shortness of breath with activity, and malnutrition. Our teams of highly skilled nurses and physical, occupational, and speech therapists utilize proven technology and clinical protocols with the objective of restoring our patients’ physical and cognitive abilities. Patient care is provided by nursing and therapy staff as directed by physician orders while case managers monitor each patient’s progress and provide documentation and oversight of patient status, achievement of goals, discharge planning, and functional outcomes. Our hospitals provide a comprehensive interdisciplinary clinical approach to treatment that leverages innovative technologies and advanced therapies and leads to superior outcomes.
Home Health and Hospice
Our home health business is the nation’s fourth largest provider of Medicare-certified skilled home health services in terms of revenues. Our hospice business is the nation’s eighth largest provider of Medicare-certified hospice services in terms of revenues. We operate home health and hospice agencies in 31 states, with a concentration in the southern half of the United States. As participants in the Medicare program, our agencies must comply with various requirements that are discussed below in the “Sources of Revenues—Medicare Reimbursement—Home Health” and “—Hospice” sections. We acquired a significant portion of our home health and hospice business when we purchased EHHI Holdings, Inc. (“EHHI”) on December 31, 2014. In the acquisition, we acquired 83.3% of the issued and outstanding equity interests of EHHI, and certain members of EHHI management, including April Anthony, its chief executive officer, acquired the remaining interests. In March 2020, we acquired 100% ownership of EHHI. See Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further discussion of the history of the ownership structure of our home health and hospice business. 
Our home health agencies provide a comprehensive range of Medicare-certified skilled home health services. These services include, among others, skilled nursing, physical, occupational and speech therapy, medical social work, and home health aide services. We also offer evidence-based specialty programs related to post-operative care, fall prevention, chronic disease management, and transitional care. Home health patients are frequently referred to us following a stay in an acute care or inpatient rehabilitation hospital or other facility, but many patients are referred from primary care settings and specialty physicians without a preceding inpatient stay. Our patients are typically older adults with three or more chronic conditions and significant functional limitations, and require greater than ten medications. As with our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals, our home health agencies have treated thousands of patients suffering or recovering from COVID-19. Our teams of registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, physical, speech and occupational therapists, medical social workers, and home health aides work closely with patients and their families and physicians to deliver patient-centered care plans focused on their needs and their goals.
We also provide hospice services to terminally ill patients and their families. These in-home services address patients’ physical needs, including pain control and symptom management, and provide emotional and spiritual support. Our hospice care teams consist of physician medical directors, nurses, social workers, chaplains, therapists, hospice aides, and volunteers.
COVID-19 Pandemic
    The rapid onset of the pandemic in the United States has resulted in significant changes to our operating environment. The willingness and ability of patients to seek healthcare services have been negatively affected by restrictive measures, such as travel bans, social distancing, quarantines, and shelter-in-place orders. Elective procedures have been postponed by physicians and acute care hospitals and limited by governmental order to preserve capacity for the expected volume of COVID-19 patients and reduce the risk of the spread of COVID-19. Patients recovering from elective surgeries have historically represented approximately 15% of our home health admissions. While not a significant percentage of our inpatient rehabilitation population, we treat patients who are recovering from elective surgery with multiple comorbidities and qualify for inpatient rehabilitation care. Additionally, many in need of treatment for more severe medical conditions have chosen not to seek care because of fear of infection. We are also experiencing supply chain disruptions as a result of the pandemic, including increased time between ordering and receiving supplies. We have experienced and are likely to continue to experience significant price increases in medical supplies, particularly personal protective equipment (“PPE”). The federal government began to undertake numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives designed to provide relief to the healthcare industry during the pandemic as described below in the “Sources of Revenue—Medicare Reimbursement” section. These initiatives have provided enhanced flexibility to our hospitals and agencies to care for our patients and assist acute care hospitals in maintaining hospital capacity in the current environment. The pandemic is still rapidly evolving and much of its impact remains unknown and difficult to predict, with the impact on our operations and financial performance being dependent on numerous factors, including the ongoing nature of the pandemic, such as its rate of spread, duration, and geographic coverage; the rate and extent to which the virus mutates; the status of testing capabilities; the development, distribution, and administration of effective vaccines and other therapeutic remedies; the legal, regulatory, and administrative developments related to the pandemic at federal, state, and local levels, such as shelter-in-place orders, suspended services, and quarantines; and our infectious disease prevention and control efforts. For discussion of the financial and operational impacts we have experienced as a result the pandemic, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, and Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
In the continuously changing operating environment during the pandemic, we have taken the following steps to ensure the safety and well-being of our patients and employees:

ü | staying current with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (the “CDC”) guidance on testing and the use of PPE, which is frequently updated;
ü | working with our supply chain and securing secondary sources to ensure an adequate supply of PPE to protect our staff and patients; 
ü | acquiring testing devices; 
ü | limiting visitors in our hospitals; 
ü | screening everyone entering our hospitals and self-screening all home health and hospice employees; 
ü | performing pre-visit telephone calls to assess risk factors within the home, including patient and caregiver health status; 
ü | following social distancing recommendations in our therapy gyms and performing therapy in patient rooms, if needed; 
ü | changing hospital configurations to protect patients from potential exposure to the virus; 
ü | suspending most of the hospital-based outpatient services (we have resumed these services at some locations); 
ü | implementing work-at-home policies for many home office employees; and 
ü | halting all non-essential travel. 

    We have also taken actions to enhance our operational and financial flexibility and ensure our long-term sustainability. Members of our executive team voluntarily reduced their base compensation for six months. In addition, we: 

ü | amended our senior credit facility in April 2020 (primarily provided covenant relief due to disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic); 
ü | issued an additional $300 million of our 4.50% Senior Notes due 2028 and an additional $300 million of our 4.75% Senior Notes due 2030 in May 2020;
ü | issued $400 million of 4.625% Senior Notes due 2031 in October 2020; 
ü | redeemed all $700 million in outstanding principal amount of the 5.75% Senior Notes due 2024 in November 2020; and 
ü | developed plans for reducing capital expenditures in the event liquidity concerns arise. 

Competitive Strengths
We believe we differentiate ourselves from our competitors based on, among other things, the quality of our clinical outcomes, our cost-effectiveness, our financial strength, and our extensive application of technology. We also believe our competitive strengths discussed below give us the ability to adapt and succeed in a healthcare industry facing regulatory uncertainty around attempts to improve outcomes and reduce costs. 
•People. We believe our employees share a steadfast commitment to providing outstanding care to our patients. We undertake significant efforts to ensure our clinical and support staff receives the education and training necessary to provide the highest quality care in the most cost-effective manner. We also have hospital staff trained for all patient acuity levels faced in the post-acute setting. We embrace the Encompass Health Way, our core set of values developed through input from a broad cross section of our employees. The Encompass Health Way calls on each of our employees to set the standard, lead with empathy, do what’s right, focus on the positive, and ensure we are stronger together. For further discussion of our human capital management, see the section titled “Human Capital Management” below.
•Change Agility. We have a demonstrated ability to adapt in the face of numerous and significant regulatory and legislative changes. In 2020, we rapidly moved to adapt our operations to the unprecedented pandemic. Additionally, while addressing the urgent challenges presented by the pandemic, both operating segments successfully managed through significant changes in their respective Medicare reimbursement systems in 2020.
•Strategic Relationships. We have a long and successful history of building strategic relationships with major healthcare systems. Approximately one-third of our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals currently operate as joint ventures with acute care hospitals or systems. Joint ventures with market leading acute care hospitals establish a solid foundation for providing integrated patient care that can improve the quality of outcomes and reduce the total cost of care.
Clinical collaboration between our hospitals and home health agencies in overlap markets offers an excellent means to improve patient experience and outcomes and reduce the total cost of care across a post-acute episode. We believe the benefits of collaboration are available in non-overlap markets as well. In 2020, we deployed a home health agency quality reporting tool to identify the highest quality clinical partners in all of our markets.
The post-acute innovation tools we have developed, and will continue to develop, support our strategic relationship initiatives by enhancing the effective and efficient management of patients across multiple post-acute care settings and facilitating high-quality patient care, improved care coordination, and network provider performance and cost management.
Additionally, we have a strategic sponsorship with the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association on a nationwide basis to increase patient independence after a stroke and reduce stroke mortality through community outreach and information campaigns. 
•Clinical Expertise and High-Quality Outcomes. We have extensive facility-based and home-based clinical experience from which we have developed standardized best practices and protocols. We believe these clinical best practices and protocols, particularly as leveraged with industry-leading technology, help ensure the delivery of consistently high-quality healthcare services, reduced inefficiencies, and improved performance across a spectrum of operational areas. 
•Cost Effectiveness. Our size, data-driven business practices, and culture help us provide facility-based and home-based healthcare services on a cost-effective basis. We leverage our comprehensive IT capabilities and centralized administrative functions, identify best practices, utilize proven staffing models, and take advantage of supply chain efficiencies across our extensive platform of operations. Our information systems allow users to analyze data and trends and create custom reports on a timely basis. Additionally, our home-based healthcare services are part of the broader industry focus on reducing costs by delivering care, when clinically appropriate, in the significantly lower cost home setting.
•Financial Resources. We have a proven track record of generating strong cash flows from operations that have allowed us to successfully pursue our growth strategy, manage our financial leverage, and make significant shareholder distributions. As of December 31, 2020, we have a strong, well-capitalized balance sheet, including ownership of approximately 70% of our hospital real estate, no significant debt maturities prior to 2023, and 
ample availability under our revolving credit facility, which along with the cash flows generated from operations should, we believe, provide sufficient support for our business strategy.
•Advanced Technology and Innovation. We are focused on developing technology-enabled real-time strategies for the next generation of integrated healthcare. Our post-acute innovation strategy is based on using our clinical expertise, our large post-acute datasets, and our proven capabilities in enterprise-level electronic medical record technologies, data analytics, data integration, and predictive analytics to drive value-based performance across the healthcare continuum for our patients, our partners, and our payors. We believe our information systems and post-acute innovation solutions, in addition to improving patient care and operating efficiencies, allow us to collect, analyze, and share information on a timely basis making us an ideal partner for other healthcare providers in a coordinated care delivery environment. Our systems also emphasize interoperability with referral sources and other providers coordinating care. We have devoted substantial resources, effort and expertise to leveraging technology to create post-acute solutions that improve patient care and operating efficiencies.
Patients and Demographic Trends
Demographic trends, such as population aging, should continue to increase long-term demand for the services we provide. While we treat patients of all ages, most of our patients are 65 and older, and the number of Medicare enrollees is expected to grow approximately 3% per year for the foreseeable future. Even more specifically, the average age of our patients is approximately 76, and the population group ranging in ages from 75 to 79 is expected to grow at approximately 5% per year through 2026. We believe the demand for the services we provide will continue to increase as the U.S. population ages. We believe these factors align with our strengths in, and focus on, post-acute services. In addition, we believe we can address the demand for facility-based and home-based post-acute care services in markets where we currently do not have a presence by constructing or acquiring new hospitals and by acquiring or opening home health and hospice agencies in those fragmented industries.
Strategy and 2021 Strategic Priorities
The following discussion of strategy and strategic priorities assumes the continuation of operations under a single ownership structure. If any change in our structure results from the ongoing strategic review, we will update our strategic priorities.
Our strategy is to expand our network of inpatient rehabilitation hospitals and home health and hospice locations, further strengthen our relationships with healthcare systems, provider networks, and payors in order to connect patient care across the healthcare continuum, and to deliver superior patient outcomes. We believe this strategy, along with our demonstrated ability to adapt to changes in healthcare, will position us for success in the evolving healthcare delivery system. In pursuit of our strategy, we established the following strategic priorities for 2021.
Growth. We will be targeting the addition of six to ten new inpatient rehabilitation hospitals and $50 million to $100 million in home health and hospice acquisitions per year. We also believe we will continue to have organic growth opportunities in our inpatient rehabilitation and home health and hospice segments based on our pre-pandemic track record of consistent growth in both segments, planned bed additions at a number of existing hospitals, and the maturation of acquired home health and hospice locations.
Operational Initiatives. Our priorities include operational initiatives that build on momentum from recent years. We will seek to continue to increase clinical collaboration in both overlap and non-overlap markets. We believe our clinical collaboration efforts have and will continue to contribute to reductions in discharges to skilled nursing facilities, higher discharges to community, and improved patient experience.
Given the significant number of stroke patients in need of post-acute care, we will continue working to build our stroke market share by leveraging our strategic sponsorship of the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association, the inpatient rehabilitation facility (“IRF”) treatment recommendations published by the Department of Veterans’ Affairs and the Journal of the American Medical Association, our clinical collaboration, and our hospitals’ participation in The Joint Commission’s Disease-Specific Care Certification Program. As of December 31, 2020, 124 of our 137 hospitals held stroke-
specific certifications that required us to demonstrate effective use of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines to manage and optimize stroke care and an organized approach to performance measurement and evaluation of clinical outcomes. 
We will also continue to develop and implement post-acute solutions that allow us to apply our clinical expertise, large post-acute datasets, electronic medical record technologies, and strategic partnerships to drive improved patient outcomes and lower the cost of care across the entire post-acute episode. 
Capital Structure. We will seek to maintain balance sheet flexibility, consider opportunistic refinancings and augment returns from investments in operations with shareholder distributions via common stock dividends and repurchases of our common stock.
For additional discussion of our strategic priorities as well as our progress toward our priorities in 2021, including operating results, growth, and shareholder distributions, and our business outlook, see Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Executive Overview,” “Results of Operations,” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
Human Capital Management
Overview of Our Employees. In 2020, our employees made inspiring sacrifices and showed extraordinary dedication to providing outstanding patient care in our hospitals and in our patients’ homes across the country during the pandemic. As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 43,000 individuals. In the healthcare services sector, many professionals, such as nurses, desire flexible work arrangements. Accordingly, part-time and per diem employees represent a large percentage of our employee population. Except for 58 employees at one hospital (approximately 17% of that hospital’s workforce), none of our employees are represented by a labor union as of December 31, 2020. The chart below includes a breakdown of our employees by segment.

 | Inpatient Rehabilitation | Home Health and Hospice
Total Employees | 31,837 | 11,341 
Full-time Employees | 19,560 | 8,334 
Part-time Employees | 2,274 | 182 
Pool/Per-diem Employees | 10,003 | 2,825 

In some markets, the shortage of clinical personnel is a significant operating issue facing healthcare providers. Shortages of nurses and other clinical personnel, including therapists, may, from time to time, require us to increase use of more costly temporary personnel, which we refer to as “contract labor,” and other types of premium pay programs. In order to recruit and retain those clinical employees, we maintain a total rewards program that we view as a combination of the tangible components of pay and benefits with the intangible components of a culture that encourages learning, development, and a supportive work environment. We believe our outstanding employee engagement scores, discussed below, evidence that our human capital management efforts have been successful. We also believe our recognition as one of Fortune Magazine’s “100 Best Companies to Work For” and the recognition of both our segments in Modern Healthcare’s “Best Places to Work” is further evidence of that success. We focus on the following strategic human capital imperatives:
•Maintaining competitive compensation and benefit programs that reward and recognize employee performance;
•Fostering a strong culture that values inclusion, diversity, and equity; and
•Emphasizing employee development and engagement to attract talent and reduce turnover.
Compensation and Benefits. Maintaining competitive compensation and benefit programs that reward and recognize employee performance furthers our goal to attract, retain, and motivate employees who will help us deliver high-quality patient care. We are also committed to providing comprehensive benefit options that will allow our employees and their families to live healthier and more secure lives. In our compensation and benefit programs: 
•we provide employee wages that are competitive and consistent with employee positions, skill levels, experience, knowledge and geographic location.
•we engage nationally recognized outside compensation and benefits consulting firms to independently evaluate the effectiveness of our compensation and benefit programs and to provide benchmarking against our peers within the industry and by specific market.
•we base annual increases and incentive compensation on merit, which is communicated to employees through our talent management process as part of our annual review procedures.
•all full-time and most part-time employees are eligible for health insurance, paid and unpaid leaves, a retirement plan, a wellness program, telemedicine, tuition reimbursement, an employee assistance program, and life and disability/accident coverage.
•we provide an employer match on retirement plan contributions.
•we also offer a wide variety of voluntary benefits that allow employees to select the options that meet their needs, including pre-paid legal services, dental insurance, vision insurance, hospital indemnity insurance, accident insurance, critical illness insurance, supplemental life insurance, disability insurance, health savings accounts, flexible spending accounts, auto/home insurance, and identity theft insurance.
•we have various short-term incentive plans for field leadership, most marketing/sales employees, and executives.
•we make annual grants of restricted stock to employees (approximately 340 in 2020) at various levels of non-executive management to foster a strong sense of ownership and align the interests of members of management with those of our stockholders. 
In early April 2020, we initiated a program for eligible frontline employees to earn additional paid time off in recognition of their outstanding efforts during the pandemic. With more than 21,000 employees potentially benefiting from this additional paid time off, we accrued approximately $43 million in salary and benefits expense in the second quarter of 2020 in connection with this award. This program provided for cash-out at the end of the year for any unused balance of paid time off. Additionally, we waived the employee cost-share for COVID-19 testing and telehealth/telemedicine for any illness and allowed frontline employees to continue working and accrue paid time off without a maximum. 
Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity. We believe fostering a strong culture that values inclusion, diversity, and equity allows us to maintain a competitive advantage with recruiting and retaining employees. We maintain an inclusion and diversity program that is overseen by our human resources team at the home office. The program is also supported by an employee-led inclusion and diversity council that is comprised of a broad, cross-functional segment of our management and administration. The four components of our inclusion and diversity program are:
•Workforce development. Specific initiatives we are pursuing include, but are not limited to, a recruiting program that targets historically black colleges; funding nursing scholarships for diverse candidates; the launch of a new Encompass Health career site tool to help veterans find jobs that closely align with their specific skills; inclusion and diversity competency training for our employees; and policy reviews to incorporate language that supports inclusion and diversity.
•Patient experience. Specific initiatives we are pursuing include, but are not limited to, completion of a language assessment process to evaluate oral and written skills of employees who elect to serve as language translators and the addition of diversity questions to our annual employee engagement survey to assess our ability to provide culturally competent care to patients.
•Community partnership. Specific initiatives we are pursuing include, but are not limited to, launching a quarterly inclusion and diversity digest to better communicate our inclusion and diversity initiatives across our company; joining the National Association of Health Service Executives (“NAHSE”), an organization that promotes the advancement and development of minority healthcare leaders; participating in NAHSE’s minority male leadership academy; and participating in a regional working group of Alabama-based businesses convened to discuss and share diversity and recruiting best practices.
•Supplier diversity. We maintain a supplier base program that offers contracting opportunities with manufacturers, distributors and service providers that are certified as minority-owned, veteran-owned and small disadvantage-owned businesses, and we are researching diverse supplier certifying organizations.
We have undertaken other initiatives to emphasize the importance of inclusion and diversity. We participate in the CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion Pledge. This coalition of more than 1,000 chief executive officers is dedicated to advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion in the workplace. Every three to five years, we engage a third party consulting agency to help us evaluate our program and explore possible enhancements. We then provide the feedback to our board of directors. In response to societal concerns regarding systemic racism and social injustice in 2020, we produced and published a 
series of video conversations with various employees and members of executive management in order to highlight personal experience with prejudice and injustice and to promote diversity, inclusion, and equity. 
Employee Development and Engagement. We believe promoting employee development and engagement furthers our ability to attract and retain nurses, therapists, and other healthcare professionals in a highly competitive environment where staffing shortages are not uncommon. We track and measure therapist and nurse turnover in our inpatient rehabilitation segment and overall turnover for our full-time employees in our home health and hospice segment (excluding those at new stores and most at the corporate office) on a quarterly and annual basis for significant trends and outliers, but we do not believe comparisons to benchmarks are material given the variations in survey data across markets, hospital sizes, practice settings, and practice specialties. The table below shows those turnover rates for 2020 and 2019.

 | 2020 | 2019 
Therapist (IRF) | 5.3% | 7.2% 
Nurse (IRF) | 23.0% | 22.8%
Overall (HH&H) | 26.7% | 24.7%

We support the long-term career aspirations of our employees through education and personal development. 
•Education opportunities. We offer our nurses an opportunity to advance their academic degrees at a reduced tuition rate of 20% to 50% of the total program cost. To date, approximately 850 of our nurses have taken advantage of this opportunity.
•Tuition reimbursement/scholarship programs. Employees also have the opportunity to advance their education through our tuition reimbursement and scholarship programs. We reimbursed over $1 million in tuition and paid over $3 million toward employees’ student loan debt in 2020.
•Academic endowments. We endowed five scholarships for deserving students from underrepresented groups pursuing degrees in nursing and allied health fields.
•Therapy grants. We fund research projects to investigate the impact and effectiveness of therapy in the inpatient rehabilitation and home health settings. In recent years, we have funded studies and research on topics ranging from caregiver education to the effectiveness of occupation-centered interventions. The program is open to qualified candidates, including employees.
•Other employee development programs:
*career ladders that offer paths to develop, demonstrate, and be rewarded for expanded responsibility in nursing, therapy and case management;
*online development library that provides access to a wide range of readily available internal and external content on many topics important for success in current or desired jobs;
*developing future leaders program that develops nurses and therapists for supervisory positions and develops nurse and therapy supervisors for higher level positions;
*leadership precepting that provides new leaders 6-12 months of structured mentoring from experienced, high-performing peers;
*leadership coaching that provides six months of executive coaching to high performing leaders;
*developing future chief nursing officers program that provides 12-18 months of intensive on-the-job experience to develop participants for future chief nursing officer job openings; and
*developing future chief executive officers program that provides 18-24 months of intensive on-the-job experience to develop participants for future hospital chief executive officer openings.
To further aid in employee development, we have invested money in best-in-class technology to offer on-demand learning and development programs, podcasts for our home health and hospice segment, and leadership coaching programs. Another important aspect of employee development is succession planning. We annually review our talent to identify potential successors for key positions and to identify candidates for accelerated development based on their performance and potential. 
The annual process includes an assessment of each employee’s promotability based on a set of leadership core competencies defined as part of the company’s talent strategy. 
We believe employee engagement is another important driver of employee retention. We conduct an annual employee engagement survey open to all of our employees. In 2020, 78% of our employees participated in the survey, which measures perceptions based on responses to 59 questions. In 2020, the average response to 93% of engagement questions surveyed exceeded healthcare benchmarks.
Competition
Inpatient Rehabilitation. The inpatient rehabilitation industry, outside of our leading position, is highly fragmented. Our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals compete primarily with rehabilitation units, most of which are within acute care hospitals, in the markets we serve. An acute care hospital, particularly one owned or operated by a large public company or not-for-profit that has a dominant position in the local market, can be a formidable competitor because 91% of our patients come from acute care hospitals. There are several privately held companies offering post-acute rehabilitation services that compete with us primarily in select geographic markets. In addition, there is a public company that is primarily focused on other post-acute care services, including approximately 1,700 outpatient clinics, but also operates approximately 29 freestanding inpatient rehabilitation hospitals. Other providers of post-acute care services compete for some rehabilitation patients. For example, nursing homes may market themselves as offering certain rehabilitation services, particularly to patients not in need of intensive rehabilitation therapy, even though those nursing homes are not required to offer the same level of care, and are not licensed, as hospitals. The primary competitive factors in any given market include the quality of care and service provided, the treatment outcomes achieved, the relationship and reputation with managed care and other private payors and the acute care hospitals, physicians, or other referral sources in the market, and the regulatory barriers to entry in certificate of need states. The ability to work as part of an integrated delivery payment model with other providers, including the ability to deliver quality patient outcomes and cost-effective care, could become an increasingly important factor in competition if a significant number of people in a market are participants in one or more of these models. See the “Regulation—Relationships with Physicians and Other Providers” and “Regulation—Certificates of Need” sections below for further discussion of some of these factors.

Home Health and Hospice. The home health and hospice services industries are also highly competitive and fragmented. There are more than 11,300 home health agencies and more than 4,800 hospice agencies nationwide certified to participate in Medicare. We are the fourth largest provider of Medicare-certified skilled home health services in the United States in terms of Medicare revenues. Our primary competition varies from market to market. Providers of home health and hospice services include both not-for-profit and for-profit organizations. There are three other public healthcare companies with significant presences in the Medicare-certified home health industry, and one insurance company with a minority interest in the largest provider of Medicare-certified skilled home health services. The primary competitive factors in any given market include the quality of care and service provided, the treatment outcomes achieved, the relationship and reputation with managed care and other private payors and the acute care hospitals, physicians, or other referral sources in the market, and the regulatory barriers to entry in certificate of need states. The ability to work as part of an integrated care delivery model with other providers could become an increasingly important factor in competition if a significant number of people in a market are participants in one or more of these models. As of January 1, 2021, our home health and hospice segment is collaborating with approximately 140 alternative payment models, including Next Generation Accountable Care Organizations (“ACOs”), MSSP ACOs, and Direct Contracting Models. Home health providers with scale, which include the other public companies, may have competitive advantages, including professional management, efficient operations, sophisticated information systems, brand recognition, and large referral bases. For a list of our home health and hospice markets by state, see the table in Item 2, Properties.
Regulatory and Reimbursement Challenges
Healthcare is a highly regulated industry facing many well-publicized regulatory and reimbursement challenges driven by escalating costs and the pursuit of better quality of care. The Medicare reimbursement systems for both inpatient rehabilitation and home health have recently undergone significant changes. The future of many aspects of healthcare regulation remains uncertain. Any regulatory or legislative changes impacting the healthcare industry ultimately may affect, among other things, reimbursement of healthcare providers, consumers’ access to coverage of health services, including among non-Medicare aged population segments within commercial insurance markets and Medicaid enrollees, and competition among providers. Changes may also affect the delivery of healthcare services to patients by providers and the regulatory compliance obligations associated with those services.
Successful healthcare providers are those able to adapt to changes in the regulatory and operating environments, build strategic relationships across the healthcare continuum, and consistently provide high-quality, cost-effective care. We believe 
we have the necessary capabilities — change agility, strategic relationships, quality of patient outcomes, cost effectiveness, and ability to capitalize on growth opportunities — to adapt to and succeed in a dynamic, highly regulated industry, and we have a proven track record of doing so. For more in-depth discussion of the primary challenges and risks related to our business, particularly the changes in Medicare reimbursement, increased compliance and enforcement burdens, and changes to our operating environment resulting from healthcare reform, see “Sources of Revenues—Medicare Reimbursement” and “Regulation” below in this section as well as Item 1A, Risk Factors, and Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Executive Overview—Key Challenges.”
Sources of Revenues
We receive payment for patient care services from the federal government (primarily under the Medicare program), managed care plans and private insurers, and, to a considerably lesser degree, state governments (under their respective Medicaid or similar programs) and directly from patients. Revenues and receivables from Medicare are significant to our operations. The federal and state governments establish payment rates as described in more detail below. We negotiate the payment rates with non-governmental group purchasers of healthcare services that are included in “Managed care” in the tables below, including private insurance companies, employers, health maintenance organizations (“HMOs”), preferred provider organizations (“PPOs”), and other managed care plans. Patients are generally not responsible for the difference between established gross charges and amounts reimbursed for such services under Medicare, Medicaid, and other private insurance plans, HMOs, or PPOs but are responsible to the extent of any exclusions, deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance features of their coverage. Medicare, through its Medicare Advantage program, offers Medicare-eligible individuals an opportunity to participate in managed care plans. Revenues from Medicare and Medicare Advantage represent approximately 85% of total revenues.
The following tables identify the sources and relative mix of our revenues for the periods stated for each of our business segments:

Medicare Reimbursement
Medicare is a federal program that provides hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons aged 65 and over, qualified disabled persons, and persons with end-stage renal disease. Medicare, through statutes and regulations, establishes reimbursement methodologies and rates for various types of healthcare providers, facilities, and services. Each year, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (“MedPAC”), an independent agency that advises the United States Congress on issues affecting Medicare, makes payment policy recommendations to Congress for a variety of Medicare payment systems including, among others, the inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system (the “IRF-PPS”), the home health prospective payment system (the “HH-PPS”), and the hospice payment system (the “Hospice-PPS”). Congress is not obligated to adopt MedPAC recommendations, and, based on outcomes in previous years, there can be no assurance Congress will adopt MedPAC’s recommendations in a given year. However, MedPAC’s recommendations have, and could in the future, become the basis for subsequent legislative or, as discussed below, regulatory action.
The Medicare statutes are subject to change from time to time. For example, in March 2010, President Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (as subsequently amended, the “2010 Healthcare Reform Laws”). In December 2018, a federal district court in Texas invalidated the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws in their entirety but postponed enforcement of that decision pending appeal. On December 18, 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court decision but remanded the case for additional analysis on the question of severability. A group of state attorneys general subsequently appealed the case to the Supreme Court of the United States, which heard oral arguments in November 2020 but has yet to rule. With respect to Medicare reimbursement, the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws provided for specific reductions to healthcare providers’ annual market basket updates and other payment policy changes. In August 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011 providing for an automatic 2% reduction, or “sequestration,” of Medicare program payments for all healthcare providers. Sequestration took effect April 1, 2013 and, as a result of subsequent legislation, will continue through fiscal year 2029 unless Congress and the President take further action. In response to the public health emergency associated with the pandemic, Congress and the President suspended sequestration through March 31, 2021, as discussed further below.
On February 9, 2018, President Trump signed into law the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (the “2018 Budget Act”), which includes several provisions affecting Medicare reimbursement. Among those changes, the 2018 Budget Act mandated the adoption of a new Medicare payment model for home health providers which went into effect January 1, 2020. In the future, concerns about the federal deficit and national debt levels could result in enactment of further federal spending reductions, further entitlement reform legislation affecting the Medicare program, or both. The future of the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws as well as the nature and substance of any other healthcare legislation remain uncertain. Healthcare will almost certainly be the subject of significant regulatory and legislative changes under the Biden administration and a Democratic-controlled Congress. 
From time to time, Medicare regulations, including reimbursement methodologies and rates, can be further modified by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”). CMS, subject to its statutory authority, may make some prospective payment system changes, including in response to MedPAC recommendations. For example, CMS instituted a rebasing adjustment in the HH-PPS consistent with a MedPAC recommendation. In some instances, CMS’s modifications can have a substantial impact on healthcare providers. In accordance with Medicare laws and statutes, CMS makes annual adjustments to Medicare payment rates in prospective payment systems, including the IRF-PPS and HH-PPS, by what is commonly known as a “market basket update.” CMS may take other regulatory action affecting rates as well. For example, under the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws, CMS requires IRFs to submit data on certain quality of care measures for the IRF quality reporting program. A facility’s failure to submit the required quality data results in a two percentage point reduction to that facility’s annual market basket increase factor for payments made for discharges in a subsequent Medicare fiscal year. IRFs began submitting quality data to CMS in October 2012. All of our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals have met the reporting deadlines to date resulting in no corresponding reimbursement reductions. Similarly, home health and hospice agencies are required to submit quality data to CMS each year, and the failure to do so in accordance with the rules will result in a two percentage point reduction in their market basket update. For 2021, we expect four of our home health and hospice agencies will incur a reduction in their reimbursement rates.
We cannot predict the adjustments to Medicare payment rates Congress or CMS may make in the future. Congress, MedPAC, and CMS will continue to address reimbursement rates for a variety of healthcare settings. Any additional downward adjustment to rates or limitations on reimbursement for the types of facilities we operate and services we provide could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. For additional discussion of the risks associated with our concentration of revenues from the federal government or with potential changes to the statutes or regulations governing Medicare reimbursement, including the 2018 Budget Act, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, and Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Executive Overview—Key Challenges.”
Although reductions or changes in reimbursement from governmental or third-party payors and regulatory changes affecting our business represent one of the most significant challenges to our business, our operations are also affected by other rules and regulations that indirectly affect reimbursement for our services, such as data coding rules and patient coverage rules and determinations. For example, Medicare providers like us can be negatively affected by the adoption of coverage policies, either at the national or local level, that determine whether an item or service is covered and under what clinical circumstances it is considered to be reasonable and necessary. Current CMS coverage rules require inpatient rehabilitation services to be ordered by a physician and be coordinated by an interdisciplinary team. The interdisciplinary team must meet weekly to review patient status and make any needed adjustments to the individualized plan of care. Qualified personnel must provide the rehabilitation nursing, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech-language pathology, social services, psychological services, and prosthetic and orthotic services that may be needed. Medicare contractors processing claims for CMS make coverage determinations regarding medical necessity that can represent restrictive interpretations of the CMS coverage rules. Those interpretations are not made through a notice and comment review process. We cannot predict how future CMS coverage rule interpretations or any new local coverage determinations will affect us.
In the ordinary course, Medicare reimbursement claims made by healthcare providers, including inpatient rehabilitation hospitals as well as home health and hospice agencies, are subject to audit from time to time by governmental payors and their agents, such as the Medicare Administrative Contractors (“MACs”) that act as fiscal intermediaries for all Medicare billings, as well as the United States Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (the “HHS-OIG”), CMS, and state Medicaid programs. In addition to those audits conducted by existing MACs, CMS has developed and instituted various Medicare audit programs under which CMS contracts with private companies to conduct claims and medical record audits. Some contractors are paid a percentage of the overpayments recovered. The Recovery Audit Contractors (“RACs”) conduct payment reviews of claims, which can examine coding, overall billing accuracy, and medical necessity. When conducting an audit, the RACs receive claims data directly from MACs on a monthly or quarterly basis.
CMS has also established Unified Program Integrity Contractors (“UPICs”), previously known as Zone Program Integrity Contractors, to perform fraud, waste, and abuse detection, deterrence and prevention activities for Medicare and Medicaid claims. Like the RACs, the UPICs conduct audits and have the ability to refer matters to the HHS-OIG or the United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”). Unlike RACs, however, UPICs do not receive a specific financial incentive based on the amount of the payment errors they identify.
As a matter of course, we undertake significant efforts through training, education, and documentation to ensure compliance with coding and medical necessity coverage rules. Despite our belief that our coding and assessment of patients are accurate, audits may lead to assertions that we have been underpaid or overpaid by Medicare or that we have submitted improper claims in some instances. Audits may also require us to incur additional costs to respond to requests for records and defend the validity of payments and claims, and ultimately require us to refund any amounts determined to have been overpaid. We cannot predict when or how these audit programs will affect us. Any denial of a claim for payment, either as a result of an audit or ordinary course payment review by the MAC, is subject to an appeals process that is currently taking numerous years to complete. For additional discussion of these audits and the risks associated with them, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, and Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Executive Overview—Key Challenges.”
In response to the public health emergency associated with the pandemic, Congress and CMS adopted several statutory and regulatory measures intended to provide relief to healthcare providers in order to ensure patients would continue to have adequate access to care. On March 27, 2020, President Trump signed into law the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act of 2020 (the “CARES Act”), which temporarily suspended sequestration for the period of May 1 through December 31, 2020. The CARES Act also authorized the cash distribution of relief funds from the United States Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) to healthcare providers. We did not request any relief funds. However, on April 10, 2020, HHS began distributing CARES Act relief funds to various of our bank accounts. We refused the CARES Act relief funds, and our banks returned all the funds to HHS. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (the “2021 Budget Act”), signed into law on December 27, 2020, extends the sequestration suspension through March 31, 2021 and provides for additional provider relief funds. We intend to refuse any additional provider relief funds distributed in the future whether authorized under the CARES Act or the 2021 Budget Act. The CARES Act, the 2021 Budget Act, and CMS regulatory actions include a number of other provisions, which are discussed below, affecting our reimbursement and operations in both segments. 
A basic summary of current Medicare reimbursement in our business segments follows:
Inpatient Rehabilitation. As discussed above, our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals receive a fixed payment reimbursement amount per discharge under the IRF-PPS based on the patient’s rehabilitation impairment category and other characteristics and conditions identified by the attending clinicians. In order to qualify for reimbursement under the IRF-PPS, our hospitals must comply with various Medicare rules and regulations including documentation and coverage requirements, or 
specifications as to what conditions must be met to qualify for reimbursement. These requirements relate to, among other things, pre-admission screening, post-admission evaluations, and individual treatment planning that all delineate the role of physicians in ordering and overseeing patient care. For example, a physician must admit each patient and in doing so determine that the treatment of the patient in an IRF setting is reasonable and necessary. In addition, to qualify as an IRF under Medicare rules, a facility must be primarily focused on treating patients with one of 13 specified medical conditions that typically require intensive therapy and supervision, such as stroke, brain injury, hip fracture, certain neurological conditions, and spinal cord injury. Specifically, at least 60% of a facility’s patients must have a diagnosis or qualifying comorbidity from at least one of these 13 conditions, which requirement is known as the “60% Rule.” Also, each patient admitted to an IRF must be able to tolerate a minimum of three hours of therapy per day for five days per week and must have a registered nurse available 24 hours, each day of the week. 
The CARES Act temporarily suspends the requirement that patients must be able to tolerate a minimum of three hours of therapy per day for five days per week. Additionally, CMS has waived certain of the requirements that at least 60% of a facility’s patients must have a diagnosis from at least 1 of 13 specified medical conditions and the requirement for a physician to conduct and document a post-admission evaluation (as discussed below, the 2021 IRF Rule permanently removed the post-admission evaluation requirement effective October 1, 2020). CMS has also issued a waiver to permit the rehabilitation physician to conduct face-to-face visits using telehealth.
Under IRF-PPS, CMS is required to adjust the payment rates based on an IRF-specific market basket index. The annual market basket update is designed to reflect changes over time in the prices of a mix of goods and services used by IRFs. In setting annual market basket updates, CMS uses data furnished by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for price proxy purposes, primarily in three categories: Producer Price Indexes, Consumer Price Indexes, and Employment Cost Indexes. With IRF-PPS, our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals retain the difference, if any, between the fixed payment from Medicare and their operating costs. Thus, our hospitals benefit from being cost-effective providers.
On July 31, 2019, CMS released its notice of final rulemaking for fiscal year 2020 IRF-PPS (the “2020 IRF Rule”). The 2020 IRF Rule implemented a 2.9% market basket update effective for discharges between October 1, 2019 and September 30, 2020. The 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws require the annual market basket update to be reduced by a productivity adjustment. The productivity adjustment equals the trailing 10-year average of changes in annual economy-wide private nonfarm business multi-factor productivity. The productivity adjustment effective October 1, 2019 decreased the market basket update by 40 basis points. The 2020 IRF Rule also included a change to the IRF-PPS, effective October 1, 2019, that replaced the FIM™ assessment instrument with new patient assessment measures, which we refer to as “Section GG functional measures” or “Section GG” based on the designation CMS assigned to them. Section GG affects patients’ classification into case-mix groupings, relative weights, and length-of-stay values under the IRF-PPS, which in turn affect our reimbursement amounts. 
On August 4, 2020, CMS released its notice of final rulemaking for fiscal year 2021 IRF-PPS (the “2021 IRF Rule”). The 2021 IRF Rule implements a net 2.4% market basket increase effective for discharges between October 1, 2020 and September 30, 2021. The 2021 IRF Rule also includes changes that impact our hospital-by-hospital base rate for Medicare reimbursement. Such changes include, but are not limited to, revisions to the wage index and labor-related share values and updates to the case-mix group relative weights and average lengths of stay values. Additionally, the 2021 IRF Rule removes the post-admission physician evaluation requirement for all IRF discharges beginning on or after October 1, 2020, codifies certain inpatient rehabilitation coverage documentation requirements, and, under certain conditions, allows the use of non-physician practitioners to perform the service and documentation requirements for one of the three required face-to-face physician visits in a patient’s second and subsequent weeks in an IRF stay. 
Unlike our inpatient services, our outpatient services are primarily reimbursed under the Medicare Part B physician fee schedule. On December 1, 2020, CMS released its final notice of rulemaking for the payment policies under the physician fee schedule and other revisions to Part B policies for calendar year 2021. The updates to the fee schedule are not expected to be material to us. The 2021 Budget Act includes a 3.75% increase to payments under the physician fee schedule for services furnished during calendar year 2021. 
Home Health. Medicare pays home health benefits for patients discharged from a hospital or patients otherwise suffering from chronic conditions that require ongoing but intermittent skilled care. As a condition of participation under Medicare, patients must be homebound (meaning unable to leave their home without a considerable and taxing effort), require intermittent skilled nursing, physical therapy or speech therapy services, or have a continuing need for occupational therapy, and receive treatment under a plan of care established and periodically reviewed by a physician. A physician must document that he or she or a qualifying nurse practitioner has had a face-to-face encounter with the patient and then certify to CMS that a patient meets the eligibility requirements for the home health benefit. The CARES Act temporarily allows nurse practitioners and physician assistants under certain conditions to certify, establish and periodically review the plan of care, as well as 
supervise the provision of items and services for beneficiaries and expands the use of telehealth. For regulatory relief during the pandemic, CMS adopted a series of waivers, including expanding the definition of “homebound” to include patients needing skilled services who are homebound due solely to their COVID-19 diagnosis or patients susceptible to contract COVID-19 and limiting and delaying certain quality reporting requirements. 
The initial certification of Medicare patient eligibility, plan of care, and comprehensive assessment is valid for a 60-day episode of care. Prior to January 1, 2020, Medicare paid home health providers under the HH-PPS for each 60-day episode of care for each patient. Providers typically received either 50% or 60% of the estimated base payment for the full 60 days for each patient upon submission of the initial claim at the beginning of the episode of care based on the patient’s condition and treatment needs. The provider received the remaining portion of the payment after the 60-day treatment period, subject to any applicable adjustments. This partial early payment process is referred to as the Request for Anticipated Payment or “RAP.”
As of January 1, 2020, Medicare reimburses home health providers under a new payment system, referred to as the Patient-Driven Groupings Model (“PDGM”). PDGM replaced a 60-day episode of payment methodology with a 30-day payment period and relies more heavily on clinical characteristics and other patient information (such as principal diagnosis, functional level, referral source, and timing), rather than the therapy service-use thresholds under the prior system, to determine payments. Under PDGM, the initial certification remains valid for 60 days. If a patient remains eligible for care after the initial period as certified by a physician, a new treatment period may begin. There are currently no limits to the number of home health treatment periods a Medicare patient may receive assuming there is eligibility for each successive period. PDGM also reduced the early payment opportunity available through RAP in 2020. Beginning in 2021, providers no longer have the opportunity to receive early payment through the RAP process. However, providers are required to submit certain RAP documentation components within five days of the start of each payment period and are subject to reimbursement penalties if not timely filed. Beginning in 2022, home health providers will be required to submit a Notice of Admission, or “NOA,” within five days of the start of the initial treatment period. CMS will reduce reimbursement for agencies that fail to submit a NOA timely. 
Home health Medicare payments are adjusted based on each patient’s condition and clinical treatment. This is referred to as the case-mix adjustment. In addition to the case-mix adjustment, payments for periods of care may be adjusted for other reasons, including unusually large (outlier) costs, low-utilization patients (such as those requiring one to five visits based on the case-mix group), and geographic differences in wages. Payments are also made for non-routine medical supplies that are used in treatment.
On October 31, 2019, CMS released its notice of final rulemaking for calendar year 2020 for home health agencies under the HH-PPS (the “2020 HH Rule”). Pursuant to the requirements of the 2018 Budget Act, the 2020 HH Rule finalized the implementation of PDGM for 2020. In addition to the significant changes to the home health reimbursement model related to PDGM, the 2020 HH Rule required additional quality reporting measures and significantly increased the standardized patient assessment data elements to be collected by providers beginning in 2022. With respect to Medicare reimbursement rates, the 2020 HH Rule implemented a net 1.3% market basket increase (market basket update of 1.5% reduced by 0.2% for an extension of the rural payment add-on factor) in 2020. The 2020 HH Rule then reduced the base payment rate by 4.4% to offset the provider behavioral changes that CMS assumed PDGM would drive. 
On October 29, 2020, CMS released its notice of final rulemaking for calendar year 2021 for home health agencies under the home health prospective payment system (the “2021 HH Rule”). The 2021 HH Rule implements a net 2.0% market basket increase (market basket update of 2.3% reduced by a productivity adjustment of 0.3%) and makes changes to the underlying wage index system. Making the previously temporary pandemic-related relief permanent, the 2021 HH Rule authorizes the use of telecommunications technologies in providing care to beneficiaries under the Medicare home health benefit as long as the telecommunications technology meets certain criteria and does not replace in-person visits.
Hospice. Medicare pays hospice benefits for patients with life expectancies of six months or less, as documented by the patient’s physician(s). Under Medicare rules, patients seeking hospice benefits must agree to forgo curative treatment for their terminal medical conditions. Medicare hospice reimbursements are subject to a number of conditions of participation, including the use of volunteers and onsite visits to evaluate aides. Volunteers provide day-to-day administrative and direct patient care services in an amount that, at a minimum, equals five percent of the total patient care hours of all paid hospice employees and contract staff. A nurse or other professional conducts an onsite visit every two weeks to evaluate if aides are providing care consistent with the care plan. The CARES Act includes the temporary waiver of the requirement to use volunteers and to conduct a nurse visit every two weeks to evaluate aides and allows for the expanded use of telehealth. The 2021 Budget Act creates a new Medicare survey program for hospice agencies which will require a survey at least once every three years. Hospices that are found to be out of compliance could be subjected to new civil monetary penalties that accrue according to days out of compliance, as well as other forms of corrective action.
For each day a patient elects hospice benefits, Medicare pays an adjusted daily rate based on patient location, and payments represent a prospective per diem amount tied to one of four different categories or levels of care: routine home care, continuous home care, inpatient respite care, and general inpatient care. Medicare hospice reimbursements to each provider are also subject to two annual caps, one limiting total hospice payments based on the average annual payment per beneficiary and another limiting payments based on the number of days of inpatient care billed by the hospice provider. There are currently no limits to the number of hospice benefit periods an eligible Medicare patient may receive, and a patient may revoke the benefit at any time.
On July 31, 2019, CMS released its notice of final rulemaking for fiscal year 2020 for hospice agencies under the Hospice-PPS (the “2020 Hospice Rule”). The 2020 Hospice Rule provided for various pricing updates, including a net market basket update of 2.6% (market basket update of 3.0% reduced by a productivity adjustment of 0.4%), for hospice payments from October 1, 2019 through September 30, 2020 and made other policy updates, including adding a requirement to provide additional cost sharing information to beneficiaries if there are services not covered by the hospice agency. 
 On July 31, 2020, CMS released its notice of final rulemaking for fiscal year 2021 for hospice agencies under the Hospice-PPS (the “2021 Hospice Rule”). The 2021 Hospice Rule implements a net 2.4% market basket increase from October 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021. 
For additional discussion of the 2021 Medicare payment rules and other regulatory and legislative initiatives affecting Medicare reimbursement, including relief measures associated with the pandemic, that could impact our businesses, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, and Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Executive Overview—Key Challenges.”
Managed Care and Other Discount Plans
We negotiate payment rates with certain large group purchasers of healthcare services, including Medicare Advantage, managed care plans, private insurance companies, and third-party administrators. Managed care contracts typically have terms between one and three years, although we have a number of managed care contracts that automatically renew each year (with pre-defined rate increases) unless a party elects to terminate the contract. In 2020, typical rate increases for our inpatient rehabilitation contracts ranged from 2-4% and for our home health and hospice contracts ranged from 0-3%. We cannot provide any assurance we will continue to receive increases in the future. Our managed care staff focuses on establishing and re-negotiating contracts that provide equitable reimbursement for the services provided.
Medicaid Reimbursement
Medicaid is a jointly administered and funded federal and state program that provides hospital and medical benefits to qualifying individuals who are deemed unable to afford healthcare. As the Medicaid program is administered by the individual states under the oversight of CMS in accordance with certain regulatory and statutory guidelines, there are substantial differences in reimbursement methodologies and coverage policies from state to state. Many states have experienced shortfalls in their Medicaid budgets and are implementing significant cuts in Medicaid reimbursement rates. Additionally, certain states control Medicaid expenditures through restricting or eliminating coverage of some services. Continuing downward pressure on Medicaid payment rates could cause a decline in that portion of our Net operating revenues. However, for the year ended December 31, 2020, Medicaid payments represented only 3.4% of our consolidated Net operating revenues. In certain states in which we operate, we are experiencing an increase in Medicaid patients, partially the result of expanded coverage consistent with the intent of the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws. For additional discussion, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, “Changes in our payor mix or the acuity of our patients could adversely affect our Net operating revenues or our profitability.”
Cost Reports
Because of our participation in Medicare and Medicaid, we are required to meet certain financial reporting requirements. Federal and, where applicable, state regulations require the submission of annual cost reports covering the revenue, costs, and expenses associated with the services provided by inpatient hospital, home health, and hospice providers to Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid recipients. These annual cost reports are subject to routine audits which may result in adjustments to the amounts ultimately determined to be due to us under these reimbursement programs. These audits are used for determining if any under- or over-payments were made to these programs and to set payment levels for future years. Medicare also makes retroactive adjustments to payments for certain low-income patients after comparing subsequently published statistical data from CMS to the cost report data. We cannot predict what retroactive adjustments, if any, will be made, but we do not anticipate these adjustments will have a material impact on us.
Regulation
The healthcare industry is subject to significant federal, state, and local regulation that affects our business activities by controlling the reimbursement we receive for services provided, requiring licensure or certification of our operations, regulating our relationships with physicians and other referral sources, regulating the use of our properties, and controlling our growth. State and local healthcare regulation may cover additional matters such as nurse staffing ratios, healthcare worker safety, marijuana legalization, and assisted suicide. We are also subject to the broader federal and state regulations that prohibit fraud and abuse in the delivery of healthcare services. Congress, HHS-OIG, and the DOJ have historically focused on fraud and abuse in healthcare. Since the 1980s, a steady stream of changes have stiffened penalties or made it easier for DOJ to impose liability on companies and individuals, and the pace of these changes has only been increasing. The 2018 Budget Act continues this emphasis by increasing the criminal and civil penalties that can be imposed for violating federal health care laws. As a healthcare provider, we are subject to periodic audits, examinations and investigations conducted by, or at the direction of, government investigative and oversight agencies. Failure to comply with applicable federal and state healthcare regulations can result in a provider’s exclusion from participation in government reimbursement programs and in substantial civil and criminal penalties.
We undertake significant effort and expense to provide the medical, nursing, therapy, and ancillary services required to comply with local, state, and federal regulations, as well as, for most facilities, accreditation standards of The Joint Commission and, for some facilities, the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities. We also maintain accreditation for our home health and hospice agencies where required and in other instances where it facilitates more efficient Medicare enrollment. The Community Health Accreditation Program is the most common accrediting organization for our agencies. Accredited facilities and agencies are subject to periodic resurvey to ensure the standards are being met.
Beyond healthcare specific regulations, we face increasing state and local regulation in areas, such as labor and employment and data privacy, traditionally subject to only or primarily federal regulation. In addition to the risk and burden of new, additional, or more stringent regulatory standards, these state and local regulations often conflict with federal regulation, and with each other. Given the number of locations in which we operate, increasing state and local regulation, which may be more stringent than federal regulation and may even conflict with federal or other state or local regulation, represents a significant burden and risk to us.
We maintain a comprehensive ethics and compliance program to promote conduct and business practices that meet or exceed requirements under laws, regulations, and industry standards. The program monitors the Company’s performance on, and raises awareness of, various regulatory requirements among employees and emphasizes the importance of complying with governmental laws and regulations. As part of the compliance program, we provide annual compliance training to our employees, Board members, medical directors, vendors, and other non-employees that operate within our hospitals, and require all employees to report any violations to their supervisor or another person of authority or through a toll-free telephone hotline. Another integral part of our compliance program is a policy of non-retaliation against employees who report compliance concerns.
Licensure and Certification
Healthcare facility construction and operation are subject to numerous federal, state, and local regulations relating to, among other things, the adequacy of medical care, equipment, personnel, operating policies and procedures, acquisition and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances, infection control, maintenance of adequate records and patient privacy, fire prevention, and compliance with building codes and environmental protection laws. Our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals are subject to periodic inspection and other reviews by governmental and non-governmental certification authorities to ensure continued compliance with the various standards necessary for facility licensure. All of our hospitals are required to be licensed.
In addition, inpatient rehabilitation hospitals must be certified by CMS to participate in the Medicare program and generally must be certified by Medicaid state agencies to participate in Medicaid programs. Certification and participation in these programs involve numerous regulatory obligations. For example, hospitals must treat at least 20 patients without reimbursement prior to certification and eligibility for Medicare reimbursement. Once certified by Medicare, hospitals undergo periodic on-site surveys and revalidations in order to maintain their certification. All of our inpatient hospitals participate in the Medicare program.
Our home health and hospice agencies are each licensed under applicable law, certified by CMS for participation in the Medicare program, and generally certified by the applicable state Medicaid agencies to participate in those programs.
Failure to comply with applicable certification requirements may make our hospitals and agencies, as the case may be, ineligible for Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement. In addition, Medicare or Medicaid may seek retroactive reimbursement from noncompliant providers or otherwise impose sanctions for noncompliance. Non-governmental payors often have the right to terminate provider contracts if the provider loses its Medicare or Medicaid certification.
All Medicare providers are subject to employee screening requirements and associated fees. The screening of employees with patient access must include a licensure check and may include other procedures such as fingerprinting, criminal background checks, unscheduled and unannounced site visits, database checks, and other screening procedures prescribed by CMS. If a healthcare provider arranges or contracts with an individual or entity who is excluded by HHS-OIG from participation in a federal healthcare program, the provider may be subject to civil monetary penalties if the excluded person renders services reimbursed, directly or indirectly, by a program.
We have developed operational systems to oversee compliance with the various standards and requirements of the Medicare program and have established ongoing quality assurance activities; however, given the complex nature of governmental healthcare regulations, there can be no assurance Medicare, Medicaid, or other regulatory authorities will not allege instances of noncompliance. A determination by a regulatory authority that a facility or agency is not in compliance with applicable requirements could also lead to the assessment of fines or other penalties, loss of licensure, exclusion from participation in Medicare and Medicaid, and the imposition of requirements that the offending facility or agency must take corrective action.
Certificates of Need
In some states and U.S. territories where we operate, the construction or expansion of facilities, the acquisition of existing facilities or agencies, or the introduction of new beds or inpatient, home health, and hospice services may be subject to review by and prior approval of state regulatory bodies under a “certificate of need,” or “CON,” law. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 40% of our licensed beds and 36% of our home health and hospice locations are in states or U.S. territories that have CON laws. CON laws require a reviewing authority or agency to determine the public need for additional or expanded healthcare facilities and services. These laws also generally require approvals for capital expenditures involving inpatient rehabilitation hospitals if such capital expenditures exceed certain thresholds. In addition, CON laws in some states require us to abide by certain charity care commitments as a condition for approving a CON. Any instance where we are subject to a CON law, we must obtain it before acquiring, opening, reclassifying, or expanding a healthcare facility, starting a new healthcare program, or opening a new home health or hospice agency.
We potentially face opposition any time we initiate a project requiring a new or amended CON or seek to acquire an existing CON. This opposition may arise either from competing national or regional companies or from local hospitals, agencies, or other providers which file competing applications or oppose the proposed CON project. Opposition to our applications may delay or prevent our future addition of beds, hospitals, or agencies in given markets or increase our costs in seeking those additions. The necessity for these approvals serves as a barrier to entry and has the potential to limit competition for us (in markets where we hold a CON) and for other providers (in markets where we are seeking a CON). We have generally been successful in obtaining CONs or similar approvals, although there can be no assurance we will achieve similar success in the future, and the likelihood of success varies by locality and state.
In an attempt to reduce regulation and increase competition, lawmakers in several states have recently proposed modification or even full repeal of CON laws. In 2019, Florida enacted legislation to repeal CON laws for several provider types, including IRFs, in two stages. Effective July 1, 2019, existing IRFs became eligible to expand without first obtaining a CON. Effective July 1, 2021, new IRFs may operate without first obtaining a CON. It appears likely other states will consider CON-related legislation and regulation changes, including in some cases expanding CON requirements.
False Claims
The federal False Claims Act (the “FCA”) imposes liability for the knowing presentation of a false claim to the United States government and provides for penalties equal to three times the actual amount of any overpayments plus up to approximately $23,000 per claim. Federal civil penalties will be adjusted to account for inflation each year. In addition, the FCA allows private persons, known as “relators,” to file complaints under seal and provides a period of time for the government to investigate such complaints and determine whether to intervene in them and take over the handling of all or part of such complaints. The government and relators may also allege violations of the FCA for the knowing and improper failure to report and refund amounts owed to the government in a timely manner following identification of an overpayment. This is known as a “reverse false claim.” The government deems identification of the overpayment to occur when a person has, or should have through reasonable diligence, determined that an overpayment was received and quantified the overpayment.
Because we perform thousands of similar procedures a year for which we are reimbursed by Medicare and other federal payors and there is a relatively long statute of limitations, a billing error, cost reporting error or disagreement over physician medical judgment could result in significant damages and civil and criminal penalties under the FCA. Many states have also adopted similar laws relating to state government payments for healthcare services. The 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws amended the FCA to expand the definition of false claim, to make it easier for the government to initiate and conduct investigations, to enhance the monetary reward to relators where prosecutions are ultimately successful, and to extend the statute of limitations on claims by the government. The federal government has become increasingly aggressive in asserting that incidents of erroneous billing or record keeping represent FCA violations and in challenging the medical judgment of independent physicians as the basis for FCA allegations. Furthermore, well-publicized enforcement actions indicate that the federal government has increasingly sought to use statistical sampling to extrapolate allegations to larger pools of claims or to infer liability without proving knowledge of falsity of individual claims. For additional discussion, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, and Note 18, Contingencies and Other Commitments, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Relationships with Physicians and Other Providers
Anti-Kickback Law. Various state and federal laws regulate relationships between providers of healthcare services, including management or service contracts and investment relationships. Among the most important of these restrictions is a federal law prohibiting the offer, payment, solicitation, or receipt of remuneration by individuals or entities to induce referrals of patients for services reimbursed under the Medicare or Medicaid programs (the “Anti-Kickback Law”). The 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws amended the federal Anti-Kickback Law to provide that proving violations of this law does not require proving actual knowledge or specific intent to commit a violation. Another amendment made it clear that Anti-Kickback Law violations can be the basis for claims under the FCA. These changes and those described above related to the FCA, when combined with other recent federal initiatives, are likely to increase investigation and enforcement efforts in the healthcare industry generally. In addition to standard federal criminal and civil sanctions, including imprisonment and penalties of up to $100,000 for each violation plus tripled damages for improper claims, violators of the Anti-Kickback Law may be subject to exclusion from the Medicare and/or Medicaid programs. Federal civil penalties will be adjusted to account for inflation each year. In 1991, HHS-OIG issued regulations describing compensation arrangements that are not viewed as illegal remuneration under the Anti-Kickback Law. Those regulations provide for certain safe harbors for identified types of compensation arrangements that, if fully complied with, assure participants in the particular arrangement that HHS-OIG will not treat that participation as a criminal offense under the Anti-Kickback Law or as the basis for an exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs or the imposition of civil sanctions. 
On November 20, 2020, HHS-OIG finalized a rule to modernize the Anti-Kickback Law by reducing regulatory barriers to care coordination and accelerating adoption of value-based delivery and payment models (the “2020 AKL Rule”). The 2020 AKL Rule adds several new safe harbors for value-based arrangements and modifies several existing safe harbors with the goal of encouraging innovations that are beneficial to patients while maintaining necessary safeguards to protect against fraud and abuse. The 2020 AKL Rule also expands the safe harbor for cybersecurity technology by covering remuneration in the form of cybersecurity technology and services. The new and modified value-based safe harbors are available to inpatient rehabilitation and home health providers if the applicable conditions are met. 
Failure to fall within a safe harbor does not constitute a violation of the Anti-Kickback Law, but HHS-OIG has indicated failure to fall within a safe harbor may subject an arrangement to increased scrutiny. A violation of the Anti-Kickback Law by us or one or more of our joint ventures could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Even the assertion of a violation could have an adverse effect upon our stock price or reputation.
We operate a number of our rehabilitation hospitals and a few of our home health agencies through joint ventures with institutional healthcare providers that may be in a position to make or influence referrals to us. In addition, we have a number of relationships with physicians and other healthcare providers, including management or service contracts. Some of these investment relationships and contractual relationships may not fall within the protection offered by a safe harbor. Despite our compliance and monitoring efforts, there can be no assurance violations of the Anti-Kickback Law will not be asserted in the future, nor can there be any assurance our defense against any such assertion would be successful.
For example, we have entered into agreements to manage our hospitals that are owned by joint ventures. Most of these agreements incorporate a percentage-based management fee. Although there is a safe harbor for personal services and management contracts, this safe harbor requires, among other things, the aggregate compensation paid to the manager over the term of the agreement be set in advance. Because our management fee may be based on a percentage of revenues, the fee arrangement may not meet this requirement. However, we believe our management arrangements satisfy the other requirements of the safe harbor for personal services and management contracts and comply with the Anti-Kickback Law.
Physician Self-Referral Law. The federal law commonly known as the “Stark law” and CMS regulations promulgated under the Stark law prohibit physicians from making referrals for “designated health services” including inpatient and outpatient hospital services, physical therapy, occupational therapy, radiology services, and home health services, to an entity in which the physician (or an immediate family member) has an investment interest or other financial relationship, subject to certain exceptions. The Stark law also prohibits those entities from filing claims or billing Medicare for those referred services. Violators of the Stark law and regulations may be subject to recoupments, civil monetary sanctions (up to $26,000 for each violation and assessments up to three times the amount claimed for each prohibited service) and exclusion from any federal, state, or other governmental healthcare programs. The statute also provides a penalty of up to $172,000 for a circumvention scheme. Federal civil penalties will be adjusted to account for inflation each year. There are statutory exceptions to the Stark law for many of the customary financial arrangements between physicians and providers, including personal services contracts and leases. However, in order to be afforded protection by a Stark law exception, the financial arrangement must comply with every requirement of the applicable exception.
Under the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws, the exception to the Stark law that currently permits physicians to refer patients to hospitals in which they have an investment or ownership interest has been dramatically limited by providing that only physician-owned hospitals with a provider agreement in place on December 31, 2010 are exempt from the general ban on self-referral. Existing physician-owned hospitals are prohibited from increasing the physician ownership percentage in the hospital after March 23, 2010. Additionally, physician-owned hospitals are prohibited from increasing the number of licensed beds after March 23, 2010, except when certain market and regulatory approval conditions are met. We have no hospitals that would be considered physician-owned under this law.
On November 20, 2020, CMS finalized a rule implementing various changes to the Stark law to provide better access and outcomes for patients by creating clearer paths for providers to serve patients through enhanced coordinated care agreements (the “2020 Stark Rule”). Notably, the 2020 Stark Rule creates permanent exceptions for value-based compensation arrangements that provide at least one value-based activity, which arrangements must further one value-based purpose, which may include: (1) coordinating and managing patient care; (2) improving quality of care for a target population; (3) reducing costs or expenditure growth without reducing quality of care; and (4) transitioning from health care delivery and payment mechanisms that are based on volume to outcome-based delivery and payment systems. In addition, the 2020 Stark Rule adopts a new exception regarding the provision of cybersecurity items to physicians and makes permanent the electronic health record exception under the Stark law. 
The complexity of the Stark law and the associated regulations and their associated strict liability provisions are a challenge for healthcare providers, who do not always have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of these laws and regulations. We attempt to structure our relationships to meet one or more exceptions to the Stark law, but the regulations implementing the exceptions are detailed and complex. Accordingly, we cannot assure that every relationship complies fully with the Stark law.
Additionally, no assurances can be given that any agency charged with enforcement of the Stark law and regulations might not assert a violation under the Stark law, nor can there be any assurance our defense against any such assertion would be successful or that new federal or state laws governing physician relationships, or new interpretations of existing laws governing such relationships, might not adversely affect relationships we have established with physicians or result in the imposition of penalties on us. A violation of the Stark law by us could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Even the assertion of a violation could have an adverse effect upon our stock price or reputation.
HIPAA
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, commonly known as “HIPAA,” broadened the scope of certain fraud and abuse laws by adding several criminal provisions for healthcare fraud offenses that apply to all health benefit programs. HIPAA also added a prohibition against incentives intended to influence decisions by Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries as to the provider from which they will receive services. In addition, HIPAA created new enforcement mechanisms to combat fraud and abuse, including the Medicare Integrity Program, and an incentive program under which individuals can receive a monetary reward for providing information on Medicare fraud and abuse that leads to the recovery of at least Medicare funds. Penalties for violations of HIPAA include civil and criminal monetary penalties. The HHS Office of Civil Rights (“HHS-OCR”) implemented a permanent HIPAA audit program for healthcare providers nationwide in 2016. As of December 31, 2020, we have not been selected for audit.
HIPAA and related HHS regulations contain certain administrative simplification provisions that require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for certain healthcare claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically. HIPAA regulations also regulate the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health-related information, 
whether communicated electronically, on paper, or orally. The regulations provide patients with significant rights related to understanding and controlling how their health information is used or disclosed and require healthcare providers to implement administrative, physical, and technical practices to protect the security of individually identifiable health information.
The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (“HITECH”) Act modifies and expands the privacy and security requirements of HIPAA. The HITECH Act applies certain of the HIPAA privacy and security requirements directly to business associates of covered entities. The modifications to existing HIPAA requirements include: expanded accounting requirements for electronic health records, tighter restrictions on marketing and fundraising, and heightened penalties and enforcement associated with noncompliance. Significantly, the HITECH Act also establishes new mandatory federal requirements for notification of breaches of security involving protected health information. HHS-OCR rules implementing the HITECH Act expand the potential liability for a breach involving protected health information to cover some instances where a subcontractor is responsible for the breaches and that individual or entity was acting within the scope of delegated authority under the related contract or engagement. These rules generally define “breach” to mean the acquisition, access, use or disclosure of protected health information in a manner not permitted by the HIPAA privacy standards, which compromises the security or privacy of protected health information. Under these rules, improper acquisition, access, use, or disclosure is presumed to be a reportable breach, unless the potentially breaching party can demonstrate a low probability that protected health information has been compromised.
In December 2020, HHS-OCR proposed a new rule that would modify HIPAA regulations. According to HHS-OCR, the proposed rule is intended to promote care coordination and value-based care. The proposed changes to the HIPAA rules also provide for strengthening individuals’ rights to access their own health information, including electronic information; improving information sharing for care coordination and case management for individuals; facilitating greater family and caregiver involvement in the care of individuals experiencing emergencies or health crises; enhancing flexibilities for disclosures in emergency or threatening circumstances, such as the opioid and COVID-19 public health emergencies; and reducing administrative burdens on HIPAA covered healthcare providers and health plans, while continuing to protect individuals’ health information privacy interests. Although one of the stated purposes of the proposed rules is to reduce healthcare providers burdens, providers would have to engage in a number of activities to come into compliance if the changes are finalized, including changing policies and procedures, changing patient privacy notices and business associate agreements and training workforce members in the new requirements. 
HHS-OCR is responsible for enforcing the requirement that covered entities notify HHS and any individual whose protected health information has been improperly acquired, accessed, used, or disclosed. In certain cases, notice of a breach is required to be made to media outlets. The heightened penalties for noncompliance range from $100 to $50,000 per violation for most violations. In the event of violations due to willful neglect that are not corrected within 30 days, penalties start at $50,000 per violation and are not subject to a per violation statutory maximum. Penalties are also subject to an annual cap for multiple identical violations in a single calendar year. Pursuant to 2019 guidance from HHS-OCR, this enforcement cap ranges from a minimum of $25,000 per year to a maximum of $1,500,000 per year depending on an entity’s level of culpability. Importantly, HHS-OCR has indicated that the failure to conduct a security risk assessment or adequately implement HIPAA compliance policies could qualify as willful neglect.
In addition, there are numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives at the federal and state levels addressing patient privacy concerns. Healthcare providers will continue to remain subject to any federal or state privacy-related laws, including but not limited to the California Consumer Privacy Act, that are more restrictive than the privacy regulations issued under HIPAA. These laws vary and could impose additional penalties. HHS-OIG and other regulators have also increasingly interpreted laws and regulations in a manner as to increase exposure of healthcare providers to allegations of noncompliance. Any actual or perceived violation of privacy-related laws and regulations, including HIPAA and the HITECH Act, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
Civil Monetary Penalties Law
Under the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, HHS may impose civil monetary penalties on healthcare providers that present, or cause to be presented, ineligible reimbursement claims for services. The 2018 Budget Act increased the civil monetary penalties, which vary depending on the offense from $5,000 to $100,000 per violation, plus treble damages for the amount at issue and may include exclusion from federal health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. The penalties are adjusted annually to account for inflation. HHS may seek to impose monetary penalties under this law for, among other things, offering inducements to beneficiaries for program services and filing false or fraudulent claims.
