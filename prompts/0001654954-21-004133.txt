 ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
  
  Overview
  
 As used in the Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” "Zoom” and the “Company” mean Zoom Telephonics, Inc., doing business as Minim, and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Minim, Inc. and MTRLC LLC. 
  
We deliver innovative Internet access products that reliably and securely connect homes and offices around the world. Now the exclusive global license holder to the Motorola brand for home networking hardware, Zoom Telephonics designs and manufactures products including cable modems, cable modem/routers, mobile broadband modems, wireless routers, Multimedia over Coax (“MoCA”) adapters and mesh home networking devices. Our AI-driven cloud software platform and applications make network management and security simple for home and business users, as well as the service providers that assist them— leading to higher customer satisfaction and decreased support burden. 
  
 Our mission is to make every smart home and office safe and easy to use for life and work. We believe advanced, vertically-integrated hardware and software is vital to delivering on this purpose as consumers increasingly depend on their networks for media streaming, remote working, telemedicine, remote education, mobile data offloading, and powering smart home appliances.  Our primary objective is to leverage these trends and build upon our position as a leading producer of  home networking devices sold through  many of the largest United States (“USA” or “US”) high-volume retailers by launching software-enabled products with the latest connectivity standards and expanding our sales channels globally.
 
 On December 4, 2020, Zoom acquired Minim, Inc. (“Minim”). Minim is a Delaware corporation that delivers its WiFi management and security Software as a Service ("SaaS") to Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to unlock bottom line growth through increased subscriber acquisition, retention, support cost efficiency. The Minim solution offers a web application for customer service representatives to effectively support subscribers and a mobile app for home users to manage their network settings, security, privacy and parental controls. The Company’s intuitive applications, built on proprietary device fingerprinting technology, also empowers businesses to  secure and manage satellite offices and remote employee networks.  Offering a full API suite, the Minim platform has been integrated with third-party hardware platforms and has been designed for ultra-extensibility as wireless technology advances.  Subsequent to the merger, the Company re-branded itself as Minim.   
  
  Cable modem products, including both cable modems and cable modem/routers (“gateways”), were Zoom’s highest revenue product category in 2015 through 2020.  Cable modems provide a high-bandwidth connection to the Internet through a cable service provider’s managed broadband network. Zoom Telephonics began shipping cable modems in 2000 and acquired a geographically-restricted license to sell Motorola-branded cable networking products in 2016.  From 2016 through 2020, the Company sold networking products under its ZOOM trademark as well as the Motorola brand.  Zoom’s primary means of distribution to end-users in the US, our primary market, is through national retailers, e-commerce platforms, and distributors.  In response to demand for faster connection speeds, security by design, and increased functionality, we have invested and continue to invest resources to advance our cable modem product line. 
  
 In August 2016, we extended our Motorola license to a worldwide exclusive license that includes cable modems and gateways, WiFi routers, WiFi range extenders, powerline communication devices, and related products. In August 2017, we further extended our Motorola license to a worldwide exclusive license for DSL modems and gateways, cellular modems and gateways, and MoCA products, and to a worldwide non-exclusive license for cellular sensors. We introduced under the Motorola brand two WiFi routers, one range extender, and one MoCA adapter in 2017. In 2018, we introduced into the retail market under the Motorola brand two WiFi routers and a DSL modem/router. In March 2020 Zoom entered into an amendment to extend the License Agreement with Motorola Mobility LLC (the “2020 Amendment”) through December 31, 2025. The 2020 Amendment expands Zoom’s exclusive license to use the Motorola trademark to a wide range of authorized channels worldwide, including  Direct to Consumer Channels and Service Provider Channels. In March 2020, we entered into a License Agreement with Motorola to sell consumer grade home security and monitoring products and to provide related services. This agreement applies to a wide range of products, including consumer grade cellular modems and gateways, DSL modems and gateways, and MoCA adapters for networking and home security products and services.  
  
  We are incorporated in Delaware under the name Zoom Telephonics, Inc. and are now doing business as “Minim” while maintaining the ZOOM trademark for products. Zoom Telephonics, Inc. was originally incorporated in New York in 1977 and changed its state of incorporation to Delaware in 1993. Minim, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Zoom Telephonics, Inc., is a corporation organized in Delaware. MTRLC LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Zoom Telephonics, Inc., is a limited liability company organized in Delaware that focuses on the sale of our Motorola brand products. Our principal executive offices are located at 848 Elm Street, Manchester, NH 03101, and our telephone number is (617) 423-1072. Our main website is www.minim.com. Information contained on our website does not constitute part of this report. Our common stock is traded on the OTCQB Venture Market under the symbol MINM (formerly traded under the symbol ZMTP until December 8, 2020).

  Strategy Overview
 
 Our strategy is to address the increasing demands of broadband users with advanced technology and build upon our position as a leading home networking product supplier in many of the largest United States (“USA” or “US”) high-volume retailers to go global. The key pillars to our strategy are as follows:
 
  Distribute high-margin software – Our cloud-based software is a companion to home networking equipment, making our established hardware sales channels a prime route to software distribution. We believe quality software is a profit margin driver, lending to higher Average Selling Prices (ASPs) and higher gross profit. In addition, we assist third-party hardware vendors and ISPs in their own software development with our API-based platform.
 
  Customer-driven design – With continued investment in warranties and customer service, we see our direct and frequent connection to end users as a market advantage that informs our product roadmap. The Company continues to invest in research and development with the latest connectivity standards— such as DOCSIS 3.1, WiFi 6, EasyMesh, and 5G— to design high-speed products while optimizing costs to maintain a healthy, price segmented portfolio.
 
  Expand sales reach – We maintain strong sales channel relationships by delivering value-driven products in a way that complements, not challenges, our resellers’ profitability. We believe this is a competitive edge that affords us wider access to the Total Addressable Market through both retailers and ISPs. As we invest in marketing and new product introductions to existing channels, we consider new market entrances.
 
  Strengthen supply chain resiliency – The Company continues to adjust its manufacturing operations and delivery mechanisms to reduce operational costs. We continue to build supply chain diversity to improve our operational resiliency to geopolitical, weather-related, and market-based risks to our product supply.

 Products
  
  General
  
 We are the creator of innovative Internet access products that dependably connect people to the information they need and the people they love. Our hardware portfolio includes: cable modems, cable modem/routers, mobile broadband modems, wireless routers, MoCA adapters, and mesh home networking devices. Our software platform includes: mobile applications, a web application, API suites, and an open-source embedded agent for networking devices.
  
 We have sold home networking products under the globally-recognized Motorola brand, as well as under our own ZOOM trademark. Our hardware and software products are purchased by consumers to support and protect their family’s connected devices; ISPs to reduce support costs and increase revenue with digitally transformed support and value-added services; and by businesses to affordably support and secure satellite and remote worker networks.
  
 In May 2015, Zoom entered into an agreement to license certain Motorola trademarks from Motorola Trademark Holdings, LLC (“Motorola”) for cable modem products. The agreement includes numerous requirements intended to assure the quality and reputation of Motorola® brand products. In January 2016 Zoom, through its MTRLC LLC subsidiary, which was formed on October 6, 2015, began shipping cable modems under the Motorola® brand. In August 2016, Zoom entered into an amendment to the license agreement with Motorola. The amendment expands Zoom’s exclusive license to use the Motorola trademark to a wide range of authorized channels worldwide and expands the license from cable modems and gateways to also include consumer routers, WiFi range extenders, home powerline network adapters, and related products. In August 2017, we further extended our Motorola license to a worldwide exclusive license for DSL modems and gateways, cellular modems and gateways, and MoCA products, and to a worldwide non-exclusive license for cellular sensors. We introduced under the Motorola® brand three WiFi routers, one range extender, one MoCA adapter, and one DSL modem/router in 2017 and 2018. Zoom plans to extend this product line, adding mesh routers and range extenders, cellular sensors, and new MoCA adapters. In March 2020, Zoom entered into an amendment to extend the License Agreement with Motorola Mobility LLC through December 31, 2025. The 2020 Amendment expands Zoom’s exclusive license to use the Motorola trademark to a wide range of authorized channels worldwide, including Service Provider Channels.

 In March 2020, Zoom entered into a License Agreement with Motorola Mobility LLC to sell consumer grade home security and monitoring products and to provide related services (the “2020 License Agreement”). The term of the 2020 License Agreement runs through December 31, 2025 and includes minimum licensing payments beginning in 2021 and continuing through the remainder of the agreement term. 
  
  Home Networking Hardware
  
 Our networking hardware products connect homes and small offices to the Internet, create wireless networks, and extend the wireless signal. These products are now primarily available through retail and e-commerce channels in the US.
  
   ●
 Modems and Modem/Routers (“Gateways”), which are devices that convert cable service into Internet connectivity for ethernet-only connection (modems) or ethernet and wireless connections (modem/routers). Zoom’s primary cable modem sales from 2016 through 2020 were of Motorola brand products. We have obtained CableLabs® certification for our currently marketed cable modems, and these cable modems have also received a number of cable service provider certifications. Required by most service providers for interoperability on their networks, all modem and modem/router products must pass this lengthy, expensive, and technically challenging certification process. Zoom plans to extend its DOCSIS 3.1 product line, adding high-performance modem/routers including WiFi 6 and mesh-capable routers.

   ●
 Routers and Mesh Systems, which are devices that create WiFi networks. Mesh WiFi systems extend the signal throughout a wider area than a single router can typically cover. In 2020, Zoom launched its first mesh WiFi system and plans to extend its mesh and router portfolio with WiFi 6 and WiFi 6E capabilities.

   ●
 Other Local Area Network Products, which are devices that create, extend, or enhance a Local Access Network. Zoom currently offers MoCA adapters, which provides an Ethernet connection over coaxial cable between a MoCA-capable router and connected devices.

 
  Software
  
 The Minim software platform offers three core software components:
  
   ●
 Minim mobile application for end users to personalize and monitor their home and office network with features such as speed testing, data usage tracking, security alerts, malware blocking, privacy settings, parental controls.

   ●
 Minim web application that enables technical support representatives in ISPs and businesses to offer efficient remote support with network insights.

   ●
 Minim API suite and open-source agent for third-party hardware vendors, ISPs, and other partners to integrate with the Minim platform, leverage Minim functionality, and manage their own account data. A foundational component of our software is an open-source embedded agent for integration with any third-party router firmware.

 
  Products for Markets outside North America
  
 The vast majority of our sales were in North America from 2015 through 2020 because the business predominantly sold cable modem and modem/router products, and the United States is by far the largest market for cable modems sold through retailers. However, we expect to see growth outside North America as we expand our ISP customer base and portfolio of retail routers, mesh systems, and other Local Area Network products under our worldwide Motorola brand license.
  
 Networking hardware products for countries outside the United States typically differ from a similar product for the United States because of varied regulatory and certification requirements, country-specific phone jacks and AC power adapters, and language needs. As a result, the introduction of new products into markets outside North America can incur significant costs and time to market. In 1993, we introduced our first dial-up modem approved for selected Western European countries. Since then, we have sold our products into a number of markets outside North America. We have received regulatory certifications for a number of countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom (“UK”), and Canada. We have planned product line enhancements to enable new market expansion. Most importantly for sales outside the United States, we are working toward selling Motorola brand home networking hardware and software products in the UK, Canada, Latin America, India, Mexico and other regions.
  
  Sales Channels
  
  General
  
 We sell our products primarily through high-volume retailers and distributors (“B2C”), Internet service providers, individual businesses (“B2B”), service providers, value-added resellers, PC system integrators, and Original Equipment Manufacturers ("OEMs"). We support our major accounts in their efforts to discern strategic directions in the market, to maintain appropriate inventory levels, and to offer a balanced selection of attractive products.

 Relatively few companies account for a substantial portion of the Company’s revenues.  In 2020, two companies accounted for 10% or greater individually, and 76% in the aggregate of the Company’s total net sales. At December 31, 2020, three companies with an accounts receivable balance of 10% or greater individually accounted for a combined 85% of the Company’s accounts receivable. In 2019, two companies accounted for 10% or greater individually, and 84% in the aggregate of the Company’s total net sales. At December 31, 2019, three companies with an accounts receivable balance of 10% or greater individually accounted for a combined 84% of the Company’s accounts receivable.
  
  Distributors and Retailers outside North America
  
 In markets outside North America we sell and ship our hardware products primarily to distributors. Our software is globally sold via licenses to ISPs and Resellers globally. We believe that sales growth outside North America will continue to require substantial additional investments of resources for product design and testing, regulatory certifications, native-language instruction manuals and software, packaging, sales support, and technical support. We have made this investment in the past for many countries, and we expect to make this investment for some countries and products in the future.   However, we anticipate that the majority of sales in the next two years will come from North America, partly because the US is one of the few countries with a robust retail cable modem market due to Federal regulations in the United States. As we expand our product portfolio beyond cable modems and serve ISPs directly and through Reseller relationships, we envision the proportion of our sales from countries outside the United States will increase.
  . 
  North American High-volume Retailers and Distributors
  
 In North America we reach the retail market primarily through high-volume retailers. Our North American retailers include Best Buy, Micro Center, Target, Wal-Mart, and e-tail and e-commerce platforms including Amazon.
  
 We sell significant quantities of our products through distributors, who often sell to corporate accounts, retailers, service providers, value-added resellers, equipment manufacturers, and other customers. Our North American distributors include D&H Distributing and Ingram Micro.
  
  Internet Service Providers & Businesses
  
 Minim works with over 140 Internet Service Providers and businesses with its subscription-based WiFi management and security software. Our solution enables challenger ISPs to better compete in the market with a premium WiFi solution while lowering operational costs with support call and onsite visit avoidance. For our business customers, our solution reduces the costs, deployment time, and risks to supporting and securing remote employee and satellite office networks. We are empowering the IT staff of our business customers to secure and support employee home networks and other small workspaces. Our customer base is primarily located in the US; however, we have customers all over the world, including Canada, UK, and South Africa.
  
  OEM and Router Manufacturers
  
 Our open-source embedded software agent enables third-party hardware vendors to integrate Minim in their networking devices, potentially to create a recurring revenue stream with our software services. Our system integrator and OEM customers sell our products under their own name or incorporate our products as a component of their systems. We seek to be responsive to the needs of these customers by providing on-time delivery of high-quality, reliable, cost-effective products with strong engineering and sales support.
  
  Sales, Marketing and Support
  
 In North America we sell our Zoom®, Motorola®, and Minim® products through a direct sales force and commissioned independent sales representatives to retailers; through channel resellers; and through electronics distributors. Worldwide technical support is primarily handled from our Manchester headquarters.
  
We believe that Motorola® is a widely recognized brand name, and we build upon this brand equity in a variety of ways, including: Amazon advertising, Google AdWords advertising, social media marketing and advertising, retailer cooperative advertising, product packaging, trade shows, and public relations. We promote Zoom® and Minim® brand awareness through similar means, as well as engaging in industry associations, content marketing, outbound sales development, analyst briefings, and open-source project contribution.
  
 We develop quality products that are user-friendly and are designed to require minimal support. We typically support our claims of quality with product warranties of one to two years, depending upon the product. To address the needs of end-users and resellers who require assistance, we have our own staff of technical support specialists.  They provide telephone support six days per week in English and Spanish and aim to continuously expand of languages, availability, and support channels. Our technical support specialists also maintain a significant Internet support facility that includes email, firmware and software downloads, and a digital knowledgebase.

  Research and Development
  
 Our research and development efforts are focused on developing new products, enhancing the capabilities of existing products, and reducing production costs. We have developed close collaborative relationships with certain of our Original Design Manufacturer (“ODM”) suppliers and component suppliers. We work with these partners and other sources to identify and respond to emerging technologies and market trends by developing products that address these trends. We also develop all the hardware and firmware for certain products in-house, including some cellular modems and some future cellular sensors.
  
 The Company’s costs on research and development were $3.8 million for 2020 and $2.2 million for 2019. The primary reasons for the increase in research and development costs were salary and related costs, increased product testing, and certification and software development expenses. As of December 31, 2020, we had twenty-two employees engaged primarily in research and development. Our research and development team performs hardware design and layout, mechanical design, prototype construction and testing, component specification, firmware and software development, product testing, foreign and domestic regulatory certification efforts, end-user and internal documentation, and third-party software selection and testing.
  
  Manufacturing & Suppliers
  
 Our products are currently designed for high-volume automated assembly to help assure reduced costs, rapid market entry, short lead times, and reliability. High-volume assembly mostly occurs in Vietnam or China. Our contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers typically obtain some or all of the material required to assemble the products based upon a Zoom Telephonics Approved Vendor List and Parts List. Our manufacturers typically insert parts onto the printed circuit board, with most parts automatically inserted by machine, solder the circuit board, and test the completed assemblies. The contract manufacturer sometimes performs final packaging. For the US and many other markets, packaging is often performed at our facilities in North America, allowing us to tailor the packaging and its contents for our customers immediately before shipping. This facility also performs warehousing, shipping, quality control, finishing and some software updates from time to time. We also perform circuit design, circuit board layout, and strategic component sourcing at our Boston area office. Wherever the product is built, our quality systems are used to help assure that the product meets our specifications.
  
 Our North American facility is currently located in Tijuana, Mexico. From time to time, we experience certain challenges associated with the Tijuana facility, specifically relating to bringing products across the border between the US and Mexico. We believe that this facility assists us in cost-effectively providing rapid response to the needs of our US customers.
  
 Historically we have used one primary manufacturer for a given design. We sometimes maintain back-up production tooling at a second manufacturer for our highest-volume products. Our manufacturers are normally adequate to meet reasonable and properly planned production needs; but a fire, natural calamity, strike, financial problem, the impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic or another significant event at an assembler's facility could adversely affect our shipments and revenues. In 2020, two suppliers provided 99% of our purchased inventory. The loss of a key supplier, or a material adverse change in a key supplier’s business or in our relationship with a key supplier, could materially and adversely harm our business.
  
 Our products include a large number of parts, most of which are available from multiple sources with varying lead times. However, most of our products include a sole-sourced chipset as the most critical component of the product. The vast majority of our cable modem chipsets come exclusively from Broadcom. Most of our cellular products include a Gemalto module. Our dial-up modem chipsets come exclusively from Conexant. Serious problems at Broadcom, including long chipset lead-times, would significantly reduce Zoom’s shipments. While many companies that use computer chips in their business experienced during 2020 supply chain issues in sourcing chips due to a chip shortage, we did not experience issues during 2020 resulting from material delays or unavailability of chips. There can be no assurance, however, that we will not experience such issues in the future.
  
 We have experienced delays in receiving shipments of essential integrated circuits in the past, and we may experience such delays in the future. Moreover, we cannot assure that a chipset supplier will, in the future, sell chipsets to us in quantities sufficient to meet our needs or that we will purchase the specified dollar amount of products necessary to receive concessions and incentives from a chipset supplier. An interruption in a chipset supplier's ability to deliver chipsets, a failure of our suppliers to produce chipset enhancements or new chipsets on a timely basis and at competitive prices, a material increase in the price of the chipsets, our failure to purchase a specified dollar amount of products or any other adverse change in our relationship with modem component suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
  
 We are also subject to price fluctuations in our cost of goods. Our costs may increase if component shortages develop, lead-times stretch out, fuel costs rise, or significant delays develop due to labor-related issues.
  
 We are also subject to the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (“RoHS”) and Consumer Electronics Control (“CEC”) rules discussed above, which affect component sourcing, product manufacturing, sales, and marketing.

 Since September 24, 2018 until after we transitioned a substantial portion of our manufacturing to Vietnam during the second quarter of 2020, substantially all of our products were subject to a tariff because they were produced in China and they were in product categories subject to the tariff on our cost of goods at the time of entry into the United States. The tariff started at 10% and increased to 25% in June 2019. These tariffs have a significant impact on our cost of inventory and profitability. Because these tariffs may not be reduced and may even be increased, we actively worked on finding production capability outside China. Our largest supplier established a major production capability in Vietnam, and we transitioned the majority of our production to Vietnam by the end of second quarter of 2020. In addition, we are working with other suppliers outside of China. With the transition of a majority of our manufacturing to Vietnam, we significantly reduced the tariff burden.
  
  Competition
  
 The Internet access and networking industries are intensely competitive and characterized by aggressive pricing practices, continually changing customer demand patterns, rapid technological advances, and emerging industry standards. These characteristics result in frequent introductions of new products with added capabilities and features, and continuous improvements in the relative functionality and price of modems and other communications products. Our operating results and our ability to compete could be adversely affected if we are unable to:
  
   ●
 successfully and accurately anticipate customer demand;

 
   ●
 manage our product transitions, inventory levels, and manufacturing processes efficiently;

 
   ●
 distribute or introduce our products quickly in response to customer demand and technological advances;

 
   ●
 differentiate our products from those of our competitors; or

 
   ●
 otherwise compete successfully in the markets for our products.

 
 Some of our primary competitors by product group include the following:
  
   ●
 Cable modem and modem/router competitors: Belkin/Linksys, Commscope/Arris, D-Link, Hon Hai Network Systems (formerly Ambit Microsystems), Netgear, Sagemcom, Technicolor, TP-Link and Ubee Interactive.

 
   ●
 Router and mesh WiFi competitors: Amazon/Eero, Amped, Apple, Asus, Belkin/Linksys, D-Link, Google, Netgear, Securifi, Tenda, TP-Link, Trendnet, and Ubiquiti.

 
   ●
 WiFi Management and Security: AirTies, Cujo AI, Plume Design, SAM Seamless Network.

   
 Many of our competitors and potential competitors have more extensive financial, engineering, product development, manufacturing, and marketing resources than we do.
  
 The principal competitive factors in our industry include the following:
  
   ●
 product performance, features, reliability and quality of service;

 
   ●
  price;

 
   ●
 brand image;

 
   ●
 product availability and lead times;

 
   ●
 size and stability of operations;

 
   ●
 breadth of product line;

 
   ●
 sales and distribution capability, including retailer and distributor relationships;

 
   ●
 technical support and service; 
  
   
9


  
 
   ●
  product documentation and product warranties;

 
   ●
  relationships with providers of broadband access services; and

 
   ●
  certifications evidencing compliance with various requirements.

 
 We believe we are able to provide a competitive mix of the above factors for our products, particularly when they are sold through retailers, computer product distributors, small to medium sized Internet service providers, and system integrators. We have been less successful in selling directly to large telecommunication providers and other large providers of broadband access services.
  
 Successfully penetrating the broadband modem market presents a number of challenges, including:
  
   ●
  the current limited retail market for broadband modems, as most consumer broadband users get their modem from their service provider;

 
   ●
  the relatively small number of cable, telecommunications and Internet service providers that make up the majority of the market for broadband modems in the USA, our largest market;

 
   ●
  the significant bargaining power and market dominance of these large service providers;

 
   ●
  the time-consuming, expensive and uncertain certification processes of the various cable, mobile broadband service providers; and

 
   ●
  the strong relationships with service providers enjoyed by some incumbent equipment providers, including ARRIS for cable modems and Huawei for DSL and mobile broadband modems.

 
  Intellectual Property Rights
  
 We rely primarily on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and patents to protect our proprietary rights. We have trademarks and copyrights for our firmware (software on a chip), printed circuit board artwork, instructions, packaging, and literature. We also have three active patents that expire between years 2021 and 2039. There cannot be any assurance that any patent application will be granted or that any patent obtained will provide protection or be of commercial benefit to us, or that the validity of a patent will not be challenged. Moreover, our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate and our competitors may independently develop comparable or superior technologies.
  
 We license certain technologies used in our products, typically rights to bundled software, on a non-exclusive basis. In addition, we purchase chipsets that incorporate sophisticated technology. We have received, and may receive in the future, infringement claims from third parties relating to our products and technologies. We investigate the validity of these claims and, if we believe the claims have merit, we respond through licensing or other appropriate actions. Certain of these past claims have related to technology included in modem chipsets. We forward these claims to the appropriate vendor. If we or our component manufacturers were unable to license necessary technology on a cost-effective basis, we could be prohibited from marketing products containing that technology, incur substantial costs in redesigning products incorporating that technology, or incur substantial costs defending any legal action taken against it. Where possible we attempt to receive patent indemnification from chipset suppliers and other appropriate suppliers, but the extent of this coverage varies, and enforcement of this indemnification may be difficult and costly.
  
 In May 2015, we entered into an agreement to license certain Motorola® brand trademarks for consumer cable modem products in the United States and Canada through certain authorized sales channels using such trademarks beginning January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2020. In August 2016, Zoom entered into an amendment to the License Agreement with Motorola Mobility LLC.  The 2016 amendment expanded Zoom’s exclusive license to use the Motorola trademark to a wide range of authorized channels worldwide and expanded the license from cable modems and gateways to also include consumer routers, WiFi range extenders, home powerline network adapters, and access points. In August 2017, Zoom entered into an amendment to the License Agreement with Motorola Mobility LLC.  The 2017 amendment expanded Zoom’s exclusive license to use the Motorola trademark to a wide range of authorized channels worldwide, and expanded the license from cable modems, gateways, consumer routers, WiFi range extenders, home powerline network adapters, and access points to also include MoCA adapters, and cellular sensors. In March 2020, Zoom entered into an amendment to extend the License Agreement with Motorola Mobility LLC through December 31, 2025. The 2020 amendment expanded Zoom’s exclusive license to use the Motorola trademark to a wide range of authorized channels worldwide, including Direct to Consumer Channels and Service Provider Channels.

 In March 2020, we entered into a license with Motorola Mobility LLC to sell consumer grade home security and monitoring products and to provide related services. The term of this Agreement runs through December 31, 2025 and includes minimum licensing payments beginning in 2021 and continuing through the remainder of the agreement term.
  
 In February 2021, Zoom Video Communications, Inc. filed a petition with the US Patent and Trademark Office seeking cancellation of the Company’s Zoom® trademark. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the petition and intends vigorously to oppose the cancellation petition.
  
  Backlog
  
 Our backlog on February 28, 2021 was $1.4 million, and on February 29, 2020 was $287 thousand. Orders included in backlog may be canceled or rescheduled by customers without significant penalty. Backlog as of any particular date should not be relied upon as indicative of our net sales for any future period.
 Human Capital
  
 Zoom is committed to attracting and retaining the brightest and best talent. Therefore, investing, developing, and maintaining human capital is critical to our success. Our effectiveness in attracting, developing, engaging and retaining talented team members demonstrates our commitment to providing a welcoming and safe workplace, with equitable compensation, benefits and opportunities for our team members to continually grow and develop their careers within Zoom.
  
 As of December 31, 2020, Zoom had 61 employees. Twenty-two employees were engaged in research and development and quality control. Ten employees were involved in operations, which manages production, inventory, purchasing, warehousing, freight, invoicing, shipping, collections, and returns. Twenty employees were engaged in sales, marketing, and customer technical support. Nine employees performed executive, accounting, administrative, and management information systems functions. Our dedicated personnel in Tijuana, Mexico are employees of our Mexican service provider and not included in our headcount. On December 31, 2020, Zoom had four consultants, two in research and development and two in operations, who are not included in our headcount.
  
 Our culture and core values. We believe that by nurturing a strong culture based on our core values we are able to attract, hire, and retain a highly engaged team. Our cultural pillars – respect, transparency, community, accountability, collaboration – reflect the way we lead and work with one another internally as well as externally with our customers, partners, suppliers and other stakeholders. We seek to embed our core values to act responsibly and with integrity, to instill a sense of individual role and purpose at Zoom, and to communicate openly and honestly. Our culture of respect and collaboration is intended to create an inclusive working environment and inclusive engagement with our stakeholders; our culture to create encourages innovation from a diversity of experiences, backgrounds and characteristics; and our culture to communicate encourages open and honest discussion. Everything we do, we do with a deep regard for each other, our customers, and our shareholders. We show our respect for each customer’s decision to welcome Zoom into their home by taking extra care to ensure our products make their connected homes safer and easier to use for life and work.
  
 Our response to COVID-19. As part of our efforts to keep our employees safe and support efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19, we instituted a mandatory work-from-home policy for all but a small number of onsite essential personnel, and we implemented work and safety protocols at our office facilities that put the health and safety of our team first. With the support and commitment of our employees, we have pivoted to a work-from-home model and continue protecting our customers. We believe open and on-going communications have been critical to maintaining our culture and productivity during the pandemic, and we hosted bi-weekly update calls and weekly virtual social gatherings. Management continues to monitor the conditions and government mandates to ensure safe practices as the pandemic evolves.
