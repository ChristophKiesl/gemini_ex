Impact of COVID-19
 
In March 2020, a novel strain of coronavirus was declared a global pandemic and a National Public Health Emergency. The novel coronavirus pandemic and related “shelter-in-place” orders and other governmental mandates relating thereto (collectively, “COVID-19”) adversely affected and will, in all likelihood continue to adversely affect, our restaurant operations and financial results for the foreseeable future. Due to COVID-19, from mid-March 2020 through mid-May 2020, we ceased all dining and bar services at all of our restaurants, limiting service to take-out and delivery only of food, and implemented reduced hours at our retail package liquor stores. From mid-May 2020 through the beginning of July 2020, there was a gradual elimination of restrictions on our restaurant operations, permitting us to, among other things, provide dining for outdoor seating patrons with appropriate social distancing and provide dining for indoor patrons at up to 50% capacity (depending on the location of the restaurant), but with no bar service and increased operating hours at our package liquor stores. From the beginning of July 2020 through the beginning of September 2020, we ceased dine-in service at all of our Miami-Dade County, Florida restaurants, (two Company-owned and six limited partnership owned restaurants). Since the beginning of September 2020, we have been offering both food and bar options at all of our restaurants, including those located in Miami-Dade County, Florida, with appropriate social distancing and dine-in service at up to 100% capacity, including outdoor dining.
 
Due to COVID-19, we implemented (i) certain cost cutting measures including material layoffs at our restaurants and reduced corporate personnel salaries; and (ii) a number of changes to our operations such as the establishment of an in-house delivery service and an adjustment to our traditional staffing model to meet customer demand. We have been in regular contact with our suppliers and while to date we have not experienced significant disruptions in our supply chain, we could see future disruptions should the impacts of COVID-19 extend for a considerable amount of time. To support our employees, we have implemented work from home support, increased sanitization of high touch, high traffic areas in our restaurants, retail package liquor stores and corporate offices, provided personal protective equipment for our employees and increased the frequency of personal hygiene practices. From March 29, 2020 through May 9, 2020, the salaries of all our non-executive corporate office personnel were reduced by 20%, the base salaries of our Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer were each reduced by 50% and our Chief Executive Officer waived his base salary, representing salary savings of approximately $135,000 during this period. Our employee headcount as of fiscal year end 2020 was 1,804 persons reduced from 1,870 persons as of our fiscal year end 2019.
 
In addition and also due to COVID-19, we did not make any quarterly distributions to our limited partners for the quarter ended March 31, 2020. For each of the quarters ended June 30, 2020 and September 30, 2020, we made quarterly distributions to our limited partners equal to one-half (½) of the amounts that would have been distributed for the quarter ended March 31, 2020.
 
During the third quarter of fiscal year end 2020, the United States government passed a $2.0 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) designed primarily to help keep businesses running during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act included provisions for certain deductions and tax credits, filing deadline extensions, filing payment deadlines and making available certain grant money to assist businesses. This CARES ACT allowed us to take advantage of credits, deferments, and deductions, and loans from an unrelated third party lender pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP Loans”) (described below) during the third quarter of our fiscal year 2020. As a result, during the third and fourth quarter of 2020, we reversed certain of our cost cutting measures, including (i) reinstating employees laid off at our restaurants in anticipation of resuming dine-in service, (ii)restoring corporate personnel and executive salaries and (iii) paying prior salary reductions.
 
We do not believe COVID-19 has had a material adverse effect on our access to supplies or labor, although there can be no assurance that there will not be a significant adverse impact on our supply chain or access to labor in the future. We are actively monitoring our food suppliers to assess how they are managing their operations to mitigate supply flow and food safety risks. To ensure we mitigate potential supply availability risk, we are building additional inventory back stock levels when appropriate and we have also identified alternative supply sources in key product categories including but not limited to food, sanitation and safety supplies.

Additional information regarding the impact of COVID-19 on our business and the CARES Act is set forth within this Part I, Part II Item 1A. Risk Factors, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
History and Development of Our Business
 
We were incorporated in Florida in 1959 and commenced operating as a chain of small cocktail lounges and package liquor stores throughout South Florida. By 1970, we had established a chain of "Big Daddy's" lounges and package liquor stores between Vero Beach and Homestead, Florida. From 1970 to 1979, we expanded our package liquor store and lounge operations throughout Florida and opened clubs in five other "Sun Belt" states. In 1975, we discontinued most of our package store operations in Florida except in the South Florida areas of Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach and Monroe Counties. In 1982, we expanded our club operations into the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania area as general partner of several limited partnerships we organized. In March 1985, we began franchising package liquor stores and lounges in the South Florida area. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements and the discussion of franchised units on page 4.
 
During our fiscal year 1987, we began renovating our lounges to provide full restaurant food service, and subsequently renovated and added food service to most of our lounges. Food sales currently represent approximately 81.1% and bar sales approximately 18.9% of our total restaurant sales.
 
Our package liquor stores emphasize high volume business by providing customers with a wide variety of brand name and private label merchandise at discount prices. Our restaurants offer alcoholic beverages and full food service with abundant portions and reasonable prices, served in a relaxed, friendly and casual atmosphere.
 
We conduct our operations directly and through a number of limited partnerships and wholly owned subsidiaries, all of which are listed below. Our subsidiaries and the limited partnerships, (except for the limited partnership, where we are not the general partner, which owns and operates our franchised restaurant in Fort Lauderdale, Florida) are reported on a consolidated basis.

Package Liquor Store Operations
 
Our package liquor stores emphasize high volume business by providing customers with a wide selection of brand name and private label liquors, beers and wines while offering competitive pricing by meeting the published sales prices of our competitors. We provide sales training to our package liquor store personnel. The stores are open for business seven days a week from 9:00-10:00 a.m. to 9:00-10:00 p.m., depending upon demand and local law. Most of our units have "night windows" with extended evening hours.
Company-Owned Package Liquor Stores. We own and operate nine package liquor stores in the South Florida area under the name “Big Daddy’s Liquors”, two of which are jointly operated with restaurants we own.
Franchised Package Liquor Stores. We currently franchise three package liquor stores, all in the South Florida area, all of which are operated under the name “Big Daddy’s Liquors”. Of the three franchised package liquor stores, two are jointly operated with our franchisee’s restaurant operations and one is operated in a freestanding building adjacent to the franchisee’s restaurant operation. Two of the three remaining franchised package liquor stores are franchised to members of the family of our Chairman of the Board, officers and/or directors. We have not entered into a franchise arrangement for either a package liquor store, restaurant or combination package liquor store/restaurant since 1986 and do not anticipate that we will do so in the foreseeable future.
 
Generally, a franchise agreement with our franchisees for the operation of a package liquor store runs for the balance of the term of the franchisee’s lease for the business premises, extended by the franchisee’s continued occupancy of the business premises thereafter, whether by lease or ownership. In exchange for our providing management and related services to the franchisee and our granting the right to the franchisee to use our service mark, “Big Daddy’s Liquors”, franchisees of package liquor stores pay us weekly in arrears, (i) a royalty equal to approximately 1% of gross sales; plus (ii) an amount for advertising equal to between 1-1/2% to 3% of gross sales generated at the stores depending upon our actual advertising costs.
 
Restaurant Operations
 
Our restaurants provide a neighborhood casual, standardized dining experience, typical of casual restaurant chains. The interior decor of the restaurants is nautical with numerous fishing and boating pictures and decorations. The restaurants are designed to permit minor modifications without significant capital expenditures. However, from time to time we are required to redesign and refurbish the restaurants at significant cost. Drink prices may vary between locations to meet local conditions. Food prices are substantially standardized for all restaurants. The restaurants' hours of operation are from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00-5:00 a.m. depending upon demand and local law.

Company-Owned Restaurants. We own and operate nine restaurants all under our service mark “Flanigan’s Seafood Bar and Grill” two of which are jointly operated with package liquor stores we own. One additional combination package liquor store and restaurant located at 2505 N. University Drive, Hollywood, Florida (Store #19) has been closed since October 2018 due to fire damage.
 
Franchised Restaurants. We franchise five restaurants, all of which operate under our service mark “Flanigan’s Seafood Bar and Grill”, two of which operate as a restaurant only, two of which operate jointly with a franchisee operated “Big Daddy’s Liquors” package liquor store and one of which operates adjacent to a “Big Daddy’s Liquors” package liquor store.
 
Generally, a franchise agreement with our franchisees for the operation of a restaurant runs for the balance of the term of the franchisee’s lease for the business premises, extended by the franchisee’s continued occupancy of the business premises thereafter, whether by lease or ownership. In exchange for our providing management and related services to the franchisee and our granting the right to the franchisee to use our service mark, “Flanigan’s Seafood Bar and Grill”, our franchisees pay us weekly in arrears, (i) a royalty equal to approximately 3% of gross sales; plus (ii) an amount for advertising equal to between 1-1/2% to 3% of gross sales from the restaurants depending upon our actual advertising costs.
 
For accounting purposes, we do not consolidate the revenue and expenses of our franchisees’ operations with our revenue and expenses. Franchise royalties we receive are “earned” when sales are made by franchisees.
 
Restaurants Owned by Affiliated Limited Partnerships
 
We have invested along with others, (some of whom are or are affiliated with our officers and directors), in nine limited partnerships which currently own and operate nine South Florida based restaurants under our service mark “Flanigan’s Seafood Bar and Grill”. In addition to being a limited partner in these limited partnerships, we are the sole general partner of eight of these limited partnerships and manage and control the operations of these restaurants. We are only a limited partner in the limited partnership which owns and operates the restaurant located in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. We are currently developing a “Flanigan’s Seafood Bar and Grill” restaurant in Sunrise, Florida which will be owned by a limited partnership using the same or substantially similar financial arrangement and of which we will be the sole general partner and may invest as a limited partner.
 
Generally, the terms of the limited partnership agreements provide that until the investors’ cash investment in a limited partnership (including any cash invested by us) is returned in full, (available cash is distributed to the investors pro-rata based on ownership interest), the limited partnership distributes to the investors annually out of available cash from the operation of the restaurant, as a return of capital, up to 25% of the cash invested in the limited partnership, with no management fee paid to us. Any available cash in excess of the 25% of the cash invested in the limited partnership distributed to the investors annually, is paid one-half (½) to us as a management fee and one-half (½) to the investors, (including us), pro-rata based on the investors’ investment, as a return of capital. Once all of the investors, (including us), have received, in full, amounts equal to their cash invested, an annual management fee becomes payable to us equal to one-half (½) of cash available to be distributed, with the other one-half (½) of available cash distributed to the investors (including us), as a profit distribution, pro-rata based on the investors’ investment. As of October 3, 2020, all eight (8) limited partnerships where we are the general partner and are eligible to receive a management fee, have returned to their respective investors all cash invested and we receive an annual management fee equal to one-half (½) of the cash available for distribution by these limited partnerships. In addition to our receipt of distributable amounts from the limited partnerships, we receive a fee equal to 3% of gross sales for use of our “Flanigan’s Seafood Bar and Grill” service mark, which use is authorized while we act as general partner only. This 3% fee is “earned” when sales are made by the limited partnerships and is paid weekly, in arrears. Whether we will have any additional restaurants under development in the future will be dependent, among other things, on market conditions and our ability to raise capital. We anticipate that we will continue to form limited partnerships to raise funds to own and operate restaurants under our service mark “Flanigan’s Seafood Bar and Grill” using the same or substantially similar financial arrangements.

During the third quarter of our fiscal year 2019, we assigned the Sunrise Lease Agreement to a newly formed limited partnership in which we currently are (i) the sole general partner; and (ii) our wholly owned subsidiary is the sole limited partner. While there can be no assurances that we will be successful in doing so, we intend to sell limited partnership interests to third parties as well as affiliates of the Company in order to raise net proceeds, in the amount of $5,000,000, which proceeds will be used to renovate this potential restaurant location. We anticipate that the new restaurant location’s ownership and operating structure will be substantially similar to that of our other restaurants owned by limited partnerships.

This limited partnership has returned to its investors all cash invested, but since we are not the general partner of this limited partnership, we do not receive an annual management fee. We have a franchise arrangement with this limited partnership and for accounting purposes, we do not consolidate the operations of this limited partnership into our operations.

Management Agreement for “The Whale’s Rib” Restaurant
 
Since January 2006, we have managed “The Whale’s Rib”, a casual dining restaurant located in Deerfield Beach, Florida, pursuant to a management agreement. We paid $500,000 in exchange for our rights to manage this restaurant. The restaurant is owned by a third party unaffiliated with us. In exchange for providing management, bookkeeping and related services, we receive one-half (½) of the net profit, if any, from the operation of the restaurant. For our fiscal years ended October 3, 2020 and September 28, 2019, we generated $150,000 and $375,000 of revenue, respectively from providing these management services.
Operations and Management
 
We emphasize systematic operations and control of all package liquor stores and restaurants regardless of whether we own, franchise or manage the unit. Each unit has its own manager who is responsible for monitoring inventory levels, supervising sales personnel, food preparation and service in restaurants and generally assuring that the unit is managed in accordance with our guidelines and procedures. We have in effect an incentive cash bonus program for our managers and salespersons based upon various performance criteria. Our operations are supervised by supervisors, who visit units to provide on-site management and support. There are three supervisors responsible for package liquor store operations and five supervisors responsible for restaurant operations.
 
All of our managers and salespersons receive extensive training in sales techniques. We arrange for independent third parties, or "shoppers", to inspect each unit in order to evaluate the unit's operations, including the handling of cash transactions.
 
Purchasing and Inventory
 
The package liquor business requires a constant substantial capital investment in inventory in the units. Our inventory consists primarily of liquor and wine products and as such, does not become excessive or obsolete that would require identifying and recording of the same. Liquor inventory purchased can normally be returned only if defective or broken.
 
All of our purchases of liquor inventory are made through our purchasing department from our corporate headquarters. The major portion of inventory is purchased under individual purchase orders with licensed wholesalers and distributors who deliver the merchandise within one or two days of the placing of an order. Frequently there is only one wholesaler in the immediate marketing area with an exclusive distributorship of certain liquor product lines. Substantially all of our liquor inventory is shipped by the wholesalers or distributors directly to our stores. We significantly increase our inventory prior to Christmas, New Year's Eve and other holidays. Under Florida law, we are required to pay for our liquor purchases within ten days of delivery.
 
Negotiations with food suppliers are conducted by our purchasing department at our corporate headquarters. We believe this ensures that the best quality and prices will be available to each restaurant. Orders for food products are prepared by each restaurant's kitchen manager and reviewed by the restaurant's general manager before orders are placed. Food is delivered by the supplier directly to each restaurant. Orders are placed several times a week to ensure product freshness. Food inventory is primarily paid for monthly.
 
Government Regulation
 
Our operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws affecting our business. In particular, our operations are subject to regulation by federal agencies and to licensing and regulation by state and local health, sanitation, alcoholic beverage control, safety and fire department agencies in the state or municipality where our units are located.
 
8

Alcoholic beverage control regulations require each of our restaurants and package liquor stores to obtain a license to sell alcoholic beverages from a state authority and in certain locations, county and municipal authorities.
 
In Florida, where all of our restaurants and package liquor stores are located, most of our liquor licenses are issued on a "quota license" basis. Quota licenses are issued on the basis of a population count established from time to time under the latest applicable census. Because the total number of liquor licenses available under a quota license system is limited and restrictions are placed upon their transfer, the licenses have purchase and resale value based upon supply and demand in the particular areas in which they are issued. The quota licenses held by us allow the sale of liquor for on and off premises consumption. The other liquor licenses held by us or limited partnerships of which we are the general partner, are restaurant liquor licenses, which do not have quota restrictions or purchase or resale value. A restaurant liquor license is issued to every applicant who meets all of the state and local licensing requirements, including, but not limited to zoning and minimum restaurant size, seating and menu. The restaurant liquor licenses held by us allow the sale of liquor for on premises consumption only.
 
All licenses must be renewed annually and may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time. Suspension or revocation may result from violation by the licensee or its employees of any federal, state or local law regulation pertaining to alcoholic beverage control. Alcoholic beverage control regulations relate to numerous aspects of the daily operations of our units, including, minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operations, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventory control, handling, storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages, internal control and accounting.
 
As the sale of alcoholic beverages constitutes a large share of our revenue, the failure to receive or retain, or a delay in obtaining a liquor license in a particular location could adversely affect our operations in that location and could impair our ability to obtain licenses elsewhere.
 
During our fiscal years 2020 and 2019, no significant pending matters have been initiated concerning any of our licenses which might be expected to result in a revocation of a liquor license or other significant actions against us.
 
We are subject to “dram-shop” statutes due to our restaurant operations. These statutes generally provide a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated individual. We carry liquor liability coverage as part of our existing comprehensive general liability insurance, which we believe is consistent with coverage carried by other entities in the restaurant industry. Although we are covered by insurance, a judgment against us under a dram-shop statute in excess of our liability coverage could have a material adverse effect on us.
 
Our operations are also subject to federal and state laws governing such matters as wages, working conditions, citizenship requirements and overtime. Significant numbers of hourly personnel at our restaurants are paid at rates related to the federal or Florida minimum wage, whichever is higher, and accordingly, increases in the minimum wage will increase labor costs. We are also subject to the Americans with Disability Act of 1990 (ADA), which, among other things, may require certain renovations to our restaurants to meet federally mandated requirements. The cost of any such renovations is not expected to materially affect us.
 
We are not aware of any statute, ordinance, rule or regulation under present consideration which would significantly limit or restrict our business as now conducted. However, in view of the number of jurisdictions in which we conduct business, and the highly regulated nature of the liquor business, there can be no assurance that additional limitations may not be imposed in the future, even though none are presently anticipated.

Coronavirus Pandemic 
 
In March 2020, a novel strain of coronavirus was declared a global pandemic and a National Public Health Emergency. The novel coronavirus pandemic and related “shelter-in-place” orders and other governmental mandates relating thereto (collectively, “COVID-19”) adversely affected and will, in all likelihood continue to adversely affect, our restaurant operations and financial results for the foreseeable future. Due to COVID-19, from mid-March 2020 through mid-May 2020, we ceased all dining and bar services at all of our restaurants, limiting service to take-out and delivery only of food, and implemented reduced hours at our retail package liquor stores. From mid-May 2020 through the beginning of July 2020, there was a gradual elimination of restrictions on our restaurant operations, permitting us to, among other things, provide dining for outdoor seating patrons with appropriate social distancing and provide dining for indoor patrons at up to 50% capacity (depending on the location of the restaurant), but with no bar service and increased operating hours at our package liquor stores. From the beginning of July 2020 through the beginning of September 2020, we ceased dine-in service at all of our Miami-Dade County, Florida restaurants, (two Company-owned and six limited partnership owned restaurants). Since the beginning of September 2020, we have been offering both food and bar options at all of our restaurants, including those located in Miami-Dade County, Florida, with appropriate social distancing and dine-in service at up to 100% capacity, including outdoor seating.
 
Due to COVID-19, we implemented (i) certain cost cutting measures including material layoffs at our restaurants and reduced corporate personnel salaries; and (ii) a number of changes to our operations such as the establishment of an in-house delivery service and an adjustment to our traditional staffing model to meet customer demand. We have been in regular contact with our suppliers and while to date we have not experienced significant disruptions in our supply chain, we could see future disruptions should the impacts of COVID-19 extend for a considerable amount of time. To support our employees, we have implemented work from home support, increased sanitization of high touch, high traffic areas in our restaurants, retail package liquor stores and corporate offices, provided personal protective equipment for our employees and increased the frequency of personal hygiene practices. From March 29, 2020 through May 9, 2020, the salaries of all our non-executive corporate office personnel were reduced by 20%, the base salaries of our Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer were each reduced by 50% and our Chief Executive Officer waived his base salary, representing salary savings of approximately $135,000 during this period. Our employee headcount as of fiscal year end 2020 was 1,804 persons reduced from 1,870 persons as of our fiscal year end 2019.
 
In addition and also due to COVID-19, we did not make any quarterly distributions to our limited partners for the quarter ended March 31, 2020. For each of the quarters ended June 30, 2020 and September 30, 2020, we made quarterly distributions to our limited partners equal to one-half (½) of the amounts that would have been distributed for the quarter ended March 31, 2020.
 
During the third quarter of fiscal year end 2020, the United States government passed a $2.0 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) designed primarily to help keep businesses running during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act included provisions for certain deductions and tax credits, filing deadline extensions, filing payment deadlines and making available certain grant money to assist businesses. This CARES ACT allowed us to take advantage of credits, deferments, and deductions, and PPP Loans (described below) during the third quarter of our fiscal year 2020. As a result, during the third and fourth quarter of 2020, we reversed certain of our cost cutting measures, including (i) reinstating employees laid off at our restaurants in anticipation of resuming dine-in service, (ii) restoring corporate personnel and executive salaries and (iii) paying prior salary reductions.
 
During the third quarter of our fiscal year 2020, we, certain of the entities owning the limited partnership stores (the “LP’s”), franchised stores (the “Franchisees”) as well as the store we manage but do not own (the “Managed Store”), (collectively, the “Borrowers”), applied for and received loans from an unrelated third party lender pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP”) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) enacted March 27, 2020, in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $13.1 million, (the “PPP Loans”), of which approximately: (i) $5.9 million was loaned to us; (ii) $4.1 million was loaned to 8 of the LP’s; (iii) $2.6 million was loaned to 5 of the Franchisees; and (iv) $0.5 million was loaned to the Managed Store. The PPP Loans to the Franchisees and the Managed Store are not included in our consolidated financial statements. Due to our receipt of the PPP Loans, we reversed certain cost cutting measures, including reinstating employees laid off at our restaurants in anticipation of resuming dine-in service and restoring corporate personnel salaries.

The PPP Loans, which are in the form of Notes issued by each of the Borrowers, mature two years from the date of funding (dates ranging from May 5, 2022 to May 11, 2022) and bear interest at a rate of 1.00% per annum, payable monthly commencing approximately six months from the date of issuance of the Notes (issuance dates ranging from April 30, 2020 to May 6, 2020). The Notes may be prepaid by the applicable Borrower at any time prior to maturity with no prepayment penalties. Proceeds from the PPP Loans have been used and are available to the respective Borrower to fund designated expenses, including certain payroll costs, group health care benefits and other permitted expenses, including rent and interest on mortgages and other debt obligations incurred before February 15, 2020. Under the terms of the PPP, up to the entire amount of principal and accrued interest may be forgiven to the extent the proceeds of the PPP Loans are used for qualifying expenses as described in the CARES Act and applicable implementing guidance issued by the U.S. Small Business Administration under the PPP. No assurance can be given that the Borrowers will obtain forgiveness of the PPP Loans in whole or in part.
 With respect to any portion of any of the PPP Loans that is not forgiven under the terms of the PPP, such amounts will be subject to customary provisions for a loan of this type, including customary events of default relating to, among other things, payment defaults, breaches of the provisions of the applicable PPP Note and cross-defaults on any other loan with the Lender or other creditors.
 
We do not believe COVID-19 has had a material adverse effect on our access to supplies or labor, although there can be no assurance that there will not be a significant adverse impact on our supply chain or access to labor in the future. We are actively monitoring our food suppliers to assess how they are managing their operations to mitigate supply flow and food safety risks. To ensure we mitigate potential supply availability risk, we are building additional inventory back stock levels when appropriate and we have also identified alternative supply sources in key product categories including but not limited to food, sanitation and safety supplies.
 
Prior to obtaining the PPP Loans, we were in compliance with the financial covenants contained in our loans with our unrelated third party institutional lender (the “Institutional Lender”) under which as of October 3, 2020, we owe in the aggregate, approximately $12,209,000 (the “Institutional Loans”). We determined that as of the end of the third quarter of our fiscal year 2020, we were not in compliance with our financial covenants contained in the Institutional Loans related to the Rent Adjusted Funded Debt to EBITDA Ratio because our consolidated debt during the third quarter of our fiscal year 2020 increased due to our repayment obligations under the PPP Loans (the “Covenant Breach’). Pursuant to the terms of the Institutional Loans, the Covenant Breach, grants the Institutional Lender the right to exercise certain remedies under the Institutional Loans, including the right to accelerate the indebtedness owed by us to the Institutional Lender thereunder. On August 10, 2020, we received a written waiver of the Covenant Breach from the Institutional Lender, which, among other things, waives the Covenant Breach through June 30, 2021. As of October 3, 2020, we are in compliance with the financial covenants contained in our loans with our Institutional Lender.
 
There can be no assurances that we will be in compliance with our financial covenants thereafter due to, among other things, that our results of operations will likely continue to be materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Absent a waiver, failure to be in compliance with our financial covenants would constitute a default under the Institutional Loans with our Institutional Lender when reported. Such a default, if not cured or waived, would allow the Institutional Lender to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness we owe under the Institutional Loans, making it due and payable at the time. If maturity of the Institutional Loans were accelerated, it would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements and results of operations.

General Liability Insurance
 
We have general liability insurance which incorporates a deductible of $10,000 per occurrence for both us and the limited partnerships. Our insurance carrier is responsible for $1,000,000 coverage per occurrence above our deductible, up to a maximum aggregate of $2,000,000 per year. During our fiscal year 2020, we were able to purchase excess liability insurance at a reasonable premium, whereby our excess insurance carrier is responsible for $10,000,000 coverage above our primary general liability insurance coverage. We are uninsured against liability claims in excess of $11,000,000 per occurrence and in the aggregate. Subsequent to the end of our fiscal year 2020, we secured general liability and excess liability insurance for the period commencing after the expiration of the current policies on December 30, 2020.
 
Our general policy is to settle only those legitimate and reasonable claims asserted and to aggressively defend and go to trial, if necessary, on frivolous and unreasonable claims. Under our current liability insurance policy, certain expenses incurred in defending a claim, including attorney's fees, are a part of our $10,000 deductible.
 
In accordance with accounting guidance, we accrue for any liability by recognizing costs when it is probable that a covered liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated. Accordingly, our annual insurance costs may be subject to adjustment from previous estimates as facts and circumstances change. Our accruals are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in the caption "Accounts payable and accrued expenses". A significant unfavorable judgment or settlement against us in excess of our liability insurance coverage could have a materially adverse effect on the Company.
 
Property Insurance; Windstorm Insurance; Deductibles
 
For the policy year beginning December 30, 2019, our property insurance is a one (1) year policy with an unaffiliated third party insurance carrier, including coverage for properties leased by us and our consolidated limited partnerships, and provides for full insurance coverage for property losses, including those caused by windstorm, such as a hurricane. For property losses caused by windstorm, the property insurance has a fixed deductible of $100,000, plus 5% of all insured losses, per occurrence. For all other property losses, the property insurance has deductibles of $10,000 per location, per occurrence. Subsequent to the end of our fiscal year 2020, we secured property insurance for the period commencing after the expiration of the current policy on December 30, 2020.
 
Competition and the Company's Market
 
The liquor and hospitality industries are highly competitive and are often affected by changes in taste and entertainment trends among the public, by local, national and economic conditions affecting spending habits, and by population and traffic patterns. We believe that the principal means of competition among package liquor stores is price and that, in general, the principal means of competition among restaurants include the location, type and quality of facilities and the type, quality and price of beverage and food served.

Our package liquor stores compete directly or indirectly with local retailers and discount "superstores". Due to the competitive nature of the liquor industry in South Florida, we have had to adjust our pricing to stay competitive, including meeting all competitors’ advertisements. Such practices will continue in the package liquor business. We believe that we have a competitive position in our market because of widespread consumer recognition of the "Big Daddy's Liquors" name.
 
Our restaurants compete directly or indirectly with many well-established competitors, both nationally and locally owned. In June 2019, we increased certain menu prices for our bar offerings to target an increase to our total bar revenues of approximately 6.2% annually and we also increased certain restaurant menu prices for our food offerings to target an increase to our total food revenues of approximately 3.4% annually. We believe that we have a competitive position in our market because of widespread consumer recognition of the "Flanigan’s Seafood Bar and Grill" name.
 
We have many well-established competitors, both nationally and locally owned, with substantially greater financial resources than we do. Their resources and market presence may provide advantages in marketing, purchasing and negotiating leases. We compete with other restaurant and retail establishments for sites and finding management personnel.
 
Our business is subject to seasonal effects, including that liquor purchases tend to increase during the holiday seasons.
 
Trade Names
 
We operate our package liquor stores and restaurants under two service marks; "Big Daddy's Liquors" and "Flanigan's Seafood Bar and Grill", both of which are federally registered trademarks owned by us. Our right to the use of the "Big Daddy's" service mark is set forth under a consent decree of a federal court entered into by us in settlement of federal trademark litigation. The consent decree and the settlement agreement allow us to continue to use and to expand our use of the "Big Daddy's” service mark in connection with our package liquor sales in Florida, while restricting future liquor sales in Florida under the "Big Daddy's" name by the other party who has a federally registered service mark for "Big Daddy's" use in the restaurant business. The federal court retained jurisdiction to enforce the consent decree. We have acquired registered Federal trademarks on the principal register for our "Flanigan's" and “Flanigan’s Seafood Bar and Grill” service marks.
 
The standard symbolic trademark associated with our facilities and operations is the bearded face and head of "Big Daddy" which is predominantly displayed at all "Flanigan's" facilities and all "Big Daddy's" facilities throughout the country. The face comprising this trademark is that of the Company’s founder, Joseph "Big Daddy" Flanigan, and is a federally registered trademark owned by us.
 
Employees
 
As of our fiscal year end 2020, we employed 1,804 persons, of which 952 were full-time and 852 were part-time. Of these, 51 were employed at our corporate offices in administrative capacities and 13 were employed in maintenance. Of the remaining employees, 65 were employed in our package liquor stores and 1,675 in our restaurants.
 
None of our employees are represented by collective bargaining organizations. We consider our labor relations to be favorable.
