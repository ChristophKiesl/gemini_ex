ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
CORPORATE HISTORY
 
Chun Can Capital Group (formerly CinTel Corp. and before that, Link2 Technologies) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on August 16, 1996. The initial business focus was to develop a 3D animation and digital effects studio that would provide high-end 3D animation and digital effects to the music video industry.
 
On September 30, 2003, Link2 Technologies entered into a definitive Share Exchange Agreement with CinTel Co., Ltd., a Korean corporation ("CinTel Korea") and the shareholders of CinTel Korea. Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of CinTel Korea in exchange for 16,683,300 shares of our common stock. CinTel Korea was founded in 1997 and has provided various Internet Traffic Management solutions to businesses and consumers. All of the business operations were comprised of developing, manufacturing and distributing Internet Traffic Management solutions to businesses and consumers in order to manage and control large traffic.
 
CinTel Korea introduced Korea's first dynamic server load balancer, and marketed Internet Traffic Management products since its inception, such as the PacketCruz (TM) family of products, iCache, i2one, and Proximator. The Internet Traffic Management solutions were marketed to customers around the world, helping them improve Internet traffic management, service levels (QOS: Quality of Service), and the user experience (QOC: Quality of Content).
 
From 2006 to 2011, we shifted our focus from Internet Traffic Management to becoming a semiconductor and LCD assembly holding company. The company's focus has included investments in several high growth subsidiaries and divesting some non-performing subsidiaries.
 
Until December 31, 2009, the Company's operations were conducted through its subsidiaries, Phoenix Digital Tech ("PDT"), Phoenix Semiconductor Telecommunication Suzhou ("PSTS"), and  Bluecomm and its indirect subsidiary BKLCD. Upon transfer of the shares of its operating subsidiaries, the company has no current operations. The Company maintains a 19% interest in PSTS and 2.1% interest in PDT.
 
The Company's principal business objective for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate, short-term earnings. The Company will not restrict its potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of business.
 
The analysis of new business opportunities has and will be undertaken by or under the supervision of the officers and directors of the Company. The Company has unrestricted flexibility in seeking, analyzing and participating in potential business opportunities. In its efforts to analyze potential acquisition targets, the Company will consider the following kinds of factors:
 
(a) 

Potential for growth, indicated by new technology, anticipated market expansion or new products;

(b) 

Competitive position as compared to other firms of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the industry as a whole; 
 
(c) 

Strength and diversity of management, either in place or scheduled for recruitment; 
 
(d) 

Capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds, to be provided by the Company or from operations, through the sale of additional securities, through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources; 
 
(e) 

The cost of participation by the Company as compared to the perceived tangible and intangible values and potentials; 
 
(f) 

The extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced; 
 
(g) 

The accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, raw materials, services, professional assistance and other required items; and 
 
(h) 

Other relevant factors. 
 
In applying the foregoing criteria, no one of which will be controlling, management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data. Potentially available business opportunities may occur in many different industries, and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. Due to the Company's limited capital available for investigation, the Company may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the opportunity to be acquired.
 
Form of Acquisition
 
The manner in which the Company participates in an opportunity will depend upon the nature of the opportunity, the respective needs and desires of the Company and the promoters of the opportunity, and the relative negotiating strength of the Company and such promoters.
 
It is likely that the Company will acquire its participation in a business opportunity through the issuance of common stock or other securities of the Company. Although the terms of any such transaction cannot be predicted, it should be noted that in certain circumstances the criteria for determining whether or not an acquisition is a so-called "tax free" reorganization under Section 368(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), depends upon whether the owners of the acquired business own 80% or more of the voting stock of the surviving entity. If a transaction were structured to take advantage of these provisions rather than other "tax free" provisions provided under the Code, all prior stockholders would in such circumstances retain 20% or less of the total issued and outstanding shares. Under other circumstances, depending upon the relative negotiating strength of the parties, prior stockholders may retain substantially less than 20% of the total issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity. This could result in substantial additional dilution to the equity of those who were stockholders of the Company prior to such reorganization.
 
The present stockholders of the Company will likely not have control of a majority of the voting shares of the Company following a reorganization transaction. As part of such a transaction, all or a majority of the Company's directors may resign and new directors may be appointed without any vote by stockholders.
 
In the case of an acquisition, the transaction may be accomplished upon the sole determination of management without any vote or approval by stockholders. In the case of a statutory merger or consolidation directly involving the Company, it will likely be necessary to call a stockholders' meeting and obtain the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares. The necessity to obtain such stockholder approval may result in delay and additional expense in the consummation of any proposed transaction and will also give rise to certain appraisal rights to dissenting stockholders. Most likely, management will seek to structure any such transaction so as not to require stockholder approval.
 
It is anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial cost for accountants, attorneys and others. If a decision is made not to participate in a specific business opportunity, the costs theretofore incurred in the related investigation would not be recoverable. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached for the participation in a specific business opportunity, the failure to consummate that transaction may result in the loss to the Company of the related costs incurred.
