ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 Unless the context otherwise requires or indicates, all references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to “Arlington Asset” refer to Arlington Asset Investment Corp., and all references to “we,” “us,” “our,” and the “Company,” refer to Arlington Asset Investment Corp. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
 Our Company
 We are an investment firm that focuses primarily on investing in mortgage related assets and residential real estate.  Our investment capital is currently allocated between the following asset classes:

• | agency mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”)
--+------------------------------------------


• | mortgage servicing right (“MSR”) related assets
--+------------------------------------------------


• | credit investments
--+-------------------


• | single-family residential (“SFR”) properties
--+---------------------------------------------

 Our agency MBS consist of residential mortgage pass-through certificates for which the principal and interest payments are guaranteed by a U.S. government sponsored enterprise (“GSE”), such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  Our MSR related assets represent investments for which the return is based on the economic performance of a pool of specific MSRs.  Our credit investments generally include investments in mortgage loans secured by either residential or commercial real property or MBS collateralized by residential or commercial mortgage loans (“non-agency MBS”) or asset-backed securities (“ABS”) collateralized by residential solar panel loans.  Our SFR investment strategy is to acquire, lease and operate single-family residential homes as rental properties.
 During 2021, we continued a process of identifying and evaluating various investment strategies to diversify into other asset classes that could complement our historical focus of levered agency MBS investing.  During 2021, we expanded or established new investment channels that allow us to allocate capital into MSR related assets, SFR rental properties and selective credit opportunities that should complement our existing agency MBS strategy, diversify risk and improve the level and reliability of returns over time.  
 We are a Virginia corporation that was incorporated on November 10, 1997. We are internally managed and do not have an external investment advisor. We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”).  As a REIT, we are required to distribute annually 90% of our REIT taxable income (subject to certain adjustments).  So long as we continue to qualify as a REIT, we will generally not be subject to U.S. federal or state corporate income taxes on our taxable income that we distribute to our shareholders on a timely basis.  At present, it is our intention to distribute 100% of our taxable income, although we will not be required to do so. We intend to make distributions of our taxable income within the time limits prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code, which may extend into the subsequent taxable year. 
 Investment Portfolio
 We manage our investment portfolio with the goal of obtaining a high risk-adjusted return on capital. We evaluate the rates of return that can be achieved in each asset class and for each individual investment within an asset class in which we invest. We then evaluate opportunities against the returns available in each of our investment alternatives and attempt to allocate our assets and capital with an emphasis toward what we believe to be the highest risk-adjusted return available. We expect this strategy will cause us to have different allocations of capital and leverage in different market environments.  In addition, we also may pursue other business activities that would utilize our experience in analyzing investment opportunities and applying similar portfolio management skills. However, investing in other asset classes or pursuing other business activities may be limited by our desire to continue to qualify as a REIT. We may change our investment strategy at any time without the consent of our shareholders; accordingly, in the future, we could make investments or enter into hedging transactions that are different from, and possibly riskier than, the investments and associated hedging transactions described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 The following tables summarize our invested asset and capital allocation of our investment strategies as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively (dollars in thousands):

 Agency MBS
 Agency MBS consist of residential pass-through certificates that are securities representing undivided interests in “pools” of mortgage loans secured by residential real property. The monthly payments of both principal and interest of the securities are guaranteed by a U.S. government agency or GSE to holders of the securities, in effect “passing through” the monthly payments made by the individual borrowers on the mortgage loans that underlie the securities plus “guarantee payments” made in the event of any defaults on such mortgage loans, net of fees paid to the issuer/guarantor and servicers of the underlying mortgage loans, to the holders of the securities. Mortgage pass-through certificates distribute cash flows from the underlying collateral on a pro rata basis among the holders of the securities. Although the principal and interest payments are guaranteed by a U.S. government agency or GSE to the security holder, the market value of the agency MBS is not guaranteed by a U.S. government agency or GSE.
 The agency MBS in which we primarily invest are issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are stockholder-owned corporations chartered by Congress with a public mission to provide liquidity, stability, and affordability to the U.S. housing market. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are currently regulated by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (“FHFA”), the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”), the SEC, and the U.S. Department of the Treasury (“U.S. Treasury”) and are currently operating under the conservatorship of the FHFA. The U.S. Treasury has agreed to support the continuing operations of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with any necessary capital contributions while in conservatorship. However, the U.S. government does not guarantee the securities, or other obligations, of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.  
 We also may invest in agency MBS issued by the Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”). Ginnie Mae is a wholly-owned corporate instrumentality of the United States within HUD. Ginnie Mae guarantees the timely payment of the principal and interest on certificates that represent an interest in a pool of mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration ("FHA"), or partially guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs and other loans eligible for inclusion in mortgage pools underlying Ginnie Mae certificates. Section 306(g) of the Housing Act provides that the full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to the payment of all amounts which may be required to be paid under any guaranty by Ginnie Mae. 
Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae operate in the secondary mortgage market. They provide funds to the mortgage market by purchasing residential mortgages from primary mortgage market institutions, such as commercial banks, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking companies, seller/servicers, securities dealers and other investors. Through the mortgage securitization process, they package mortgage loans into guaranteed MBS for sale to investors, such as us, in the form of pass-through certificates and guarantee the payment of principal and interest on the securities or on the underlying loans held within the securitization trust in exchange for guarantee fees. The underlying loans of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac agency MBS must meet certain underwriting standards established by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (referred to as “conforming loans”) and may be fixed or adjustable rate loans with original terms to maturity generally up to 30 years.
 Agency MBS differ from other forms of traditional fixed-income securities which normally provide for periodic payments of interest in fixed amounts with principal payments at maturity. Instead, agency MBS provide for a monthly payment that consists of both interest and principal. In addition, outstanding principal on the agency MBS may be prepaid, without penalty, at par at any time due to prepayments on the underlying mortgage loans. These differences can result in significantly greater price and yield volatility than is the case with more traditional fixed-income securities.
 As of December 31, 2021, our agency MBS portfolio was comprised of securities collateralized by pools of fixed-rate mortgages that have original terms to maturity of 30 years. In the future, we may also invest in agency MBS collateralized by adjustable-rate mortgage loans (“ARMs”), hybrid ARMs, or loans with original terms to maturity of 15 or 20 years.
 2

We purchase agency MBS either in initial offerings or in the secondary market through broker-dealers or similar entities. We may also utilize to-be-announced (“TBA”) forward contracts in order to invest in agency MBS or to hedge our investments. A TBA security is a forward contract for the purchase or the sale of agency securities at a predetermined price, face amount, issuer, coupon and stated maturity on an agreed-upon future date, but the particular agency securities to be delivered are not identified until shortly before the TBA settlement date. We may also choose, prior to settlement, to move the settlement of these securities out to a later date by entering into an offsetting position (referred to as a “pair off”), net settling the paired off positions for cash, and simultaneously entering into a similar TBA contract for a later settlement date, which is commonly collectively referred to as a “dollar roll” transaction.
 Mortgage Servicing Right Related Assets
 An MSR provides a mortgage servicer with the right to service a pool of residential mortgage loans in exchange for a portion of the interest payments made on the underlying residential mortgage loans. This amount typically ranges from 25 to 50 basis points times the unpaid principal balance (“UPB”) of the residential mortgage loans, plus ancillary income and custodial interest. An MSR is made up of two components: a basic fee and an excess servicing spread. The basic fee is the amount of compensation for the performance of servicing duties (including advance obligations), and the excess servicing spread is the amount that exceeds the basic fee. Ownership of an MSR requires the owner to be a licensed mortgage servicer. An owner of an excess servicing spread is not required to be licensed, and is not required to assume any servicing duties, advance obligations or liabilities associated with the loan pool underlying the MSR unless otherwise specified through agreement.  
 We do not hold the requisite licenses to purchase or hold MSRs directly.  However, we have entered into agreements with a licensed, GSE approved residential mortgage loan servicer that enable us to garner the economic return of an investment in an MSR purchased by the mortgage servicing counterparty through an MSR financing transaction.  Under the terms of the arrangement, for an MSR acquired by the mortgage servicing counterparty (i) we purchase the excess servicing spread from the mortgage servicer counterparty, entitling us to monthly distributions of the servicing fees collected by the mortgage servicing counterparty in excess of 12.5 basis points per annum (and to distributions of corresponding proceeds of sale of the MSRs), and (ii) we fund the balance of the MSR purchase price to the parent company of the mortgage servicing counterparty and, in exchange, have an unsecured right to payment of certain amounts determined by reference to the MSR, generally equal to the servicing fee revenue less the excess servicing spread and the costs of servicing (and to distributions of corresponding proceeds of sale of the MSRs), net of fees earned by the mortgage servicing counterparty and its affiliates including an incentive fee equal to a percentage of the total return of the MSR in excess of a hurdle rate of return.  Under the arrangement, we are obligated to provide funds to the mortgage servicing counterparty to fund the counterparty’s advances of payments on the serviced pool of mortgage loans.  The mortgage servicing counterparty is required to return to us subsequent servicing advances collected from the underlying borrowers or reimbursed by the GSEs.  The mortgage servicing counterparty is entitled to reimbursement from the GSEs of any servicing advances that are not subsequently collected from the underlying borrowers. We have committed to invest a total minimum of $50,000 in capital with the counterparty with $25,000 of the minimum commitment expiring on December 31, 2023 and $25,000 of the minimum commitment expiring on April 1, 2024.
 The MSRs that underly our MSR related assets are comprised solely of residential mortgage loans guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.   We target pools of loans that are recently originated or have a low coupon that will generally exhibit a lower propensity for prepayment in a rising rate environment.  The MSRs underlying our MSR related assets are purchased by our mortgage servicing counterparty in either bulk purchases in the secondary market or through flow agreements with various loan originators.  
 Credit Investments
 Our targeted credit investments generally include the following:
  
• | mortgage loans secured by residential real property
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | mortgage loans secured by commercial real property
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | non-agency MBS collateralized by residential mortgage loans
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | non-agency MBS collateralized by commercial mortgage loans
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | ABS collateralized by solar panel loans
--+----------------------------------------

 The principal and interest of such credit investments are not guaranteed by a GSE or a U.S government agency.  Accordingly, these investments carry a significantly higher level of credit exposure relative to the credit exposure of agency MBS. The credit investments in which we may invest are generally non-investment grade or not rated by major rating agencies.  
 Residential Mortgage Loans
 Residential mortgage loans are secured by one to four family residential properties and are generally classified as being either a qualified or non-qualified mortgage.  A qualified mortgage is a mortgage that meets certain requirements for lender protection and 
 3

secondary trading under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“the Dodd-Frank Act”).  In general, a qualified mortgage (i) contains less risky loan features, such as interest-only periods, negative amortization or balloon payments, (ii) has debt-to-income ratio limits, (iii) has limits on origination points and fees, and (iv) has certain legal protections for lenders.   Qualified mortgages may or may not meet the underwriting standards of a U.S. government agency or GSE.  In general, non-qualified mortgage loans carry a higher credit risk than qualified mortgage loans.
Residential mortgage loans may also consist of either performing or distressed loans.  Performing residential mortgage loans are loans that are generally current and may consist of GSE eligible mortgage loans, non-qualified mortgage loans, or loans originally underwritten to GSE or another program’s guidelines but are either undeliverable to a GSE or ineligible for a program due to certain underwriting or compliance errors.  Distressed residential mortgage loans may include seasoned re-performing, non-performing and other delinquent mortgage loans that would generally be purchased at a discount to the principal amount outstanding.  
 Residential Business Purpose Loans
 Residential business purpose loans (“BPL”) are mortgage loans made to professional real estate investors secured by first lien positions in non-owner occupied residential real estate. Residential business purpose loans are used by the borrower to fund the acquisition, renovation, rehabilitation, development and/or improvement of a residential property for investment or sale.  The repayment of the mortgage loans is often largely based on the ability of the borrower to sell the mortgaged property or to convert the property for rental purposes and obtain refinancing in the form of a longer-term loan.  The loans generally consist of fixed-rate, short-term, interest-only mortgage loans with the full amount of principal due at maturity. Residential BPLs are also used to fund investments in single-family rental properties.  The repayment of loans for single-family rental properties are generally based upon the rental income received by the borrower or upon the sale of the property.
Commercial Mortgage Loans
 Commercial mortgage loans are secured by commercial real property such as office, retail, multifamily, industrial, hospitality or healthcare facilities.  The commercial mortgage loans in which we invest typically have a first lien in the underlying real property; however, we may also invest in loans that have a second lien or that are considered mezzanine loans. Commercial mortgage loans generally require the payment of interest monthly at a fixed-rate or floating rate based a benchmark such as LIBOR, SOFR or the prime rate plus a spread and generally mature between three and ten years and may require periodic principal amortization with a balloon principal payment at maturity.  Commercial mortgage loans typically have various covenants including financial covenants based on the performance of the property securing the loan.
Solar Panel Loans or ABS Collateralized by Solar Panel Loans
 Solar panel loans are sustainable home improvement loans primarily used to finance the acquisition and installation of solar panels and related energy storage systems and equipment in residential homes.  The loans are an obligation of the homeowner and are secured by the solar panels and related energy storage systems and equipment.  The loans generally bear interest at fixed rates and have maturities of up to 25 years.  The borrower may qualify for solar income tax credits for which the borrower is typically incentivized to use any proceeds towards the repayment of the outstanding principal balance of the solar panel loans.  Our investments in solar panel loans generally would not qualify as investments in real property or mortgages on real property.  Accordingly, our ability to invest in solar panel loans would be limited by our desire to qualify as a REIT.
 Non-agency MBS
 Our credit investments also include investments in securitization trusts not issued or guaranteed by a U.S. government agency or GSE that are collateralized by a pool of either residential or commercial mortgage loans, which we refer to as non-agency MBS.  In some instances, non-agency commercial MBS may be backed by a single mortgage loan secured by one or more commercial real properties. In addition, non-agency MBS also may include a re-securitization of MBS.
 Non-agency MBS are generally issued by a securitization trust referred to as either a Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduit (“REMIC”) or a grantor trust. The securitization trust will generally issue both senior and subordinated interests. Senior securities are those interests in a securitization that have the first right to cash flows and are last in line to absorb losses, and, therefore, have the least amount of credit risk in a securitization transaction. In general, most, if not all, principal collected from the underlying mortgage loan pool is used to pay down the senior securities until certain performance tests are satisfied. If certain performance tests are satisfied, principal payments are allocated, generally on a pro rata basis, between the senior securities and the subordinated securities. Conversely, the most subordinate securities are those interests in a securitization that have the last right to cash flows and are first in line to absorb losses. Subordinate securities absorb the initial credit losses from a securitization structure, thus protecting the senior securities. Subordinate securities generally receive interest payments even if they do not receive principal payments.
 Non-agency MBS may be supported by one or more forms of private (i.e., non-governmental) credit enhancement. These credit enhancements provide an extra layer of loss coverage in the event that losses are incurred upon foreclosure sales or other liquidations of underlying mortgaged properties in amounts that exceed the equity holder’s equity interest in the property. Forms of credit 
 4

enhancement include limited issuer guarantees, reserve funds, private mortgage guaranty pool insurance, overcollateralization and subordination. Subordination is a form of credit enhancement frequently used and involves the issuance of classes of MBS that are subordinate to senior class MBS and, accordingly, are the first to absorb credit losses realized on the underlying mortgage loans. In addition, non-agency MBS are generally purchased at a discount to par value, which may provide further protection to credit losses of the underlying mortgage loan collateral. 
 Single-Family Residential Rental Properties
 Our SFR investment strategy is to acquire, lease and operate single-family residential homes as rental properties.  We believe the investment opportunity in single-family residential rental properties offers attractive long-term returns supported by favorable supply and demand dynamics, a healthy U.S. home financing market and flexible financing structures with attractive terms for institutional investors.  We believe demographic trends support our SFR investment strategy with a rising housing demand fueled by strong population growth as well as a post-pandemic demand for single-family homes.  In addition, declining housing affordability has increased the home rental demand.  At the same time, there is a limited supply of new housing evidenced by the current growth in the U.S. population outpacing the number of annual housing starts.  Investments in SFR properties currently offer attractive current yields in the form of the net rental profit plus provide the ability to realize any home price appreciation over time.
 We target markets that exhibit strong job and household formation growth, lower new housing supply and superior net rental income growth located in the southeast, southwest and mid-west regions of the United States.  Within these markets, we target neighborhoods with strong demand drivers such as close proximity to major employment centers, desirable schools and access to transportation corridors.  We seek to acquire high quality, newer homes and address any upfront capital needs that both reduce ongoing maintenance costs and lead to higher resident demand.  We enter into lease agreements with our residents with a term that typically is for twelve months.  Under the terms of our lease agreements, our residents are generally responsible for the payment of all utilities while we are responsible for the payment of real estate taxes, insurance costs and homeowner association fees.  We enter into property management agreements with third-party property managers to manage the daily operations of the homes, including the marketing of a rental property, lease negotiation, collection of rent and management of any repairs and maintenance.  
 To execute our SFR investment strategy, we have partnered with a leading global asset manager that has nearly $140 billion of assets under management including approximately $1.5 billion in more than 4,400 single-family residential properties that enables us to leverage our partner’s scale, intellectual capital and access to compelling investment and growth opportunities in the single-family residential market.  Under the arrangement, our partner identifies, acquires and oversees the third-party management of our SFR properties on our behalf in exchange for a fixed fee plus an incentive fee equal to a percentage of the total investment return in excess of a hurdle rate of return.
 Financing Strategy
 We use leverage to finance a portion of our investment portfolio and to seek to increase potential returns to our shareholders. To the extent that revenue derived from our investment portfolio exceeds our interest expense and other costs of the financing, our net income will be greater than if we had not borrowed funds and had not invested in the assets. Conversely, if the revenue from our investment portfolio does not sufficiently cover the interest expense and other costs of the financing, our net income will be less or our net loss will be greater than if we had not borrowed funds.
 We closely monitor the leverage (debt-to-equity ratio) of our investment portfolio. Our leverage may vary from time to time depending upon several factors, including changes in the value of the underlying investment and hedge portfolio, changes in investment allocation between our investment strategies, the timing and amount of investment purchases or sales, and our assessment of risk and returns.
 We finance our agency MBS and credit investments using short-term secured borrowings structured as repurchase agreements. Under our repurchase agreements, we are subject to daily margin calls in the event the estimated fair value of existing pledged collateral declines and such lenders demand additional collateral.  To mitigate our risk associated with daily margin calls on less liquid credit investments, we generally seek to limit the amount of our use of repurchase agreement financing secured by credit investments.  
 When we engage in a repurchase transaction, we initially sell securities to the counterparty under a master repurchase agreement in exchange for cash from the counterparty. The counterparty is obligated to resell the same securities back to us at the end of the term of the repurchase agreement, which typically is 30 to 60 days, but may have maturities as short as one day or as long as one year. Amounts available to be borrowed under our repurchase agreements are dependent upon lender collateral requirements and the lender’s determination of the fair value of the securities pledged as collateral, which fluctuates with changes in interest rates, credit quality and liquidity conditions within the investment banking, mortgage finance and real estate industries. In addition, our counterparties apply a “haircut” to our pledged collateral, which means our collateral is valued, for the purposes of the repurchase transaction, at less than market value. Under our repurchase agreements, we typically pay a fixed interest rate. These transactions are accounted for as secured financings, and we present the investment securities and related funding on our consolidated balance sheets.
 We may also finance the acquisition of agency MBS by entering into TBA dollar roll transactions in which we would sell a TBA contract for current month settlement and simultaneously purchase from the same counterparty a similar TBA contract for a 
 5

forward settlement date. Prior to the forward settlement date, we may choose to roll the position out to a later date by entering into an offsetting TBA position, net settling the paired off positions for cash, and simultaneously entering into a similar TBA contract for a later settlement date. In such transactions, the TBA contract purchased for a forward settlement date is priced at a discount to the TBA contract sold for settlement/pair-off in the current month. This difference (or discount) is referred to as the “price drop.” As discussed in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations— “Non-GAAP Core Operating Income,” we believe this price drop is the economic equivalent of net interest carry income (interest income less implied financing cost) earned from the underlying agency MBS over the roll period, which is commonly referred to as “dollar roll income.” Consequently, dollar roll transactions represent a form of off-balance sheet financing. In evaluating our overall leverage at risk, we consider both our on-balance and off-balance sheet financing.
In general, we seek term securitization debt financing for our targeted investments in residential or commercial mortgage loans within our credit investment strategy for which the financing obligation is non-recourse to us and for which we are not obligated to pledge additional margin.  Our investments in non-agency MBS carry implicit financing leverage through the securitized debt that is issued by the underlying trust.  In certain of our investments in non-agency MBS, we may be deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a securitization trust that is a variable interest entity (“VIE”) through our ownership interest in the trust requiring us to consolidate the trust’s asset and liabilities for financial reporting purposes.  In such a situation, the debt issued by the securitization trust is non-recourse to us and our risk of loss is limited to our investment in the trust.
 For our investments in MSR related assets, at our election and direction, we could have our mortgage servicing counterparty utilize leverage on the MSRs that are subject to our MSR financing receivables to finance the purchase of additional MSRs to increase potential returns to us through a credit facility that our mortgage servicing counterparty has with a third-party lender.  Any draws under the credit facility would be secured by the MSRs subject to our MSR financing receivables.  Under its credit facility, our mortgage servicing counterparty can obtain advances up to a fixed percentage of the fair value of the MSR collateral value.  In general, if the fair value of the pledged MSR collateral declines and the lender demands additional collateral from our mortgage servicing counterparty through a margin call, we would be required to provide additional funds to meet such margin call.  Accordingly, our MSR financing receivables can have embedded leverage to the extent we request our mortgage servicing counterparty to utilize leverage.
 Within our SFR investment strategy, we may also utilize leverage to increase potential returns to us.  In general, we seek to obtain financing structures that provide for an initial period that allows us to draw advances to acquire SFR properties that converts to a term period upon the expiration of the initial draw period.  We also look to utilize financing structures through special purpose entities that generally have recourse only to the collateral value of the SFR properties with limited recourse to the parent company.  We may leverage our equity capital invested in our SFR investment strategy up to approximately 3.0 to 1.  
 We have also issued, and may issue in the future, long-term unsecured notes as an additional source of financing.
 Risk Management Strategy
 In conducting our business, we are exposed to market risks, including interest rate, prepayment, extension, spread, credit, liquidity and regulatory risks. We attempt to manage these risks through the use of interest rate hedging instruments, investment allocation, asset selection and monitoring our overall leverage levels.  We use a variety of strategies to manage a portion of our exposure to these risks to the extent we believe to be prudent, taking into account our investment strategy, the cost of any hedging transactions and our intention to qualify as a REIT. As a result, we may not hedge certain risks if we believe that bearing such risks enhances our return relative to our risk/return profile. 
Competition
 Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to acquire our targeted investments at favorable returns. In acquiring these assets, we compete with mortgage finance and specialty finance companies, real estate funds, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors, REITs, investment banking firms, other lenders, the U.S. Treasury, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, other governmental bodies and other entities. In addition, there are numerous entities with similar asset acquisition objectives and others may be organized in the future which may increase competition for the available supply of our targeted mortgage investments that meet our investment objectives. Additionally, our investment strategy is dependent on the amount of financing available to us, which may also be impacted by competing borrowers. In acquiring individual properties for investment purposes, we compete with individual investors, small private investment partnerships looking for one-off acquisitions of investment properties that can either be leased or restored and sold, and larger investors, including private equity funds and other REITs, that are seeking to capitalize on the same market opportunity that we have identified. In acquiring portfolios of properties, we compete with large and small private equity investors, public and private REITs, and other sizable private institutional investors. These same entities may also compete with us for tenants.  Our investment strategy will be adversely impacted if we are not able to secure financing on favorable terms, if at all. In addition, competition is intense for the recruitment and retention of qualified professionals. Our ability to continue to compete effectively in our businesses will depend upon our continued ability to attract new professionals and retain and motivate our existing professionals. For a further discussion of the competitive factors affecting our business, see “Item 1A - Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Our Tax Status
 We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code.  As a REIT, we are required to distribute annually 90% of our REIT taxable income (subject to certain adjustments).  So long as we continue to qualify as a REIT, we will generally not be subject to U.S. federal or state corporate income taxes on our taxable income that we distribute to our shareholders on a timely basis.  Any amounts not distributed are subject to U.S. federal and state corporate taxes.  At present, it is our intention to distribute 100% of our taxable income, although we will not be required to do so. We intend to make distributions of our taxable income within the time limits prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code, which may extend into the subsequent taxable year. 
 Qualification and taxation as a REIT depends upon our ability to continually meet requirements imposed upon REITs by the Internal Revenue Code, including satisfying certain organizational requirements, an annual distribution requirement and quarterly asset and annual income tests.  The REIT asset and income tests are significant to our operations as they restrict the extent to which we can invest in certain types of securities and conduct certain hedging activities within the REIT.  
 Income Tests
 To qualify as a REIT, we must satisfy two gross income requirements on an annual basis:
  
1. | At least 75% of our gross income for each taxable year generally must be derived from investments in real property or mortgages on real property.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | At least 95% of our gross income for each taxable year generally must be derived from some combination of income that qualifies under the 75% gross income test described above, as well as other dividends, interest, gains from the sale or disposition of stock or securities, which need not have any relation to real property.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Interest income and gains from the disposition of obligations secured by mortgages on real property, such as agency MBS, constitute qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test described above.  There is no direct authority with respect to the qualification of income or gains from TBAs for the 75% gross income test; however, we treat income and gains from commitments to purchase TBAs as qualifying income under the 75% gross income test based on an opinion of legal counsel.  
 Income earned by a taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”) is not attributable to the REIT.  As a result, income that might not be qualifying income for the purpose of the income tests applicable to a REIT could be earned by a TRS without affecting our status as a REIT.  A TRS is an entity that is taxable as a corporation in which we directly or indirectly own the stock and that elects with us to be treated as a TRS. 
 Income and gains from instruments that we use to hedge the interest rate risk associated with our borrowings incurred, or to be incurred, to acquire real estate assets will generally be excluded from both gross income tests, provided that specified requirements are met.  To the extent that we enter into hedging instruments that are not a hedge of our interest rate risk associated with our borrowings incurred to acquire real estate assets or are not properly designated as such, the gross income and gains from such hedging transactions will likely be treated as nonqualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test and may also be treated as nonqualifying income for purposes of the 95% gross income test.  However, we may conduct such hedging activities through a TRS, the income of which may be subject to income tax rather than participating in the arrangements directly through the REIT.
 Asset Tests
 At the close of each calendar quarter, we must satisfy five gross asset tests relating to the nature of our assets:
  
1. | At least 75% of the value of our assets must be represented by some combination of real estate assets, cash, cash items, U.S. Government securities, stock in other REITs and debt instruments of publicly offered REITs, and, under some circumstances, temporary investments in stock or debt instruments purchased with new capital. For this purpose, interests in mortgage loans secured by real property such as agency MBS are treated as real estate assets. Assets that do not qualify for purposes of the 75% asset test are subject to the additional tests described below. 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | The value of any one issuer’s securities that we own may not exceed 5% of the value of our total assets.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | We may not own more than 10% of any issuer’s outstanding securities, as measured by either voting power or value. The 5% and 10% asset tests do not apply to securities of TRSs and qualified REIT subsidiaries and the 10% test does not apply to “straight debt” having specified characteristics and to certain other securities. 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | The aggregate value of all securities of all TRSs that we hold may not exceed 20% of the value of our total assets.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | No more than 25% of the total value of our assets may be represented by certain non-mortgage debt instruments issued by publicly offered REITs.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If we should fail to satisfy the income or asset tests, such a failure would not cause us to lose our REIT qualification if we were able to eliminate the discrepancy within a specified cure period, in the case of the asset tests, satisfy certain relief provisions and pay any applicable penalty taxes and other fines.  Please refer to the “Risks Related to Taxation” in “Item 1A - Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K for further discussion of REIT qualification requirements and related items.
 Net Operating Loss and Net Capital Loss Carryforwards
 As of December 31, 2021, we had estimated NOL carryforwards of $165.0 million that can be used to offset future taxable ordinary income and reduce our future distribution requirements. NOL carryforwards totaling $14.6 million expire in 2028 and NOL carryforwards totaling $150.4 million have no expiration period. As of December 31, 2021, we also had estimated NCL carryforwards of $127.1 million that can be used to offset future net capital gains. The scheduled expirations of our NCL carryforwards are $3.8 million in 2022, $110.3 million in 2023 and $13.0 million in 2026. Our estimated NOL and NCL carryforwards as of December 31, 2021 are subject to potential adjustments up to the time of filing our income tax returns.
 Our ability to use our NOLs, NCLs and built-in losses would be limited if we experienced an “ownership change” under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. In general, an “ownership change” would occur if there is a cumulative change in the ownership of our Class A Common Stock (our “common stock”) of more than 50% by one or more “5% shareholders” during a three-year period. Our Board of Directors adopted and our shareholders approved a shareholder rights agreement and the first amendment thereto, in an effort to protect against a possible limitation on our ability to use our NOL carryforwards, NCL carryforwards, and built-in losses under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Rights Plan was adopted to dissuade any person or group from acquiring 4.9% or more of our outstanding common stock without the approval of our Board of Directors and triggering an “ownership change” as defined by Section 382. 
 Government Regulation
 We intend to operate so as to be excluded from regulation under the 1940 Act. We rely on Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the 1940 Act, which provides an exclusion for entities that are “primarily engaged in purchasing or otherwise acquiring . . . interests in real estate.” Section 3(c)(5)(C) as interpreted by the staff of the SEC provides an exclusion from registration for a company if at least 55% of its assets, on an unconsolidated basis, consist of qualified assets such as whole loans and whole pool agency certificates, and if at least 80% of its assets, on an unconsolidated basis, are real estate related assets. We will need to ensure not only that we qualify for an exclusion or exemption from regulation under the 1940 Act, but also that each of our subsidiaries qualifies for such an exclusion or exemption. We intend to maintain our exclusion by monitoring the value of our interests in our subsidiaries. We may not be successful in this regard.
 If we fail to maintain our exclusion or secure a different exclusion or exemption if necessary, we may be required to register as an investment company, or we may be required to acquire or dispose of assets in order to meet our exemption. Any such asset acquisitions or dispositions may include assets that we would not acquire or dispose of in the ordinary course of business, may be at unfavorable prices and result in a decline in the price of our common stock. If we are required to register under the 1940 Act, we would become subject to substantial regulation with respect to our capital structure (including our ability to use leverage), management, operations, transactions with affiliated persons (as defined in the 1940 Act), and portfolio composition, including restrictions with respect to diversification and industry concentration and other matters. Accordingly, registration under the 1940 Act could limit our ability to follow our current investment and financing strategies and result in a decline in the price of our common stock.
