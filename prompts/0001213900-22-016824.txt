Item 1. Business.
Overview



Our company is led by Howard Lindzon, our Chief Executive Officer, Paul Grinberg, our Executive Chairman, and Douglas Horlick, our President and Chief Operating Officer. Our leadership has deep operational expertise as executives and entrepreneurs across public and private companies as well as investing, acquisition and fundraising experience spanning multiple decades. Collectively, our goal is to identify and invest in innovative and mission-driven companies in the fintech, enterprise software or consumer technology sectors and support growth and value creation in the public market.



Additionally, through the members of our board of directors and their networks, we are supported by technology investors, leading technology founders, executives of private and public companies and industry analysts and consultants. The members of our board of directors bring over 100 years of collective successful entrepreneurship and investment experience. Through Mr. Lindzon, we plan to work closely with Social Leverage, a top-performing early-stage investment company, providing us with access to the investment talent at Social Leverage and a vast network of technology founders enabling us to leverage the rigorous investment criteria and proven value creation approach of the Social Leverage funds.



We are a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on December 1, 2020 for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar Business Combination with one or more businesses (the “Business Combination”). While we may pursue an initial Business Combination target in any industry or geographic location, we intend to focus our search on target businesses in the financial technology, enterprise software and consumer technology industries. Our sponsor is Social Leverage Acquisition Sponsor I LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Sponsor”).



Our registration statement for our initial public offering of units (the “Initial Public Offering”) was declared effective on February 11, 2021. On February 17, 2021, we consummated our Initial Public Offering of 34,500,000 units (the “Units” and, with respect to the Class A common stock included in the Units being offered, the “Public Shares”), including 4,500,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments (the “Option Units”), at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $345.0 million, and incurring offering costs of approximately $19.7 million, inclusive of approximately $12.1 million and approximately $152,000 for deferred underwriting commissions and deferred legal fees, respectively.



Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the private placement (the “Private Placement”) of 6,000,000 warrants (each, a “Private Placement Warrant” and collectively, the “Private Placement Warrants”), at a price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant to the Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of $9.0 million. 



Upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement, $345.0 million ($10.00 per Unit) of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and certain of the proceeds of the Private Placement were placed in a trust account (“Trust Account”) located in the United States with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and invested only in U.S. government securities with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account as described below.





1







Our management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating our initial Business Combination. Our initial Business Combination must be with one or more operating businesses or assets with an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the net assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account) at the time we sign an agreement to enter into the initial Business Combination. However, we will only complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.



We intend to effectuate a Business Combination using the proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and Private Placement, and from additional issuances of, if any, our capital stock and our debt, or a combination of cash, stock and debt. We have not engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations until we complete a Business Combination, and we have not generated any operating revenue to date. We will not generate any operating revenues until after completion of our initial Business Combination, at the earliest. Our entire activity since inception through December 31, 2021 was related to our formation, the preparation for the Initial Public Offering, and following the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the search for a prospective initial Business Combination. Based on our business activities, we are a “shell company” as defined under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash.



We will provide the holders of our Public Shares (the “Public Stockholders”) with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the initial Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of our Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us. The Public Stockholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then held in the Trust Account. The per-share amount to be distributed to Public Stockholders who redeem their Public Shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we pay to the underwriters.



If we are unable to complete a Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, or February 17, 2023, (as such period may be extended by the Company’s stockholders in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation, the “Combination Period”), we will (1) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (2) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds in the Trust Account (net of taxes payable and less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any); and (3) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining stockholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.



Effecting a Business Combination



Acquisition/Investment Criteria



Our acquisition strategy will leverage our management team and Social Leverage’s expansive network of deal sources where we believe a combination of proactive outreach and receptivity to inbound ideas will provide us with a number of initial Business Combination opportunities. We have identified the following general criteria that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We will use these criteria in evaluating initial Business Combination opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial Business Combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria. We expect that no individual criterion will entirely determine a decision to pursue a particular opportunity. We intend to seek an initial Business Combination with a business that we believe:

● | Has a large and attractive end-market that is expected to benefit from long-term secular tailwinds;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






2








● | Has a defensible, market-leading position and demonstrates advantages when compared to competitors in the form of a strong and attractive customer and user base;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Has a strong, visionary management team, or provides a platform to assemble an effective management team that is well-incentivized and aligned in an effort to create stockholder value;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Exhibits an authentic and winning team culture that attracts and maintains top talent;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Needs a flexible, creative or opportunistic structure where we can deliver additional value;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Exhibits desirable returns on capital and need for capital to achieve its growth strategy, which we believe has been misevaluated by the marketplace;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Will benefit from Social Leverage’s long-term relationship as it continues to accelerate growth in public markets;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Will benefit from our management team’s industry expertise and differentiated network;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Will benefit from a public currency. Access to the public equity markets allows the target company to tap an additional form of financing to pursue accretive acquisitions, high-return capital projects and/or strengthen its balance sheet and recruit key employees through publicly traded equity compensation to achieve its growth strategy;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Is mature, at scale and ready to access the public capital markets but needs help articulating its business model and opportunity to public investors. Our management team has significant experience engaging with public market analysts and investors to help companies better communicate their stories. We believe many companies in our target sectors can leverage our management team’s experience and advice to maximize shareholder value as part of our initial Business Combination and following as an operating public company.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




We anticipate offering the following benefits to an initial Business Combination target:




● | Partnership with our management team members who have extensive and proven experience in operating, leading, advising and investing in market-leading fintech, enterprise software and consumer technology companies;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Access to our management team’s deep and broad networks, insights and operational, financial, transactional and legal and regulatory expertise;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increase company profile and improve credibility with investors, customers, suppliers and other key stakeholders;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Higher level of engagement with core, relevant, fundamental investors as anchor stockholder than what a traditional IPO book-building process offers;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Lower risk and expedited path to a public listing;
--+---------------------------------------------------


● | Infusion of cash and ongoing access to public capital markets to enable organic and inorganic growth;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Ability for key stakeholders to focus on growing the business; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Opportunity to motivate and retain employees using stock-based compensation.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------




These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial Business Combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general criteria as well as other considerations and factors that our management team and advisors may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into an initial Business Combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our stockholder communications related to our initial Business Combination, which, would be in the form of proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we would file with the SEC.





3







We may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our initial Business Combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of our initial Business Combination. We intend to acquire a company with an enterprise value significantly above the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants. Depending on the size of the transaction or the number of public shares we become obligated to redeem, we may potentially utilize several additional financing sources, including but not limited to the issuance of additional securities to the sellers of the target, the issuance of debt by banks or other lenders or the owners of the target, a private placement to raise additional funds, or a combination of the foregoing. Following our initial Business Combination, if cash on hand is insufficient to meet our obligations or our working capital needs, we may need to obtain additional financing. If we are unable to complete our initial Business Combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the Trust Account.



Our Acquisition Process



In evaluating prospective Business Combinations, we expect to conduct an extensive due diligence review process that will encompass, among other things, a thorough review of historical and projected financial and operating data, meetings with incumbent management and their advisors (if applicable), inspection of facilities and assets, discussion with suppliers and customers including surveys, legal reviews and other reviews, as we deem appropriate. We will also utilize the expertise of our management team and advisors in analyzing fintech, enterprise software and consumer technology companies, and evaluating the appropriate return expectations given the risk profile of the target business.



We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial Business Combination with a company that is affiliated with our officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial Business Combination with a business that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent and disinterested directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that such initial Business Combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.



Each of the members of our Sponsor (including persons or entities affiliated with Social Leverage), our directors and officers will, directly or indirectly, own founder shares and/or Private Placement Warrants following the Initial Public Offering and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial Business Combination. Further, such officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular Business Combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial Business Combination.



We have engaged in preliminary discussions with initial Business Combination targets but have not yet selected a target business with which to consummate our initial Business Combination.



Past experience or performance of Social Leverage, or any of its funds, investments or portfolio companies, or our Sponsor, directors or management team or their respective affiliates is not a guarantee of either (1) our ability to successfully identify and execute a transaction or (2) success with respect to any Business Combination that we may consummate. You should not rely on the historical record of Social Leverage, or any of its funds, investments or portfolio companies, or our Sponsor, directors or management team or their respective affiliates as indicative of future performance. See Item 1.A. “Risk Factors — Past performance by Social Leverage, or any of its funds, investments or portfolio companies, or our sponsor, directors or management team or their respective affiliates may not be indicative of future performance of an investment in the company.” Neither our Sponsor nor any member of our management team has any experience operating special purpose acquisition companies.



Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a Business Combination opportunity to such entity subject to his or her fiduciary duties. As a result, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a Business Combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will need to honor such fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such Business Combination opportunity to such entity, before we can pursue such opportunity. If these other entities decide to pursue any such opportunity, we may be precluded from pursuing the same. However, we do not expect these duties to materially affect our ability to complete our initial Business Combination. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any Business Combination opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the company and it is an opportunity that we are able to complete on a reasonable basis.

In addition, our officers or directors may be investors, or have other direct or indirect interests, in a business with which we may enter into a Business Combination agreement and/or in certain funds or other persons that may purchase shares in the Initial Public Offeringor that may otherwise purchase shares of our Class A common stock in the public market.



Our officers, directors and any of their respective affiliates may sponsor or form, or, in the case of individuals, serve as a director or officer of, other blank check companies similar to ours during the period in which we are seeking an initial Business Combination. Any such companies may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an acquisition target. However, we do not believe that any such potential conflicts would materially affect our ability to complete our initial Business Combination.



Social Leverage may become aware of a potential Business Combination opportunity that may be an attractive opportunity for our company. However, Social Leverage is not under any obligation to source any potential opportunities for our initial Business Combination or refer any such opportunities to our company or provide any other services to our company. Social Leverage’s role with respect to our company is expected to be primarily passive and advisory in nature. Social Leverage may have fiduciary and/or contractual duties to its investment vehicles and to companies in which Social Leverage has invested. As a result, Social Leverage may have a duty to offer Business Combination opportunities to certain Social Leverage funds, other investment vehicles or other entities before other parties, including our company. Additionally, certain companies in which Social Leverage has invested may enter into transactions with, provide goods or services to, or receive goods or services from an entity with which we seek to complete our initial Business Combination. Transactions of these types may present a conflict of interest because Social Leverage may directly or indirectly receive a financial benefit as a result of such transaction.



We believe that any such potential conflicts of interest of Social Leverage and our officers and directors will be naturally mitigated by the differing nature of targets that Social Leverage typically considers most attractive for its venture capital activities and the types of initial Business Combination opportunities that we expect to be most attractive for our company.



Our directors and officers are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs, and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities, including identifying potential Business Combinations and monitoring the related due diligence. See Item 1.A.: “Risk Factors — Certain of our directors and officers are now, and all of them may in the future become, affiliated with entities engaged in business activities similar to those intended to be conducted by us and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented.”



Initial Business Combination 



The rules of the NYSE require that our initial Business Combination must be with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the Trust Account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes, if permitted, and excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting discount held in trust). We refer to this as the 80% of net assets test. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not currently intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial Business Combination, although there is no assurance that will be the case.





5







We anticipate structuring our initial Business Combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial Business Combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the issued and outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to our initial Business Combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in our initial Business Combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity securities of a target business or issue a substantial number of new shares to third-parties in connection with financing our initial Business Combination. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial Business Combination could own less than a majority of our issued and outstanding shares subsequent to our initial Business Combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If our initial Business Combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we are not then listed on the NYSE for whatever reason, we would no longer be required to meet the foregoing 80% of net assets test.



We have filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial Business Combination.



Corporate Information



We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.



In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.



We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the Initial Public Offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.00 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” will have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.



Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $250 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter, and (2) our annual revenues equaled or exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year or the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter.

Our executive offices are located at 8390 E. Via de Ventura, Suite F110-207, Scottsdale, Arizona 85258 and our telephone number is 302-492-7522. Upon completion of this offering, our corporate website address will be socialleverageholdings.com. Our website and the information contained on, or that can be accessed through, the website is not deemed to be incorporated by reference in, and is not considered part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. You should not rely on any such information in making your decision whether to invest in our securities.



Competition



We expect to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be individuals or investment partnerships), other blank check companies and other entities, domestic and international, competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire. Many of these individuals and entities are well established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources or more local industry knowledge than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. Additionally, the number of blank check companies looking for Business Combination targets has increased compared to recent years and many of these blank check companies are sponsored by entities or persons that have significant experience with completing Business Combinations. While we believe there are numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire with the net proceeds from our Initial Public Offering and Private Placement, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore, in the event we seek stockholder approval of our initial Business Combination and we are obligated to pay cash for our shares of Class A common stock, it will potentially reduce the resources available to us for our initial Business Combination. Any of these obligations may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a Business Combination. If we have not completed our initial Business Combination within the required time period, our public stockholders may receive only approximately $10.00 per share or less in certain circumstances on the liquidation of our Trust Account and our warrants will expire worthless.
Employees



We currently have three officers and do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial Business Combination. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial Business Combination. The amount of time that any such person will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial Business Combination and the current stage of the Business Combination process.
