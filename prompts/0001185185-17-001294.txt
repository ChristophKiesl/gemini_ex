Products
 As the exclusive United States trade co-publisher of the Usborne line of books, we offer over 2,000 different titles.  Many of these titles are interactive in nature, including our Touchy-Feely board books, activity and flashcards, adventure and search books, art books, sticker books and foreign language books.  We also have a growing number of titles printed by our Kane Miller Book Publishers.   Most of our Kane Miller titles were originally published in other countries, in their native languages, and we have purchased the exclusive rights to publish the titles in North America.
 
 We have a broad line of ‘internet-linked’ books which allow readers to expand their educational experience by referring them to relevant non-Usborne websites.  Our books include science and math titles, as well as chapter books and novels.  We continually introduce new titles across all lines of our products.
 
UBAM markets the books through commissioned consultants using a combination of direct sales, home parties, book fairs social media and the internet.  The division had approximately 25,800 consultants in 50 states at February 28, 2017.
 
EDC Publishing markets through commissioned trade representatives who call on book, toy, and specialty stores along with other retail outlets. EDC Publishing also conducts in-house marketing by telephone to these customers and potential customers.  This division markets to approximately 5,000 book, toy and specialty stores.  Significant orders, totaling 17% of EDC Publishing division's net sales, have been received from major book chains.
 
Key Customers
 No customer represents more than 10% of our net sales.
 
Seasonality
 Sales for both divisions are greatest during the fall due to the holiday season.
 
Competition
 While we have the exclusive U.S. rights to sell Usborne Books and our Kane Miller published books, we face competition from the internet and other book publishers who are also selling directly to our customers.  We also face competition in our UBAM division in recruiting and retaining sales consultants from other larger direct selling companies.  Our school and library market faces competition from Scholastic Books for the book fair market.
 
EDC Publishing faces competition from large U.S. and international publishing companies.
 
Employees
 As of May 1, 2017, 202 full-time employees worked at our Tulsa and San Diego facilities; almost 66% of those are in the distribution warehouse.  We believe our relations with our employees are good.
Company Reports
 We make available, free of charge, on our website (www.edcpub.com) copies of our Annual Reports, Quarterly Reports, Current Reports on Form 8-K, amendments to those reports filed or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and reports of holdings of our securities filed by our officers and directors under Section 16 of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such material electronically or otherwise furnishing it to the SEC.
