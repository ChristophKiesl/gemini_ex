Item 1.    Description of Our Business
Unless the context suggests otherwise, all references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our,” refer to IAA, Inc. and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.
Our Company and Business Segments
We are a leading global digital marketplace connecting vehicle buyers and sellers. Leveraging leading-edge technology and focusing on innovation, our unique platform facilitates the marketing and sale of total-loss, damaged and low-value vehicles for a full spectrum of sellers. Headquartered in Westchester, IL, our company has two operating segments: United States and International. We maintain operations in the United States, which make up the United States segment and operations in Canada and the United Kingdom, which make up the International segment. We have more than 210 facilities across both business segments. These two operating segments also represent our two reportable segments. These segments represent geographic areas and reflect how the chief operating decision maker allocates resources and measures results. See Note - 15 - Segment Information in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information. Discussions throughout which refer to “North America” or “North American” include the combination of the United States segment and operations in Canada from the International segment. 
We serve a global buyer base and a full spectrum of sellers, including insurance companies, dealerships, fleet lease and rental car companies, and charitable organizations. We offer sellers a comprehensive suite of services aimed at maximizing vehicle value, reducing administrative costs, shortening selling cycle time and delivering the highest economic returns. Our products provide global buyers with the vehicles they need to, among other things, fulfill their vehicle rebuild requirements, replacement part inventory or scrap demand. We provide global buyers with multiple bidding/buying digital channels, innovative vehicle merchandising, efficient evaluation services and online bidding tools, enhancing the overall purchasing experience. 
Our Corporate History and Our Separation from KAR Auction Services, Inc. (“KAR”)
IAA entered the vehicle salvage business in 1982, and first became a public company in 1991. After growing through a series of acquisitions, IAA was acquired by two private equity firms in 2005. The two private equity firms and certain members of IAA management contributed IAA to KAR in 2007. 
On February 27, 2018, KAR announced a plan to pursue the separation and spin-off (the “Separation”) of IAA (its salvage auction services business) into a separate public company. On June 28, 2019 (the “Separation Date”), KAR completed the distribution of 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of IAA to the holders of record of KAR's common stock on June 18, 2019, on a pro rata basis (the “Distribution”). Following the Separation and Distribution, IAA became an independent publicly-traded company and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “IAA.” 
Recent Highlights and Developments 
Proposed Merger 
Merger Agreement
On November 7, 2022, we entered into the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (as amended or otherwise modified prior to January 22, 2023, the “Original Merger Agreement”), and on January 22, 2023, we entered into the Amendment to the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (such amendment, the “Merger Agreement Amendment” and, together with the Original Merger Agreement, as it may be further amended or modified from time to time, the “Merger Agreement”) with Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers Incorporated, a company organized under the federal laws of Canada (“RBA”), Ritchie Bros. Holdings Inc., a Washington corporation and a direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiary of RBA (“US Holdings”), Impala Merger Sub I, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of US Holdings (“Merger Sub 1”), and Impala Merger Sub II, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of US Holdings (“Merger Sub 2”), providing for RBA’s acquisition of the Company in a stock and cash transaction. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the closing of the transactions (i) Merger Sub 1 will be merged with and into us (the “First Merger”), with the Company surviving as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of RBA and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of US Holdings (the “Surviving Corporation”), and (ii) immediately following the consummation of the First Merger, the Surviving Corporation will be merged with and into Merger Sub 2 (together with the First Merger, the “Mergers”), with Merger Sub 2 surviving as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of US Holdings. 
At the effective time of the First Merger (the “Effective Time”), each issued and outstanding share of common stock of the Company (other than certain customary excluded shares) as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted automatically into the right to receive (A) 0.5252 of a common share, without par value, of RBA (“RBA Common Shares”) and (B) $12.80 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes (together, the “Merger Consideration”). Additionally, our stockholders will receive cash in lieu of any fractional RBA Common Shares to which they would otherwise be entitled.
Cooperation Agreement 
Also on January 22, 2023, we entered into a Cooperation Agreement (the “Cooperation Agreement”) with Ancora Holdings Group, LLC and/or its applicable affiliates (“Ancora”) regarding the Mergers, the membership and composition of our Board of Directors in certain circumstances and related matters. Pursuant to the Cooperation Agreement, with the prior written consent of RBA, we have agreed to take all necessary actions to designate Timothy James O’Day as an IAA designee for appointment to the combined company board of directors immediately following the Effective Time (subject to the completion of customary vetting and onboarding matters). Ancora irrevocably committed to appear at the special meeting of our stockholders (the “IAA Special Meeting”) to consider and vote its shares, representing approximately 4% of our voting power as of the date of the Cooperation Agreement, in favor of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Mergers, and certain other matters at the IAA Special Meeting. Additionally, Ancora has committed to vote in accordance with the recommendation of our Board of Directors with respect to director elections and, subject to certain limited exceptions, all other proposals put forth to our stockholders until the later of the closing of the Mergers and the conclusion of our 2023 annual meeting of stockholders. Ancora also has certain replacement rights with respect to Mr. Timothy James O’Day’s appointment to the combined company board of directors, subject to specified ownership thresholds and the prior written consent of RBA.
In the event that the IAA stockholders or the RBA shareholders do not approve the Mergers or we file definitive proxy materials for our 2023 annual meeting of stockholders (the first to occur of such events, a “Transaction Vote Down”), (i) within five business days of the Transaction Vote Down, one of our current directors (other than our Chief Executive Officer) will resign from our Board of Directors and we will, after completion of customary vetting and onboarding matters, appoint Mr. Timothy James O’Day as an observer to our Board of Directors, (ii) we will appoint a second director candidate identified by Ancora and selected pursuant to the procedures described in the Cooperation Agreement as an observer to our Board of Directors (the “Second Director Candidate”), and (iii) we will appoint a third director candidate to be mutually agreed between us and Ancora as an observer to our Board of Directors (the “Mutual Director Candidate” and, together with Mr. Timothy James O’Day and the Second Director Candidate, the “New Director Candidates”). In the event of a Transaction Vote Down, immediately following the 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, we will increase the size of our Board of Directors to 11 directors in order to appoint the New Director Candidates as directors. Thereafter, we will not increase our Board of Directors without prior written consent from Ancora.
Approvals
On December 20, 2022, the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, expired and RBA received a no-action letter from the Canadian Commissioner of Competition with respect to the Mergers. The parties have received all necessary antitrust clearance required by the Merger Agreement. The IAA Special Meeting is scheduled for March 14, 2023 and a special meeting of RBA shareholders to consider and vote on approval of the issuance of RBA Common Shares in connection with the Mergers (the “RBA Special Meeting”)  is also scheduled for March 14, 2023. If these matters are approved by our stockholders and RBA shareholders at the IAA Special Meeting and RBA Special Meeting, respectively, we expect to close the Mergers in the first half of 2023, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of additional conditions to closing set forth in the Merger Agreement. We currently operate, and until completion of the Mergers will continue to operate, independently of RBA. See Note 1 – Basis of Presentation in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the proposed Merger.
Acquisition
During the first quarter of fiscal 2022 we received required approvals from the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority (the “CMA”) relating to our acquisition of SYNETIQ Ltd. (“SYNETIQ”) on October 26, 2021. The results of operations of SYNETIQ are included in our International segment from the date of acquisition.
Our Operations, Products and Services 
We generate a significant portion of our revenue from auction fees and related services associated with our salvage auctions. Approximately two-thirds of our revenue is earned from buyers. We charge fees to buyers for each vehicle purchased based on a tiered structure that increases with the sales price of the vehicle as well as fees for additional services such as storage, transportation, and vehicle condition reporting. We also charge buyers a fixed registration fee to access auctions. Approximately one-third of our revenue is earned from vehicle suppliers or sellers. We charge vehicle sellers agreed-upon 
processing and service fees to facilitate the remarketing of salvage vehicles, including the inbound tow, processing, storage, titling, enhancing and sale at auction.
The majority of our business comprises auctioning consigned vehicles. We recognize revenues from consigned vehicles on a net basis in the amount of fees charged. However, our related receivables and payables include the gross value of the vehicles sold. We also purchase vehicles in certain situations and resell them or, in our International segment, dismantle them and sell the vehicle parts and scrap. We recognize revenues from purchased vehicles on a gross basis, which results in lower gross margin versus vehicles sold at auction on a consignment basis.
Our operating expenses consist of cost of services, cost of vehicle and parts sales, selling, general and administrative and depreciation and amortization. Cost of services is comprised of payroll and related costs, subcontract services, supplies, insurance, property taxes, utilities, service contract claims, maintenance and lease expense related to the auction sites. Cost of vehicle and parts sales represents the cost of purchased vehicles and associated parts. Cost of services and cost of vehicle and parts sales exclude depreciation and amortization. Selling, general and administrative expenses are comprised of, among other things, payroll and related costs, sales and marketing, information technology services and professional fees.
We offer a comprehensive suite of auction, logistics and vehicle-processing services as part of our ability to increasingly function as a “one-stop shop” for vehicle sellers and buyers within IAA’s global digital marketplace. Our integrated products and services aim to maximize the value of vehicles while lowering administrative costs and creating a frictionless customer experience throughout vehicle assignment, transport, inventory management, merchandising and sale.
We market vehicles to prospective buyers through our many marketplaces, 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Auctions are typically held weekly for most locations and allow bidders to participate virtually at the auction. Certain vehicles are also offered for sale online via IAA Timed AuctionsTM, where bidders may bid on those vehicles for a fixed duration of time, and via IAA Buy NowTM where vehicles are offered for sale at a fixed price. All vehicles which are ready for sale are listed and available online on IAA Auction CenterTM, allowing prospective bidders to preview and bid on vehicles prior to the digital auction event. IAA Auction Center includes a “Fast Search” function that allows for filtering to quickly locate specific vehicles and offers logged-in buyers additional services such as “Enhanced Vehicle Details” that includes VIN details and Hollander Interchange parts data to help buyers make informed purchasing decisions. IAA Auction Center provides online buyers with an open, competitive digital bidding environment. Our mobile and online capabilities provide buyers the greatest flexibility in their purchasing options, exposing vehicles to bidders from around the globe and allowing bidders to participate in a greater number of auctions. Online inventory browsing, digital alerts (via email or through buyer app) and multiple vehicle payment methods reduce the time required to acquire vehicles, and the broader market exposure and increased competitive bidding generally drive higher selling prices. We believe the capabilities of our auction models maximize auction proceeds and returns for our vehicle sellers.
We have developed proprietary web-based information systems such as Automated Salvage Auction Processing system (ASAP) for the United States segment and VISion for the International segment to streamline all aspects of our operations and centralize operational data collection. These systems provide sellers with 24-hour online access to powerful tools to manage the salvage disposition process, including inventory management, sales price analysis and electronic data interchange of titling information. Our unique digital marketplace, combined with our unique merchandising platform (IAA Interact™), provides buyers detailed information and optionality in how they bid and buy, which are key differentiators of our service offering and helps sellers achieve the highest selling price on a given vehicle. Leveraging leading-edge technology and focusing on innovation, we processed approximately 2.3 million total loss, damaged and low-value vehicles in fiscal 2022.
In addition, we also offer products and services to: 
•expedite the process of vehicle pick-up, towing and assignment
•transport vehicles inbound to or outbound from our facilities
•optimize the organization and management of inventory
•merchandize vehicles to engage buyers with detailed vehicle information

Our Industry and Trends in Market Demand
The salvage vehicle auction industry provides a venue for sellers, primarily automobile insurance companies, to dispose or liquidate total loss, damaged or low-value vehicles to domestic and international dismantlers, rebuilders, scrap dealers or qualified public buyers.
We believe that demand for our services in the salvage vehicle auction industry is driven and impacted by several factors, including (i) size and age of automotive Car Parc (as defined below), (ii) miles driven, (iii) increases in vehicle complexity and total loss frequency and (iv) higher utilization of recycled and alternative automotive parts.
(i) Size and Age of Automotive Car Parc
The salvage vehicle marketplace has historically benefited from a growing number of vehicles on the road (“Car Parc”) and an increasing average age of vehicles. Growth in the number of vehicles in operation contributes to a rising number of automotive accidents, which supports increased volumes through our marketplaces. Meanwhile, vehicle owners have continued to drive the same vehicle for longer periods of time. As vehicles become older and their residual values decline, it becomes more likely that these vehicles will surpass the total loss threshold when involved in an accident and be sold on behalf of insurers through our marketplaces.
Recently, the global economy has experienced extreme volatility, inflationary conditions and disruptions in the global supply chain. The higher production costs and supply chain disruptions related to new vehicles continue to keep new vehicle prices elevated resulting in an increase in used car prices. This increase in used car prices has contributed to our higher average selling prices and revenue per unit, which have been offset slightly by higher purchased vehicle costs. 
(ii) Miles Driven
The salvage vehicle marketplace is directly impacted by the number of miles driven. The significant decline in miles driven resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic-related stay-at home orders that were executed in mid-March of fiscal 2020 across North America and the United Kingdom translated into a reduction in the number of car accidents and, in turn, a reduction in vehicle assignment volumes in our marketplace in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021. During fiscal 2022, miles driven returned to near pre-COVID-19 levels. 
(iii) Increases in Vehicle Complexity and Total Loss Frequency
Vehicle design has become increasingly more complex in recent years, as automotive manufacturers seek to differentiate themselves from competitors by incorporating new complex technologies and other enhancements into their designs in order to reduce weight and improve fuel efficiency. These technological advancements have resulted in higher repair and part replacement costs following an accident, making insurance companies more likely to declare a damaged vehicle a total loss. Based on data from CCC Information Services, the percentage of claims resulting in total losses was approximately 18% in 2022, 20% in 2021 and 21% in 2020. When a vehicle is deemed a total loss, insurers typically auction the vehicle through a salvage vehicle marketplace.
(iv) Higher Utilization of Recycled and Alternative Automotive Parts
As insurance companies continue to identify ways to reduce their claim costs, the utilization and acceptance rates continue to increase for recycled parts from total loss vehicles and aftermarket replacement parts. We believe this trend is helping increase revenue for our buyer base, which in turn increases demand for our marketplaces. 
Customers
We obtain our supply of vehicles from insurance companies, used vehicle dealers, rental car and fleet leasing companies, auto lenders and charitable organizations, among others. We have established long-term relationships with virtually all of the major automobile insurance companies in the markets we serve. The vast majority of the vehicles we process are on a consignment basis. The buyers of damaged and total loss vehicles include automotive body shops, rebuilders, used car dealers, automotive wholesalers, exporters, dismantlers, recyclers, brokers, and where allowed, non-licensed (public) buyers, among others. Approximately two-thirds of our revenue is earned from buyers and one-third of our revenue is earned from vehicle suppliers or sellers. During fiscal 2022, approximately 40% of our revenues were associated with vehicles supplied by our four largest insurance customers in the United States segment.
Sales and Marketing
Our sales force solicits prospective customers at the national, regional and local levels. Branch managers address customer needs at the local level. We also participate in a number of local, regional and national trade show events that further promote the benefits of our products and services.
In addition to providing sellers with a means of processing and selling vehicles, we offer a comprehensive suite of services to help maximize returns and shorten the selling and processing time. We help establish workflow integration within our sellers' processes, and view such mutually beneficial relationships as an essential component of our effort to attract and retain suppliers.
Our broad and industry leading geographic coverage allows us to service sellers on a national basis.
Competitive Conditions 
In our industry, we compete for sellers who supply vehicles to run through our auctions, and for buyers globally to bid on and purchase those vehicles. To attract sellers to use our global digital marketplace over that of our competitors, among other competitive areas, we focus on the following: providing industry-leading innovative products and services aimed at increasing the proportion of the vehicle processing function as a “one-stop-shop” for sellers in a manner that enhances customer integration with us; delivering a consistent high-satisfaction customer experience; maintaining a broad real estate footprint and capacity to meet market demand for storing and handling their vehicles; and delivering high value through sales results and competitive fee structures. 
Similarly, to attract buyers to our global digital marketplace, among other products and services, we offer state of the art merchandising technology that provides additional information, imagery and detail for each auctioned vehicle, thereby increasing buyer confidence and trust. We also offer a full spectrum of transportation services which help to further streamline the purchasing process for buyers, allowing them to schedule and pay for transportation of vehicles within IAA’s system. IAA’s customized bidding and purchasing experience, flexible bidding and buying channels provide buyers with multiple ways to procure vehicles.
Our principal competitors include Copart, Inc., Total Resource Auctions, a subsidiary of Cox Enterprises, Inc., independent auctions and a limited number of used vehicle auctions that regularly remarket damaged and total loss vehicles. Additionally, some dismantlers of damaged and total loss vehicles and Internet-based companies also enter the market from time to time. While most insurance companies have abandoned or reduced efforts to sell damaged and total loss vehicles without the use of service providers such as us, they may in the future decide to dispose of their vehicles directly to end users. See “Our market position and competitive advantage could be threatened by our competitors and/or disruptive new entrants” included in Item 1A, Risk Factors for additional information.
Seasonality
The volume of vehicles sold through our auctions generally fluctuates from quarter to quarter. This seasonality is caused by several factors including weather, the timing of used vehicles available for sale from selling customers, the availability and quality of salvage vehicles, holidays, and the seasonality of the retail market for used vehicles, which affects the demand side of the auction industry. Used vehicle auction volumes tend to decline during prolonged periods of winter weather conditions. However, severe weather conditions, including but not limited to hurricanes and tornadoes, can lead to an increase in the available supply of salvage vehicles volumes. In addition, mild weather conditions and decreases in traffic volume can each lead to a decline in the available supply of salvage vehicles because fewer traffic accidents occur, resulting in fewer damaged vehicles overall. As a result, revenues and operating expenses related to volume will fluctuate accordingly on a quarterly basis. The fourth calendar quarter typically experiences lower used vehicle auction volume as well as additional costs associated with the holidays and winter weather.
Our Business Strategy
We maintain a long history of strong and consistent execution that has led to growth in the business over several decades in periods under both private and public ownership. We also hold a strong track record of acquiring and integrating independent auction operations and improving profitability. We seek to grow our business through the execution of the following strategies, among others: 
Enhance Existing Relationships and Expand Market Share
We continue to maintain strong relationships with virtually all of the major automobile insurance companies in the markets we serve and increase our penetration of non-insurance sellers. Additionally, we provide an alternative venue for damaged and lower-value vehicles and, as a result, non-insurance sellers have contributed to our growth.
Broaden Our Service Offering to Deepen Strategic Relationships 
Our market-leading Total Loss Solutions® provides insurance companies with end-to-end outsourced solutions for the portion of the claims process prior to total loss determination and assignment to a salvage vehicle auction, which allows the insurance companies to reduce cycle time and cost, while improving employee engagement and customer service and ultimately increasing policyholder retention. Our expansion of our Inspection Services, a digital solution for remote vehicle inspections and appraisals, provides insurance carriers with high-resolution images and reports with all the information they need, without having to deploy an appraiser to the field. Expediting the appraisal process helps insurers settle with vehicle owners faster, reducing rental car costs, storage fees and cycle times. Our Quick Tow product innovation leverages our data analytics to identify specific vehicles ready for pick-up and streamlines the vehicle release process to eliminate a phone call to the policy holder or storage location. The Quick Tow process has been expedited further with the use of e-Checks to pay advanced towing and storage charges – eliminating the inefficiencies inherent in a traditional paper check process. Our IAA Loan Payoff product, a significant competitive differentiator in our industry, mitigates the time-consuming process of managing a total loss claim requiring loan payoff and title release. Our integration with Fastlane’s LossExpress™ solution expands our lender coverage to nearly all for total loss claims through our Loan Payoff portal. Our integration with Dealertrack’s Dealertrack Accelerated Title® solution expedites the total loss settlement and lien payoff process digitally and expands access to vehicle titles for all parties. We continue to add additional innovative services and capabilities to our leading end-to-end solutions.
Continue to Enhance International Buyer Network
We are a leader in developing an international buyer network and continue to enhance our network through digital marketing, market alliance partners, and in country visits. We have customized our marketing approaches to cater to local cultures and ways of doing business, and have invested significant resources in developing a deep understanding of the unique needs of each international market. Expanding the base of international buyers brings more bidders to our platform and yields better outcomes for sellers in our global digital marketplace.
Our further commitment to our international buyers is demonstrated by our buyer portal, which is available online in 6 languages and our call center, which currently supports 12 languages.
Continue to Expand Margins Through Cost Reductions, Operating Efficiencies and Ancillary Services
We are focused on reducing costs and driving efficiencies while also maintaining our level of customer service. As a part of our buyer digital transformation initiative, we have shifted to a fully online, digital auction model which is generating cost savings by eliminating live physical auctions. Our ongoing initiatives in other areas such as towing, pricing and branch process improvement will further enable us to execute our strategy. 
We are also shortening the time it takes a vehicle to move through the auction process through our operational efficiency efforts and service offerings like IAA Total Loss Solutions® and IAA Loan Payoff. The shortened auction process timeline further improves the service we provide our customers, reduces depreciation on vehicle values, and also improves our operating margins by making our real estate usage more efficient. We also continuously analyze our vehicle storage process in order to 
optimize our real estate usage and our ability to process more volume without incurring incremental costs. We have further deployed additional digital tools into our yard operations to increase the efficiency of the vehicle check-in, title, inventory and sale processes. Consistent with the economy generally, we have recently experienced labor, towing and other transportation shortages, which have resulted in an increase in associated costs. We are focused on leveraging our strong and longstanding towing partnerships, bringing in additional resources, leveraging our Tow App and piloting new technology to mitigate the impact of labor, towing and other transportation shortages. As a result, in the near-term, we may experience higher costs related to labor, towing and transportation, which may delay our ability reduce costs in these areas. 
Continue to Innovate and Enhance Data Analytics Capabilities
Our products deliver enhanced economic benefits to our customers by increasing transparency and reducing cycle time and friction throughout the process. We continue to broaden our product portfolio by investing in the development of innovative solutions that further improve our customers’ results.
Using our data analytics expertise, we can provide better tools for both sellers and buyers to be better informed and make confident decisions to improve their results and satisfaction.
Expand Internationally in Attractive Markets
For the year ended January 1, 2023, approximately 19% of our revenues were generated outside of the United States, and we are in the process of establishing or continuing to build operations in key geographic markets. Since the acquisition of SYNETIQ in the U.K., we have enhanced our industry relationships and expanded our geographic footprint to address the demand for dismantling and green parts services. Our auction expertise platform along with SYNETIQ’s capabilities in used parts and dismantling has created an offering that provides broad options to maximize proceeds for customers. 
We also intend to strategically enter new markets by pursuing strategic acquisitions, partnerships or greenfield opportunities in high priority markets globally.
Employ Disciplined Capital Allocation Strategy 
We generate strong cash flows as a result of our attractive gross margins, the ability to leverage our corporate infrastructure across our multiple auction locations, low maintenance capital expenditures and limited working capital requirements. We have a balanced and disciplined capital allocation policy that enables us to deliver attractive long-term stockholder value. 
Our initiative to strategically build real estate capacity throughout our global footprint, remains one of our most important commitments to servicing our clients and meeting growing demand. Our investment in real estate to start new branches or expand existing locations reflect our continued focus on strategically investing in properties with attractive return on capital. 
Government Regulation
Our operations are subject to regulation, supervision and licensing under various federal, state, provincial and local authorities, agencies, statutes and ordinances, which, among other things, require us to obtain and maintain certain licenses, permits and qualifications to operate. They also govern the storage, handling and transfer of ownership of vehicles between buyers and sellers, and prescribe certain disclosures and notices that must be provided in interacting with our wholesale and retail buyer customers. Some of the regulations and laws that apply to our operations include, without limitation, the following:
•The acquisition and sale of totaled and recovered theft vehicles are regulated by state or other local motor vehicle departments in each of the locations in which we operate.
•Some of the transport vehicles used at our marketplaces are regulated by the U.S. Department of Transportation or similar regulatory agencies in the other countries in which we operate.
•In many states and provinces, regulations require that a damaged and total loss vehicle be forever “branded” with a salvage notice in order to notify prospective purchasers of the vehicle’s previous salvage status.
•Some state, provincial and local regulations limit who can purchase damaged and total loss vehicles, as well as determine whether a damaged and total loss vehicle can be sold as rebuildable or must be sold for parts or scrap only. 
•We are subject to various local zoning requirements with regard to the location of our auction and storage facilities, which requirements vary from location to location.
•We are indirectly subject to the regulations of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 due to our vendor relationships with financial institutions.
•We deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations at certain locations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations.
Compliance with these regulations and laws requires human level awareness, performance and expertise, and investments in our enterprise management systems to facilitate efficient workflow, data tracking and auditing capabilities to measure compliance. We invest annually in our information technology systems and infrastructure with a focus towards maintenance, security and system upgrades in order to comply with regulatory changes. Expenditures in these endeavors has been, and could in the future be, significant. See Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional information. 
For additional information on the potential impacts that could result from our failure to comply with the rules and regulations governing our operations, see further Item 1A, Risk Factors under the risk: “We are subject to certain governmental regulations, including vehicle brokerage and auction laws and currency reporting obligations. Our business is subject to risks related to litigation and regulatory actions.” 
Environmental Regulation
Our operations are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing the emission or discharge of pollutants into the air or water, the generation, treatment, storage and release of hazardous materials and wastes and the investigation and remediation of contamination. Our failure to comply with current or future environmental, health or safety laws or to obtain and comply with permits required under such laws, could subject us to significant liability or require costly investigative, remedial or corrective actions. From time to time, we have incurred, and may in the future incur, expenditures related to compliance with such foreign, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and such expenditures, individually or in the aggregate, could be significant.
In the used vehicle remarketing industry, large numbers of vehicles, including wrecked vehicles at salvage auctions, are stored and/or refurbished at auction facilities and during that time minor releases of fuel, motor oil and other materials may occur. We have investigated or remediated, or are currently investigating or remediating, contamination resulting from various sources, including gasoline, fuel additives (such as methyl tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE), motor oil, petroleum products and other hazardous materials released from aboveground or underground storage tanks or in connection with current or former operations conducted at our facilities. We have incurred, and may in the future incur, expenditures relating to releases of hazardous materials, investigative, remedial or corrective actions, claims by third parties and other environmental issues, and such expenditures, individually or in the aggregate, have been and in the future could be significant, and have in the past caused, and could in the future cause, us to incur substantial compliance and other costs.
We implement a rigorous set of protocols and procedures to ensure that any fluid leaks from vehicles are promptly cleaned and storage areas are kept clean. Our employees receive training on how to properly respond to spills in the event any occur. Our employees also receive training on proper housekeeping and material management. We believe implementation of the protocols and procedures minimizes any potential environmental impacts to soil and groundwater at our locations.
Federal and state environmental authorities are currently investigating IAA’s role, if any, in contributing to contamination at the Lower Duwamish Waterway Superfund Site in Seattle, Washington, and the Pyrite Canyon Plume in Riverside, California. IAA’s potential liability, if any, at these sites cannot be estimated at this time. See Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of this matter.
Human Capital Resources 
Recruitment and Retention
In order to create and develop innovative industry leading products and services and to deliver the highest levels of customer service, we believe it is critical that we attract and retain talented and dedicated employees. As part of these efforts, we strive to offer a competitive compensation and benefits program, to create a work environment where everyone feels included and empowered to do to their best work, and to give employees the opportunity to make a difference in the communities we serve.
At January 1, 2023, we had a total of approximately 4,914 employees, of which approximately 3,768 were located in the United States and approximately 1,146 were located in Canada and the United Kingdom. Approximately 98% of our workforce consists of full-time employees. We use innovative efforts to recruit, train and develop our employees for long-term success with the organization and, to the extent possible, we strive to promote from within the organization. Our employees have rated IAA a Great Place to Work® since 2018. 
In addition to the employee workforce, from time to time, we also utilize temporary labor services to assist in handling the vehicles consigned to us and to provide certain other services. Some of the services we provide are outsourced to third party providers that perform the services either on-site or off-site. The use of third party providers depends upon the resources available at each auction facility as well as peaks in the volume of vehicles offered at auction.
Compensation and Benefits Program
Our compensation program is designed to attract and reward talented individuals who possess the skills necessary to support our business objectives, assist in the achievement of our strategic goals and create long-term value for our stockholders. We provide employees with compensation packages that we believe are competitive and consistent with employee positions, skill levels, experience, knowledge and geographic location. In addition to cash and, in certain cases, equity compensation, we also offer full-time employees and part-time employees working more than 30 hours per week benefits such as life and health (medical, dental & vision) insurance, paid time off, paid parental leave, and a 401(k) plan. 
Workplace Safety
We strive to provide a safe work environment for both our employees and customers. We conduct regular employee training in the areas of safety and emergency preparedness. We believe we have an exemplary workplace safety record with a Total Recordable Incident Rate (“TRIR”) rating of 2.41 during fiscal 2022, outperforming the industry average. We are classified as a motor vehicle and motor vehicle parts and supplies merchant wholesaler (code 423110) by the National American Industry Classification System (“NAICS”). According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics data as of 2019, the industry average TRIR for companies within our NAICS code classification was 3.10.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We believe that a diverse, equitable and inclusive environment of employees produces more creative solutions, results in better, more innovative products and services and is crucial to our efforts to attract and retain key talent. We have a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (“DEI”) Council led by senior executives and comprised of employees at every level of the organization. The DEI Council focuses on initiatives to promote inclusion and cultural awareness and appreciation, increasing diversity and representation of historically underrepresented groups at the management levels and above, and also work with industry partners in their diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.
