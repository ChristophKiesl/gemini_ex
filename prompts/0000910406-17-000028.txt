Item 1.        Business                                            
Overview 
The Hain Celestial Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was founded in 1993 and is headquartered in Lake Success, New York. The Company’s mission has continued to evolve since its founding, with health and wellness being the core tenet — to be the leading marketer, manufacturer and seller of organic and natural, “better-for-you” products by anticipating and exceeding consumer expectations in providing quality, innovation, value and convenience. The Company is committed to growing sustainably while continuing to implement environmentally sound business practices and manufacturing processes. 
With a proven track record of strategic growth and profitability, the Company manufactures, markets, distributes and sells organic and natural products under brand names that are sold as “better-for-you” products, providing consumers with the opportunity to lead A Healthier Way of LifeTM.  Hain Celestial is a leader in many organic and natural products categories, with many recognized brands in the various market categories it serves, including Almond Dream®, Arrowhead Mills®, Bearitos®, BluePrint®, Celestial Seasonings®, Coconut Dream®, Cully & Sully®, Danival®, DeBoles®, Earth’s Best®, Ella’s Kitchen®, Empire®, Europe’s Best®, Farmhouse Fare®, Frank Cooper’s®, FreeBird®, Gale’s®, Garden of Eatin’®, GG UniqueFiberTM, Hain Pure Foods®, Hartley’s®, Health Valley®, Imagine®, Johnson’s Juice Co.®, Joya®, Kosher Valley®, Lima®, Linda McCartney’s® (under license), MaraNatha®, Natumi®, New Covent Garden Soup Co.®, Plainville Farms®, Rice Dream®, Robertson’s®, Rudi’s Gluten-Free Bakery®, Rudi’s Organic Bakery®, Sensible Portions®, Spectrum Organics®, Soy Dream®, Sun-Pat®, SunSpire®, Terra®, The Greek Gods®, Tilda®, WestSoy® and Yves Veggie Cuisine®.  The Company’s personal care products are marketed under the Alba Botanica®, Avalon Organics®, Earth’s Best®, JASON®, Live Clean® and Queen Helene® brands.  
The Company sells its products through specialty and natural food distributors, supermarkets, natural foods stores, mass-market and e-commerce retailers, food service channels and club, drug and convenience stores in over 80 countries worldwide. 
Our business strategy is to integrate our brands under one management team and employ uniform marketing, sales and distribution programs when attainable. We believe that by integrating our various brands, we will continue to achieve economies of scale and enhanced market penetration. We seek to capitalize on the equity of our brands and the distribution achieved through each of our acquired businesses with strategic introductions of new products that complement existing lines to enhance revenues and margins.
Project Terra
During fiscal year 2016, the Company commenced a strategic review, which it called “Project Terra,” that resulted in the Company redefining its core platforms starting with the United States segment for future growth based upon consumer trends to create and inspire A Healthier Way of Life™.  The core platforms are defined by common consumer need, route-to-market or internal advantage and are aligned with the Company’s strategic roadmap to continue its leadership position in the organic and natural, better-for-you products industry. Beginning in fiscal year 2017, those core platforms within our United States segment are:

• | Better-for-You-Baby, which includes infant foods, infant formula, toddler and kids foods, diapers and wipe products that nurture and care for babies and toddlers, under the Earth’s Best® and Ella’s Kitchen® brands.


• | Better-for-You-Pantry, which includes core consumer staples, such as Maranatha®, Arrowhead Mills®, Imagine® and Spectrum Organics® brands.


• | Better-for-You-Snacking, which includes wholesome products for in-between meals, such as Terra®, Sensible Portions® and Garden of Eatin’® brands.


• | Fresh Living, which includes yogurt, plant-based proteins and other refrigerated products, such as The Greek Gods® yogurt and Dream™ plant-based beverage brands.


• | Pure Personal Care, which includes personal care products focused on providing consumers with cleaner and gentler ingredients, such as JASON®, Avalon Organics® and Alba Botanica® brands.


• | Tea, which includes tea products marketed under the Celestial Seasonings® brand.

In addition, beginning in fiscal 2017, the Company launched Cultivate Ventures (“Cultivate”), a venture unit with a threefold purpose: (i) to strategically invest in the Company’s smaller brands in high potential categories such as BluePrint® cold-pressed juices, SunSpire® chocolates and DeBoles® pasta by giving these products a dedicated, creative focus for refresh and relaunch; (ii) to incubate small acquisitions until they reach the scale required to migrate to the Company’s core platforms; and (iii) to invest in concepts, products and technology that focus on health and wellness. 
5

Effective July 1, 2016, due to changes to the Company’s internal management and reporting structure resulting from the formation of Cultivate, certain brands previously included within the United States operating segment will be moved to a new operating segment called Cultivate. As a result, the Company will be managed in eight operating segments: the United States (excluding Cultivate), United Kingdom, Tilda Limited (“Tilda”), Hain Pure Protein Corporation (“HPPC”), EK Holdings, Inc. (“Empire”), Canada, Europe and Cultivate. The United States, excluding Cultivate, will be its own reportable segment. Cultivate will be combined with Canada and Europe and reported within the “Rest of World” reportable segment, as they do not currently meet the quantitative thresholds for segment reporting. There will be no changes to the United Kingdom and Hain Pure Protein reportable segments. 
Another key initiative from Project Terra was the identification of global cost savings expected over the next three fiscal years, a portion of which the Company intends to reinvest into its brands. Additionally, the Company identified certain brands for divestment, which no longer fit into its core strategy for future growth. The disposal of these brands does not represent a strategic shift and is not expected to have a major effect on the Company's operations or financial results, as defined by ASC 205-20, Discontinued Operations; as a result, the disposals do not meet the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations.
Finally, in connection with Project Terra, the Company, with the assistance of outside consultants, engaged in an evaluation of its trade investment in the United States segment. Based on this assessment, the Company determined that its trade investment could be utilized more effectively, and therefore, beginning in fiscal 2017, the Company developed plans to shift from a model of investing in trade at the non-consumer facing level to more consumer facing activities.
Acquisitions and Investments
We have acquired numerous companies and brands since our formation and intend to seek future growth through internal expansion as well as the acquisition of complementary brands. We consider the acquisition of organic, natural and “better-for-you” product companies or product lines to be a part of our business strategy. During fiscal 2016, we acquired Orchard House Foods Limited (“Orchard House”), a leader in pre-cut fresh fruit, juices, fruit desserts and ingredients in the United Kingdom, and Formatio Beratungs- und Beteiligungs GmbH and its subsidiaries (“Mona”), a leader in plant-based foods and beverages under the Joya® brand with facilities in Germany and Austria. See Note 5, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 
During fiscal year 2016, we acquired a 14.9% interest in Chop’t Creative Salad Company LLC (“Chop’t”). Chop’t develops and operates fast-casual, fresh salad restaurants in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic United States. See Note 14, Investments and Joint Ventures, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Headcount
As of June 30, 2016, we employed a total of 7,700 full-time employees. Of these employees, 259 were in sales, and 5,952 were in production, with the remaining 1,489 employees in management, finance, marketing, operations, legal and clerical positions.
Products
During fiscal 2016, we primarily sold our organic, natural, and “better-for-you” products in the following categories: grocery; poultry/protein; snacks; personal care; and tea. We continuously evaluate our existing products for quality, taste, nutritional value and cost and make improvements where possible. We discontinue products or stock keeping units (“SKUs”) when sales of those items do not warrant further production. Our product categories consist of the following:
Grocery
Grocery products include infant formula, infant, toddler and kids foods, diapers and wipes, rice and grain-based products, plant-based beverages and frozen desserts (such as soy, rice, oat, almond and coconut), flour and baking mixes, breads, hot and cold cereals, pasta, condiments, cooking and culinary oils, granolas, cereal bars, canned, chilled fresh, aseptic and instant soups, Greek-style yogurts, chilis, packaged grains, chocolate, nut butters, juices including cold-pressed juice, hot-eating, chilled and frozen desserts, cookies, crackers, frozen pastas and ethnic meals, frozen fruit and vegetables, pre-cut fresh fruit, refrigerated and frozen plant-based meat-alternative products, tofu, seitan and tempeh products, jams, fruit spreads, jelly, honey, marmalade products as well as other food products. Grocery products accounted for approximately 62% of our consolidated net sales in 2016, 66% in 2015 and 78% in 2014.
6

Poultry/Protein
Our poultry and protein products are manufactured and marketed as antibiotic-free or organic, vegetarian fed and humanely raised. We manufacture and market kosher products under the Empire® and Kosher Valley® brands. A full range of turkey and chicken products are offered for fresh meat, deli, prepared and frozen foods. Poultry products accounted for approximately 17% of our consolidated net sales in 2016 and 13% in 2015. There were no sales of poultry and protein products included in our consolidated net sales for 2014 as the businesses in this product category were accounted for under either the equity method or cost method of accounting prior to fiscal 2015.
Snacks
Our snack products include a variety of potato, root vegetable and other exotic vegetable chips, straws, tortilla chips, whole grain
chips, pita chips, puffs and popcorn. Snack products accounted for approximately 11% of our consolidated net sales in 2016 and 2015 and 12% in 2014.
Personal Care
Our personal care products cover a variety of personal care categories including skin, hair and oral care, deodorants, baby care items, body washes, sunscreens and lotions. Personal care products accounted for approximately 6% of our consolidated net sales in 2016, 5% in 2015 and 4% in 2014.
Tea
Under the Celestial Seasonings® brand, we currently offer more than 70 varieties of herbal, green, black, wellness, rooibos and chai tea. Tea products accounted for approximately 4% of our consolidated net sales in 2016, 5% in 2015 and 6% in 2014.
Seasonality
Certain of our product lines have seasonal fluctuations. Hot tea, baking products, hot cereal, hot-eating desserts and soup sales are stronger in colder months, while sales of snack foods, sunscreen and certain of our prepared food and personal care products are stronger in the warmer months. Additionally, due to the nature of our acquisitions of HPPC, Empire and Tilda businesses, our net sales and earnings may further fluctuate based on the timing of holidays throughout the year. As such, our results of operations and our cash flows for any particular quarter are not indicative of the results we expect for the full year, and our historical seasonality may not be indicative of future quarterly results of operations. In recent years, net sales and diluted earnings per share in the first fiscal quarter have typically been the lowest of our four quarters. 
Working Capital
For information relating to our cash flows from operations and working capital items, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 of this Form 10-K.
Capital Expenditures
During fiscal 2016, our aggregate capital expenditures were $77.3 million. We expect to spend approximately $70.0 million for capital projects in fiscal 2017.
Segments
We principally manage our business by geography in seven operating segments: the United States, United Kingdom, Tilda, Hain Pure Protein Corporation, Empire Kosher Poultry, Canada and Europe.  In addition, we have four reportable segments: United States, United Kingdom, Hain Pure Protein and Rest of World. We have aggregated (based on economic similarities, the nature of their products, end-user markets and methods of distribution) the operating segments of the United Kingdom and Tilda into the United Kingdom reportable segment and the operating segments of Hain Pure Protein Corporation and Empire Kosher Poultry into the Hain Pure Protein reportable segment. Additionally, Canada and Europe do not currently meet the quantitative thresholds for segment reporting and are therefore combined and reported as “Rest of World.” 
Each segment includes the results of operations attributable to its geographic location except that the United States segment includes the results of operations of the Ella’s Kitchen brand, which primarily conducts business in the United States and United Kingdom.  The products included in the Hain Pure Protein segment are sold in the United States.  
7

We use segment net sales and operating income to evaluate segment performance and to allocate resources.  We believe this measure is most relevant in order to analyze segment results and trends.  Segment operating income excludes certain general corporate expenses (which are a component of selling, general and administrative expenses), impairment and acquisition related expenses, restructuring and integration charges.
The following table presents the Company’s net sales by reportable segment for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2016, 2015, and 2014 (in thousands):

 | Fiscal Year ended June 30,
 | 2016 | | 2015 (Revised) | | 2014 (Revised)

(a) | Net sales for the United Kingdom segment for fiscal 2016 and 2015 include sales of plant-based beverages in the United Kingdom that were previously reported in the Rest of World segment due to a change in the responsibilities for this business.

10

Marketing
We use a combination of trade and consumer promotions to market our products. We use trade advertising and promotion, including placement fees, cooperative advertising and feature advertising in distribution catalogs. Consumer advertising and sales promotions are also made via social media and trial use programs. We utilize in-store product demonstrations and sampling in the club store channel. Our investments in consumer spending are aimed at enhancing brand equity and increasing consumption. These consumer spending categories include, but are not limited to, coupons, direct mailing, e-consumer relationship programs and other forms of promotions. Additionally, we maintain separate websites and social media pages for many of our brands featuring product information regarding the particular brand.
We also utilize sponsorship programs to help create brand awareness. In the United States, our Earth’s Best® brand has an agreement
with PBS Kids and Sesame Workshop, and our Terra Blues® are the official snack of JetBlue Airways. Terra® chips and Sensible Portions® snacks are Official Partners of the New York Knicks along with other Hain Celestial brands featured at Madison Square Garden. In addition, Sensible Portions® products, Yves Veggie Cuisine® plant-based burgers and Terra® chips are advertised and sold at Citi Field. There is no guarantee that these promotional investments are or will be successful.
New Product Initiatives Through Research and Development
Innovation, including new product development, is a key component of our growth strategy. We continuously seek to understand our consumers and develop products that address their desire for organic, natural and better-for-you alternatives to conventional packaged foods and personal care products. We have a demonstrated track record of extending our product offerings into other product categories. A team of professional product developers, including microbiologists, nutritionists, food scientists, chefs and chemists, work to develop products to meet changing consumer needs. Our research and development staff incorporates product ideas from all areas of our business in order to formulate new products. In addition to developing new products, the research and development staff routinely reformulates and improves existing products based on advances in ingredients, packaging and technology. We incurred approximately $11.4 million in company-sponsored research and development activities, consisting primarily of personnel related costs, in 2016, $10.3 million in 2015 and $10.0 million in 2014. In addition to our company-sponsored research and development activities, in order to quickly and economically introduce our new products to market, we may partner with contract manufacturers that make our products according to our formulas or other specifications. The Company also partners with certain customers from time-to-time on exclusive customer initiatives. The Company’s research and development expenditures do not include the expenditures on such activities undertaken by co-packers and suppliers who develop numerous products on behalf of the Company and on their own initiative with the expectation that the Company will accept their new product ideas and market them under the Company’s brands.

Co-Packers
In addition to the products manufactured in our own facilities, independent third-party manufacturers, who are referred to in our industry as “co-packers,” manufacture many of our products. In general, utilizing co-packers provides us with the flexibility to produce a large variety of products and the ability to enter new categories quickly and economically. Our contract manufacturers have been selected based on their production capabilities and their specific product category expertise, and we expect to continue to partner with them to improve and expand our product offerings.  During 2016, 2015 and 2014, approximately 35%, 39% and 43%, respectively, of our revenue was derived from products manufactured by co-packers. Our co-packers are audited for quality assurance purposes and compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices. Additionally, the co-packers are required to ensure our products are manufactured in accordance with our quality and safety specifications and that they are compliant with all relevant regulations.
Suppliers of Ingredients and Packaging
Agricultural commodities and ingredients, including almonds, corn, dairy, fruit and vegetables, oils, rice, soybeans and wheat, are the principal inputs used in our products. Our certified organic and natural raw materials as well as our packaging materials are obtained from various suppliers around the world. The Company works with its suppliers to ensure the quality and safety of their ingredients and that such ingredients meet our specifications and comply with applicable regulations. These assurances are supported by our purchasing contracts, supplier expectations manual and quality assurance specification packets, including affidavits, certificates of analysis and analytical testing, where required. Our purchasers and quality team visit major suppliers around the world to procure competitively priced, quality ingredients that meet our specifications.
We maintain long-term relationships with many of our suppliers. Purchase arrangements with ingredient suppliers are generally made annually. Purchases are made through purchase orders or contracts, and price, delivery terms and product specifications vary.
12

Competition
We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our products compete with both large mainstream conventional packaged foods companies and natural and organic packaged foods companies. Many of these competitors enjoy significantly greater resources. Large mainstream conventional packaged foods competitors include Campbell Soup Company, Mondelez International, Inc., General Mills, Inc., Groupe Danone, The J.M. Smucker Company, Kellogg Company, The Kraft Heinz Company, Nestle S.A., PepsiCo, Inc. and Unilever PLC, and conventional personal care products companies, including but not limited to The Proctor & Gamble Company, Johnson & Johnson and Colgate-Palmolive Company. Certain of these large mainstream conventional packaged foods and personal care companies compete with us by selling both conventional products and natural and/or organic products. Natural and organic packaged foods competitors include Chobani LLC, Nature’s Bounty Inc., Clif Bar & Company and Amy’s Kitchen. In addition to these competitors, in each of our categories we compete with many regional and small, local niche brands. Given limited retailer shelf space and merchandising events, competitors actively support their respective brands with marketing, advertising and promotional spending. In addition, most retailers market similar items under their own private label, which compete for the same shelf space.
Competitive factors in the packaged foods industry include product quality and taste, brand awareness and loyalty, product variety, interesting or unique product names, product packaging and package design, shelf space, reputation, price, advertising, promotion and nutritional claims. We believe that we currently compete effectively with respect to each of these factors.
Trademarks
