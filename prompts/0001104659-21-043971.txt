Item 1. Business
 
Historical background
 
Target Group Inc. (“Target Group” or “the Company”) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on July 2, 2013, under our original name of River Run Acquisition Corporation. On May 5, 2014, we issued 500,000 shares of common stock to Rubin Schindermann and 500,000 shares of Common Stock to Alexander Starr. With the issuance of these shares and the redemption of 19,500,000 shares of common stock issued to our original officers, directors and shareholders, we effected a change of control. Mr. Schindermann and Mr. Starr became our new officers and directors. They accepted the resignations of our original founding officers and directors. Effective May 13, 2014, the Company changed its name to Chess Supersite Corporation.
 
On July 23, 2014, we acquired certain assets (“Acquisition”) of Chess Supersite, Inc., a corporation existing under the laws of Ontario, Canada (“Chess Canada”). The Acquisition was consummated pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement and the issuance of 5,000,000 shares of our common stock to Chess Canada. In the Acquisition, we acquired all right, title and interest in and to the properties, assets, interests and rights of Chess Canada, including the contracts and intellectual property which are related to the business of developing, operating and maintaining a website focused on the game of chess. Chess Supersite, Inc. is under the common control of Rubin Schindermann and Alexander Starr.
 
Our original business comprised the operation of an extensive chess gaming website under the name ChessStars™. This comprehensive user-friendly web site www.chessstars.com, offered a state-of-the-art playing zone, broadcasts of the major tournaments, intuitive mega database, chess skilled contests and much more.
 
On July 3, 2018, we filed an amendment in our Certificate of Incorporation to change our name to Target Group Inc. Effective October 18, 2018, our common stock became eligible for quotation on the OTCQB platform operated by OTC Markets Group Inc, under the symbol “CBDY”.
 
Effective December 12, 2018, our Board of Directors approved the termination of our ChessStars™ online chess playing platform effective December 31, 2018. Effective December 7, 2020, we sold the ChessStars™ business to a former director, Alexander Starr in consideration of Starr’s cancellation of the $60,000 debt owing to him by us.
 
During the second quarter of 2020, the global spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19) continued to have a significant impact on the Canadian and global economy and customer purchasing behavior, while equity markets remained volatile. However, these factors have not impacted the Company’s operations, financial results for the year.
 
Cannabis Business-Canada
 
We are now engaged in the cultivation, processing and distribution of curated cannabis products for the adult-use medical and recreational cannabis market in Canada and, where legalized by state legislation, in the United States. We believe that there is a shift in the public’s perception of cannabis from a state of prohibition to a state of legalization. In October 2018, Canada became the first major industrialized nation to legalize adult-use cannabis at the national federal level. Cannabis is still heavily regulated. However, the medical use of cannabis is now permitted in up to 29 countries and many more countries have reformed, or are considering reforming, their cannabis uses laws to include the recreational use of cannabis.
 
In the 2016 publication by Deloitte, Insights and Opportunities Recreational Marijuana, the project size of the Canadian adult-use market ranged from CDN$4.9 billion to CDN$8.7 billion annually. In the 2018 publication by Deloitte, A Society in Transition, an Industry Ready to Boom, the projected size of the Canadian adult-use market in 2019 ranged from CDN$1.8 billion to CDN$4.3 billion. The Canadian medical cannabis industry experienced substantial growth since 2014. Health Canada projects the Canadian cannabis market will reach CDN$1.3 billion in annual value by 2024.
