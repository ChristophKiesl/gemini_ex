In Fiscal 2016, we generated revenue of approximately $1.34 billion.

This network reinforces and supports sales across the multiple channels in which we do business. In Fiscal 2016 we shipped products to approximately 155 countries outside the United States, totaling approximately $192.2 million, or 14.4% of revenue. This compares to sales outside of the United States in Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014 of $208.6 million and $246.1 million, or 14.7% and 15.8% of revenue, respectively.

Operating costs consist primarily of labor and benefits costs; occupancy costs; distribution costs; and in-store marketing costs. Assets primarily include inventory in the retail stores, fixtures and leasehold improvements.

Key Capabilities
Lands’ End was founded on certain principles of doing business that are embodied in our promise to deliver great quality, exceptional value and uncompromising service to our customers. These core principles of quality, value and service are the foundation of the competitive advantages that we believe distinguish us from our competitors, including:
Customer base. We believe that a principal factor in our success to date has been the development of our list of existing and prospective households, many of whom were identified by their responses to our marketing. We routinely update and refine our customer list prior to individual catalog and email mailings and monitor customer interest in our offerings as reflected by criteria such as the timing and frequency of purchases and the dollar amount of and types of products purchased. We believe that our customer base consists primarily of affluent, college-educated, professional and style-conscious women and men. In Fiscal 2016, our customers had average annual household income of $107,000 and the average age of our customer is 56, according to an analysis of our customer file with data provided by our third-party consumer information provider using its proprietary demographic, behavioral, lifestyle, financial and home attribute databases.
Products. We seek to develop new, innovative products for our customers by utilizing modern fabrics and quality construction to create timeless, affordable styles with consistently excellent fits. We also seek to present our products in an engaging and inspiring way. We believe that our typical customers value quality, seek good value for their money and are looking to add classics to their wardrobe while also placing an emphasis on being fashionable. From a design and merchandising perspective, we seek to balance our product offerings to provide the right combination of classic styles alongside modern touches that are consistent with current trends. We believe that we have had success adding relevant, timeless items into our product assortment, many of which have become customer favorites. We devote significant time and resources to quality assurance and product compliance. Our in-house team manages all product specifications and seeks to ensure brand integrity by providing our customers with the consistent, high-quality merchandise for which Lands’ End is known. We are a vertically integrated retailer that manages all aspects of our design, marketing and distribution in-house, which provides us with maximum control over the promotion and sale of our products.

Customer service. We are committed to building on Lands’ End’s legacy of strong customer service. We believe that we have a strong track record of improving the customer service experience through innovation. Today, Lands’ End is focused on making the shopping experience as easy and personalized as possible, regardless of whether our customers shop online, by phone or in one of our Lands’ End Shops at Sears. Our operations, including prompt order fulfillment, responsiveness to our customers’ requests and our return policy of Guaranteed. Period.®, have contributed to our award-winning customer service, which we believe is one of our core strengths and a key point of differentiation from our competitors. Due to our commitment to excellent customer service, we have received many accolades over the years and most recently, received the following:

• | Lands’ End Earns StellaService’s Elite Award for Phone, Email & Chat, which is awarded to retailers who provide the very best in customer care, Source: StellaService (May 10, 2016)


• | Lands’ End Named Customer Service Champion, Source: Prosper Insights & Analytics. Featured on Forbes.com (March 29, 2016)

In addition, Lands’ End introduced Text Messaging for Customer Service in 2016 - among the first in the apparel retail industry to do so.
E-commerce. As one of the first apparel retailers to establish an online e-commerce presence, we are a leading digital brand in the apparel industry. One of our strategic goals is to broaden our customer base by creating engaging shopping experiences through our e-commerce platforms. To this end, we launched a significantly improved and redesigned landsend.com website. Highlights of our new website include:

• | Streamlined checkout, optimized for mobile and tablet shoppers to capture an increasing share of sales as customer migrate to mobile devices.


• | Convenient payment types including Visa Pay to simplify checkout, especially from mobile devices.


• | Improved search, navigation and our recommendation engine that provide great solutions for customers to quickly find products that best fulfill their product and style preferences.


• | New enhanced digital E- catalogs, which allow prospective and existing customers to view, engage and shop our products in a new and innovative way. Our new E-catalog can be viewed at www.landsend.com.

Marketing and Brand
We believe that our most important asset is our brand. Lands’ End is a well-recognized brand with a deeply rooted tradition of offering excellent quality, value and service along with the Lands’ End guarantee, and we seek to reflect that tradition in all of our merchandise. Any item associated with our name falls under our return policy of Guaranteed. Period®. We believe that this commitment has generated our large and loyal customer base for over fifty years. We invest significantly in brand development through our focus on providing excellent customer service and our emphasis on digital transformation and innovative product development.
We attempt to build on our brand recognition through multi-channel marketing campaigns including an e-commerce website, www.landsend.com, catalog distribution, digital marketing, social media, experiential and national print advertising. Creative designs for these marketing platforms are primarily developed in-house by our talented creative team. We strive to be more efficient in our overall spend, enabling us to invest in initiatives that we believe will yield benefits over the longer-term. The majority of our marketing spend will be allocated to our catalog and digital marketing, where we can generate near term return on investment. We are also investing in branding initiatives designed to communicate the enhancements we are making to our product offering and to broaden the Lands’ End image, while not stepping away from our core DNA. We will also continue to deliver the Lands’ End value proposition with strategically planned promotions throughout the year.
Suppliers
Our apparel and non-apparel products are produced globally by independent manufacturers who are selected, monitored and coordinated by the Lands’ End Global Sourcing team based in Dodgeville, Wisconsin, a Hong Kong domiciled subsidiary of Sears Holdings and other third party buying agents. Our products are manufactured in approximately 20 to 30 countries and substantially all are imported from Asia and South America, depending on the 

5

nature of the product mix. Our top 10 vendors accounted for approximately 40% of our merchandise purchases in Fiscal 2016. In Fiscal 2016, we worked with approximately 200 vendors that manufactured substantially all of our product receipts. We generally do not enter into long-term merchandise supply contracts. We continue to take advantage of opportunities to more efficiently source our products worldwide, consistent with our high standards of quality and value. Significant areas of non-product spend include transportation, information systems, marketing, packaging and catalog paper and print. 
Distribution
We own and operate three distribution centers in Wisconsin to support our United States Direct and Retail businesses and a portion of our international business. Our Dodgeville facility is approximately 1.05 million square feet and is a full-service distribution center, including monogramming, hemming and embroidery services. Our Reedsburg location is approximately 400,000 square feet and offers all order fulfillment services except hemming. Our Stevens Point distribution center is approximately 150,000 square feet and primarily focuses on supporting Lands’ End Business Outfitters with embroidery services. Customer orders are shipped via UPS, USPS and third-party parcel consolidators.
We own and operate a distribution center in the United Kingdom based in Oakham, a community north of London. Order fulfillment and specialty services for our European businesses are performed at this facility, which originally opened in 1998 and totals approximately 175,000 square feet. We also lease a 55,580 square foot distribution center in Fujieda, Japan.
Orders are generally filled on a current basis, and order backlog is not material to our business.
Vendors
 We prioritize the selection of vendors that follow ethical employment practices, comply with all legal requirements, agree to our global compliance requirements and who we believe meet our product quality standards. Our vendors are required to provide full access to their facilities and to relevant records relating to their employment practices, such as, but not limited to child labor, wages and benefits, forced labor, discrimination, freedom of association, unlawful inducements, safe and healthy working conditions and other business practices so that we may monitor their compliance with ethical and legal requirements relating to the conduct of their business.
Information Technology
Our information technology systems provide comprehensive support for the design, merchandising, importing, marketing, distribution, sales, order processing and fulfillment of our Lands’ End products. We believe our merchandising and financial systems, coupled with our e-commerce platforms and point-of-sale systems, allow for effective merchandise planning and sales accounting.
We have a dedicated information technology team that provides strategic direction, application development, infrastructure services and systems support for the functions and processes of our business. The information technology team contracts with third-party consulting firms to provide cost-effective staff augmentation services and partners with leading hardware, software and cloud-based technology firms to provide the infrastructure necessary to run and operate our systems. Our core software applications are comprised of a combination of internally developed and packaged third-party systems. The e-commerce solutions powering www.landsend.com, the Lands’ End Business Outfitters websites, and our international Lands’ End websites are operated out of our own internal data centers as well as through hosting relationships with third parties.
We are in the process of implementing new information technology systems as part of a multi-year plan to expand and upgrade our information technology platforms and infrastructure. In Fiscal 2017 we intend to continue to pursue additional strategic investments, including development of our ERP platform and digital capabilities including enhanced mobile experiences, personalization, data driven decision making and social media integration, and continued enhancements to the digital shopping experiences on our e-commerce platforms.
As described previously, we are implementing an ERP platform and other complementary information technology systems over the next several years to create efficiencies within our internal processes and reporting. Implementation of these solutions and systems is highly dependent on coordination of numerous software, hardware, cloud and system integration providers. See also Item 1A, Risk Factors, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
We purchase, in the ordinary course of business, raw materials and supplies essential to our operations from numerous suppliers around the world, including in the United States. There have been no recent significant availability problems or supply shortages.
Competition
We operate primarily in the apparel industry. The apparel industry is highly competitive. We compete with a diverse group of direct-to-consumer companies and retailers, including national department store chains, men’s
and women’s specialty apparel chains, outdoor specialty stores, apparel catalog businesses, sportswear marketers and online apparel businesses that sell similar lines of merchandise. We compete principally on the basis of merchandise value (quality and price), our established customer list and award-winning customer service, including reliable order fulfillment, our return policy and services and information provided at our user-friendly websites.
Seasonality
We experience seasonal fluctuations in our net revenue and operating results and historically have realized a significant portion of our net revenue and earnings for the year during our fourth fiscal quarter. We generated 34.4%, 33.4% and 32.4% of our net revenue in the fourth fiscal quarter of Fiscal 2016, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014, respectively. Thus, lower than expected fourth quarter net revenue could have an adverse impact on our annual operating results.
Working capital requirements typically increase during the second and third quarters of the fiscal year as inventory builds to support peak shipping/selling periods and, accordingly, typically decrease during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year as inventory is shipped/sold. Cash provided by operating activities is typically higher in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to reduced working capital requirements during that period.
Intellectual Property
Lands’ End owns or has rights to use certain word and design trademarks, service marks, and trade names that are registered or exist under common law in the United States and other jurisdictions. The Lands’ End® trade name and trademark is used both in the United States and internationally, and is material to our business. Trademarks that are important in identifying and distinguishing our products and services are Guaranteed. Period.®, Lands’ End Canvas®, Lighthouse by Lands’ End™, Square Rigger®, Squall®, Super-T™, Drifter™, Outrigger®, Marinac®, and Beach Living®, all of which are owned by us, as well as the licensed marks Supima®, No-Gape®, and others. Other recognized trademarks owned by Lands’ End include SwimMates™, Starfish™, Iron Knees®, Willis & Geiger® and ThermaCheck®. Lands’ End’s rights to some of these trademarks may be limited to select markets.
Employees
We employ approximately 5,000 employees throughout our operations: approximately 4,200 employees in the United States and approximately 800 employees outside the United States. With the seasonal nature of the retail industry, over 2,000 flexible part-time employees join us each year to support our varying peak seasons, including the fourth quarter holiday shopping season. The non-peak workforce is comprised of approximately 18% salaried exempt employees, 41% regular hourly employees and 41% year-round flexible part-time employees.
Pledged Assets
In connection with the Separation, Lands' End entered into the ABL Facility and the Term Loan Facility. All domestic obligations under the Debt Facilities are unconditionally guaranteed by Lands’ End and, subject to certain exceptions, each of its existing and future direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries. In addition, the obligations of the UK Borrower under the ABL Facility are guaranteed by its existing and future direct and indirect subsidiaries organized in the United Kingdom. The ABL Facility is secured by a first priority security interest in certain working capital of the borrowers and guarantors consisting primarily of accounts receivable and inventory. The Term Loan Facility is secured by a second priority security interest in the same collateral, with certain exceptions. 

7

The Term Loan Facility also is secured by a first priority security interest in certain property and assets of the borrowers and guarantors, including certain fixed assets and stock of subsidiaries. The ABL Facility is secured by a second priority security interest in the same collateral. 
Sustainability Initiatives
Lands’ End is working towards improving its sustainable footprint through key practices like waste reduction, purchasing recycled products and through corporate partnerships. Lands' End hopes to inspire customers and other corporations to increase sustainability awareness and initiatives.
We have a focus on raising awareness and educating associates on reducing our internal use of consumables and natural resources. In addition, we have a broad range of recycling and waste management initiatives at our corporate office and distribution centers to address our use of paper products, aluminum cans, glass, electronics and plastic as well as maintenance operations, disposal of non-recyclables with composting and water management. In 2016, we reused or recycled approximately 90% of waste generated at our corporate headquarters. 
Additionally, we believe that we also demonstrate marketplace leadership by participating in industry educational workshops and initiatives. Lands’ End has formed strategic partnerships with organizations like the Sustainable Apparel Coalition, bluesign, National Forest Foundation, and the Clean Lakes Alliance. These partnerships, which respectively operate globally, nationally, and locally allow us to engage at a variety of levels. 
For more information about Lands' End's sustainability efforts please go to www.landsend.com/sustainability/. 
History and Relationship with Sears Holdings
We were founded in 1963, incorporated in Delaware in 1986 and our common stock was listed on the New York Stock Exchange from 1986 to 2002. On June 17, 2002, we became a wholly owned subsidiary of Sears Roebuck. On March 14, 2014, the Sears Holdings board of directors approved the distribution of the issued and outstanding shares of Lands’ End common stock on the basis of 0.300795 shares of Lands’ End common stock for each share of Sears Holdings common stock held on March 24, 2014, the record date for the distribution. Sears Holdings distributed 100 percent of the outstanding common stock of Lands' End to its stockholders on April 4, 2014.
According to statements on form Schedule 13D filed with the SEC by ESL, ESL beneficially owned significant portions of both the Company's and Sears Holdings Corporation's outstanding shares of common stock. Therefore Sears Holdings Corporation, the Company's former parent company, is considered a related party both prior to and subsequent to the Separation. Additionally, in Fiscal 2016, ESL purchased approximately $10.7 million of the Company's outstanding debt at a discount of approximately $2.7 million. Due to the related party relationship, this discount was considered a cancellation of debt under Section 108 of the Internal Revenue Code, triggering additional income tax payments due in the current period for the Company.
In its annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2017, Sears Holdings disclosed that its historical operating results indicate substantial doubt exists related to its ability to continue as a going concern. Sears Holdings also disclosed they believe that actions they have taken in the last 12 months and expected benefits from actions in 2017 are probable of occurring and mitigating the substantial doubt raised by their historical operating results and therefore will satisfy their liquidity needs for the 12 months from issuance of their financial statements.
In connection with and subsequent to the Separation, we entered into various agreements with Sears Holdings or its subsidiaries that govern our relationship with Sears Holdings with respect to the Lands' End Shops at Sears, various general corporate services, and other relationships. Accordingly, the terms of these agreements may be more or less favorable than those we could have negotiated with unaffiliated third parties. See Note 11, Related Party Agreements and Transactions.
