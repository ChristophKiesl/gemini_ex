Overview
 We are a differentiated platform for growing Alcoholic Beverages brands, fueled by the joint capabilities of our data-driven brand development strategy paired with a true omni-channel distribution network. We believe our balanced platform is well-suited to gain market share and drive meaningful long-term growth in the Alcoholic Beverages market. Winc’s mission is to become the leading brand builder within the Alcoholic Beverages industry through an omni-channel growth platform.
 As product innovators focused on building durable brands that consumers love, we have developed a proprietary process, called Ideate, Launch and Amplify, that has allowed us to consistently produce quality wine brands in a capital-efficient fashion. We believe this process is unique within the Alcoholic Beverages industry. The key components of our brand building strategy are as follows:
 Ideate—The Winc digital platform is the starting point for our brand ideation process. Ongoing analysis of consumer data and the behavior of our online consumer base provides near real-time insights into shifting and emerging consumer preferences. For years, we have been learning and constantly refining our understanding of the key signals from our consumer data that we believe have the greatest predictive power. We then combine those signals with an extensive review of industry data trends and qualitative inputs from our winemakers, sommeliers and creative team to discern the most compelling product opportunities for our development team to begin the brand-building process.
 Launch—After our team has delivered a target product from the Ideate process, we design the brand and associated beverage formulation. With our asset-light outsourced production model, we produce initial inventories and prepare to launch the product on the Winc digital platform directly into our consumer base. Once our products begin to be sold on the Winc digital platform, we can quickly identify brands that are demonstrating strong initial traction using a variety of key data points, such as click-through metrics, consumer ratings and social listening and re-order rates. For those brands showing breakout potential, we further test, refine and iterate in a rapid and capital-efficient manner before ultimately Amplifying the most promising brands to broader distribution.
 Amplify—With validation from consumers and proprietary sell-through data from the Winc digital platform, we aim to take one or two of the best performing new brands each year and Amplify them by scaling the new products across our high-volume omni-channel distribution platform. Our proprietary data enables us to better predict and validate demand prior to a broad wholesale launch supported by extensive digital marketing. This approach is designed to reduce the launch-related risk of our brands and allow for superior targeting capabilities, which we believe increases the attractiveness of our brands to wholesale distributors and retailers, both of whom are eager to add predictably high-velocity and profitable brands to their offerings.
 We believe our Ideate, Launch and Amplify brand development process incorporates the “Best of the New” and “Best of the Old” aspects of Alcoholic Beverages brand creation in a truly omni-channel fashion. The “Best of the New” is highlighted by our data-rich DTC relationships via the Winc digital platform. This data is a critical competitive advantage that we use to help shape the ideation and development of our brands. Our digitally native roots also provide us with a strong core competency in digital marketing and data analytics that allows us to interact in a more targeted and direct fashion with end-consumers and Amplify brands in ways the legacy Alcoholic Beverages companies have yet to consistently utilize. Our “Best of the Old” strategy is encompassed by our appreciation of the value creation potential and durable power of proprietary brand development, as well as the scale benefits that can be achieved by leveraging the legacy wholesale distribution channel. Today, the vast majority of wine is still purchased according to the legacy three-tier system, which mandates a supply chain through which, unless selling through DTC licenses, alcohol suppliers may sell only to wholesale distributors, wholesale distributors to retailers and retailers to consumers.
 We view our omni-channel platform as highly complementary because it creates a positive feedback loop where incremental scale on either side of our platform begets scale and success on the other. This “Scale Begets Scale” dynamic allows the online DTC and offline wholesale businesses to be self-reinforcing rather than competing. As our brand portfolio expands over time, we believe our DTC channel will become more desirable to existing and potential online consumers who will have an increasing number of highly rated and recognizable products to choose from each month. We believe over time this will lower our consumer acquisition cost, improve consumer retention rates and increase AOV, thereby allowing us to take a larger share of our consumers' wine-buying wallets. We expect the resulting growth in our DTC channel to provide us with increased scale and SG&A leverage that can be reinvested in strengthening and better powering our data set, which we consider to be critical to driving innovation and effectively launching successful new core products into the wholesale channel. In turn, we expect this brand portfolio to further solidify our relationship with wholesale distributors, resulting in an expansion of retail accounts and shelf space with retailers and greater brand recognition on the part of consumers, which then strengthens our subscription-based DTC offering, and the cycle continues. We believe that this increasingly powerful “Scale Begets Scale” dynamic provides us with a highly differentiated and strong competitive position within the rapidly evolving Alcoholic Beverages marketplace.


At one time, this omni-channel approach might have created the perception of a potential for “channel conflict” between us and wholesale distributors and retailers. However, we believe that our partners within the wholesale channel recognize that the Winc digital platform allows us to provide them with key data to help de-risk brand launches and increase the odds that our brands will become high performers on store shelves. Rather than disrupt the traditional wholesale distribution network, we consider our relationships with wholesale distributors and retailers to be more like strategic partnerships as we help them address the next generation of wine buyers with unique branding, digital marketing capabilities and de-risked brand launches.
 Our Market Opportunity
 The Alcoholic Beverages category represents one of the largest total addressable market opportunities in the entire CPG landscape. The attractiveness of the Alcoholic Beverages market is further enhanced by the highly recurring and frequent nature of product usage by consumers. Finally, leading Alcoholic Beverages companies have consistently reported among the highest profit margins within the broader CPG space. We believe this combination of market size, frequency of consumption and strong profitability makes the Alcoholic Beverages market a very attractive backdrop for us to pursue our open-ended platform development opportunity across other beverage verticals.
 The wine market can be further delineated into three distinct price point ranges: $9.99 or lower retail price per bottle, $10.00 to $29.99 retail price per bottle and $30.00 or higher retail price per bottle. We call these three price bands Value, Premium and Luxury, respectively. While we plan to offer products across several price points over time, we have historically achieved our greatest success by focusing on the large and attractive Premium category. We believe this is due to consumer preferences for a well-regarded flavor profile, a strong brand and a reasonable price point. In our view, the Premium category is where we believe that meaningful scale can be achieved by a winemaker and where we intend to position the vast majority of our wines going forward.
 In addition to our broad exposure to the highly attractive Premium segment of the wine category, we believe we are well positioned to benefit from two additional important trends that are currently re-shaping the Alcoholic Beverages industry:
 First, from a demographic perspective, we believe the rise of Millennials and Gen-Z drinkers, whom we call “Next-Gen” consumers, has the potential to create a large shift in market share across the entire Alcoholic Beverages industry, as demonstrated in the wine industry. Over the last 30 years, Baby Boomers and Gen X have driven wine consumption. Over time, the demographics of wine drinkers are expected to continue to shift to Millennial and Gen-Z consumers who are developing new taste preferences, discovery patterns, consumption frequencies and price points. With a significant majority of our Winc.com members aged 44 or younger, and a branding strategy that strongly resonates with these younger consumers, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the rapidly evolving demographic shift taking place within the wine industry.
 Second, like many other sectors, we believe the Alcoholic Beverages industry is experiencing a meaningful shift to online purchasing. This shift was accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which drove increases in ecommerce spending within the traditionally slow to change Alcoholic Beverages category. We believe that the go-forward opportunity remains even greater and that Alcoholic Beverages remain meaningfully under-indexed relative to other CPG categories in terms of overall ecommerce penetration. Due to our digitally native roots and large current online presence, we believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on these shifting channel dynamics, as more and more consumers routinely discover and order their Alcoholic Beverages products online. Additionally, we believe the biggest winners in the industry will be those that most effectively create a highly synergistic omni-channel purchasing experience for their consumers.
 The Competitive Landscape
 By incorporating the “Best of the New” and “Best of the Old” into our business model, we currently maintain a highly differentiated competitive position within the Alcoholic Beverages industry, as we sit squarely between the legacy shelf-focused brand developers and the newer breed of DTC online-focused wineries.
 Legacy shelf-focused brand aggregators have historically built and consolidated brands over the course of many years with significant capital investments in physical assets, traditional brand marketing and strategic transactions to create the scale necessary to become preferred partners to wholesale distributors, which in turn, has allowed them to maintain a dominant share of shelf space throughout the wholesale channel.
 We firmly believe a true brand builder in the Alcoholic Beverages industry must become a scaled partner to wholesale distributors and retailers, and our aspiration is to become a top ten partner to the major wholesale distributors. However, we plan to accomplish this in a manner that is meaningfully different from legacy brand aggregators. First, we believe our unique, modern branding resonates particularly well with the faster-growing and younger generation of wine consumers, which are becoming an increasingly important demographic to the industry. Second, we believe the combination of data generated from the Winc digital platform, our direct relationship with consumers and our digital marketing expertise can reduce certain risks relating to wholesale brand launches and enables more effective targeting than more traditional branding and marketing techniques. Third, our asset-light outsourced production model is more capital-efficient and reduces time to market for potential break-out brands compared to legacy shelf-focused brand aggregators. Finally, we have found that wholesale distributors and retailers greatly value the additional insights we bring them from our broader data set, which allow them to better understand emerging trends in the rapidly evolving Alcoholic Beverages market.


In stark contrast to our efforts to become a critical partner to wholesale distributors and retail accounts that are seeking to effectively reach the next generation of wine consumers, many online-only wineries that offer a DTC subscription model have made a strategic decision to completely bypass and disintermediate the traditional wholesale distribution channel. We believe this is a less scalable business model with a substantially smaller total addressable market.
 Our goal is to serve all Alcoholic Beverages consumers across all available distribution channels, whether they choose to purchase product in a store, in a restaurant or online. We believe this is best accomplished by building a large portfolio of durable brands that successfully scales through a true omni-channel distribution platform.
 Competitive Strengths
 Highly Innovative, Differentiated and Repeatable Brand Development Strategy—We have used our Ideate, Launch and Amplify framework to launch multiple brands that resonate with consumers. Since January 1, 2016, we have released five brands that, based on their success in both the DTC and wholesale channels, we currently consider our core brands, with two of those being released in 2019 or later. As our online consumer base continues to grow and our processes and data analytics capabilities are further refined, we anticipate building a larger portfolio of brands that will be marketed broadly both throughout the wholesale channel, as well as on the Winc digital platform. We believe this proven ability to successfully launch brands in a repeatable and predictable fashion is a core competency for us and a durable competitive advantage.
 Barrier to Entry Created by Extensive Portfolio of Owned Brands—We have successfully launched and grown multiple highly rated and award-winning wines. Our core brands form the focus of our portfolio and are comprised of a strong and diverse collection of wine brands. Collectively, our brands have won multiple awards, including Summer Water as #56 on the Top 100 wines of 2020 by Wine Enthusiast.
 In our experience, once a wine brand achieves scale, it generally maintains or grows market share for an extended period time. Therefore, we believe, in the aggregate, a growing portfolio of core brands can provide us with a highly recurring revenue stream and SG&A leverage to enable reinvestment in our development strategy and distribution expansion. A large portfolio of successful wine brands also provides us with critical scale advantages that we believe will strengthen our relationships with wholesale distributors and retail chains. Finally, we expect that a large and increasingly well-recognized portfolio of top wine brands will enhance the Winc digital experience, thereby strengthening the performance of our online business.
 Attractive Return on New Product Development—We believe our brand development framework allows us to Ideate and Launch brands in a rapid and capital-efficient fashion. We further believe that our ability to sell newer brands through the Winc digital platform enables us to quickly recoup initial investments, which helps reduce financial risk associated with new product launches. Moreover, when a potentially higher performing brand is identified, we believe it has the opportunity to become a core brand in our portfolio, with appeal across both DTC and wholesale channels, and to represent greater long-term return on invested capital.
We believe our brand development framework and portfolio management strategy represents a repeatable process that allows us to generate attractive returns on successful brand launches while reducing the financial risk associated with new product launches. We believe we have the opportunity to continue to improve on these returns on investments in new products as our omni-channel distribution platform continues to scale with a growing number of online consumers and a larger physical retail account presence in the wholesale channel.
 Uniquely Scaled Data and Analytics Capabilities—We collect a wealth of proprietary data from our online consumers. We use this data, which includes click-through rates, re-order frequency, consumer feedback and additional metrics to help shape our brand development process, optimize the Winc digital platform consumer experience and collaborate effectively with wholesale distributors.
 Global Access to Raw Materials and Dynamic Supply Chain—Due to our asset-light outsourced production model, we are not reliant on any one vineyard or geographic region to source raw material for our brands. As a scale producer, we are able to procure high quality grapes and raw materials from a consistently growing list of sources and create a supply chain that is both deep and diversified. The depth of our raw material procurement abilities has allowed our winemakers to be very creative in their winemaking formulation and enabled our top brands to scale without significant supply constraint. Finally, our asset-light outsourced production model allows us to manage inventory in a highly capital-efficient fashion. We believe this dynamism represents a meaningful strength in comparison to a more traditional asset-heavy winery built around a finite set of vineyards in one geographic region.
 Rapidly Expanding Omni-channel Distribution Network—We believe we have established a resilient and differentiated omni-channel distribution network. Our plan is to continue to grow both our online consumer base and to expand our wholesale presence to at least 50,000 retail accounts over the next several years.
 In our view, a key driver of success in our industry is an ability to synergistically pair proprietary brands that excite consumers with extensive omni-channel distribution. While there are thousands of small wineries in the United States, the vast majority lack the distribution necessary to achieve broad recognition of their brands through the wholesale channel. A lack of extensive distribution is the key barrier to scale for any small or emerging wine brand.
 We are now well down the path of building a fully scaled omni-channel distribution network that will allow us to fully Amplify our brands, both online and offline, to maximize their financial impact, reach more consumers and maximize brand awareness. In line with

our “Scale Begets Scale” strategy, as our DTC channel expands, we expect that we will have increased opportunities to innovate and market new products. Likewise, as our wholesale business scales, we believe that when we launch brands validated through our DTC channel, the brands will scale much more quickly in the wholesale channel. We view this self-reinforcing relationship as a key competitive differentiator in the highly fragmented wine industry, where many producers are destined to remain sub-scale due to a lack of distribution in both channels.
 Growing Scale with Key Wholesale Distributors and Retailers—Historically, there has been little turnover of top suppliers to the industry’s key wholesale distributors, as scaled brand aggregators and the largest wholesale distributors tend to become entrenched partners. To become a key partner to these critical wholesale distributors and fully capitalize on the growth opportunity presented by the legacy distribution system, we intend to continue presenting key wholesale distributors and retailers with a broad portfolio of differentiated brands that we believe will resonate strongly with consumers based on extensive testing and data analysis through the Winc digital platform. We believe our wines are attractive to wholesale distributors due to: (1) the uniqueness of our branding, which resonates strongly with the increasingly important younger average wine drinker; (2) the data-backed evidence of demand for our brands; and (3) superior targeting capabilities due to our data analytic and digital marketing expertise. As sales grow and we expand our portfolio of brands with success across both DTC and wholesale channels, we would expect our relationships with key wholesale distributors to also grow and expand. Once we reach our goal of becoming a top ten wine supplier to the wholesale distributors, these critical relationships become a strong differentiator and large competitive moat for us by helping us grow and maintain shelf space throughout the entire retail landscape.
 Financial Profile Enables Reinvestment to Drive Growth—We believe the recurring nature of our subscription-driven DTC revenues, strong gross margins and our asset-light outsourced business model provide us with sustainable competitive advantages to reinvest in brand building, marketing, consumer acquisition and distribution expansion. Our view is that a strong underlying financial profile that produces SG&A leverage to invest in building scale is critical to our long-term success. Key differentiators of our financial model are as follows:
 •Recurring Nature of Revenues: We believe the stickiness of brands that achieve scale, high frequency usage patterns of Alcoholic Beverages consumers, recurring subscription-based revenues through the Winc digital platform, as well as durable relationships with key wholesale distributors and retailers will enable us to grow steadily over time.
 •Strong Gross Margins: For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, our gross margins were 41.8% and 40.7%, respectively. This allows us to disproportionately invest in growth over the near and intermediate terms, which we believe will increase our operating margins through SG&A leverage as we continue to scale.
 •Flexible Supply Chain and Asset-Light Outsourced Business Model: Our dynamic supply chain and asset-light outsourced production model allow us to use SG&A leverage to invest in building brands. It also allows us to satisfy inventory needs in a more predictable and lower-risk fashion than more asset-heavy legacy wineries.
 First-Class Management Team and Organizational Structure Built for Brand Innovation—Our management team consists of brand-building specialists and operators with broad experience across the CPG industry, experienced winemakers and proven marketing professionals. Over the past several years, this team has demonstrated an ability to develop a high-growth DTC subscription platform and successfully launch a strong portfolio of wine brands into the wholesale channel with speed and scale in a repeatable fashion.
 Growth Strategies
 New Brand Development and Portfolio Optimization—The primary driver of our long-term growth strategy is our ability to consistently and predictably build innovative new products that, in aggregate, become a leading portfolio of owned brands in the Alcoholic Beverages industry. The expansion and optimization of this portfolio remains a key enabler of all our other growth strategies.
 Drive Efficient Online Consumer Acquisition—The Winc digital platform is unique in that our leading wine subscription platform is not only designed to delight consumers but also to bring critical information that delivers strategic value to our brand-building efforts. As a result, the Winc digital platform is a key pillar in our broader omni-channel distribution strategy. However, because online consumer acquisition is not our primary driver of long-term growth, we plan to remain highly disciplined in managing our online marketing initiatives. We believe this strategy allows for high returns on consumer acquisition and short payback periods. By increasing wholesale penetration and continuing to provide new products, we also aim to improve the retention rates and AOVs through a variety of digital analytic and marketing strategies. However, our core belief is that over time, the best and most sustainable way to retain online consumers, and expand their purchases on the Winc digital platform, is to develop the strongest possible core portfolio of widely recognized, differentiated and well-loved brands and make them available on the Winc digital platform. We believe this strategy will result in improved consumer acquisition costs and AOVs as well-recognized brands will draw consumers to the Winc digital platform in a more organic fashion, improve the likelihood that they will remain our online consumers and increase AOVs as we take a larger share of their Alcoholic Beverages buying wallets.
 Multiple Levers for Wholesale Expansion—We believe our opportunity to expand in wholesale is multi-faceted, with several key levers to drive outsized growth:


•Wholesale Retail Account Expansion: Our goal is to leverage our relationships with national and regional wholesale distributors to meaningfully expand our retail accounts from 16,905 retail accounts serviced in 2021 to over 50,000 retail accounts over the next several years. Recent wins with shelf-space at large chains, such as Target, Walmart, Total Wine and Spirits, Kroger and H-E-B, as well as strengthening relationships with key wholesale distributors has increased our confidence in an accelerated path to our retail account growth targets.
 •New Brands Drive SKU Growth: We plan to capitalize on our ability to develop brands that consumers love in an effort to capture more shelf space with additional SKUs at each retail location, which should grow revenues per retail account.
 •Increase Sales Velocity: We plan to continually Amplify and market our core brand portfolio on an ongoing basis to drive sell-through and increase sales velocity. Additionally, we expect relationships with last-mile delivery providers such as Amazon Prime, GoPuff, Instacart and Drizly will help to continue to increase wholesale channel sales velocity.
 Adjacent Category Expansion—We plan to expand our business by creating new innovative products that are closely adjacent to our current wine product offerings, such as Prosecco and ready-to-drink wine cocktails. We also believe that our unique, omni-channel platform could be applied to entirely new categories, such as spirits, beer and non-alcoholic celebratory beverages, significantly increasing our addressable market. Our goal is to create the broadest possible portfolio to maximize our exposure to the Alcoholic Beverages market, and we believe our Ideate, Launch and Amplify brand development process can be leveraged into these other targeted categories in a seamless fashion.
 Growth through Acquisitions in Highly Fragmented Markets—In addition to organic growth of our brand portfolio and distribution scale, we believe we will have opportunity to grow through acquisitions. While our growth and success are not contingent upon future acquisitions, we are constantly evaluating acquisition opportunities and believe our organization is positioned to Amplify any brands we acquire by providing digital marketing expertise and a national wholesale distribution network to accelerate growth and improve a potential target’s existing business. For example, in May 2021, we purchased certain assets of Natural Merchants, Inc., an international wine importer and leading purveyor of natural, organic, biodynamic and vegan wines from around the world.
 Our Products
 Our Portfolio of Core Brands
 Each of our current core brands has individually generated more than $1.0 million in net revenues through the DTC channel and more than $0.5 million through the wholesale channel in the last 12 months, and we believe has the potential to continue to grow sales through the wholesale channel.
 Summer Water—Launched first as a DTC product, Summer Water gained national acclaim without presence in the legacy wholesale channel. Since launching in the wholesale channel, it has continued to scale by achieving high velocity and becoming the #8 best-selling pure play rosé brand in the United States according to Nielsen data as of January 1, 2022. As the brand has scaled, quality continues to improve as new vintages achieve higher ratings by our Winc.com members. SW is a nationally recognized brand, ranking #56 on Wine Enthusiast’s top 100 Wines of the Year in 2020. New line extensions include “Keep it Chill,” a chilled red, “Droplets,” a 187 milliliter single-serve, and “Bubbly,” a sparkling rosé.
 Wonderful Wine Company—Despite being launched during a challenging COVID-19-impacted market, WWC achieved immediate traction with consumers and sold approximately 17,000 cases in 2020. A digital-first strategy built brand awareness rapidly and gained the interest of national retailers, such as Walmart, where the brand launched in the second quarter of 2021. This “better for you, better for the world” brand was the result of proprietary data and insights from our online consumers.
 Lost Poet—The raw material (wine) in LP is our highest-rated red blend with nearly 105,000 ratings in addition to being rated in the top 3% of the world by Vivino in 2017. While the high quality of the wine was validated by our online consumers, we did not have a scalable brand. To reach a key shopper profile for our retailers, we crafted a brand and marketing strategy to target younger female consumers by partnering with Atticus, a best-selling author and Instagram poet. The highly successful re-launch quickly achieved national press, influencer pick-up and a placement with Target.
 Folly of the Beast—Our award-winning winemaker, Ryan Zotovich, applied his luxury winemaking experience to create uncompromising value in this under $20.00 Pinot Noir. Folly delivers a fresh and bright style favored by younger consumers, having been ordered by approximately 203,000 distinct users as of December 31, 2021. In addition to receiving 93 points from Tasting Panel in 2019, Folly is our best-selling and highest rated Pinot Noir that continues to scale in wholesale. The brand includes small-lot single vineyard bottlings from some of the top Pinot Noir vineyards in California and a recently launched Chardonnay.
Chop Shop—We positioned Chop as the perfect pairing for America’s favorite culinary past time, BBQ. A favorite of our consumers with a 4.23 rating out of 5.00 and over 151,000 reviews as of February 2022, Chop continues to scale across channels.
 Our Portfolio of Non-Core Brands
 Cherries and Rainbows—Low-sulfur winemaking has historically been an attribute of the small and fragmented natural wine scene. Our product team worked diligently to perfect high-quality, low-sulfur winemaking at scale before launching. The delicious flavor, low-sulfur and contemporary branding have contributed to this brand’s rapid rise first with Whole Foods and now with H-E-B. Initially

launched as a red wine, the brand’s success led to our extension of the line to include a white wine. The use of our DTC channel to test consumer receptiveness to the white wine extension exemplifies our Ideate, Launch, Amplify brand building strategy. The consumer feedback we have received from our DTC channel and early wholesale channel traction lead us to believe that Cherries and Rainbows will become a core brand over the coming years.
 Organic and Sustainable Wines—Internal data indicates that organic and sustainable wines are of growing importance to younger consumers. This emerging preference is confirmed with the success of our brands, such as WWC and Cherries and Rainbows. Additionally, through the purchase of certain assets of Natural Merchants, Inc., we have introduced an organic Top-100 Wine Enthusiast brand into our portfolio and established supplier relationships with prominent family-owned organic specialists. Among these is the La Cantina Pizzolato brand family, which includes some of Winc's fastest growing SKUs available at key national retailers such as Whole Foods, Natural Grocers and Sprouts. We believe that our digitally native model will help us increase our access to organic suppliers, providing data-driven insights to create healthier beverages for the future.
 Anchor Portfolio—Our asset-light outsourced production model allows for continual optimization around our consumers tastes and preferences. Each year, our wine team seeks to improve our DTC experience through a globally diverse and constantly improving selection of over 100 wines.
 New Products
 Our innovation pipeline broadens our platform and expands our business. The primary focuses for our product expansion are collaborations, line extensions, new categories, and new formats. Each new launch allows for targeted marketing and provides potential incremental value to both the online and offline channels.
 •Line Extensions—Leveraging the brand equity and consumer base of our core brands creates an opportunity for increase in share and growth.
 •New Brands—The fast-to-market and capital-efficient elements of our platform create an opportunity to continually innovate within traditional categories to assess breakout potential.
 •Ready-to-Drink Cocktails—Our innovation pipeline includes formulations and brands to address this rapidly expanding market opportunity with our unique omni-channel strategy and capabilities.
 •Alternative Packaging Formats—Younger consumers are driving packaging innovation in the wine space. Portability, convenience and environmental impact are key drivers in this innovation. Cans, Tetra, box, bag and PET (polyethylene terephthalate) packaging options are currently in development. We expect to launch a 1.5 liter Astropouch portable bag with spigot under the brand name "DIME" in early 2022.
 •Spirits and Beer—As the digital landscape continues to evolve and younger consumers purchase across categories and the digital landscape, we believe we are uniquely positioned to potentially expand into other categories within the Alcoholic Beverages industry.
 •Non-Alcoholic Celebratory Beverages—Our first non-alcoholic wine launched in 2021, and we see expansion opportunities in non-alcoholic and functional beverages.
 Company History
 Winc (formerly Club W) launched in 2011 with the goal of making discovering great wine easy. Our founders set out to create a model that catered to a broad audience to curate and personalize the process of buying and enjoying wine. Under the guidance of winemaker, sommelier and co-founder Brian Smith, Club W transitioned to producing fully proprietary products in 2014. Club W rebranded as Winc in 2016. The rebrand was not only a reflection of our past transition into fully proprietary products, but our expansion beyond our successful online membership. As consumers were beginning to foreshadow our most successful products through their proprietary data, our wholesale channel was launched in late 2015. Over the past six years, we have continued to focus on building our portfolio of brands to scale both the DTC and wholesale channels.
 Omni-Channel Platform
 DTC
 Winc.com is one component of our digital platform and provides an authentic brand experience for our consumers while driving engagement and also providing feedback for future product development. In addition, we have dedicated brand websites through which online consumers can purchase our core brands.
 We acquire online consumers through a mix of paid and non-paid advertising. Our paid advertising may include search engine marketing, display, paid social media and product placement and traditional advertising, such as direct mail, television, radio and magazine advertising. Our non-paid advertising efforts include search engine optimization, non-paid social media, email and SMS marketing.
 Our Winc.com online process helps guide consumers towards a discounted first purchase, typically consisting of a four-bottle order and then encourages consumers to sign up for a Winc.com membership. Our Winc.com membership is a subscription through which

members are charged a set monthly amount and then given credits that can be used at any time to purchase products on Winc.com. Unused credits roll over each month and never expire. This credit model allows us to collect predictable revenue monthly from our consumers, while allowing our consumers the flexibility of ordering wines they want when they need them.
 We believe our DTC platform provides strategic benefit to our entire ecosystem. Through the Winc.com shopping experience, members have the option of selecting from our curated recommendations or purchasing products of their choice. After each purchase, members are encouraged to rate their wines in order to improve their recommendations in the future—this direct consumer connection allows us to collect data on our products and unlock unique consumer insights that then help to improve our ability to market and sell through alternative channels. It also allows for an improved experience for our consumers, helping to increase the value of our offerings to them through personalized recommendations.
 Wholesale
 In the United States, Alcoholic Beverages may be sold either subject to TTB regulation through the government-mandated three-tier system or directly to consumers through a DTC channel, subject to other Alcoholic Beverages rules and regulations. We historically have sold through our DTC channel, but increasingly we are selling through the three-tier system, which we refer to as our wholesale channel. The three-tier system establishes three categories of licensees: the producer (the party that makes the wine), the wholesale distributor (the party that buys the wine from the producer and then sells to the retailer) and the retailer (the party that sells the wine to the end consumer). In this wholesale framework, we act as the producer, selling our products to distributors who in turn contract directly with retailers.
 Through our relationships with wholesale distributors, we are able to distribute across all 50 states and, during 2021, we serviced 16,905 retail accounts across 12 countries. Wholesale distributor accounts are split between on-premise and off-premise retailers. Of the retail accounts serviced in 2021, over 13,000 were for off-premise consumption (grocery stores, wine shops and liquor stores) and over 3,400 were on-premise consumption (restaurants, bars and other venues), and we sold approximately 201,500 cases of wine through our wholesale channel to these off-premise and on-premise retailers, collectively, during the year. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, off-premise wine sales for the U.S. wine industry increased as a percentage of total U.S. wine sales due to quarantining and restaurant shutdowns. Our largest retail accounts through distributors for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 were Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, Walmart, H-E-B, Target, Albertsons and Central Market. Under the three-tier system, distributors directly manage sales to our retail accounts, while we maintain strong relationships with large retailers in order to facilitate brand creation and growth.
Our typical agreements with distributors generally have a term of approximately five years and can be terminated by the distributor for any reason upon advance notice or by either party if the other party is in breach, though the laws and regulations of several states prohibit changes of wholesale distributors except under certain limited circumstances, which makes it difficult to terminate a wholesale distributor for poor performance without reasonable cause as defined by applicable statutes. Distributors purchase products from us at prevailing prices in the applicable territory.
Winemaking
 With the vast majority of work happening in the vineyard, we have a long-term focus on investing in sustainable and organic farming and winemaking practices. Because at the heart of all great wine is great raw material, we are champions of minimal intervention winemaking practices, which allows us to respect the raw product, shape award-winning wines and leave vineyards in a healthy state for future harvests. We seek low sugar, low sulfite, vegan wines, which we believe deliver the most natural expression of quality.
 We source from exceptional vineyards and partner with exceptional winemakers from around the world. Our relationships with independent winemakers and growers allow us to deliver even greater quality and diversity. The hundreds of unique wines we have bottled from around the globe range from classic blends to obscure, single vineyard fringe projects. We strive to showcase the best that every region, varietal and style has to offer, at the best value possible.
 By deploying a multipronged sourcing strategy on a global basis, we are able to adapt to changing consumer market dynamics, opportunistic sourcing and shifting consumer demand. We believe our strategy across categories allows us the flexibility and scope to source the best possible product in a more capital-efficient fashion than most at scale wineries whose product decisions are driven by significant assets or holdings.
 Supply Chain Overview
 We have developed a highly efficient supply chain that minimizes capital investment and provides a broad range of supply and production alternatives.
 Use of co-manufacturers
 We operate using an asset-light outsourced model by leveraging a network of co-manufacturers in California to accomplish our various production and bottling needs; a relationship known in the wine industry as alternating proprietorship. This model allows us to lower the up-front capital expenditures necessary to manufacture wines and reduce the personnel costs related to manufacturing. We dictate to the co-manufacturing facility all workflows, and the co-manufacturing facility, in turn, carries out the winery production. Under our

direction, we have the ability to work with our co-manufacturers to maintain high standards, oversight and ensure compliance with all requirements while utilizing the co-manufacturers’ facility and staff on our behalf.
 Inventory management
 We aim to curate a diverse and balanced selection of wines to our consumers. Inventory is managed by the constant evaluation of consumer data and channel performance, allowing us to embrace omni-channel inventory balancing. As a result, we have never experienced dead stock, which we believe is very unique in the traditional winery landscape. Through data-driven models, we have been able to predict and anticipate demand for our products. For example, we analyzed ratings and site behavior for the 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon varietal of our Porter & Plot brand to launch the same wine as a limited exclusive in our wholesale channel. Our product planning strategy takes into account many factors, including price points, varietals, countries of origin, wine style and brands. Our proprietary DTC data enables us to understand buying behaviors and product preferences, read SKU velocities and evaluate consumer ratings to inform our overall product breath and volume needs. Traditional wineries do not have access to such real-time performance indicators and must wait for third-party data, which is often significantly lagging to current volume, to make decisions on a go-forward plan. As a result, traditional wineries invest in product, even new vintages, before they have a sense of performance. We believe our data-driven production plan is incredibly nimble and enables our inventory to flex up or down based on the demands of our DTC and wholesale channels. Additionally, balancing inventory between channels with our biggest brands means we can release new vintages and wines in-line with online consumer and wholesale buyer expectations.
 Sourcing
 We approach sourcing under two main channels: grape to glass and contract wines. There are three categories of contract wines: contract, spot market and case good import sourcing. By deploying a multipronged sourcing strategy on a global basis, our team has the ability to adapt to changing consumer market dynamics and shifting consumer demand and engage in opportunistic sourcing. We believe our strategy across categories allows us the flexibility and scope to source the best possible product in a capital-efficient fashion not typically employed with more vertically integrated traditional wineries.
 •Grape to glass: We utilize our direct grower relationships and broker network to secure grapes for these programs. We deploy a grape to glass strategy for projects that require a very distinct style. Summer Water is a great example of this strategy. The grapes and winemaking for this project are very specific to achieve the quality and style that has made it so successful. We believe thoughtful sourcing, farming and winemaking are integral to achieving this level of quality even as we continue to scale.
 •Contract wine: Contract wine is wine that is purchased from a third party to make on our behalf. Generally, the third party is vertically integrated, and we can leverage that integration by signing a bulk wine agreement that provides a high quality-to-price ratio and that the wine will be made under the direction of our winemaking team. Contract wine holds four main benefits: (i) securing hard to find and in-demand varietals, (ii) securing long-term growth hedging against any possible short supply, (iii) establishing a consistent price point and quality for a component of a blend or brand and (iv) cash flow efficiency. Under these agreements, we are only required to put a deposit on wine, as opposed to realizing all costs and then holding in tank until it matures and is ready for bottle (a process typically ranging from six to twelve months). These contracts generally have terms ranging from one to three years. Our winemaking team works in collaboration with these third parties to shape the wines and pursue optimization and improvements on quality with each new vintage. 
 •Spot market: Components of blends or wines purchased outside of contract are classified as spot market purchases. While we have a trusted network of growers and collaborators, global supply and demand of high-quality wine is rarely in balance. We believe we are in a position to take advantage of these conditions when it ultimately benefits our consumers with respect to price and eventual wine quality. This represents the most capital efficient part of the supply chain as it is just-in-time sourcing. While not our core, this strategy has been very helpful in efficiently scaling production to meet high growth and allows for low-risk testing of new collaborators and styles.
 •Case good imports: We utilize our supplier relationships to import finished case goods for the majority of our natural and organic wine brands, most of which we sell in our wholesale channel. We are licensed to import and sell these brands in the United States, and we are the exclusive U.S. importer and seller of several of these brands.
Bottling
 As of December 31, 2021, we have partnered with seven different bottling facilities, utilizing alternating proprietor agreements, within the State of California. Each facility possesses its own niche strengths and capabilities, including organic certification, cost and scale flexibility and formulation and packaging competencies. Our dedicated and experienced winemaking and product operations teams manage the planning, production and supply chain to ensure bottling timelines, budgets and the needs of our sales channels are met.
Labeling
 We have in-house branding and compliance teams that work hand-in-hand to create visually appealing labels for our consumers in accordance with TTB requirements. Labels are printed by various vendors in the United States and shipped to our bottling facilities in

accordance with production timelines. We work with several different vendors with the aim of optimizing pricing and maintaining access to the latest printing capabilities and technology.
 Warehousing and Product Distribution
 Finished inventory is freighted to our two warehouse and fulfillment centers, which are located in Santa Maria, California and Garnet Valley, Pennsylvania. These bi-coastal locations allow delivery of approximately 75% of orders within two days and 97% of orders within three days, using ground shipping. Our investment in these Winc-operated warehouses differentiates us from competitors who often use third-party logistics. By comparison, we custom pack and ship finished products to our online consumers across the United States and house inventory for wholesale pick-up.
 Inventory levels are tracked and maintained through our warehouse management system. We regularly evaluate our distribution infrastructure and capacity to monitor our ability to meet our anticipated needs and support our continued growth across all sales channels.
 As a result of our direct involvement in warehousing and product distribution, we believe we have greater flexibility on multi-channel fulfillment. In fact, we have even been engaged by direct competitors to fulfill and ship orders in the past due to our high-level performance and product expertise.
 Shipping and Delivery
 Inventory to fulfill our DTC orders is stored between two Winc-operated fulfillment centers. Inventory is balanced between these two warehouses to pick, pack and ship orders based on best-cost-routing to ensure the shortest delivery times and lowest shipping cost. We have negotiated proprietary contracts with the largest national shippers, with FedEx shipping the majority of our DTC orders. Final delivery to consumers through FedEx requires age verification and signature.
Environmental, Social and Governance Practices
 We are committed to making wines that not only taste good today, but also contribute to good for tomorrow. Environmental sustainability is a key focus across all parts of our business, from the farms and vineyards we partner with to the bottles and boxes our consumers receive. Additionally, we strive to operate a socially impactful company that considers the well-being of all persons involved in our process to deliver great products to our consumers.
The Vineyard and Winery
 Sustainability is a winemaking philosophy that encourages mindfulness in three categories: (i) social (livable wages, benefits, safe working environments, continued education and career growth), (ii) ecological (stewardship of the land, i.e., safe usage of agrichemicals, responsible water usage, vineyard health through cover crops and the preservation of local flora and fauna), and (iii) economic (a viable business model that supports company health and longevity). Our sustainable wine follows the philosophy outlined above and is all Certified Sustainable (as certified through third-party agencies—Lodi Rules, SIP or CSWGA). Certified Sustainable means the vineyard and wine have passed rigid, non-negotiable standards as outlined by the applicable agency.
Organic International Sourcing
 The majority of our international sourcing from France, Spain, Argentina and Italy is currently certified organic. Grapes are certified organic by a third party (NOP, ECCOCERT, USDA or CCOF), and, in order to label any domestic or international wines as organic, all certification must be verified by the TTB. In addition, our May 2021 purchase of certain assets of Natural Merchants, Inc., an international wine importer, gives us core capabilities and access to organically farmed grapes that will be used across our products to increase the amount of sustainably and organically farmed grapes we use in our wines.
Environmentally Friendly Logistics and Manufacturing
 By using flexi-tanks to ship more than twice as much wine per container and by bottling closer to the point of sale, we reduce our carbon footprint from shipping. In addition, when we transfer our wines over road, rather than using refrigerated trucks, which emit carbon dioxide and increase vehicle fuel demand, we opt for reusable insulated blankets and truck liners.
The boxes our online consumers receive are made from 70% post-consumer materials and are 100% recyclable. They have been designed to use the least amount of corrugate possible while keeping our online consumers’ wine secure for delivery to their doorstep. Additionally, we expect to switch to Vinc Neo Corks in the majority of our future SKU production. These corks are 100% plant based, 100% sustainable and made from discarded materials. We have also removed foils from most of our bottles to further reduce waste, and most of the foils that we have not removed are now made from polylaminate, which is more easily recyclable than aluminum counterparts. We also expect to continue to incorporate light weight glass into our production, which requires less energy and less water to manufacture than the average weight bottle.
Human Capital Management


We are building a team that shares our goal of creating products that help to enhance our consumer’s everyday celebrations. We are led by an experienced executive team. However, without the talented individuals who work at Winc, our leadership team would not have been able to execute on our success to date.
 We are growing fast and recognize that the talented individuals who work at Winc are at the center of our success. As of December 31, 2021, we had a total of 100 full-time employees, as well as a limited number of temporary employees and consultants. In building our high-performing teams, we have invested in leadership, marketing, digital and technology capabilities. Our core values embrace passionate problem-solving, curiosity and open-mindedness, challenging the status quo, ownership and execution, teamwork, collaboration and fun. We offer a competitive compensation and benefits program and opportunities for our employees to grow and develop personally and professionally. We maintain a strong relationship with our employees and have never experienced a labor-related work stoppage.
 IT Systems
 The Winc digital platform has been built by our internal team in order to execute on our membership-based subscription model, support our dedicated brand websites and deliver on a best-in-class online consumer experience through unique and proprietary features. Through this platform, we are able to operationalize our credits-based membership model and have a full suite of customization opportunities on Winc.com, something that DTC businesses built on out-of-the-box platforms may not have. Additionally, our homegrown digital product experimentation platform allows us to rapidly test new ideas to improve consumer acquisition efficiency, gather consumer feedback and data, increase average order value, and improve the consumer experience.
 Competition
 The Alcoholic Beverages industry generally, and the wine industry in particular, is intensely competitive. We compete with online DTC wine retailers, such as Naked Wines, Firstleaf and Bright Cellars, which curate wines based on consumers’ preferences, and online wine clubs. However, unlike us, none of these companies function as fully integrated wineries with nationally distributed brands. We believe our brands attract consumer loyalty and give us a competitive advantage.
 In addition to online wine retailers, we also compete with other wineries that ship directly to consumers and distribute their wines through third parties to restaurants and brick-and-mortar retailers, such as Constellation Brands, E & J Gallo Winery, Vintage Wine Estates and Duckhorn Vineyards. The wines we produce and distribute compete with domestic and foreign wines in the premium, super-premium and ultra-premium wine market segments. Our wines also compete with other alcoholic and, to a lesser degree, non-Alcoholic Beverages, for shelf space in retail stores and for marketing focus by independent wholesale distributors, many of which carry extensive brand portfolios.
 We believe our ability to compete effectively in our industry is primarily on the basis of developing a portfolio of high-quality and culturally relevant brands and innovative products that resonate with our consumers.
 Intellectual Property
 Our ability to compete in our industry depends in part on our ability to obtain, maintain, establish, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights. We protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of trademark and trade secret protection, and other intellectual property protections under applicable law. We register domain names, trademarks, and service marks in the United States and abroad. We also seek to protect and avoid disclosure of our intellectual property through confidentiality, non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements with our employees, and through appropriate agreements with our suppliers and others. Our intellectual property is an important component of our business, and we believe that our know-how and continued innovation are important to developing and maintaining our competitive position. We also believe having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable on our products is an important factor in continuing to build our brand and distinguish our products. We consider the WINC logo trademarks to be among our most valuable intellectual property assets. In addition, we have registered the trademarks for many of our wines and product names and have also obtained trademark protection for several of our tag lines. Several of our wine brands, services and accessories are under registered U.S. trademarks. Each registration is renewable indefinitely so long as the Company is making a bona fide usage of the trademark. As of December 31, 2021, between the United States and foreign jurisdictions, we own approximately 110 registered trademarks and 35 pending trademarks, including registrations for “WINC” and “SUMMER WATER”. We do not currently own any patents or registered copyrights and primarily rely on trademarks and trade secret protection.
Government Regulation
 Regulatory Framework
 We, along with our contract growers, producers, manufacturers, wholesale distributors, retail accounts and ingredients and packaging suppliers, are subject to extensive regulations in the United States and abroad by federal, state, local and foreign government authorities with respect to registration, production processes, product attributes, packaging, labeling, storage, shipping and distribution of wine.
 We are also subject to state and local tax requirements in all states where our wine is sold. We and our third-party providers monitor the requirements of relevant jurisdictions to maintain compliance with tax liability and reporting matters.
 Alcohol-Related Regulation


We are subject to extensive alcohol-related regulation in the United States by federal, state and local laws regulating the production, distribution and sale of Alcoholic Beverages, including by the TTB and the FDA. The TTB is primarily responsible for overseeing alcohol production records supporting tax obligations, issuing wine labeling guidelines, including grape source and bottle fill requirements, as well as reviewing and issuing certificates of label approval, which are required for the sale of wine through interstate commerce. We carefully monitor compliance with TTB rules and regulations, as well the state law of each state in which we sell our wines. For example, in California, we are subject to alcohol-related licensing and regulations by many authorities, including the ABC. ABC agents and representatives investigate applications for licenses to sell Alcoholic Beverages, report on the moral character and fitness of alcohol license applicants and the suitability of premises where sales are to be conducted and enforce California Alcoholic Beverages laws. We are also subject to municipal authorities with respect to aspects of our operations, including applicable land use laws and the terms of our use permits.
 Employee and Occupational Safety Regulation
 We are subject to certain state and federal employee safety and employment practices regulations, including regulations issued pursuant to OSHA and regulations governing prohibited workplace discriminatory practices and conditions, including those regulations relating to COVID-19 virus transmission mitigation practices. These regulations require us to comply with manufacturing safety standards, including protecting our employees from accidents, providing our employees with a safe and non-hostile work environment and being an equal opportunity employer.
Environmental Regulation
 As a result of our agricultural and wine production activities, we and certain third parties with which we work are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Federal regulations govern, among other things, air emissions, wastewater and storm water discharges, and the treatment, handling and storage and disposal of materials and wastes. State environmental regulations and authorities intended to address and oversee environmental issues are largely state-level analogs to federal regulations and authorities intended to perform similar purposes. For example, in California, we are subject to state-specific rules, such as those contained in the California Environmental Quality Act, California Air Resources Act, Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act, California Water Code sections 13300-13999 and Title 23 of the California Administrative Code and various sections of the Health and Safety Code. We are also subject to municipal environmental regulations that address a number of elements of our wine production process, including air quality, the handling of hazardous waste, recycling, water use and discharge, emissions and traffic impacts.
Labeling Regulation
 Many of our wines are identified by their appellation of origin, which are among the most highly regarded wine growing regions in the world. An appellation may be present on a wine label only if it meets the requirements of applicable state and federal regulations that seek to ensure the consistency and quality of wines from a specific territory. These appellations designate the specific geographic origin of most or all (depending on the appellation) of the wine’s grapes, and can be a political subdivision (e.g., a country, state or county) or a designated viticultural area. The rules for vineyard designation are similar. Most of our labels maintain the same appellation of origin from year to year. From time to time, our winemakers choose to change the appellation of one of our wines to take advantage of high-quality grapes in other areas or to change the profile of a wine.
Privacy and Security Regulation
 We collect personal information from individuals. Accordingly, we are or may become subject to numerous data privacy and security related regulations, including U.S. state privacy, security and breach notification laws. Certain U.S. states have adopted robust data privacy and security laws and regulations and others are considering doing so. For example, the CCPA, which took effect in 2020, imposes obligations and restrictions on businesses regarding their collection, use and sharing of personal information and provides new and enhanced data privacy rights to California residents, such as affording them the right to access and delete their personal information and to opt out of certain sharing of personal information. Further, the CPRA was voted into law by California residents in November 2020. The CPRA significantly amends the CCPA and imposes additional data protection obligations on covered companies doing business in California, including additional consumer rights processes and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It also creates a new California data protection agency specifically tasked with enforcing the law, which will likely result in increased regulatory scrutiny of California businesses in the areas of data protection and security. In addition, the FTC and many state attorneys general are interpreting existing federal and state consumer protection laws to impose evolving standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and security of information about individuals. As we expand our business in the future, we may increasingly become subject to data privacy and security laws in foreign jurisdictions. In response to the data privacy laws and regulations discussed above and those in other countries in which we do business, we have implemented several technological safeguards, processes, contractual third-party provisions, and employee trainings to help ensure that we handle information about our employees and consumers in a compliant manner. We maintain a privacy policy and related procedures and train our workforce to understand and comply with applicable privacy laws. See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property and Data Privacy” for additional information regarding the risks related to compliance with data privacy and security laws and their potential effect on us.
