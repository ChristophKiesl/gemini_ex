 Item 1. Business.
 OVERVIEW 
 The following organization chart sets forth our wholly-owned subsidiaries:

General 
 On February 4, 2019, the Company registered its common stock, having a par value of $.0001 per share, pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") and is effective pursuant to General Instruction A.(d). 
 SusGlobal Energy Corp. ("SusGlobal") was formed by articles of amalgamation on December 3, 2014, in the Province of Ontario, Canada and its executive office is in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, at 200 Davenport Road. Our telephone number is 416-223-8500. Our website address is www.susglobalenergy.com. Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K are all available, free of charge, on our website as soon as practicable after we file the reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). SusGlobal Energy Corp., a company in the start-up stages and Commandcredit Corp. ("Commandcredit"), an inactive Canadian public company, amalgamated to continue business under the name of SusGlobal Energy Corp.
 On May 23, 2017, SusGlobal filed an Application for Authorization to continue in another Jurisdiction with the Ministry of Government Services in Ontario and a certificate of corporate domestication and certificate of incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware under which it changed its jurisdiction of incorporation from Ontario to the State of Delaware (the "Domestication"). In connection with the Domestication each of the currently issued and outstanding common shares were automatically converted on a one-for-one basis into common shares compliant with the laws of the state of Delaware (the "Shares"). As a result of the Domestication, pursuant to Section 388 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), SusGlobal continued its existence under the DGCL as a corporation incorporated in the State of Delaware. The business, assets and liabilities of SusGlobal and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, as well as its principal location and fiscal year, were the same immediately after the Domestication as they were immediately prior to the Domestication. SusGlobal filed a Registration Statement on Form S-4 to register the Shares and this registration statement was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on May, 23, 2017.

SusGlobal is a renewables company focused on acquiring, developing and monetizing a global portfolio of proprietary technologies in the waste to energy and regenerative products application.
 When the terms "the Company," "we," "us" or "our" are used in this document, those terms refer to SusGlobal Energy Corp., and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, SusGlobal Energy Canada Corp., SusGlobal Energy Canada I Ltd., SusGlobal Energy Belleville Ltd., and 1684567 Ontario Inc.
 On December 11, 2018, the Company began trading on the OTCQB venture market exchange, under the ticker symbol SNRG.
 With the growing amount of organic wastes being produced by society as a whole, a solution for sustainable global management of these wastes must be achieved. SusGlobal through its proprietary technology and processes is equipped and confident to deliver this objective. Management believes renewable energy is the energy of the future. Sources of this type of energy are more evenly distributed over the earth's surface than finite energy sources, making it an attractive alternative to petroleum-based energy. Biomass, one of the renewable resources, is derived from organic material such as forestry, food, plant and animal residuals. SusGlobal can therefore help you turn what many consider waste into precious energy and regenerative products. The portfolio will be comprised of four distinct types of technologies: (a) Process Source Separated Organics ("SSO") in anaerobic digesters to divert from landfills and recover biogas. This biogas can be converted to gaseous fuel for industrial processes, electricity to the grid or cleaned for compressed renewable gas. (b) Increasing the capacity of existing infrastructure (anaerobic digesters) to allow processing of SSO to increase biogas yield. (c) Utilize recycled plastics to produce liquid fuels and (d) process SSO and digestate to produce an organic compost or a pathogen free organic liquid fertilizer. The convertibility of organic material into valuable end products such as biogas, liquid biofuels, organic fertilizers and compost shows the utility of renewables. These products can be converted into electricity, fuels and marketed to agricultural operations that are looking for an increase in crop yields, soil amendment and environmentally-sound practices. This practice also diverts these materials from landfills and reduces Greenhouse Gas Emissions ("GHG") that result from landfilling organic wastes. The Company can provide peace of mind that the full lifecycle of organic material is achieved, global benefits are realized and stewardship for total sustainability is upheld. It is management's objective to grow SusGlobal into a significant sustainable waste to energy and regenerative products provider, as Leaders in The Circular Economy®.
 We believe the project and services offered can benefit both the public and private markets. The following includes some of our work managing organic waste streams: Anaerobic Digestion, Dry Digestion, Biogas Production, Wastewater Treatment, In-Vessel Composting, SSO Treatment, Biosolids Heat Treatment, Leachate Management and Composting.
 The Company can provide a full range of services for handling organic residuals in a period where innovation and sustainability are paramount. From start to finish we offer in-depth knowledge, a wealth of experience and cutting-edge technology for handling organic waste.
 The primary focus of the services SusGlobal provides includes identifying idle or underutilized anaerobic digesters and integrating our technologies with capital investment to optimizing the operation of the existing digesters to reach their full capacity for processing SSO. Our processes not only divert significant organic waste from landfills, but also result in methane avoidance, with significant GHG reductions from waste disposal. The processes also produce renewable energy through the conversion of wastewater biosolids and organic wastes in the same equipment (co-digestion) and valuable end products such as biogas, electricity and organic fertilizer, both dry and liquid, considered Class AA organic fertilizer.

Currently, the primary customers are municipalities in both rural and urban centers throughout southern and central Ontario, Canada. Where necessary, to be in compliance with provincial and local environmental laws and regulations, SusGlobal submits applications to the respective authorities for approval prior to any necessary engineering being carried out.

  10

On May 23, 2019, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the "May 2019 SPA") with one investor (the "May 2019 Investor") pursuant to which the Company issued to the May 2019 Investor one 12% unsecured convertible promissory note (the "May 2019 Investor Note") in the principal amount of $250,000. On this date, the Company received proceeds of $204,250, net of transaction related expenses of $45,750.
 The maturity date of the May 2019 Investor note was May 23, 2020.
 As a result of the unsecured convertible notes not having been repaid by their respective due dates, these defaults resulted in the principal balance of each of the May 2019, July 2019, and October 2019 Investor Notes increasing by 10% and the interest rate on each of those notes increasing from 12% to 24% annually.
 On January 20, 2021, the October 2019 Investor, the July 2019 Investor and the May 2019 Investor, accepted in full 2,100,000 common shares of the Company representing payment in full of all obligations due and owing under their unsecured convertible promissory notes.

Each First Note contains a $25,000 Original Issue Discount such that the issue price of each First Note was $250,000. The proceeds on the issuance of the First Notes were received from the March 2019 Investors upon the signing of the March 2019 SPAs. The proceeds on the issuance of the Back-End Notes were initially received by the issuance of two offsetting $250,000 secured notes to the Company by the March 2019 Investors (the "Buyer Notes"), provided that prior to conversion of the Back-End Notes, the March 2019 Investors must have paid back the Back-End Notes in cash.
 Although the March 2019 SPAs are dated March 7, 2019 and March 8, 2019 (each, a "March 2019 Effective Date"), they became effective upon the receipt in cash of the issue price by the March 2019 Investors. On March 11, 2019, the Company received cash of $456,000, net of transaction-related expenses, for the First Notes from the March 2019 Investors.
  11

Since the unsecured convertible promissory noted were not repaid by their due dates, these defaults resulted in the outstanding balance (principal plus accrued interest) increasing by 10% and the interest rate on the 2019 March Investor Notes increasing from 12% to 24% annually.
 During the year ended December 31, 2020, the March 2019 Investors converted a total of $91,802 (2019-$75,000) of their March 2019 Investor Notes.
 In addition, on December 24, 2020, one of the two March 2019 Investors accepted a payment of $165,000 representing payment in full of all obligations due and owing under their March 2019 Investor Note. This resulted in a gain on forgiveness of debt of $119,983, including accrued interest of $68,085, disclosed under other income (loss) in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
 On January 19, 2021, the remaining March 2019 Investor and the Company reached an agreement for payment in full of all obligations due and owing under its convertible promissory notes by payments totaling $550,000, $50,000 on January 20, 2021, $200,000 on or before March 1, 2021 which was converted to 1,075,124 shares on March 11, 2021 and $300,000 on or before March 31, 2021. The payment due on or before March 31, 2021 was extended to April 29, 2021.
 On January 28, 2019, the Company entered into securities purchase agreements (the "January 2019 SPAs") with three investors (the "January 2019 Investors") pursuant to which the Company issued to the January 2019 Investors 12% unsecured convertible promissory notes (the "January 2019 Investor Notes") in the aggregate principal amount of $337,500, with such principal and the interest thereon convertible into shares of the Company's common stock (the "Common Stock") at the January 2019 Investors' option. Although the January 2019 SPAs are dated January 28, 2019 (the "January 2019 Effective Date"), they became effective upon the receipt in cash of the issue price by the January 2019 Investors.
 The amounts of $102,500, $100,000, and $100,000, totaling $302,500, represented the proceeds to the Company, net of transaction-related expenses, for the January 2019 Notes from the January 2019 Investors and were received in cash from February 1 through February 4, 2019.
 The maturity date of each of the January 2019 Investor Notes is January 28, 2020 (the "January 2019 Maturity Dates"). The Notes bear interest at a rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum (the "January 2019 Interest Rate"), which interest shall be paid by the Company to the January 2019 Investors in Common Stock at any time the January 2019 Investors send a notice of conversion to the Company. The January 2019 Investors are entitled to, at their option, convert all or any amount of the principal face amount and any accrued but unpaid interest of the January 2019 Notes into Common Stock, at any time, at a conversion price for each share of Common Stock equal to 65% multiplied by the lowest trading price (as defined in the January 2019 Notes) of the Common Stock as reported on the National Quotations Bureau OTC Marketplace exchange upon which the Company's shares are traded during the twenty (20) consecutive Trading Day period immediately preceding (i) the January 2019 Effective Date; or (ii) the conversion date.
  12

The Company has reserved a minimum of eight (8) times the number of its authorized and unissued Common Stock (the "January 2019 Reserved Amounts"), free from pre-emptive rights, to provide for the issuance of Common Stock upon the full conversion of the January 2019 Notes. Upon full conversion of the January 2019 Investor Notes, any shares remaining in such reserve shall be cancelled. The Company increases the January 2019 Reserved Amount in accordance with the Company's obligations under the January 2019 Investor Notes.
 Since the unsecured convertible promissory notes were not repaid by their maturity dates these defaults resulted in the outstanding balance (principal plus accrued interest) of each of the January 2019 Investor Notes to increase by 50% and increased by a further $15,000 (together the "Default Amounts") along with the interest rate increasing from 12% to 24% annually. The January 2019 Investors had the option to require the Company to immediately issue, in lieu of the Default Amount, the number of shares of common stock of the Company equal to the Default Amount divided by the conversion price then in effect.
 During the year ended December 31, 2020, the January 2019 Investors converted a total of $61,925 (2019-$158,618) of their January 2019 Investor Notes.

 Treatment of Organic Waste and Septage
 On February 28, 2019, the Company announced that it had received the project completion report titled: Development Optimization and Validation of an Innovative Integrated Anaerobic Thermophilic Digester Treatment of Organic Waste and Septage. The report was written by a research team at Fleming College's Centre for Advancement of Water and Wastewater Technologies, located in Lindsay, Ontario, Canada. The collaborative project was supported by the Advancing Water Technologies Program (the "AWT Program") of Southern Ontario Water Consortium. The project focused on the development of a new and innovative technology for handling and processing organic residuals. This new technology utilizes the anaerobic mesophilic digestion process coupled with thermophilic digestion to maximize biogas yields and produce organic fertilizer through optimal operations.
Asset Purchase
 On September 15, 2017, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement (the "APA) with Astoria Organic Matters Ltd., and Astoria Organic Matters Canada LP ("Astoria"), pursuant to which the Company purchased certain assets of Astoria from the court appointed receiver of Astoria, BDO Canada Limited (the "Receiver"). The purchase price for the composting buildings, Gore cover system, driveway and paving, office trailer, certain machinery and equipment, computer equipment, computer software and intangible assets (the "Assets") consisted of cash of $3,005,300 (C$4,100,000), funded by PACE and 529,970 restricted common shares of the Company, determined to be valued at $529,970 (C$700,000) based on private placement pricing at the time. In addition, legal costs of $21,442 (C$29,253) in connection with acquiring the Assets are included in the cost of the organic composting facility. In addition, the Company purchased certain accounts receivable which it was required to collect, totaling $127,650 (C$174,147) and a deposit with a local municipality in the amount of $36,650 (C$50,000).
 On May 9, 2017, the company signed a memorandum of agreement with Kentech (the "Kentech Agreement"), a corporation existing under the laws of the province of Ontario, Canada ("Kentech"). The Kentech Agreement provides the Company the right to acquire and the right to use the equipment and innovative processes of Kentech in relation to the production of liquid fertilizer from organic waste material. The Kentech Agreement is for a period of five years, commencing on the date of the Kentech Agreement. The Kentech Agreement may be terminated by either party upon providing six months' notice.
 On December 7, 2016, the Company was awarded funding for the AWT Program, a program for business led collaborations in the water sector. The AWT Program is administered by the Southern Ontario Water Consortium to assist small and medium sized businesses in the Province of Ontario, Canada, leverage world-class research facilities and academic expertise to develop and demonstrate water technologies for successful introduction to market. In addition, the AWT Program is designed to enhance the Ontario water cluster and continue to build Ontario's reputation for water excellence around the world. The Company's academic partner is the CAWT at Fleming College in Lindsay, Ontario, Canada. The original AWT Program budget was for $586,400 ($800,000 CAD), of which the Company contributes 50% in cash and in-kind contributions and CAWT contributes 50%. CAWT revised its budget for the second and third years of the AWT Program. As a result, the cash commitments for 2017 and 2018, the second and third years of the AWT Program were cancelled.
  17

The Company had already completed and provided its commitment for the first year of the AWT Program which ended March 31, 2017, consisting of professional fees of $7,217 ($9,432 CAD) and a contribution to the capital requirements of the AWT Program, totaling $71,017 ($94,000 CAD), for equipment to be used in the AWT Program and to be retained by CAWT.
 Operations
 The Company owns the Environmental Compliance Approvals (the "ECAs") issued by the MECP from the Province of Ontario, in place to accept up to 70,000 metric tonnes of waste annually from the provinces of Ontario, Quebec and from New York state, and to operate a waste transfer station with the capacity to process up to an additional 50,000 metric tonnes of waste annually. Once built, the location of the waste transfer station will be alongside the organic waste processing and composting facility which is currently operating in Belleville, Ontario, Canada.
  18

Waste Transfer Station- Access to the waste transfer station is critical to haulers who collect waste in areas not in close proximity to disposal facilities where such disposal continues to be permitted. Tipping fees charged to third parties at waste transfer stations are usually based on the type and volume or weight of the waste deposited at the waste transfer station, the distance to the disposal site, market rates for disposal costs and other general market factors.
 Organic Composting Facility- As noted above, the Company's organic waste processing and composting facility, located in Belleville, Ontario Canada, has ECAs in place to accept up to 70,000 metric tonnes of waste annually and is currently in operation. Certain assets of the organic waste processing and composting facility, including the ECAs for the waste transfer station (not yet built), were acquired by the Company on September 15, 2017, from the Receiver for Astoria, under the APA. The Company charges tipping fees for the waste accepted at the organic waste composting facility based on arrangements in place with the customers and the type of waste accepted. Typical waste accepted includes, leaf and yard, biosolids, food, liquid, paper sludge and source separated organics. During year ended December 31, 2020, tipping fees ranged from $22 (C$30) to $119 (C$159) per metric tonne (2019-$19 (C$25) to $100 (C$130 per metric tonne).
Competition 
 Seasonal Trends
 Our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in summer months, primarily due to waste volumes resulting from higher construction and demolition waste volumes and the availability of leaf and yard waste along with contracts involving the grinding of leaf and yard waste. In addition, revenue from the sale of organic compost would be higher beginning in late spring and tapering off in the fall.
Employees
 As of December 31, 2020, the Company had eight full-time employees and two independent contractors. Of the eight full time employees, two were employed in management and administrative positions, and the balance in operations. The two independent contractors provide services in management positions. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.
Financial Assurance and Insurance Obligations
 Financial Assurance
 Municipal and governmental waste service contracts generally require contracting parties to demonstrate financial responsibility for their obligations under the contract. Financial assurance is also a requirement for (i) obtaining or retaining disposal site or waste transfer station operating permits; and (ii) estimated post-closure and environmental remedial obligations at our operations. We have established financial assurance using letters of credit and/or deposits with the municipalities. The type of assurance used is based on several factors, most importantly: the jurisdiction, contractual requirements, market factors and availability of credit capacity.
 A letter of credit in favor of the MECP is supported by our credit facility with PACE. As at December 31, 2020 and the date of filing, the MECP has not drawn on the letter of credit. The letter of credit with the MECP is renewable annually, and is in force until September 30, 2021, unless terminated by PACE.
  19

Insurance
 We carry a broad range of insurance coverages, including general liability, automobile liability, workers' compensation, real and personal property, directors' and officers' liability, environmental and pollution legal liability and other coverages we believe are customary to the industry. Our exposure to loss for insurance claims is generally limited to the per-incident deductible under the related insurance policy. We do not expect the impact of any known casualty, property, environmental or other contingency to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we have self-insured certain buildings and equipment.
Regulation
 Our business is subject to extensive and evolving federal, provincial and local environmental, health, safety and transportation laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are administered by the MECP, Environment Canada, and various other federal, provincial and local environmental, zoning, transportation, land use, health and safety agencies in Canada. Many of these agencies regularly examine our operations to monitor compliance with these laws and regulations and have the power to enforce compliance, obtain injunctions or impose civil or criminal penalties in case of non-compliance. On November 5, 2020, the MECP conducted two audits for two of our ECAs. The MECPs comments were received late December 2020. The audits resulted in the Company taking corrective action regarding sampling, testing and the removal of exceeding waste from the site during 2021. The Company has completed some of the corrective action and responded to the MECP and will continue with the remaining corrective action through 2021. The Company has accrued actual and estimated costs totaling $354,125 (C$450,885) in connection with the corrective action. In addition, the Company has accrued for deferred assets relating to machinery it anticipates purchasing in 2021, in the amount of $215,953 (C$274,959).
 Because the primary mission of our business is to manage solid and liquid waste hauled to our organic waste processing and composting facility in an environmentally sound manner, our capital expenditures are related, either directly or indirectly, to environmental protection measures, including compliance with federal, provincial and local rules. There are costs associated with siting, design, permitting, operations, monitoring, site maintenance, corrective actions, financial assurance, and facility closure and post-closure obligations. With acquisition, development or expansion of a waste management or waste transfer station, we must often spend considerable time, effort and money to obtain or maintain required permits and approvals. There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain or maintain required governmental approvals. Once obtained, operating permits are subject to renewal, modification, suspension or revocation by the issuing agency. Compliance with current regulations and future requirements could require us to make significant capital and operating expenditures. However, most of these expenditures are made in the normal course of business and do not place us at any competitive disadvantage.
 The primary Provincial statutes affecting our business are summarized below:
 Provincial and Local Regulations 
 Various provincial and local regulations affect our operations. The Province of Ontario has its own laws and regulations governing solid waste disposal, water and air pollution, and, in most cases, releases and cleanup of hazardous substances and liabilities for such matters. The Province of Ontario has also adopted regulations governing the design, operation, maintenance and closure of waste transfer stations. Some regions, municipalities and other local governments in Ontario have adopted similar laws and regulations. Our facilities and operations are likely to be subject to these types of requirements.
 Our operations are affected by the increasing preference for alternatives to landfill disposal. Many regional and local governments in Ontario mandate recycling and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of waste, such as yard waste, food waste and electronics at landfills. The number of regional and local governments in Ontario with recycling requirements and disposal bans continues to grow, while the logistics and economics of recycling the items remain challenging. In addition, Ontario has imposed timelines for the ban of organics from landfills in the province in an effort to totally divert these wastes from landfills. This will provide opportunities for the expansion of facilities like ours. This had already occurred in the province of Quebec and in the United States of America (the "USA"), where various states have enacted, or are considering enacting, laws that restrict the disposal within the state of solid waste generated outside the state. While laws that overtly discriminate against out-of-state waste have been found to be unconstitutional, some laws that are less overtly discriminatory have been upheld in court. From time to time, the United States Congress has considered legislation authorizing states to adopt regulations, restrictions, or taxes on the importation of out-of-state or out-of-jurisdiction waste. Additionally, several state and local governments have enacted "flow control" regulations, which attempt to require that all waste generated within the state or local jurisdiction be deposited at specific sites. In 1994, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a flow control ordinance that gave preference to a local facility that was privately owned was unconstitutional, but in 2007, the Court ruled that an ordinance directing waste to a facility owned by the local government was constitutional. The United States Congress' adoption of legislation allowing restrictions on interstate transportation of out-of-state or out-of-jurisdiction waste or certain types of flow control, or courts' interpretations of interstate waste and flow control legislation, could adversely affect our solid and hazardous waste management services.

Federal, Provincial and Local Climate Change Initiatives
 In light of regulatory and business developments related to concerns about climate change, we have identified a strategic business opportunity to provide our public and private sector customers with sustainable solutions to reduce their Greenhouse Gas ("GHG") emissions. As part of our on-going marketing evaluations, we assess customer demand for and opportunities to develop waste services offering verifiable carbon reductions, such as waste reduction, increased recycling, and conversion of biogas and discarded materials into electricity and fuel. We use carbon life cycle tools in evaluating potential new services and in establishing the value proposition that makes us attractive as an environmental service provider. We are active in support of public policies that encourage development and use of lower carbon energy and waste services that lower users' carbon footprints. We understand the importance of broad stakeholder engagement in these endeavors, and actively seek opportunities for public policy discussion on more sustainable materials management practices. In addition, we work with stakeholders at the federal and provincial level in support of legislation that encourages production and use of renewable, low-carbon fuels and electricity. Despite the past U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accords, we have seen no reduction in customer demand for services aligned with their GHG reduction goals and strategies. Ontario is part of the WCI led by the state of California and, if anything, California has doubled down on their GHG reduction goals. The states of Oregon and Washington are also considering joining the WCI that currently includes, amongst other states and provinces, California, Ontario and Quebec as members.
 We continue to assess the physical risks to company operations from the effects of severe weather events and use risk mitigation planning to increase our resiliency in the face of such events. We are investing in infrastructure to withstand more severe storm events, which may afford us a competitive advantage and reinforce our reputation as a reliable service provider through continued service in the aftermath of such events.
