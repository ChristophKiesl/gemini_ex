--------+----------

General 
 Riverview Financial Corporation (the “Company” or “Riverview”) was formed in 2013 as a bank holding company incorporated under the laws of Pennsylvania. The Company is regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve Board”) or (“FRB”). The Company provides a full range of financial services through its wholly-owned bank subsidiary, Riverview Bank (the “Bank”), which is its sole operating segment. The Company had approximately 221 employees as of December 31, 2020. 
 The Bank is a state-chartered bank and trust company regulated by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities (“DOB”) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) that offers financial services through 27 community banking offices and three limited purpose offices. The Wealth and Trust Management divisions of the Bank provide trust and investment advisory services to the general public and businesses. 
 Unless the context indicates otherwise, all references in this annual report to the “Company”, “Bank”, “we”, “us” and “our” refer to Riverview Financial Corporation, its direct and indirect subsidiaries and its and their respective predecessors. 
 We primarily generate income through interest income derived from our loan and securities portfolios. Other income is generated primarily from transaction fees, trust and wealth management fees, mortgage banking fees and service charges on deposit accounts. Our primary costs are interest paid on deposits and borrowings and general operating expenses. We provide a variety of commercial and retail banking and financial services to businesses, non-profit organizations, governmental and municipal agencies, professional customers, and retail customers, on a personalized basis. 
 Market Areas 
 The Bank’s market area consists of Berks, Blair, Bucks, Centre, Clearfield, Cumberland, Dauphin, Huntingdon, Lebanon, Lehigh, Lycoming, Perry, Schuylkill and Somerset Counties in Central Pennsylvania. 
 Products and Services 
 The Bank offers a variety of consumer and commercial banking products and services throughout its market area. Our primary lending products are real estate, commercial and consumer loans. Our primary deposit products are NOW, demand deposit accounts, and certificate of deposit accounts. We also offer ATM access, investment accounts, trust department services and other various lending, depository and related financial services. 
Lending Activities 
 We provide a full range of retail and commercial lending products designed to meet the borrowing needs of consumers and small- and medium-sized businesses in our market area. A significant amount of our loans are made to customers located within our market area. We have no foreign loans or highly leveraged transaction loans, as defined by the Federal Reserve Board. Although we participate in loans originated by other banks, we have originated the majority of the loans in our portfolio. 
 Our primary commercial products are loans to small- and medium- sized businesses. Our consumer products include one-to-four family residential mortgages, consumer, automobile, home equity, educational and lines of credit loans. Our retail lending products include the following types of loans, among others: residential real estate; automobiles; manufactured housing; personal; student; and home equity. Our commercial lending products include the following types of loans, among others: commercial real estate; working capital; equipment and other commercial needs; construction; and agricultural and mineral rights. The terms offered on a loan vary depending on the type of loan and credit-worthiness of the borrower. We fund our loans, primarily, from our various deposit products which include certificates of deposits, savings, money market and various demand deposit accounts that are offered to both consumer and commercial customers.

  Payment risk is a function of the economic climate in which our lending activities are conducted. Economic downturns in the economy generally, or in a particular sector, could cause cash flow problems for our customers, impairing their ability to repay loans we make to them. We attempt to minimize this risk by avoiding loan concentrations to a single customer or a group of similar customer types, the loss of any one or more of whom would have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition. One element of interest rate risk arises from making fixed rate loans in an environment of changing interest rates. We attempt to mitigate this risk by making adjustable rate loans and by limiting repricing terms to five years or less for commercial customers requiring fixed rate loans. 
 Our lending activity also exposes us to the risk that any collateral we take as security is not adequate. We attempt to manage collateral risk by avoiding loan concentrations to particular types of borrowers, by perfecting liens on collateral and by obtaining appraisals on property prior to extending loans. We attempt to mitigate our exposure to these and other types of lending risks by stratifying authorization requirements by loan size and complexity. 
 We are not dependent upon a single customer, or a few customers, the loss of one or more of which would have a materially adverse effect on our operations. In the ordinary course of our business, our operations and earnings are not materially affected by seasonal changes or by Federal, state or local environmental laws or regulations. 
 We intend to continue to evaluate commercial real estate, commercial business and governmental lending opportunities, including small business lending. We continue to proactively monitor and manage existing credit relationships. 
 We have not engaged in sub-prime residential mortgage lending, which is defined as mortgage loans advanced to borrowers who do not qualify for market interest rates because of problems with their credit history. We focus our lending efforts within our market area. 
 Deposit Activities 
 Our primary source of funds is the cash flow provided by our financing activities, mainly deposit gathering. We offer a variety of deposit accounts with a range of interest rates and terms, including, among others: money market accounts; NOW accounts; savings accounts; certificates of deposit; individual retirement accounts, and demand deposit accounts. These deposits are primarily obtained from areas surrounding our branch offices. We rely primarily on marketing, product innovation, technology, service and long-standing relationships with customers to attract and retain deposits. Other deposit related services include: mobile and online banking; remote deposit capture; automatic clearing house transactions; cash management services; automated teller machines; point of sale transactions; safe deposit boxes; night depository services; direct deposit; and official check services. 
Trust, Wealth Management and Brokerage Services 
 Through our trust department, we offer a broad range of fiduciary and investment services. Our trust and investment services include: 
 

• | investment management;
--+-----------------------


• | IRA trustee services;

--+----------------------------------


We provide a comprehensive array of wealth management products and services through Riverview’s Wealth Management and Trust Management divisions to individuals, small businesses and nonprofit entities. These products and services include the following, among others: investment portfolio management; brokerage; estate planning assistance; annuities; business succession planning; insurance; education funding strategies; and tax planning assistance.

  We have a third-party marketing agreement with a broker-dealer that allows us to offer a full range of securities, brokerage services and annuity sales to our customers. We have three dedicated locations that provide such investor services as well as accommodating customer meetings by appointment within our retail banking offices. Through these divisions, our clients have access to a wide array of financial products including stocks, bonds, mutual funds, annuities and insurance. 
 Competition 
 The banking and financial services industries are highly competitive. Within its geographic region, the Bank faces direct competition from other commercial banks, varying in size from local community banks to larger regional and nationwide banks, credit unions and non-bank entities. As a result of the wide availability of electronic delivery channels, the Bank also faces competition from financial institutions that do not have a physical presence in its geographic markets. 
 Many of our competitors are substantially larger in terms of assets and available resources. Certain of these institutions have significantly higher lending limits than we do and may provide various services to their customers that we presently do not. In addition, we experience competition for deposits from mutual funds and broker dealers, while consumer discount, mortgage and insurance companies compete with us for various types of loans. Credit unions, finance companies and mortgage companies enjoy certain competitive advantages over us, as they are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions and taxation as commercial banks. Principal methods of competing for bank products, permitted nonbanking services and financial activities include price, nature of product, quality of service, convenience of location, and availability of banking convenience technology, including telephone, mobile and web-based banking services. 
 In our market area, interest rates on deposits, especially time deposits, and interest rates and fees charged to customers on loans are very competitive. In the current economic environment, we are experiencing increased competition in view of our loan demand and deposit gathering. 
 We believe that our most significant competitive advantage originates from our business philosophy, which includes offering direct access to senior management and other officers, providing friendly, informed and courteous service, local and timely decision making, flexible and reasonable operating procedures, and consistently applied credit policies. In addition, our success has been, and will continue to be, a result of our emphasis on community involvement and customer relationships. With consolidation continuing in the financial industry, and particularly in our market area, smaller community banks like us are gaining opportunities to increase market share as larger institutions reduce their emphasis on, or exit, the markets. 
 Seasonality 
 Generally, our operations are not seasonal in nature. Our deposit activities, however, have been somewhat influenced by fiscal funding appropriations related to municipalities and school districts in our market areas, which are to some extent seasonal in nature. 
Supervision and Regulation 
 We are extensively regulated and examined under federal and state laws. Generally, these laws and regulations are intended to protect consumers, not shareholders. The following is a summary description of certain provisions of law that affect the regulation of bank holding companies and banks. This discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to applicable laws and regulations. Changes in laws and regulations may have a material effect on our business and prospects. 
 The Company is a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act (“BHCA”) and is subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve Board”) or (“FRB”). We are required to file annual and quarterly reports with the FRB and to provide the FRB with such additional information as the FRB may require. The FRB also conducts periodic examinations of the Company. In addition, under the Pennsylvania Banking Code of 1965 of the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities (“DOB”), the DOB has the authority to examine the books, records and affairs of the Company and to require any documentation deemed necessary to ensure compliance with the Pennsylvania Banking Code. 
 With certain limited exceptions, we are required to obtain prior approval from the FRB before acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of any voting securities or substantially all assets of a bank or bank holding company, or before merging or consolidating with another bank holding company. Additionally, with certain exceptions, any person or entity proposing to acquire control through direct or indirect ownership of 25% or more of our voting securities (or 10% or more under certain circumstances) is required to give 60 days’ written notice of the acquisition to the FRB, which may prohibit the transaction, and to publish notice to the public. 
 
5 

  The Bank is primarily regulated by the DOB and the FDIC. The DOB may prohibit an institution, over which it has supervisory authority, from engaging in activities or investments that the agency believes constitute unsafe or unsound banking practices. Federal banking regulators have extensive enforcement authority over the institutions they regulate to prohibit or correct activities that violate law, regulation or a regulatory agreement or which are deemed to constitute unsafe or unsound practices. 
 Enforcement actions may include: 
 

• | the appointment of a conservator or receiver;
--+----------------------------------------------


• | the issuance of a cease and desist order;
--+------------------------------------------


• | the termination of deposit insurance, the imposition of civil money penalties on the institution, its directors, officers, employees and institution affiliated parties;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the issuance of directives to increase capital;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | the issuance of formal and informal agreements and orders;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | the removal of or restrictions on directors, officers, employees and institution-affiliated parties; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the enforcement of any such mechanisms through restraining orders or any other court actions.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


We are subject to certain restrictions on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, principal shareholders or any related interests of such persons which generally require that such credit extensions be made on substantially the same terms as are available to third parties dealing with us, and do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. Other laws limit the maximum amount that we may loan to any one customer as a percentage of our capital levels. 
 Permitted Non-Banking Activities 
 Generally, a bank holding company may not engage in any activities other than banking, managing or controlling its bank and other authorized subsidiaries, or providing service to those subsidiaries. With prior approval from the FRB, we may acquire more than 5% of the assets or outstanding shares of a company engaging in non-bank activities determined by the FRB to be closely related to the business of banking or of managing or controlling banks. The FRB provides expedited procedures for expansion into approved categories of non-bank activities. A bank holding company that meets certain specified criteria may elect to be regulated as a “financial holding company” and thereby engage in a broader array of nonbanking financial activities, including insurance and investment banking. 
Limitations on Dividends and Other Payments and Transactions 
 Our ability to pay dividends is largely dependent upon the receipt of dividends from the Bank. The Company relies on dividends from the Bank for its own ability to pay dividends to shareholders. Both federal and state laws impose restrictions on the ability of both the Company and the Bank to pay dividends. 
 Subsidiary banks of a bank holding company are subject to certain quantitative and qualitative restrictions on extensions of credit to the bank holding company or its subsidiaries, and on the use of their securities as collateral for loans. These regulations and restrictions may limit the Company’s ability to obtain funds from the Bank for its cash needs, including funds for the payment of dividends, interest and operating expenses. Further, subject to certain exceptions, a bank holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements relating to any extension of credit, the lease or sale of property, or furnishing of services. 
 Under FRB regulations, a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks and to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank. The FRB may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to a subsidiary bank when required. A required capital injection may be called for at a time when the holding company does not have the resources to provide it. In addition, depository institutions insured by the FDIC can be held liable for any losses incurred, or reasonably anticipated to be incurred, in connection with the default of or assistance provided to a commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository institution. Such cross-guarantee liabilities generally are superior in priority to the obligation of the depository institutions to its shareholders, due solely to their status as shareholders, and obligations to other affiliates. 
 Pennsylvania Law 
 As a Pennsylvania bank holding company, the Company is subject to various restrictions on its activities as set forth in Pennsylvania law. This is in addition to those restrictions set forth in federal law. Under Pennsylvania law, a bank holding company that desires to acquire a bank or bank holding company that has its principal place of business in Pennsylvania must obtain permission from the DOB.

  Risk-Based Capital Requirements 
 The federal banking regulators have adopted risk-based capital regulations to facilitate assessing capital adequacy of a bank’s operations for assets reported on the balance sheet and transactions, such as letters of credit and recourse agreements, which are recorded as off-balance sheet items. Under these guidelines, nominal dollar amounts of assets and credit-equivalent amounts of off-balance sheet items are multiplied by one of several risk adjustment percentages, which range from 0% for assets with low credit risk, such as certain US Treasury securities, to 100% or more for assets with relatively high credit risk. 
 A bank’s risk-based capital ratios are obtained by dividing its qualifying capital by its total risk adjusted assets. The regulators measure risk-adjusted assets, which include off-balance-sheet items, against both total qualifying capital, Common Equity Tier 1 capital, and Tier 1 capital. 
 “Common Equity Tier 1 Capital” includes common equity and minority interest in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill and other intangibles, subject to certain exceptions and retained earnings. 
 “Tier 1”, or core capital, includes common equity, non-cumulative preferred stock and minority interest in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill and other intangibles, subject to certain exceptions. 
 “Tier 2”, or supplementary capital, includes, among other things, limited life preferred stock, hybrid capital instruments, mandatory convertible securities, qualifying subordinated debt, and the allowance for loan and lease losses, subject to certain limitations less restricted deductions. The inclusion of elements of Tier 2 capital is subject to certain other requirements and limitations of the federal banking agencies. 
 The Basel III regulatory capital requirements are as follows: 
 A minimum ratio of common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.5%. 
 A minimum ratio of tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 6%. 
 A minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8%. 
 A minimum leverage ratio of 4%. 
 In addition, FDIC-insured banks must hold a common equity tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets applicable to all insured banks. If a bank fails to hold capital above the minimum capital ratios and the capital conservation buffer, it is subject to certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executives. 
 Under the rules, community banks were permitted to make a one-time election not to include Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”) in regulatory capital and instead use the previously existing treatment that excluded most AOCI components from regulatory capital. The opt-out election was required to be made in the first call filed after the institution became subject to the final rule. The Bank “opted-out” of the inclusion of the components of AOCI in regulatory capital. 
 Failure to meet applicable capital guidelines could subject a banking organization to a variety of enforcement actions including: 
 

• | limitations on its ability to pay dividends;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | the issuance by the applicable regulatory authority of a capital directive to increase capital;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | or the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, as well as the measures described under FDICIA as applicable to undercapitalized institutions under the prompt corrective action regulation.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


In addition, future changes in regulations or practices could further reduce the amount of capital recognized for purposes of capital adequacy. Such a change could affect the ability of the Bank to grow and could restrict the amount of profits, if any, available for the payment of dividends to the Company. 
 At December 31, 2020, the Bank complied with the foregoing requirements with a common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 12.9%, tier 1 leverage capital ratio of 9.8%, tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 12.9% and a total capital ratio of 14.2%. 
 Legislation enacted in 2018 required the federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, to establish a “community bank leverage ratio” of between 8 to 10% of average total consolidated assets for qualifying institutions with assets of less than $10 billion. Institutions

  with capital meeting the specified requirements and electing to follow the alternative framework are deemed to comply with the applicable regulatory capital requirements, including the risk-based requirements. In November 2019, the federal regulators issued a final rule that set the optional “community bank leverage ratio” at 9%, effective January 1, 2020. Institutions with capital meeting the specified requirement and electing to follow the community bank leverage ratio framework would be deemed to comply with the applicable regulatory capital requirements, including the risk-based capital requirements. 
 The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act lowered the community bank leverage ratio to 8%, with federal regulation making the reduced ratio effective beginning with the second quarter of 2020 until the end of 2020. Another rule was issued to transition back to the 9% community bank leverage ratio by increasing the ratio to 8.5% for calendar year 2021 and to 9% thereafter. The Bank has not elected to follow the community bank leverage ratio framework at December 31, 2020. We are currently evaluating the election to use the community bank leverage ratio framework and may make such an election in the future. 
 Prompt Corrective Action Regulations 
 Under prompt corrective action regulations, the FDIC is authorized and, under certain circumstances, required, to take supervisory actions against undercapitalized banks. The extent of supervisory action depends upon the degree of the institution’s undercapitalization. For this purpose, a bank is placed in one of the following five categories based on its capital level: 

• | well-capitalized (at least 5% leverage capital, 8% Tier 1 risk-based capital, 10% total risk-based capital and 6.5% common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | adequately capitalized (at least 4% leverage capital, 6% Tier 1 risk-based capital, 8% total risk-based capital and 4.5% common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | undercapitalized (less than 4% leverage capital, 6% Tier 1 risk-based capital, 8% total risk-based capital or 4.5% common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | significantly undercapitalized (less than 3% leverage capital, 4% Tier 1 risk-based capital, 6% total risk-based capital or 3% common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital); and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | critically undercapitalized (less than 2% tangible capital).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


The regulations provide that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the FDIC within 45 days of the date a bank receives notice that it is “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.” Any holding company for the bank required to submit a capital restoration plan must guarantee the lesser of an amount equal to 5% of the bank’s assets at the time it was notified or deemed to be undercapitalized by the FDIC, or the amount necessary to restore the bank to adequately capitalized status. This guarantee remains in place until the FDIC notifies the bank that it has maintained adequately capitalized status for each of four consecutive calendar quarters, and the FDIC has the authority to require payment and collect payment under the guarantee. Various restrictions, including on growth and capital distributions, also apply to “undercapitalized” institutions. If an “undercapitalized” institution fails to submit an acceptable capital plan, it is treated as “significantly undercapitalized.” “Significantly undercapitalized” institutions must comply with one or more additional restrictions including, but not limited to, an order by the FDIC to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets, cease receipt of deposits from correspondent banks or dismiss officers or directors and restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, compensation of executive officers and capital distributions by the parent holding company. The FDIC may also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors. Critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator within specified timeframes. 
 At December 31, 2020, the Bank met the criteria for being considered “well-capitalized”. 
 The previously referenced final rule establishing an elective “community bank leverage ratio” regulatory capital requirement provides that a qualifying institution whose capital exceeds the community bank leverage ratio and opts to use that framework will be considered “well-capitalized” for purposes of prompt corrective action. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Regulatory agencies include in their evaluations of a bank’s capital adequacy, an assessment of the bank’s interest rate risk exposure. The standards for measuring the adequacy and effectiveness of a banking organization’s interest rate risk management includes a measurement of board of directors and senior management oversight, and a determination of whether a banking organization’s procedures for comprehensive risk management are appropriate to the circumstances of the specific banking organization. We utilize internal interest rate risk models to measure and monitor interest rate risk. Finally, regulatory agencies, as part of the scope of their periodic examinations, evaluate our interest rate risk.

  Commercial Real Estate Guidance 
 In December 2015, the federal banking agencies released a statement entitled “Statement on Prudent Risk Management for Commercial Real Estate Lending” (the “CRE Statement”). In the CRE Statement, the agencies express concerns with institutions that ease commercial real estate underwriting standards, direct financial institutions to maintain underwriting discipline and exercise risk management practices to identify, measure and monitor lending risks, and indicate that they will continue to pay special attention to commercial real estate lending activities and concentrations going forward. The agencies previously issued guidance in December 2006, entitled “Interagency Guidance on Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices”, which states that an institution is potentially exposed to significant commercial real estate concentration risk, and should employ enhanced risk management practices, where total commercial real estate loans represents 300% or more of its total capital and the outstanding balance of such institution’s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased by 50% or more during the prior 36 months. 
Deposit Insurance 
 The Bank’s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC. Deposit insurance per account owner is $250,000. 
 The FDIC charges insured depository institutions premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s risk-based assessment system, institutions deemed less risky for failure pay lower assessments. Assessments for institutions with less than $10 billion of assets are based on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from statistical modeling estimating the probability of an institution’s failure within three years. 
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has authority to increase insurance assessments. A significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Bank. Management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future. 
 Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) 
 Under the CRA, the Bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with its safe and sound operation, to ascertain and meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income areas. CRA is designed to create a system for bank regulatory agencies to evaluate a depository institution’s record in meeting the credit needs of its community. Assessment by bank regulators of CRA compliance focuses on three tests: (i) a lending test, to evaluate the institution’s record of making loans, including community development loans in its designated assessment areas; (ii) an investment test, to evaluate the institution’s record of investing in community development projects, affordable housing, and programs benefiting low or moderate income individuals, areas and small businesses; and (iii) a service test, to evaluate the institution’s delivery of banking services throughout its CRA assessment area, including low and moderate income areas. The Bank had its last completed CRA compliance examination conducted November 4, 2019 and received a “satisfactory” rating. 
Bank Secrecy Act, USA Patriot Act of 2001 (“Patriot Act”), and Related Rules and Regulations 
 The Patriot Act contained anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and imposes various regulations, including standards for verifying client identification at account opening, and rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering. Among other requirements, the Patriot Act and the related regulations imposed the following requirements with respect to financial institutions: 

• | Establishment of anti-money laundering programs;
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | Establishment of a program specifying procedures for obtaining identifying information from customers seeking to open new accounts, including verifying the identity of customers within a reasonable period of time;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Establishment of enhanced due diligence policies, procedures and controls designed to detect and report money laundering; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Prohibition on correspondent accounts for foreign shell banks and compliance with recordkeeping obligations with respect to correspondent accounts of foreign banks.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Failure to comply with the Patriot Act’s requirements could have serious legal, financial, regulatory and reputational consequences. In addition, bank regulators will consider a holding company’s effectiveness in combating money laundering when ruling on BHCA and Bank Merger Act applications. 
 In 2018, a Financial Crimes Enforcement Network rule requiring banks to implement strengthened customer due diligence requirements took effect. Among other requirements, the rules contain explicit customer due diligence requirements and require banks to identify and verify the identity of beneficial owners of legal entity customers, subject to certain exclusions and exemptions.

  Consumer Lending Laws 
 Bank regulatory agencies are increasingly focusing attention on consumer protection laws and regulations. Such laws and regulations include: 
 

• | Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, requiring that borrowers for mortgage loans for one- to four-family residential real estate receive various disclosures, including good faith estimates of settlement costs, lender servicing and escrow account practices, and prohibiting certain practices that increase the cost of settlement services;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fair Credit Reporting Act, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fair Lending laws;
--+-------------------


• | Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices laws and regulations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Truth in Savings Act.
--+----------------------


The operations of the Bank are further subject to the: 
 

• | Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (also known as “Check 21”), which gives “substitute checks,” such as digital check images and copies made from that image, the same legal standing as the original paper check; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which places limitations on the sharing of consumer financial information by financial institutions with unaffiliated third parties. Specifically, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires all financial institutions offering financial products or services to retail customers to provide such customers with the financial institution’s privacy policy and provide such customers the opportunity to “opt out” of the sharing of certain personal financial information with unaffiliated third parties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


CARES Act 
 The CARES Act, which became law on March 27, 2020, provided over $2 trillion to combat the coronavirus (COVID-19) and stimulate the economy. The law had several provisions relevant to depository institutions, including: 
 

• | Allowing institutions not to characterize loan modifications relating to the COVID-19 pandemic as a troubled debt restructuring and also allowing them to suspend the corresponding impairment determination for accounting purposes;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | As previously noted, temporarily reducing the community bank leverage ratio alternative available to institutions of less than $10 billion of assets to 8%;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The ability of a borrower of a federally-backed mortgage loan (VA, FHA, USDA, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae) experiencing financial hardship due, directly or indirectly to the COVID-19 pandemic, to request forbearance from paying their mortgage by submitting a request to the borrower’s servicer affirming their financial hardship during the COVID-19 emergency. Such a forbearance could be granted for up to 180 days, subject to extension for an additional 180-day period upon the request of the borrower. During that time, no fees, penalties or interest beyond the amounts scheduled or calculated as if the borrower made all contractual payments on time and in full under the mortgage contract could accrue on the borrower’s account. Except for vacant or abandoned property, the servicer of a federally-backed mortgage was prohibited from taking any foreclosure action, including any eviction or sale action, for not less than the 60-day period beginning March 18, 2020, extended by federal mortgage-backing agencies to at least December 31, 2020;

• | The ability of a borrower of a multi-family federally-backed mortgage loan that was current as of February 1, 2020, to submit a request for forbearance to the borrower’s servicer affirming that the borrower is experiencing financial hardship during the

COVID-19 emergency. A forbearance would be granted for up to 30 days, which could be extended for up to two additional 30-day periods upon the request of the borrower. Later extensions were made available, for a total of six months, for certain federally-backed multi-family mortgage loans. During the time of the forbearance, the multi-family borrower could not evict or initiate the eviction of a tenant or charge any late fees, penalties or other charges to a tenant for late payment of rent. Additionally, a multi-family borrower that received a forbearance could not require a tenant to vacate a dwelling unit before a date that is 30 days after the date on which the borrower provided the tenant notice to vacate and may not issue a notice to vacate until after the expiration of the forbearance.

The Paycheck Protection Program 
 The CARES Act and the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act provided $659 billion to fund loans by depository institutions to eligible small businesses through the Small Business Administration’s (“SBA”) 7(a) loan guaranty program. These loans are 100% federally guaranteed (principal and interest). An eligible business could apply under the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) during the applicable covered period and receive a loan up to 2.5 times its average monthly “payroll costs” limited to a loan amount of $10.0 million. The proceeds of the loan could be used for payroll (excluding individual employee compensation over $100,000 per year), mortgage, interest, rent, insurance, utilities and other qualifying expenses. PPP loans have: (a) an interest rate of 1.0%, (b) a two-year loan term (or five-year loan term for loans made after June 5, 2020) to maturity; and (c) principal and interest payments deferred until the date on which the SBA remits the loan forgiveness amount to the borrower’s lender or, alternatively, notifies the lender no loan forgiveness is allowed. If the borrower did not submit a loan forgiveness application to the lender within 10 months following the end of the 24-week loan forgiveness covered period (or the 8-week loan forgiveness covered period with respect to loans made prior to June 5, 2020 if such covered period is elected by the borrower), the borrower would begin paying principal and interest on the PPP loan immediately after the 10-month period. The SBA guarantees 100% of the PPP loans made to eligible borrowers. The entire principal amount of the borrower’s PPP loan, including any accrued interest, is eligible to be fully reduced by the loan forgiveness amount under the PPP so long as, during the applicable loan forgiveness covered period, employee and compensation levels of the business are maintained and 60% of the loan proceeds are used for payroll expenses, with the remaining 40% of the loan proceeds used for other qualifying expenses. 
 On December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (the “Relief Act”) became law and provides an additional $284 billion for the PPP and extends the PPP through March 31, 2021. PPP changes as a result of the Relief Act include: (1) an opportunity for a second PPP forgivable loan for small businesses and nonprofits with 300 or fewer employees that can demonstrate a loss of 25 percent of gross receipts in any quarter during 2020 compared to the same quarter in 2019; (2) allowing qualified borrowers to apply for a PPP loan up to 2.5 times (or 3.5 times for small businesses in the restaurant and hospitality industries) the borrower’s average monthly payroll costs in the one-year period prior to the date on which the loan is made or calendar year 2019, limited to a loan amount of $2.0 million; (3) the addition of personal protective equipment expenses, costs associated with outdoor dining, uninsured costs related to property damaged and vandalism or looting due to 2020 public disturbances and supplier costs as eligible and forgivable expenses; (4) simplifying the loan forgiveness process for loans of $150,000 or less; and (5) eliminating the requirement that Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) Advances will reduce the borrower’s PPP loan forgiveness amount. Additionally, expenses paid with the proceeds of PPP loans that are forgiven are now tax-deductible, reversing previous guidance from the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service, which did not allow deductions on expenses paid for with PPP loan proceeds. 
Holding Company Capital Regulations 
 Federal law required the Federal Reserve Board to apply consolidated capital requirements to bank holding companies that are no less stringent than those applicable to the institutions themselves. Consolidated regulatory capital requirements identical to those applicable to the subsidiary depository institutions applied to bank holding companies as of January 1, 2015. However, legislation enacted in May 2018 required the FRB to raise the threshold of its “small holding company” exception to the applicability of consolidated holding company capital requirements from $1 billion of consolidated assets to $3 billion of consolidated assets. That change became effective in August 2018. Consequently, holding companies with less than $3 billion of consolidated assets, including the Company, are generally not subject to the requirements unless otherwise advised by the FRB. 
Dividends and Stock Repurchases 
 The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends and the repurchase of shares of common stock by bank holding companies. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Regulatory guidance provides for prior regulatory review of capital distributions in certain circumstances, such as where the company’s net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend. The guidance also provides for prior regulatory review where the company’s overall rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company’s capital needs and overall financial condition. The ability of a holding company

  to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. The policy statement also provides for regulatory review prior to a holding company redeeming or repurchasing regulatory capital instruments when the holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock that would result in a net reduction in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding as of the end of a quarter compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred. These regulatory policies could affect the ability of the company to pay dividends, repurchase shares of common stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions. 
 Federal Reserve System 
 FRB regulations require depository institutions to maintain cash reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW and demand deposit accounts). The FRB announced they were reducing the reserve requirement ratio to zero percent across all deposit tiers as of March 26, 2020. This comes as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact much of the way financial institutions both operate and serve their customers. 
 Prior to this regulatory change, The Bank was required to a maintain a reserve of 3% against aggregate transaction accounts, (subject to adjustment annually by the FRB) plus a reserve of 10% (subject to adjustment by the FRB between 8% and 14%) against that portion of total excess transaction accounts. Account balances below certain levels of otherwise reservable balances (subject to adjustment by the FRB) were exempt from the reserve requirements. The Bank is in compliance with the foregoing requirements. 
 Required reserves must be maintained in the form of vault cash, an account at a Federal Reserve Bank or a pass-through account as defined by the FRB. Pursuant to the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, the Federal Reserve Banks pay interest on depository institution required and excess reserve balances. 
 Change in Control Regulations 
 Under the Change in Bank Control Act, no person may acquire control of a bank holding company such as the Company unless the FRB has been given 60 days’ prior written notice and has not issued a notice disapproving the proposed acquisition, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the competitive effects of the acquisition. Control, as defined under federal law, means ownership, control of or holding irrevocable proxies representing more than 25% of any class of voting stock, control in any manner of the election of a majority of the company’s directors, or a determination by the regulator that the acquirer has the power to direct, or directly or indirectly to exercise a controlling influence over, the management or policies of the institution. 
 There is a presumption of control upon the acquisition of 10% or more of a class of voting stock if the holding company involved has its shares registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or, of the holding company involved does not have its shares registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, if no other persons will own, control or hold the power to vote a greater percentage of that class of voting security after the acquisition. 
 The Federal Reserve Board has adopted a final rule, effective September 30, 2020, that revises its framework for determining whether a company, under the Bank Holding Company Act, has a “controlling influence” over a bank or savings and loan holding company. 
 Future Legislation 
 Proposed legislation is introduced in almost every legislative session that would dramatically affect the regulation of the banking industry. We cannot predict if any such legislation will be adopted nor if adopted how it would affect our business. History has demonstrated that new legislation or changes to existing laws or regulations usually results in greater compliance burden and therefore generally increases the cost of doing business. 
Employees and Human Capital Disclosure 
 At December 31, 2020, we employed 221 individuals, nearly all of whom are full-time and of which approximately 77% are women. At December 31, 2019, we employed 276 individuals. The Company employs a business model that combines high-touch service, new technologies and relationship-based focus of a community bank with extensive suite of banking and innovative financial services to businesses and individuals embracing the new digital banking era. We seek to hire well-qualified employees who are also a good fit for our value system. Our selection and promotion processes are without bias and include the active recruitment of minorities and women.

  Training and Development. We encourage and support the growth and development of our employees and, wherever possible, seek to fill positions by promotion and transfer from within the organization. The training and development of our employees is a priority. Annually, we invest more than $70,000 in tools, training programs and continuing education to help our employees build their knowledge, skills and experience. We provide in-house training to employees on topics including leadership and professional development, cybersecurity, risk and compliance and technology. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we provided approximately 5,966 hours of training to our employees. 
 Safety, Health and Welfare. The safety, health and wellness of our employees is a top priority. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we continued to responsibly serve the needs of our customers while prioritizing the health and safety of our employees. The Company identified the potential threat of COVID-19 in February 2020, activated its Pandemic Plan in March 2020, and had a fully remote workforce for its corporate office by early April 2020 as COVID-19 began to affect our primary market. The activation of the established Pandemic Plan allowed the Bank to react in a disciplined manner to a rapidly changing situation. The Bank is monitoring conditions in its local community and the surrounding areas and will re-evaluate the work assignments of its employees as conditions improve. The Bank requires certain health protocols to be followed by all employees including, but not limited to, daily temperature checks prior to entering the common workspace, office cleaning measures, social distancing practices and the use of face coverings in all common areas. 
 The Bank’s actions ensured, and continue to ensure, the Bank’s uninterrupted operational effectiveness, while safeguarding the health and safety of our customers and employees. The Pandemic Plan incorporates guidance from the regulatory and health communities, is defined by the Bank’s Pandemic Team and incorporates the actions to be taken from the business lines up through the Board of Directors. The Bank’s branch network continues to serve the local community and its online platforms facilitate alternate methods for its customers to meet their financial needs. While COVID-19 has resulted in widespread disruption to the lives and businesses of the Bank’s customers and employees, the Bank’s Pandemic Plan has enabled the Bank to remain focused on assisting customers and ensuring that the Bank remains fully operational. 
 Benefits. On an ongoing basis, we further promote the health and wellness of our employees by strongly encouraging work-life balance. Our benefits package includes health care coverage, retirement benefits, life and disability insurance, wellness programs, paid time off and leave policies. 
 Retention. Employee retention helps us operate efficiently and offers continuity to our customers and the community. We believe our concern for our employees’ well-being, supporting our employees’ career goals, offering competitive wages and providing valuable benefits aids in retention of our employees. At December 31, 2020, 42% of our current staff have been with us for at least five years. 
 Community Involvement. We support a multitude of diverse, worthy, community-based organizations through a comprehensive grants program, as well as through the by encouraging our employees to volunteer.
