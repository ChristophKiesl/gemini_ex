 Industry Background 
 As products become commoditized in a global economy and a digital world, customer loyalty increasingly depends on ease of doing business. Today’s digital consumers expect to be served intelligently across all touch points. In response, businesses are seeking efficient, scalable solutions to deliver smart customer experiences that are quick and easy. 
 Traditional customer relationship management (CRM) solutions are not designed for the digital world. Mostly, they view the phone as the primary customer interaction channel. Digital channels like web, mobile and social are not designed into the solution from the start. As a result, customer journeys tend to be fragmented and inconsistent across channels, especially digital-first engagements. Moreover, traditional CRM tools do not natively leverage the power of AI, knowledge and analytics to automate and optimize customer journeys as well as to enhance agent capability.
 The eGain Solution 
 Our solution make it easy for B2C businesses to engage customers in a digital world across all touch points, delivering the following benefits:

· | Build profitable long-term customer relationships. Customers are spending more time conducting business on mobile, social and web. Our solution helps businesses design brand-aligned, omnichannel customer journeys that are easy, quick and helpful. Whether a customer is looking to buy, ask a question, or pay a bill, our solution helps businesses provide customers personalized, guided and consistent responses. As a result, businesses improve their customer satisfaction and NPS scores.

· | Reduce operating costs through self-service automation and improved agent productivity. Our solution helps companies provide highly effective customer service while reducing operating costs.

· | Increase revenue through intelligent offers and contextual promotions. Our solution also helps businesses convert more website visitors into buyers, reduce shopping cart abandonment and increase average order value. It enables agents to contextually up-sell and cross-sell products in the course of customer interactions. A visitor to a website using eGain is proactively offered personalized promotions or real-time assistance, based on configurable business rules informed by visitor behavior and history. Visitors collaborate with a customer service agent live over the web through click-to-call, text or video chat, and cobrowse to inquire about and buy a product.

  Cloud Operations 
 We serve our customers and end users from several secure data centers worldwide. Physical security features at these facilities include 24x7 on-site security, three physical barriers and multiple access controls. The systems at these facilities are protected by firewalls and encryption technology. Operational redundancy features include redundant power, on-site backup generators, multiple carrier entrance facilities, and robust environmental controls and monitoring. 
 We employ a wide range of security features, including two-factor authentication, data encryption, encoded session identifications and passwords. We contract with specialized security vendors to conduct regular security audits of our infrastructure. We also employ outside vendors for 24x7 managed network security and monitoring. Every page we serve is delivered encrypted to the end user via a Secure Socket Layer, or SSL, transaction. We also use encryption in our storage systems and backup technology. 
 We continuously monitor the performance of our application suite using a variety of automated tools. We designed our infrastructure with built-in redundancy for all key components. Our network includes redundant firewalls, switches and intrusion detection systems, and incorporates failover backup for maximum uptime. We load balance at each tier in

the network infrastructure. We also designed our application server clusters so that servers can fail without interrupting the user experience, and our database servers are clustered for failover. We regularly back up and store customer data both on and off-site in secure locations to minimize the risk of data loss at any facility. 
 Customers 
 We serve a worldwide customer base across a wide variety of industry sectors, including healthcare, retail, telecommunications, financial services, insurance, outsourced services, technology, utilities, government, manufacturing and consumer electronics. Our product is sold primarily to large B2C enterprises (over $500 million in annual revenue). For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, international revenue accounted for 51% and domestic revenue for 49% of total revenue, compared to 50% and 50%, respectively, for fiscal year 2016, and 52% and 48%, respectively, for fiscal year 2015. 
 One customer accounted for 13% of total revenue in fiscal year 2017. Two customers accounted for 14% and 10%, respectively, of total revenue in fiscal year 2016. One customer accounted for 10% of total revenue in fiscal year 2015. 
 Competition

 Sales and Marketing 
 Sales Strategy 
 Our sales strategy is to pursue targeted accounts, mostly B2C enterprises, through a combination of our direct sales force and partners. We target our sales efforts at enterprise companies. Our North American direct sales organization is based at our corporate headquarters in Sunnyvale, California, with field sales presence throughout the United States. Internationally, we have offices in India and the United Kingdom. 
 The direct sales force is organized into teams that include field sales representatives and sales consultants. Our direct sales force is complemented by lead generation representatives and sales development representatives. 
 We also complement our direct sales force with reseller and sales alliances. We believe we are able to leverage additional sales, marketing and deployment capabilities through these alliances. 
 Marketing and Partner Strategy 
 Our marketing strategy is to build our brand around innovative and robust products trusted by leading enterprises. Our marketing organization focuses on public relations, analyst relations, marketing communications and demand generation. We employ a wide range of marketing avenues to deliver our message, including print and Internet advertising, targeted electronic and postal mailing, email newsletters, and a variety of trade shows, seminars, webinars, and interest groups. 
 Our marketing group also produces sales tools, including product collateral, customer case studies, demonstrations, presentations, and competitive analyses. In addition, the group performs market analyses and customer reviews to identify and develop key partnership opportunities and product capabilities. 
 We believe that our partners help extend the breadth and depth of our product offerings, drive market penetration, and augment our professional service capabilities. We believe these relationships are important to delivering successful, integrated products and services to our customers, and scaling our business. Our partner portal, EcoNet™, enables us to provide comprehensive sales, support and services information for channel partners, while enabling them to collaborate with one another through an online forum. Partner enablement is a key focus area for our consulting and training teams too. 
 As of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, we had 81 employees engaged in worldwide sales and marketing activities. 
 Consulting and Education 
 Our worldwide professional services organization provides consulting and education services designed to facilitate customer success and build customer loyalty. 

· | Consulting Services. Our consulting services group offers rapid implementation services, custom solution development, and systems integration services. Consultants work with customers to understand their specific requirements, analyze their business needs, and implement integrated solutions.

 Customer Support 
 We offer a comprehensive collection of support services designed to rapidly respond to inquiries. Our technical support services are available to customers worldwide under maintenance and support agreements. The customer success team uses eGain’s own software suite to provide world-class service to all our customers through support centers located in California, the United Kingdom, and India. 
 As of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, there were 63 employees engaged in worldwide customer support services and 42 employees engaged in worldwide cloud services and maintenance support. 
 Research and Development 
 The market for our products changes rapidly and is characterized by evolving industry standards, swift changes in customer requirements, and frequent new product introductions and enhancements. We believe that strong product development capabilities are essential to our strategy of maintaining technology leadership. This includes enhancing current technology, providing excellent quality, performance, and functionality, as well as developing additional applications, and maintaining the competitiveness of our product and service offerings. 
 We continuously analyze market and customer requirements and evaluate external technology that we believe will enhance our competitiveness, increase our lifetime customer value or expand our target market. As a result of this process, we acquired Exony Limited, a leader in enterprise contact center analytics software, in August 2014.  
 As of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, we had 130 employees engaged in worldwide product development activities. We spent approximately $13.8 million on research and development in fiscal year 2017, and $16.1 million and $16.0 million, respectively, in fiscal years 2016 and 2015. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We regard our intellectual property as critical to our success. We rely on intellectual property and other laws, in addition to confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements, to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology and business.
 As of June 30, 2017, we had 7 issued patents in the United States. In addition, we have a number of pending patent applications in the United States, including one provisional filing and several non‑provisional filings. Our issued U.S. patents expire at various times between 2029 and 2032.
 We continually assess the propriety of seeking intellectual property protection for those aspects of our technology that we believe constitute innovations providing significant competitive advantages. Future applications may or may not receive the issuance of valid patents or registered trademarks. 
 We routinely require our employees, customers, and potential business partners to enter into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements before we will disclose any sensitive aspects of our products, technology, or business plans. In addition, we require employees to agree to surrender to us any proprietary information, inventions or other intellectual property they generate or come to possess while employed by us. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights through confidentiality and license agreements, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. These precautions may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property. In addition, some of our license agreements with certain customers and partners require us to place the source code for our products into escrow. These agreements typically provide that some party will have a limited, non-exclusive right to access and use this code as authorized by the license agreement if there is a bankruptcy proceeding instituted by or against us, or if we materially breach a contractual commitment to provide support and maintenance to the party. 
 Employees 
 As of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, we had 479 full-time employees, of which 130 were in product development, 218 in services and support, 81 in sales and marketing, and 50 in finance and administration.

 None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. While we believe our relations with our employees are good, our future performance depends largely upon the continued service of our key technical, sales and marketing, and senior management personnel, none of whom are bound by employment agreements requiring service for a defined period of time. 
 Available Information 
 We were incorporated in Delaware in September 1997, and our website is located at www.egain.com. We make available free of charge on our website our annual reports on Form 10‑K, quarterly reports on Form 10‑Q, current reports on Form 8‑K and amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file or furnish such materials to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our website and the information contained therein or connected thereto are not intended to be incorporated into this Annual Report on Form 10‑K.    ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
 The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 
 Our business is influenced by a range of factors that are beyond our control and that we have no comparative advantage in forecasting. These include:

·
-


· | general economic and business conditions;
--+------------------------------------------


· | currency exchange rate fluctuations;
--+-------------------------------------


· | the overall demand for enterprise software and services;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


· | customer acceptance of cloud-based solutions;
--+----------------------------------------------


· | governmental budgetary constraints or shifts in government spending priorities; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | general political developments.
--+--------------------------------

  The global economic climate continues to influence our business. This includes items such as, a general tightening in the credit markets, lower levels of liquidity, increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy, and extreme volatility in credit, equity and fixed income markets. These macroeconomic developments negatively affected, and could continue to negatively affect, our business, operating results or financial condition which, in turn, could adversely affect our stock price. A general weakening of, and related declining corporate confidence in, the global economy or the curtailment in government or corporate spending could cause current or potential customers to reduce their technology budgets or be unable to fund software or services purchases, which could cause customers to delay, decrease or cancel purchases of our products and services or cause customers not to pay us or to delay paying us for previously purchased products and services. 
 Our revenue and operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future, and because we recognize revenue from subscriptions over a period of time, downturns in revenue may not be immediately reflected in our operating results.
 Because we recognize recurring revenue and maintenance revenue ratably over the terms of the related subscription agreements and maintenance support agreements, most of our revenue each quarter results from recognition of deferred revenue related to agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, declines in new or renewed subscription agreements and maintenance agreements that occur in one quarter will largely be felt in future quarters, both because we may be unable to generate sufficient new revenue to offset the decline and because we may be unable to adjust our operating costs and capital expenditures to align with the changes in revenue. In addition, our subscription model makes it more difficult for us to increase our revenue rapidly in any period, because revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term. Legacy license revenue is difficult to forecast and is likely to fluctuate due to many factors that are beyond our control including transition of license customers to 

 
  10

 
recurring revenue models. Accordingly, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as definitive indicators of future performance. 
 Other factors that may cause our revenue and operating results to fluctuate include: 

· | timing of customer budget cycles;
--+----------------------------------


· | the priority our customers place on our products compared to other business investments;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | size, timing and contract terms of new customer contracts, and unpredictable and often lengthy sales cycles;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | reduced renewals;
--+------------------


· | competitive factors, including new product introductions, upgrades and discounted pricing or special payment terms offered by our competitors, as well as strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestitures, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments or changes in business strategy;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | technical difficulties, errors or service interruptions in our solutions that may cause customer dissatisfaction with solutions;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | consolidation among our customers, which may alter their buying patterns, or business failures that may reduce demand for our solutions;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | operating expenses associated with expansion of our sales force or business, and our product development efforts;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | cost, timing and management efforts related to the introduction of new features to our solutions;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | our ability to obtain, maintain and protect our intellectual property rights and adequately safeguard the information imported to our solutions or otherwise provided to us by our customers; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | extraordinary expenses such as impairment charges, litigation or other payments related to settlement of dispute.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Any of these developments may adversely affect our revenue, operating results and financial condition. Furthermore, we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In such cases, we may be required to defer revenue recognition on sales to affected customers. In the future, we may have to record additional reserves or write-offs, or defer revenue on sales transactions, which could negatively impact our financial results. 
 If we are unable to increase the profitability of our recurring revenue products and services, if we experience significant customer attrition, or if we are required to defer recognition of revenue, our operating results could be adversely affected. 
 We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, substantial resources to expand, market, and implement and refine our recurring revenue products and services offerings. Our business model shift to recurring revenues, and our subscription services in particular, has generally generated much lower gross margins than our traditional perpetual license sales. If we are unable to increase the volume of our subscription business to offset the lower margins, we may not be able to achieve sustained profitability. 
 In order to sustain or increase our recent operating profitability, we must improve gross margins in our recurring revenue product and services offerings. Factors that could harm our ability to improve our gross margins include: 

· | increased costs to license and maintain third party software embedded in our software applications or the cost to create or substitute such third party software if it can no longer be licensed on commercially reasonable terms;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  11

 


· | our inability to maintain or increase the prices customers pay for our products and services based on competitive pricing pressures and general economic conditions limiting customer demand;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | increased cost of third party services providers, including data centers for our cloud operations and professional services contractors performing implementation and technical support services to cloud customers;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | customer contractual requirements that delay revenue recognition until customer implementations commence production operations or customer-specific requirements are met;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | significant attrition as customers decide for their own economic or other reasons to not renew their subscription contracts when they are up for renewal could negatively impact the efficiency of our data centers and lead to the costs being spread over fewer customers negatively impacting gross margin; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the inability to implement, or delays in implementing, technology-based efficiencies and efforts to streamline and consolidate processes to reduce operating costs.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We cannot accurately predict subscription renewal or upgrade rates and the impact these rates may have on our future revenue and operating results. 
 Even though our subscription contracts are typically structured for auto-renewals, we do allow our customers to elect not to renew their subscriptions for our service after the expiration of their initial subscription period, which is typically 12 to 36 months, and some customers have elected not to renew. In addition, our customers may choose to renew for fewer subscriptions, renew for shorter contract lengths, or renew for lower cost editions of our service. We cannot accurately predict renewal rates given our varied customer base of enterprise and small and medium size business customers and the number of multiyear subscription contracts. Our renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customer dissatisfaction with our service, decreases in customers’ spending levels, decreases in the number of users at our customers, pricing changes and deteriorating general economic conditions. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our service or reduce the number of paying subscriptions at the time of renewal, our revenue will decline and our business will suffer. 
 Our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services, more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our service to our current customers. This may also require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management. Similarly, the rate at which our customers purchase new or enhanced services depends on a number of factors, including general economic conditions and that our customers do not react negatively to any price changes related to these additional features and services. If our efforts to upsell to our customers are not successful and negative reaction occurs, our business may suffer. 
 Our credit agreement contains restrictive and financial covenants that may limit our operational flexibility. Furthermore, if we default on our obligations under the credit agreement, our operations may be interrupted and our business and financial results could be adversely affected.
 In November 2014, we entered into a credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (Wells Fargo), under which Wells Fargo agreed to provide a term loan in the amount of $10.0 million (Term) and revolving loan to us in an amount not to exceed $10.0 million (Revolver), Term and Revolver (collectively, the Loans). In September 2015, we increased the maximum borrowing amount of the Revolver to $15.0 million. The Loans contain a number of restrictive covenants, and its terms may restrict our current and future operations, including: 

· | affecting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry conditions;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | affecting our ability to use our cash flows, or obtain additional financing, for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | increasing our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, if we fail to comply with the covenants or payment obligations specified in the Loans, we may trigger an event of default, in which case Wells Fargo would have the right to: (i) terminate its commitment to provide additional loans under the Loans, and (ii) declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. In addition, Wells Fargo would have the right to proceed against the Loans collateral, which consists of substantially all our assets. If the debt under the Loans were to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash or be able to sell sufficient collateral to repay this debt, which would have an immediate material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 Our lengthy sales cycles and the difficulty in predicting timing of sales or delays may impair our operating results. 
 The long sales cycle for our products may cause license and subscription revenue and operating results to vary significantly from period to period. The sales cycle for our products can be six months or more and varies substantially from customer to customer. Because we sell complex and deeply integrated solutions, it can take many months of customer education to secure sales. Because our potential customers may evaluate our products before, if ever, executing definitive agreements, we may incur substantial expenses and spend significant management and legal effort in connection with the potential customer. 
 Our multi-product offering and the increasingly complex needs of our customers contribute to a longer and unpredictable sales cycle. Consequently, we often face difficulty predicting the quarter in which expected sales will actually occur. This contributes to the uncertainty and fluctuations in our future operating results. In particular, the corporate decision-making and approval process of our customers and potential customers has become more complicated. This has caused our average sales cycle to further increase and, in some cases, has prevented the closure of sales that we believed were likely to close. 
 We may need additional capital, and raising such additional capital may be difficult or impossible and will likely significantly dilute existing stockholders. 
 We believe that existing capital resources will enable us to maintain current and planned operations for the next 12 months. However, our working capital requirements in the foreseeable future are subject to numerous risks and will depend on a variety of factors. We may need to secure additional financing due to unforeseen or unanticipated market conditions. We may try to raise additional funds through public or private financings, strategic relationships, or other arrangements. Such financing may be difficult to obtain on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we succeed in raising additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible securities, then the issuance could result in substantial dilution to existing stockholders. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities or preferred stock, these new securities would have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock. The terms of these securities could impose restrictions on our operations. 
 Because we depend on a relatively small number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenue, the loss of any of these customers or our failure to attract new significant customers could adversely impact our revenue and harm our business. 
 We have in the past and expect in the future to derive a substantial portion of our revenue from sales to a relatively small number of customers. The composition of these customers has varied in the past, and we expect that it will continue to vary over time. The loss of any significant customer or a decline in business with any significant customer would materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 As we acquire companies or technologies, we may not realize the expected business benefits, the acquisitions could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operations. 
 As part of our business strategy, we periodically make investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies and intellectual property rights, and we expect that we will continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future. In August 2014, we acquired Exony Ltd. Acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including: 

· | the potential failure to achieve the expected benefits of the combination or acquisition;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  13

 


· | difficulties in and the cost of integrating operations, technologies, services and personnel;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | diversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | risks of entering new markets in which we have little or no experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | potential write-offs of acquired assets or investments, and potential financial and credit risks associated with acquired customers;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | potential loss of key employees;
--+---------------------------------


· | inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the inability to maintain relationships with customers and partners of the acquired business;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the difficulty of transitioning the acquired technology onto our existing platforms and maintaining the security standards consistent with our other services for such technology;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


· | unanticipated expenses related to acquired technology and its integration into existing technology;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | negative impact to our results of operations because of the depreciation and amortization of amounts related to acquired intangible assets, fixed assets and deferred compensation, and the loss of acquired deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | delays in customer purchases due to uncertainty related to any acquisition;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the need to implement controls, procedures and policies at the acquired company;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


· | in the case of foreign acquisitions, the challenges associated with integrating operations across different cultures and languages and any currency and regulatory risks associated with specific countries; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the tax effects of any such acquisitions.
--+------------------------------------------

  In addition, if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible or other debt securities or loans, our existing stockholders may be diluted, or we could face constraints related to the terms of repayment obligations related to the incurrence of indebtedness which could affect the market price of our common stock. Further, if we fail to evaluate and execute acquisitions or investments effectively, our business operations and prospects may be seriously harmed.
 We must compete successfully in our market segment. 
 The market for customer engagement software is intensely competitive. Other than product innovation and existing customer relationships, there are no substantial barriers to entry in this market, and established or new entities may enter this market in the future. While software internally developed by enterprises represents indirect competition, we also compete directly with packaged application software vendors, including Avaya, Inc., Genesys Telecommunications, LivePerson, Inc., and Moxie Software, Inc. In addition, we face actual or potential competition from larger software companies such as Microsoft Corporation, Oracle Corporation, Salesforce.com, Inc. and similar companies that may attempt to sell customer engagement software to their installed base. 
 We believe competition will continue to be fierce as current competitors increase the sophistication of their offerings and as new participants enter the market. Many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, broader brand recognition, and significantly greater financial, marketing and other 

 
  14

 
resources. With more established and better-financed competitors, these companies may be able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies, and make more attractive offers to businesses to induce them to use their products or services. 
 If we fail to expand and improve our sales performance and marketing activities, we may be unable to grow our business, negatively impacting our operating results and financial condition. 
 Expansion and growth of our business is dependent on our ability to expand our sales force and on the ability of our sales force to increase sales. If we are not able to effectively develop and maintain awareness of our products in a cost-effective manner, we may not achieve widespread acceptance of our existing and future products. This may result in a failure to expand and attract new customers and enhance relationships with existing customers. This may impede our efforts to improve operations in other areas of the Company and may result in declines in the market price of our common stock. 
 Due to the complexity of our customer engagement hub platform and related products and services, we must utilize highly trained sales personnel to educate prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our products and services as well as provide effective customer support. If we have turnover in our sales and marketing teams, we may not be able to successfully compete with those of our competitors. 
 Our failure to develop and expand strategic and third party distribution channels would impede our revenue growth. 
 Our success and future growth depends in part upon the skills, experience, performance and continued service of our distribution partners, including software and hardware vendors and resellers. We engage with distribution partners in a number of ways, including assisting us to identify prospective customers, to distribute our products in geographies where we do not have a physical presence and to distribute our products where they are considered complementary to other third party products distributed by the partner. We believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop and expand strategic, long term and profitable partnerships and reseller relationships. If we are unable to do so, or if any existing or future distribution partners fail to successfully market, resell, implement or support our products for their customers, or if distribution partners represent multiple providers and devote greater resources to market, resell, implement and support competing products and services, our future revenue growth could be impeded. Our failure to develop and expand relationships with systems integrators could harm our business. 
 We sometimes rely on system integrators to recommend our products to their customers and to install and support our products for their customers. We likewise depend on broad market acceptance by these system integrators of our product and service offerings. Our agreements generally do not prohibit competitive offerings and system integrators may develop market or recommend software applications that compete with our products. Moreover, if these firms fail to implement our products successfully for their customers, we may not have the resources to implement our products on the schedule required by their customers. To the extent we devote resources to these relationships and the partnerships do not proceed as anticipated or provide revenue or other results as anticipated, our business may be harmed. Once partnerships are forged, there can be no guarantee that such relationships will be renewed in the future or available on acceptable terms. If we lose strategic third party relationships, fail to renew or develop new relationships, or fail to fully exploit revenue opportunities within such relationships, our results of operations and future growth may suffer. 
 Our international operations involve various risks. 
 We derived 51% of our revenue from international sales for the fiscal year 2017 compared to 50% for the fiscal year 2016, and 52% for fiscal year 2015. Including those discussed above, our international sales operations are subject to a number of specific risks, such as: 

· | general economic conditions in each country or region in which we do or plan to do business;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | foreign currency fluctuations and imposition of exchange controls;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


· | expenses associated with complying with differing technology standards and language translation issues;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  15

 


· | difficulty and costs in staffing and managing our international operations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | health or similar issues, such as a pandemic or epidemic;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


· | various trade restrictions and tax consequences;
--+-------------------------------------------------


· | hostilities in various parts of the world; and
--+-----------------------------------------------


· | reduced intellectual property protections in some countries.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

  As of June 30, 2017, approximately 47% of our workforce was employed in India. Of these employees, 31% are allocated to research and development. Although the movement of certain operations internationally was principally motivated by cost cutting, the continued management of these remote operations requires significant management attention and financial resources that could adversely affect our operating performance. In addition, with the significant increase in the numbers of foreign businesses that have established operations in India, the competition to attract and retain employees there has increased significantly. As a result of the increased competition for skilled workers, we experienced increased compensation costs and expect these costs to increase in the future. Our reliance on our workforce in India makes us particularly susceptible to disruptions in the business environment in that region. In particular, sophisticated telecommunications links, high-speed data communications with other eGain offices and customers, and overall consistency and stability of our business infrastructure are vital to our day-to-day operations, and any impairment of such infrastructure will cause our financial condition and results to suffer. The maintenance of stable political relations between the United States, European Union and India are also of great importance to our operations. 
 Any of these risks could have a significant impact on our product development, customer support, or professional services. To the extent the benefit of maintaining these operations abroad does not exceed the expense of establishing and maintaining such activities, our operating results and financial condition will suffer. 
 Difficulties in implementing our products could harm our revenue and margins. 
 We generally recognize license or subscription revenue from a customer sale when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product or access to the product has been delivered, the arrangement does not involve significant customization of the software, the license or subscription fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the fee is probable. If an arrangement requires significant customization or implementation services from us, recognition of the associated license or subscription and service revenue could be delayed. The timing of the commencement and completion of these services is subject to factors that may be beyond our control, as this process may require access to the customer’s facilities and coordination with the customer’s personnel after delivery of the software. In addition, customers could cancel or delay product implementations. Implementation typically involves working with sophisticated software, computing and communications systems. If we experience difficulties with implementation or do not meet project milestones in a timely manner, we could be obligated to devote more customer support, engineering and other resources to a particular project. Some customers may also require us to develop customized features or capabilities. If new or existing customers cancel or have difficulty deploying our products or require significant amounts of our professional services, support, or customized features, revenue recognition could be cancelled or further delayed and our costs could increase, causing increased variability in our operating results. 
 Our reserves may be insufficient to cover receivables we are unable to collect. 
 We assume a certain level of credit risk with our customers in order to do business. Conditions affecting any of our customers could cause them to become unable or unwilling to pay us in a timely manner, or at all, for products or services we have already provided them. In the past, we have experienced collection delays from certain customers, and we cannot predict whether we will continue to experience similar or more severe delays in the future. Although we have established reserves to cover losses due to delays or inability to pay, there can be no assurance that such reserves will be sufficient to cover our losses. If losses due to delays or inability to pay are greater than our reserves, it could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.

 We may be subject to legal liability and/or negative publicity for the services provided to consumers via our technology platforms. 
 Our technology platforms enable representatives of our customers as well as individual service providers to communicate with consumers and other persons seeking information or advice on the Internet. The law relating to the liability of online platform providers such as us for the activities of users of their online platforms is often challenged in the U.S. and internationally. We may be unable to prevent users of our technology platforms from providing negligent, unlawful or inappropriate advice, information or content via our technology platforms, or from behaving in an unlawful manner, and we may be subject to allegations of civil or criminal liability for negligent, fraudulent, unlawful or inappropriate activities carried out by users of our technology platforms. 
 Claims could be made against online services companies under both U.S. and foreign law such as fraud, defamation, libel, invasion of privacy, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated by users of our technology platforms. In addition, domestic and foreign legislation has been proposed that could prohibit or impose liability for the transmission over the Internet of certain types of information. Our defense of any of these actions could be costly and involve significant time and attention of our management and other resources. 
 The Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or DMCA, is intended, among other things, to reduce the liability of online service providers for listing or linking to third party web properties that include materials that infringe copyrights or rights of others. Additionally, portions of The Communications Decency Act, or CDA, are intended to provide statutory protections to online service providers who distribute third party content. A safe harbor for copyright infringement is also available under the DMCA to certain online service providers that provide specific services, if the providers take certain affirmative steps as set forth in the DMCA. Important questions regarding the safe harbor under the DMCA and the CDA have yet to be litigated, and we cannot guarantee that we will meet the safe harbor requirements of the DMCA or of the CDA. If we are not covered by a safe harbor, for any reason, we could be exposed to claims, which could be costly and time-consuming to defend. 
 Unplanned system interruptions and capacity constraints and failure to effect efficient transmission of customer communications and data over the Internet could harm our business and reputation. 
 Our customers have in the past experienced some interruptions with eGain cloud operations. We believe that these interruptions will continue to occur from time to time. These interruptions could be due to hardware and operating system failures. As a result, our business will suffer if we experience frequent or long system interruptions that result in the unavailability or reduced performance of our hosted operations or reduce our ability to provide remote management services. We expect to experience occasional temporary capacity constraints due to sharply increased traffic or other Internet-wide disruptions, which may cause unanticipated system disruptions, slower response times, impaired quality, and degradation in levels of customer service. If this were to continue to happen, our business and reputation could be seriously harmed. 
 The growth in the use of the Internet has caused interruptions and delays in accessing the Internet and transmitting data over the Internet. Interruptions also occur due to systems burdens brought on by unsolicited bulk email or “Spam,” malicious service attacks and hacking into operating systems, viruses, worms and a “Trojan” horse, the proliferation of which is beyond our control and may seriously impact our and our customers’ businesses. 
 Because we provide cloud-based software, interruptions or delays in Internet transmissions will harm our customers’ ability to receive and respond to online interactions. Therefore, our market depends on ongoing improvements being made to the entire Internet infrastructure to alleviate overloading and congestion. 
 Our success largely depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications hardware and network systems. A significant amount of our computer and communications systems are located in Sunnyvale, California. Due to our location, our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire, earthquake, power loss, telecommunications failure and similar events. Customer data that we store in third party data centers may also be vulnerable to damage or interruption from floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. Any damage to, or failure of, our systems generally could result in interruptions in our service. 

 
  17

 
Interruptions in our service may reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our renewal rate and our ability to attract new customers.
 We do maintain a business continuity plan for our customers in the event of an outage. We maintain other co-locations for the purposes of disaster recovery as well as maintaining backups of our customer’s information. We provide premium disaster recovery and standard disaster recovery to our customers.  If a customer opts not to pay for premium disaster recovery, we will only assure that their data is available within 72 hours. This delay could cause severe disruptions to our customers’ customers and may result in customer termination of our solutions.  Our premium disaster recovery service provides for an alternative data center and a return to operations within one business day.  
 We have entered into service agreements with some of our customers that require minimum performance standards, including standards regarding the availability and response time of our remote management services. If we fail to meet these standards, our customers could terminate their relationships with us, and we could be subject to contractual refunds and service credits to, and exposure to claims for losses by, customers. Any unplanned interruption of services may harm our ability to attract and retain customers. 
 If our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer’s data or our data or our IT systems, our service may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our service and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities. 
 Our service involves the storage and transmission of customers’ proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation and possible liability. These security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our customers’ data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our IT systems. Additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers’ data or our data or IT systems. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, our customers may authorize third party access to their customer data located in our cloud environment. Because we do not control the transmissions between customer authorized third parties, or the processing of such data by customer authorized third parties, we cannot ensure the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing. Any security breach could result in a loss of confidence in the security of our service, damage our reputation, negatively impact our future sales, disrupt our business and lead to legal liability. 
 The terms we agree to in our Service Level Agreements or other contracts may result in increased costs or liabilities, which would in turn affect our results of operations. 
 Our Service Level Agreements (SLAs) provides for service credits for system unavailability, and in some cases, indemnities for loss, damage or costs resulting from use of our system. If we were required to provide any of these in a material way, our results of operations would suffer. 
 We have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for various claims including alleged infringement of proprietary rights. 
 We are involved in various legal matters arising from the normal course of business activities. These may include claims, suits, and other proceedings involving alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, and commercial, labor and employment, and other matters. 
 The software and Internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have received in the past and may receive in the future communications from third parties claiming that we or our customers have infringed the intellectual property rights of others. In addition we have been, and may in the future be, sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their claimed proprietary rights. Our technologies and those of our customers may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third party or we may be required to 

 
  18

 
pay damages, or both. Many of our agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim. 
 The outcome of any litigation, regardless of its merits, is inherently uncertain. Any claims and lawsuits, and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert management attention from executing our business plan, lead to attempts on the part of other parties to pursue similar claims and, in the case of intellectual property claims, require us to change our technology, change our business practices or pay monetary damages, or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements. 
 Any adverse determination related to intellectual property claims or other litigation could prevent us from offering our service to others, could be material to our financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results. In addition, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, a resolution of a legal matter could materially affect our future results of operation or cash flows or both. 
 We rely on trademark, copyright, trade secret laws, contractual restrictions and patent rights to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights and if these rights are impaired, then our ability to generate revenue will be harmed. 
 If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors might gain access to our technology, and our business might be harmed. In addition, defending our intellectual property rights might entail significant expense. Any of our trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. While we have some U.S. patents and pending U.S. patent applications, we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications. In addition, our existing patents and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain. Effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our service is available. The laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the U.S., and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property. 
 We might be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. We may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. Any litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. 
 Our failure or inability to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on a timely basis would harm our business. 
 We may be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time in the ordinary course of our business, including claims of alleged infringement of the patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties. Our products may infringe issued patents that may relate to our products because patent applications in the United States are not publicly disclosed until the patent is issued, and hence applications may have been filed which relate to our software products. Intellectual property litigation is expensive, time consuming, and could divert management’s attention away from running our business. This litigation could also require us to develop non-infringing technology or enter into royalty or license agreements. These royalty or license agreements, if required, may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all, in the event of a successful claim of infringement. 
 Software errors could be costly and time-consuming for us to correct, and could harm our reputation and impair our ability to sell our solutions.
 Our solutions are based on complex software that may contain errors, or "bugs," that could be costly to correct, harm our reputation and impair our ability to sell our solutions to new customers. Moreover, customers relying on our solution may be more sensitive to such errors, and potential security vulnerabilities and business interruptions for these applications. If we incur substantial costs to correct any errors of this nature, our operating margins could be adversely 

 
  19

 
affected. Because our customers depend on our solutions for critical business functions, any service interruptions could result in lost or delayed market acceptance and lost sales, higher service-level credits and warranty costs, diversion of development resources and product liability suits.  
 Our stock price has demonstrated volatility and continued market conditions may cause declines or fluctuations. 
 The price at which our common stock trades has been and will likely continue to be highly volatile and show wide fluctuations due to factors such as the following: 

· | transition to a recurring revenue model;
--+-----------------------------------------


· | concerns related to liquidity of our stock;
--+--------------------------------------------


· | actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results, our ability to meet announced or anticipated profitability goals and changes in or failure to meet securities analysts’ expectations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | announcements of technological innovations and/or the introduction of new services by us or our competitors;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | developments with respect to intellectual property rights and litigation, regulatory scrutiny and new legislation;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | conditions and trends in the Internet and other technology industries; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | general market and economic conditions.
--+----------------------------------------

  Furthermore, the stock market has recently and in the past experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for the common stock of technology companies, regardless of the specific operating performance of the affected company. These broad market fluctuations may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. 
 Our insiders who are significant stockholders may control the election of our board and may have interests that conflict with those of other stockholders. 
 Our directors and executive officers, together with their affiliates and members of their immediate families, beneficially owned, in the aggregate, approximately 36% of our outstanding capital stock as of September 19, 2017, of which our Chief Executive Officer, Ashutosh Roy, beneficially owned approximately 31% as of such date. As a result of these concentrated holdings, Mr. Roy individually or together with this group has the ability to exercise significant control over most matters requiring our stockholders’ approval, including the election and removal of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions. 
 Our offshore product development, support and professional services may prove difficult to manage or may not allow us to realize our cost reduction goals, produce effective new solutions and provide professional services to drive growth.
 We use offshore resources to perform new product and services development and provide support and professional consulting efforts, which requires detailed technical and logistical coordination. We must ensure that our international resources and personnel are aware of and understand development specifications and customer support, as well as implementation and configuration requirements and that they can meet applicable timelines. If we are unable to maintain acceptable standards of quality in support, product development and professional services, our attempts to reduce costs and drive growth through new products and margin improvements in technical support and professional services may be negatively impacted, which would adversely affect our results of operations. Outsourcing services to offshore providers may expose us to misappropriation of our intellectual property or that of our customers, or make it more difficult to defend intellectual property rights in our technology.

 
  20

 

 If we are unable to hire and retain key personnel, our business and results of operations would be negatively affected. 
 Our success will also depend in large part on the skills, experience and performance of our senior management, engineering, sales, marketing and other key personnel. The loss of the services of any of our senior management or other key personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer and co-founder, Ashutosh Roy, could harm our business. Additionally, an increase in attrition in the Indian workforce on which we rely for research and development would have significant negative effects on us and our results of operations. If we cannot hire and retain qualified personnel, our ability to expand our business would be impaired and our results of operations would suffer. 
 Changes in the European regulatory environment regarding privacy and data protection regulations could expose us to risks of noncompliance and costs associated with compliance.
 We have in the past relied on adherence to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Safe Harbor Privacy Principles and compliance with the U.S.-EU and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks as agreed to and set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce, and the European Union and Switzerland, which established a means for legitimating the transfer of PII by U.S. companies doing business in Europe from the European Economic Area to the U.S. As a result of the October 6, 2015 European Union Court of Justice, or ECJ, opinion in Case C-362/14 (Schrems v. Data Protection Commissioner) regarding the adequacy of the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework, the U.S. – EU Safe Harbor Framework is no longer deemed to be a valid method of compliance with restrictions set forth in the Data Protection Directive (Directive) (and member states’ implementations thereof) regarding the transfer of data outside of the European Economic Area requiring us to rely on alternative mechanisms permitted under the Directive, such as consent and EU-specified standard contractual clauses.  The U.S. - EU Safe Harbor was replaced with the EU - U.S. Privacy Shield (Privacy Shield) in July 2016 and, starting on August 1, 2016, the Privacy Shield was made available to companies for self-certification. We have self-certified with the Privacy Shield. Nevertheless, some of the mechanisms permitting transfer of data from the EU to the U.S. have been subject to challenges, whose outcomes remain uncertain. On December 15, 2015, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union reached a political agreement on the future EU data protection legal framework. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), adopted on 27 April 2016, will replace the Directive, and becomes enforceable from 25 May 2018 after a two-year transition period. The GDPR will have significant impacts on how businesses can collect and process the personal data of EU individuals. We may be unsuccessful in establishing legitimate means of transferring data from the European Economic Area, we may experience hesitancy, reluctance, or refusal by European or multi-national customers to continue to use our services due to the potential risk exposure to such customers as a result of the ECJ ruling or the implementation of GDPR, and we and our customers are at risk of enforcement actions taken by an EU data protection authority until such point in time that we ensure that all data transfers to us from the European Economic Area are legitimized. We may find it necessary to establish systems to maintain EU-origin data in the European Economic Area, which may involve substantial expense and distraction from other aspects of our business. We publicly post our privacy policies and practices concerning our processing, use and disclosure of PII. Our publication of our privacy policy and other statements we publish that provide promises and assurances about privacy and security can subject us to potential state and federal action if they are found to be deceptive or misrepresentative of our practices. Further, the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such laws, regulations and policies that are applicable to us may limit the use and adoption of our products and solutions and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
 Privacy concerns and laws, evolving regulation of cloud computing, cross-border data transfer restrictions and other domestic or foreign regulations may limit the use and adoption of our solutions and adversely affect our business. 
 Regulation related to the provision of services on the Internet is increasing, as federal, state and foreign governments continue to adopt new laws and regulations addressing data privacy and the collection, processing, storage and use of personal information. Further, laws are increasingly aimed at the use of personal information for marketing purposes, such as the European Union’s e-Privacy Directive, and the country-specific regulations that implement that directive. Such laws and regulations are subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions. These and other requirements could reduce demand for our solutions or restrict our ability to store and process data or, in some cases, impact our ability to offer our services and solutions in certain locations. 

 
  21

 

 In addition to government activity, privacy advocacy and other industry groups have established or may establish new self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us. Our customers expect us to meet voluntary certification or other standards established by third parties, such as TRUSTe. If we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards, it could adversely affect our ability to provide our solutions to certain customers and could harm our business. 
 The costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by laws, regulations and standards may limit the use and adoption of our service and reduce overall demand for it, or lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for any noncompliance. 
 Furthermore, concerns regarding data privacy may cause our customers’ customers to resist providing the data necessary to allow our customers to use our service effectively. Even the perception that the privacy of personal information is not satisfactorily protected or does not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our products or services, and could limit adoption of our subscription solution. 
 Industry-specific regulation is evolving and unfavorable industry-specific laws, regulations or interpretive positions could harm our business. 
 Our customers and potential customers do business in a variety of industries, including financial services, the public sector, healthcare and telecommunications. Regulators in certain industries have adopted and may in the future adopt regulations or interpretive positions regarding the use of cloud computing and other outsourced services. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, industry-specific laws, regulations and interpretive positions may limit customers’ use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand for our services. For example, some financial services regulators have imposed guidelines for use of cloud computing services that mandate specific controls or require financial services enterprises to obtain regulatory approval prior to outsourcing certain functions. If we are unable to comply with these guidelines or controls, or if our customers are unable to obtain regulatory approval to use our service where required, our business may be harmed. In addition, an inability to satisfy the standards of certain voluntary third-party certification bodies that our customers may expect, such as an attestation of compliance with the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards, may have an adverse impact on our business. If in the future we are unable to achieve or maintain these industry-specific certifications or other requirements or standards relevant to our customers, it may harm our business. 
 In some cases, industry-specific laws, regulations or interpretive positions may also apply directly to us as a service provider. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such requirements could have an adverse impact on our business. 
 We may need to license third-party technologies and may be unable to do so on commercially reasonable terms. 
 To the extent we need to license third-party technologies, we may be unable to do so on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, we may fail to successfully integrate any licensed technology into our products or services. Third-party licenses may expose us to increased risks, including risks associated with the integration of new technology, the diversion of resources from the development of our own proprietary technology, and our inability to generate revenue from new technology sufficient to offset associated acquisition and maintenance costs. Our inability to obtain and successfully integrate any of these licenses could delay product and service development until equivalent technology can be identified, licensed and integrated. This in turn would harm our business and operating results. 
 Changes to current accounting policies could have a significant effect on our reported financial results or the way in which we conduct our business. 
 Generally accepted accounting principles and the related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations for some of our significant accounting policies are highly complex and require subjective judgments and assumptions. Some of our more significant accounting policies that could be affected by changes in the accounting rules and the related implementation guidelines and interpretations include: 

· | recognition of revenue;
--+------------------------

 
 
  22

 


· | contingencies and litigation; and
--+----------------------------------


· | accounting for income taxes.
--+-----------------------------

  Changes in these or other rules, or scrutiny of our current accounting practices, or a determination that our judgments or assumptions in the application of these accounting principles were incorrect, could have a significant adverse effect on our reported operating results or the way in which we conduct our business. 
 We depend on broad market acceptance of our applications and of our business model. 
 We depend on the widespread acceptance and use of our applications as an effective solution for businesses seeking to manage high volumes of customer interactions across multiple channels, including Web, phone, email, print and in-person. While we believe the potential to be very large, we cannot accurately estimate the size or growth rate of the potential market for such product and service offerings generally, and we do not know whether our products and services in particular will achieve broad market acceptance. The market for customer engagement software is rapidly evolving, and concerns over the security and reliability of online transactions, the privacy of users and quality of service or other issues may inhibit the growth of the Internet and commercial online services. If the market for our applications fails to grow or grows more slowly than we currently anticipate, our business will be seriously harmed. 
 Furthermore, our business model is premised on business assumptions that are still evolving. Our business model assumes that both customers and companies will increasingly elect to communicate via multiple channels, as well as demand integration of the online channels into the traditional telephone-based call center. If any of these assumptions is incorrect or if customers and companies do not adopt digital technology in a timely manner, our business will be seriously harmed and our stock price will decline. 
 We may be unable to respond to the rapid technological change and changing customer preferences in the online sales, marketing, customer service, and/or online consumer services industries and this may harm our business. 
 If we are unable, for technological, legal, financial or other reasons, to adapt in a timely manner to changing market conditions in the online sales, marketing, customer service and/or e-commerce industry or our customers’ or Internet users’ requirements or preferences, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected. Business on the Internet is characterized by rapid technological change. In addition, the market for online sales, marketing, customer service and expert advice solutions is relatively new. Sudden changes in customer and Internet user requirements and preferences, frequent new product and service introductions embodying new technologies, such as broadband communications, and the emergence of new industry standards and practices such as but not limited to security standards could render our services and our proprietary technology and systems obsolete. The rapid evolution of these products and services will require that we continually improve the performance, features and reliability of our services. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to: 

· | enhance the features and performance of our services;
--+------------------------------------------------------


· | develop and offer new services that are valuable to companies doing business online as well as Internet users; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices in a cost-effective and timely manner.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  If any of our new services, including upgrades to our current services, do not meet our customers’ or Internet users’ expectations, our business may be harmed. Updating our technology may require significant additional capital expenditures and could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 If new services require us to grow rapidly, this could place a significant strain on our managerial, operational, technical and financial resources. In order to manage our growth, we could be required to implement new or upgraded operating and financial systems, procedures and controls. Our failure to expand our operations in an efficient manner could cause our expenses to grow, our revenue to decline or grow more slowly than expected and could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition

 We may engage in future acquisitions or investments that could dilute our existing stockholders, cause us to incur significant expenses or harm our business. 
 We may review acquisition or investment prospects that we believe may complement our current business or enhance our technological capabilities. Integrating any newly acquired businesses or their technologies or products may be expensive and time-consuming, and may not result in benefits to our business. To finance any acquisitions, it may be necessary for us to raise additional funds through public or private financings. Additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, if at all, and, in the case of equity financings, may result in dilution to our existing stockholders. We may not be able to operate acquired businesses profitably. If we are unable to integrate newly acquired entities or technologies effectively, our operating results could suffer. Future acquisitions by us could also result in large and immediate write-offs, incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, or amortization of expenses related to goodwill and other intangibles, any of which could harm our operating results.
 We may not be able to realize the benefits of offering the limited “Try & Buy” free version of our service.
 We offer a limited version of our subscription service to customers or potential customers free of charge (known as “Try & Buy”) in order to promote usage, brand and product awareness, and adoption, and we invest time and resources for such initial engagements without compensation from the customers. Some customers never enter into a definitive contract for our paid subscription service despite the time and effort we may have expended on such Try & Buy initiatives.  To the extent that these customers do not become paying customers, we will not realize the intended benefits of this marketing effort, and our ability to grow our business and revenue may be harmed.
 The uncertainty surrounding the implementation and effect of Brexit may cause increased economic volatility, affecting our operations and business.
 On June 23, 2016, voters in the United Kingdom (U.K.) approved an advisory referendum to withdraw membership from the European Union (E.U.), which proposed exit (referred to as Brexit) could cause disruptions to, and create uncertainty surrounding, our business in the U.K. and E.U., including affecting our relationships with our existing and future customers, suppliers and employees. As a result, Brexit could have an adverse effect on our future business, financial results and operations. The formal process for U.K. leaving the E.U. began in March 2017, when the U.K. served notice to the European Council under Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon. The long-term nature of the U.K.’s relationship with the E.U. is unclear and there is considerable uncertainty when any relationship will be agreed and implemented. The political and economic instability created by Brexit has caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in global financial markets and uncertainty regarding the regulation of data protection in the U.K. Brexit could also have the effect of disrupting the free movement of goods, services, and people between the U.K., the E.U., and elsewhere. The effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the U.K. makes to retain access to E.U. markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which E.U. laws to replace or replicate. Further, uncertainty around these and related issues could lead to adverse effects on the economy of the U.K. and the other economies in which we operate. There can be no assurance that any or all of these events will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations, results of operations and financial condition.
