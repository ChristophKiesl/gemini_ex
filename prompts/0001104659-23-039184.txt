ITEM 1. BUSINESS
7 Acquisition Corporation (the “Company”) is a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company on March 4, 2021. The Company was incorporated for the purpose of entering into a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the “Business Combination”).
The Company is not limited to a particular industry or geographic location for purposes of consummating a Business Combination. The Company is an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies.
To date, our efforts have been limited to our organizational activities and activities relating to our initial public offering (“IPO”) and the identification and evaluation of prospective acquisition targets for our initial Business Combination. We have generated no operating revenues to date, and we do not expect that we will generate operating revenues until we consummate our initial Business Combination. The registration statement for the Company’s IPO was declared effective on November 4, 2021 (the “Effective Date”). On November 9, 2021, the Company consummated the IPO of 23,000,000 units (the “Units”), including 3,000,000 Units that were issued pursuant to the underwriter’s exercise of its over-allotment option in full, at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $230,000,000, which is discussed in Note 3 to our financial statements included in this Report. Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Company consummated the sale of 11,350,000 private placement warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant in a private placement to our sponsor and the anchor investors, generating proceeds of $11,350,000.
Following the closing of the IPO on November 9, 2021, $234,600,000 ($10.20 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the IPO and the consummation of the Private Placement Warrants Purchase Agreement was placed in a trust account (“Trust Account”) located in the United States which are invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earliest of: (i) the completion of a Business Combination; (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a shareholder vote to amend the Company’s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association; and (iii) the redemption of the Company’s public shares if the Company is unable to complete the initial Business Combination within 18 months from November 9, 2021, the closing date of the IPO (or any extended period of time that the Company may have to consummate an initial Business Combination as a result of an amendment to its amended and restated memorandum and articles of association) (the “Combination Period”).
The closing of the IPO and sale of Private Placement Warrants generated total gross proceeds of $241,350,000. Following the closing of the IPO and sale of Private Placement Warrants, an aggregate amount of $234,600,000 was placed in the U.S. based trust account (the “Trust Account”) established in connection with the IPO. Transaction costs amounted to $24,551,888, consisting of $4,600,000 of underwriting discounts and commissions, $8,050,000 of deferred underwriting fees, $686,869 of other offering costs and $11,215,019 excess fair value of anchor investor shares. In addition, on November 9, 2021, $2,111,900 of cash was held outside of the Trust Account established in connection with the IPO, which is available for the payment of offering costs and for working capital purposes. On January 6, 2023, the underwriter agreed to waive any entitlement to the deferred underwriting fee payable due upon the consummation of the initial Business Combination and further agreed to waive any claim it may have in the future to the Trust Account or any monies or other assets therein.
As a result of the underwriter’s exercise in full of its over-allotment option, 750,000 of the Founder Shares are no longer subject to forfeiture.
On December 22, 2021, we announced that the holders of our Units may elect to separately trade the Class A ordinary shares and Warrants included in the Units commencing on December 23, 2021 on the Nasdaq Global Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbols of “SVNA” and “SVNAW,” respectively. Those Units not separated will continue to trade on Nasdaq under the symbol “SVNAU.”
