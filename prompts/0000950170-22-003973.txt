Our current clinical pipeline in the Oncology Innovation Platform is derived from the following core technologies: (1) Cell Therapy, (2) Orascovery, based on a P-glycoprotein (“P-gp”) pump inhibitor, and (3) Src Kinase inhibition. We have assembled a strong and experienced leadership team and have established global operations across the pharmaceutical value chain to execute our goal of becoming a global leader in bringing innovative cancer treatments to the market and improving health outcomes.
Significant Developments in the Oncology Innovation Platform
 Cell Therapy
 Through our acquisition of Kuur Therapeutics, Inc. (formerly known as Cell Medica, “Kuur”) in 2021, we acquired rights to intellectual property to further the development of autologous and allogeneic, or “off-the-shelf”, natural killer T (“NKT”) cell immunotherapies for the treatment of solid and hematological malignancies. We are advancing the following product candidates: KUR-501, KUR-502, and KUR-503.
KUR-501 is an autologous product in which NKT cells are engineered with a chimeric antigen receptor (“CAR”) targeting GD2 (“GINAKIT” cells). GD2 is expressed on almost all neuroblastoma tumors and certain other malignancies. KUR-501 is currently being evaluated in a phase 1 clinical trial (GINAKIT2) treating children with relapsed-refractory (“R/R”) high risk neuroblastoma. In May 2021, we presented an interim data update from the first eleven evaluable patients at the American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy (“ASGCT”). During this initial evaluation, the safety profile of KUR-501 was manageable, and there was no dose limiting toxicity (“DLT”). No patients experienced grade 2 or higher toxicities related to KUR-501. There were no grades 3-5 cytokine release syndrome (“CRS”) and no evidence of immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (“ICANS”) in any of the patients. Grades 3-4 adverse events (“AEs”), reported regardless of relationship to KUR-501, have included anemia, leukopenia, lymphopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, abdominal distension, acute gastroenteritis, liver enzyme increase, vomiting, bone pain, headache, neck pain, fever, urinary tract infection, altered mental status, and hypoxia. As this clinical development program is still in the early stages, we do not yet have meaningful statistics on safety, including AEs, to report. Observed responses included one complete response (“CR”) and one partial response (“PR”). Four additional patients have exhibited stable disease (“SD”). We also observed long-term persistence of NKT cells expressing CAR. Importantly, we observed NKT cell localization to the tumor site.
KUR-502 is an allogeneic (“off-the-shelf”) product in which NKT cells are engineered with a CAR targeting CD19. KUR-502 is currently being evaluated in a phase 1 clinical trial (ANCHOR) treating adults with R/R CD19 positive malignancies, including B cell lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (“ALL”), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (“CLL”). In December 2021, we presented an interim data update on the first five evaluable patients at the American Society of Hematology (“ASH”) annual meeting. Tumor biopsies showed presence of NKT cells expressing CARs in the disease sites, indicating that the KUR-502 cells are able to traffic to the tumor. The safety profile was manageable with no DLT. There was one case of grade 1 CRS, no ICANS, and no graft versus host disease (“GvHD”) attributable to KUR-502. Grades 3-4 AEs, reported regardless of relationship to KUR-502, have included lymphopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, liver enzyme elevation, bilirubin elevation, anemia, diarrhea, hypoalbuminemia, and myositis. As this clinical development program is still in the early stages, we do not yet have meaningful statistics on safety, including AEs, to report. Of the first five evaluable patients, the overall response rate was 80%, and the complete response rate was 60%.
KUR-503 is an allogeneic (“off-the-shelf”) product in which NKT cells are engineered with a CAR targeting glypican-3 (“GPC3”). GPC3 is a molecule that is highly expressed on most hepatocellular carcinomas (“HCC”) but not normal liver or other non-neoplastic tissue. KUR-503 is currently in preclinical development, and we are planning to submit an IND by the first half of 2023.
We continue to advance TCR affinity-enhancing specific T-cell (“TAEST”) therapy with our drug candidate, TCRT-ESO-A2. TCRT-ESO-A2 is an autologous T cell receptor (“TCR”)-T cell therapy targeting solid tumors that are NY-ESO-1 positive in HLA-A*02:01 positive patients. A phase 1 clinical trial treating adults with advanced solid tumors expressing NY-ESO-1 is currently open enrolling.
Orascovery
Our Orascovery technology is based on the novel P-gp pump inhibitor molecule, encequidar. Oral administration of encequidar in combination with established chemotherapy agents such as paclitaxel, irinotecan, docetaxel, topotecan and eribulin has been shown

to improve the absorption of these agents by blocking the P-gp pump in the intestinal wall. Oral paclitaxel and encequidar (“Oral Paclitaxel”), is our lead asset in our Orascovery platform.
Significant developments in our Orascovery platform in 2021 include the following:
 On February 26, 2021, we received a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) regarding our New Drug Application (“NDA”) for Oral Paclitaxel for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer ("mBC").
In June 2021, we presented data on Oral Paclitaxel for the treatment of mBC at the American Society for Clinical Oncology 2021 (ASCO2021) Virtual Scientific Program. Results of a post-hoc subgroup efficacy analysis based on additional tumor subtype data were presented.
In June 2021, we presented data from an open-label, two-way crossover phase 1 pharmacokinetic study of oral docetaxel and encequidar (“Oral Docetaxel”) vs IV docetaxel, at the ASCO2021 Virtual Scientific Program. The data demonstrated the drug was well tolerated with no dose limiting toxicities, or drug-related serious adverse events at the doses tested. The mean absolute bioavailability was 15.9% (range 8% to 25%) with PK exposure becoming non-linear at 300 mg/m2.
In September 2021, we presented interim data from a study of Oral Paclitaxel in combination with pembrolizumab at the European Society for Medical Oncology (“ESMO”) Virtual Congress 2021. The safety data helps establish Part B dose expansion and Phase 2 dose. The data showed encouraging anti-tumor activity in non-small cell lung cancer patients who failed prior PD1/PDL1 therapies.
 Following the CRL, we held two Type A meetings with the FDA to discuss the deficiencies raised in the CRL, review a proposed design for a new clinical trial intended to address the deficiencies raised in the CRL, and discuss the potential regulatory path forward for Oral Paclitaxel in metastatic breast cancer (“mBC”) in the U.S. In October 2021, after careful consideration of the FDA feedback, we determined to redeploy our resources to focus on other ongoing studies of Oral Paclitaxel and our Cell Therapy platform.
 On November 29, 2021, we announced the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”) validation of the Marketing Authorization Application (“MAA”) for Oral Paclitaxel, for review. The Phase 3 study of Oral Paclitaxel in MBC (KX-ORAX-001) served as the basis of the MAA.
 In December 2021, we presented a subgroup analysis from the Phase 3 study of Oral Paclitaxel in mBC patients, at the 2021 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (“SABCS”). Analysis of safety data demonstrated that patients with elevated liver tests were at increased risk of neutropenia related toxicities. Post hoc analysis of this subgroup of patients with hepatic impairment was conducted and showed a median survival rate of 18.9 months in patients treated with Oral Paclitaxel vs 10.1 months in those treated with IV Paclitaxel, with a hazard ratio of 0.59.
We are continuing to evaluate Oral Paclitaxel in combination with check point inhibitors.
 Src Kinase Inhibition
 Our Src Kinase inhibition platform technology is based on novel small molecule compounds that have multiple mechanisms of action, including the inhibition of the activity of Src Kinase and the inhibition of tubulin polymerization, which may limit the growth or proliferation of cancerous cells. We believe the combination of these mechanisms of action provides a broader range of anti-cancer activity compared to either mechanism of action alone. Our lead product candidate on our Src Kinase inhibition platform is tirbanibulin (formerly known as KX2-391 and KX-01) ointment, which we are advancing for the treatment of actinic keratosis (“AK”) and skin cancer.
Significant developments in our Src Kinase inhibition platform in 2021 include the following:
 The New England Journal of Medicine published the pivotal Phase 3 trial results on Klisyri® for the topical treatment of AK of the face or scalp in the February 11, 2021 issue.
 On February 15, 2021, we entered into the Second Amendment to the 2011 license agreement with PharmaEssentia Corp. (“PharmaEssentia”) for tirbanibulin ointment (the “Second Amendment to the PharmaEssentia Agreement”). The Second Amendment to the PharmaEssentia Agreement expands the territory to include Japan and South Korea and includes a license to use the intellectual property for additional dermatology indications and skin cancer in the existing territories.
 On February 18, 2021, our partner Almirall S.A. (“Almirall”) launched Klisyri® for AK in the US.
 On May 21, 2021, we announced our partner Almirall S.A. received a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) of the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) for the regulatory approval of Klisyri®, indicated for the topical treatment of AK of the face or scalp.
On July 19, 2021, our partner Almirall received approval from the European Commission to market Klisyri®, indicated for the topical treatment of AK of the face or scalp in adults.


On July 26, 2021, we announced that we entered into licensing agreements and strategic partnerships with Seqirus Pty Ltd (“Seqirus”), a subsidiary of CSL Limited, and AVIR Pharma Inc. (“AVIR”) for tirbanibulin. Under the terms of the agreements, Seqirus will have an exclusive license to commercialize tirbanibulin in Australia and New Zealand, and AVIR will have an exclusive license to commercialize tirbanibulin in Canada.
 On September 27, 2021, we announced our partner Almirall had launched Klisyri® in Germany and the UK, as part of a phased European launch.
 
Mission and Strategy
Our company’s mission is to become a leader in bringing innovative cancer treatments to the market and to improve patient health outcomes. Historically, we had focused development of our Orascovery platform which is based on a technology that converts IV chemotherapy to oral chemotherapy. We conducted a large phase 3 clinical trial in metastatic breast cancer comparing Oral Paclitaxel to IV paclitaxel, which was the basis of our NDA submission. Unfortunately, in February 2021, we received a CRL from the FDA which asked for an additional clinical study to support approval. After careful evaluation and prioritization of our research and development (“R&D”) pipeline, we have decided to focus our R&D resources on our innovative cell therapy platform, which is based on NKT cells. NKT cells have unique biology that has potential advantages over current T cell and NK cell based technologies. We believe these advantages include the following:
    (1)There is still a major unmet need in hematological and solid tumors in that even in those indications where autologous CAR-T cells have been previously approved, up to 60% of patients receiving CAR-T therapy do not achieve long term durable responses.
 (2)Cellular therapies have generally not been effective in the treatment of solid tumors. We believe NKT cells are an ideal platform for treatment of solid tumors because NKT cells home to tumors, and we have data demonstrating that CAR-NKT cells are superior in tumor homing compared to CAR-T cells. 
 (3)Our allogeneic (“off-the-shelf”) CAR-NKT cell therapy products may be produced at larger scale than autologous products, potentially at lower cost. 
 (4)Our allogeneic CAR-NKT cells are manufactured starting with the lymphocytes of healthy donors. Use of healthy donors, rather than patients (who are the source of autologous cell therapy starting materials), results in a more robust and consistent product, because patient lymphocytes are usually dysfunctional due to previous cancer therapy. 
 NKT cells demonstrate anti-tumor activity, even without a CAR. This is because NKT cells can kill immune suppressive cells in the local tumor microenvironment. Thus, when we add a CAR to NKT cells they are now equipped with two different anti-tumor mechanisms, which may lead to more potent anti-tumor activity and reduce the potential for relapse.
Advancing KUR-501 CAR-NKT Targeting GD2 – KUR-501 is an autologous product in which NKT cells are engineered with a CAR targeting GD2 and is currently being evaluated in a phase 1 clinical trial (GINAKIT2) treating children with R/R high risk neuroblastoma. Neuroblastoma is a rare pediatric cancer and patients with R/R high risk neuroblastoma have very poor outcomes. Therefore, we believe there is a significant unmet need for better treatment options. Interim data presented at the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy (ASGCT) 2021 Annual Meeting for the first eleven evaluable patients, showed long-term persistence of CAR-NKT cells and CAR-NKT cell localization at the tumor site. Responses were observed in two patients, including one CR, one PR, and four patients achieved SD. The safety profile of KUR-501 was manageable and the product is being administered in the outpatient setting. GINATKIT2 will continue enrolling patients at higher dose level cohorts with a goal to identify an optimal dose that we may take into a pivotal study.
 Advancing KUR-502 CAR-NKT Targeting CD19 – Early data, as presented at the ASH annual meeting in December 2021, indicated that, of the first five evaluable patients, there was a promising overall response rate of 80% with a complete response rate of 60%. KUR-502 is an allogeneic, “off-the-shelf” product in which NKT cells are engineered with a CAR targeting CD19. Today, autologous CAR-T cell treatments are available to patients, but the patient-to-patient variability and long manufacturing lead times limit patient care options. As an allogeneic “off-the-shelf” product, KUR-502 leverages economies of scale and has the potential to significantly increase patient access to innovative CAR-NKT treatments. Our aim is to expand the phase 1 (ANCHOR) clinical trial treating adults with R/R CD19 positive malignancies currently being conducted at the Baylor College of Medicine (“BCM”) to a phase 1 multicenter clinical trial (ANCHOR2).
 Focusing on Specific Programs of Oral Paclitaxel – For Oral Paclitaxel, while our MAA submission is currently under review by the U.K. MHRA, we have focused our efforts on our ongoing combination clinical trials with checkpoint inhibitors where we believe there is an opportunity. Oral Paclitaxel is currently being evaluated in combination with pembrolizumab in non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”); and dostarlimab +/- carboplatin in neoadjuvant breast cancer, as part of the I-SPY TRIAL (Investigation of Serial studies to Predict Your Therapeutic Response with Imaging And moLecular analysis 2) (“I-SPY 2 TRIAL”).


Licensing and Partnership Opportunities – We continue to increase the global reach of tirbanibulin 1% ointment by maintaining strong global partnerships with existing partners such as Almirall, Seqirus, and AVIR and by evaluating other strategic territories to launch the product. Our team will continue to work closely with our partners to explore additional treatment regimens and indications for tirbanibulin 1% ointment.

We will pursue strategic licensing and partnership opportunities for our small molecule programs and target opportunities that will create potential value for stockholders and support our business strategy and mission.
 Operating Segments
We have organized our business model into three platforms: (1) our Oncology Innovation Platform, dedicated to the research and development of our proprietary drugs; (2) our Commercial Platform, focused on the sales and marketing of our specialty drugs and the market development of our proprietary drugs; and (3) our Global Supply Chain Platform, dedicated to providing a stable and efficient supply of active pharmaceutical ingredients (“API”) for our clinical and commercial efforts. Athenex has global operations with offices and facilities in Buffalo and Clarence, New York; Cranford, New Jersey; Houston, Texas; Chicago, Illinois; Hong Kong; Taipei, Taiwan; multiple locations in Chongqing, China; Manchester, United Kingdom; Guatemala City, Guatemala and Buenos Aires, Argentina.
 Our Oncology Innovation Platform
Within our Oncology Innovation Platform, we have three different technologies: (1) Cell therapy (2) Orascovery, based on a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) pump inhibitor, and (3) Src Kinase inhibition. The following table summarizes the development status of our current pipeline of product candidates in our Oncology Innovation Platform as of March 1, 2022:



We collaborate with a number of biotechnology pharmaceutical companies, including Hanmi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (“Hanmi”), Eli Lilly and Company (“Lilly”), Almirall, Guangzhou Xiangxue Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (“Xiangxue”), ZenRx Limited (“ZenRx”) and PharmaEssentia, to support the development of our clinical pipeline globally and explore additional indications. For additional information, please see “Business—License and Collaboration Agreements”.
 Our Cell Therapy Platform
 NKT cells are a core aspect of our cell therapy platform. NKT cells are a subset of lymphocytes that share properties of both innate and adaptive immune cells. NKT cells acquire effector memory functions immediately after exiting the thymus and, thus, behave similarly to innate immunity cells like natural killer (“NK”) cells. Within the immune system, NKT cells have an important function, acting among the first cells to respond to either infection or stress in the tissues.
The target recognition for both NKT and T-cells is strictly restricted and antigen specific. Although both NKT and T-cells express TCRs, their models for recognition of antigen (target) are distinct. Both T-cells and NKT cells recognize target antigens in

association with other molecules, a phenomenon called “restriction.” T-cell TCRs are restricted by either human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I or class II whereas NKT cell TCRs are restricted by CD1d, which is related to class I HLA in structure. The CD1d molecule is identical in all people (monomorphic) while HLA class I and II molecules are polymorphic (see following figure). T-cells utilize a wide variety of different TCRs, whereas type 1 NKT cells (which we use) employ an invariant TCR (iTCR). As a result, without major genetic engineering, the majority of T-cell products must be limited to autologous use, given the potential for toxicity if T-cell products are infused into a genetically different recipient (e.g., GvHD). In contrast, because CD1d is the same in all individuals, and NKT cells express an iTCR restricted by CD1d, the potential for GvHD toxicity is minimal. We believe that this provides us a promising basis to use NKT cells for an “off-the-shelf” product, without the need for complex genetic engineering to prevent GvHD.
 

Clinical Development
KUR-501 is an autologous product in which NKT cells are engineered with a CAR targeting GD2. Neuroblastoma is a pediatric cancer, and we believe there is a significant unmet need as the patient prognoses are often poor and treatment options are limited. KUR-501 is currently being evaluated in a phase 1 clinical trial (GINAKIT2) treating children with R/R high risk neuroblastoma. In May 2021, we presented an interim data update from the first eleven evaluable patients at ASGCT. During this initial evaluation, the safety profile of KUR-501 was manageable, and there was no DLT. No patients experienced grade 2 or higher toxicities related to KUR-501. There were no grades 3-5 CRS and no evidence of ICANS in any of the patients. Grades 3-4 AEs, reported regardless of relationship to KUR-501, have included anemia, leukopenia, lymphopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, abdominal distension, acute gastroenteritis, liver enzyme increase, vomiting, bone pain, headache, neck pain, fever, urinary tract infection, altered mental status, and hypoxia. As this clinical development program is still in the early stages, we do not yet have meaningful statistics on safety, including AEs, to report. Observed responses included one CR and one PR. Four additional patients have exhibited SD. We also observed long-term persistence of NKT cells expressing CAR. Importantly, we observed NKT cell localization to the tumor site. GINAKIT2 is supported by Athenex and is being conducted by Athenex’s collaborator, the Baylor College of Medicine ("BCM”). GINAKIT2 is currently recruiting patients.
KUR-502 is an allogeneic (“off-the-shelf”) product in which NKT cells are engineered with a CAR targeting CD19. In addition to the CAR, KUR-502 is genetically engineered to down regulate surface expression of HLA class I and class II proteins, resulting in reduced recognition and elimination by the host immune system following infusion. Therefore, unlike KUR-501, the KUR-502 CAR NKT product is manufactured from NKT cells isolated from healthy donors. Today, there are autologous CAR-T cell treatments available to patients, however, these treatments are limited by manufacturing lead time and variable final product quality due to their patient specific starting material (e.g., leukapheresis). As an “off-the-shelf” product, KUR-502 is designed to minimize manufacturing impact and increase patient accessibility. KUR-502 is currently being evaluated in a phase 1 (ANCHOR) clinical trial treating adults with R/R CD19 positive malignancies, including B cell lymphoma, ALL, and CLL. The single-arm study evaluates three dose levels of KUR-502 with patients receiving pre-dose lymphodepletion chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine. Interim data showed the presence of NKT cells expressing CARs in the disease sites, indicating that the KUR-502 cells are able to traffic to the tumor. The safety profile was manageable with no DLT, only one case of grade 1 CRS, no ICANS, and no GvHD

attributable to NKT cells expressing CAR. Grades 3-4 AEs, reported regardless of relationship to KUR-502, have included lymphopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, liver enzyme elevation, bilirubin elevation, anemia, diarrhea, hypoalbuminemia, and myositis. As this clinical development program is still in the early stages, we do not yet have meaningful statistics on safety, including AEs, to report. Of the first five evaluable patients, the overall response rate was 80%, and the complete response rate was 60%. Given that these patients were heavily pretreated, including with prior autologous CAR-T cell treatment, we believe the early response data suggests that KUR-502 may yield high efficacy at low dose levels. The study is ongoing. ANCHOR is supported by Athenex and is being conducted by Athenex’s collaborator, BCM. ANCHOR is currently recruiting patients.
KUR-503 is an allogeneic (“off-the-shelf”) product in which NKT cells are engineered with a CAR targeting GPC3. GPC3 is a molecule that is highly expressed on most HCC but not normal liver or other non-neoplastic tissue. KUR-503 is currently in preclinical development, and we are planning to submit an IND by the first half of 2023.
 We continue to advance TAEST therapy with our drug candidate, TCRT-ESO-A2. TCRT-ESO-A2 is an autologous TCR-T cell therapy targeting solid tumors that are NY-ESO-1 positive in HLA-A*02:01 positive patients. A phase 1 clinical trial treating adults with advanced solid tumors expressing NY-ESO-1 is currently open enrolling.


Our Orascovery Platform
 Our Orascovery platform technology is based on the novel oral P-gp pump inhibitor molecule, encequidar. The P-gp pump is a plasma membrane efflux protein on the cells which forms a localized drug transport system. In the intestine it limits the oral absorption of a large number of drugs, including widely used P-gp substrate cancer chemotherapeutic drugs such as paclitaxel, irinotecan, docetaxel and eribulin, thus restricting their current dosing to IV administration.
Mechanism of Action - P-gp Inhibition
Encequidar is a P-gp pump inhibitor and an oral absorption enhancer that prevents the P-gp pump-mediated efflux of chemotherapy agents back into the gastrointestinal tract. P-gp plays an important physiologic role as a transporter protein at multiple barrier sites, including the gastrointestinal tract and the blood brain barrier (“BBB”). The demonstrated role of P-gp in limiting intestinal absorption of multiple cancer chemotherapies highlighted the potential utility of a small molecule P-gp inhibitor for enabling oral administration of P-gp substrate drugs otherwise restricted to IV dosing. Encequidar was originally identified by Hanmi as a highly selective and potent P-gp inhibitor, capable of elevating the oral bioavailability of paclitaxel from less than 5% (in the absence of encequidar) to 41% in rats. Encequidar is distinct from previously developed small molecule P-gp inhibitors because it is designed to not be systemically absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract following oral administration with only small amounts detectable in the plasma even after relatively high doses. This unique property makes encequidar a good candidate for co-administration with P-gp substrate drugs, such as paclitaxel, which normally exhibit poor oral bioavailability and are therefore limited to IV routes of dosing.
Clinical Development
In three separate pharmacokinetics (“PK”) studies of encequidar conducted in healthy subjects, a total of 81 individuals received single oral doses of encequidar tablets in single doses of up to 900 mg, and 30 individuals were enrolled in multiple dose cohorts with treatment groups receiving encequidar tablets ranging from 60 to 360 mg per day for five days. Encequidar was well-tolerated, with mostly mild gastrointestinal adverse effects. No serious adverse events (“SAEs”) were reported. At the current clinical dose of 15 mg given once daily for up to five days, the maximal concentration of the drug in plasma ("Cmax") in systemic circulation is low. Drug-drug interaction studies of encequidar with digoxin and dabigatran have been conducted, and the metabolism and routes of excretion in humans has been determined.
 Our Orascovery Product Candidates
Oral Paclitaxel and Encequidar
 Overview
IV paclitaxel is used widely for the treatment of breast, ovarian, and lung cancer. Due to its poor solubility, paclitaxel is usually dissolved in ethanol and polyethoxylated castor oil, which is a major cause of IV hypersensitivity reactions. As a result, premedication with high dose steroids and antihistamines is required to minimize these adverse reactions. Additional common toxicities associated with IV administration of paclitaxel include neuropathy, neutropenia and alopecia. These side effects limit dose intensification and often require reduction in dosing.
Oral Paclitaxel is our lead drug candidate in our Orascovery Platform and is initially being developed for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer. We conducted a pivotal, randomized Phase 3 study of Oral Paclitaxel monotherapy versus IV paclitaxel monotherapy which met its primary endpoint of confirmed response rate in patients receiving Oral Paclitaxel. On February 26, 2021, we received a CRL from the FDA regarding our NDA for Oral Paclitaxel. Following the CRL, we held two Type A meetings with the FDA to discuss the deficiencies raised in the CRL, review a proposed design for a new clinical trial intended to address the deficiencies raised in the CRL, and discuss the potential regulatory path forward for Oral Paclitaxel in mBC in the U.S. In October 2021, after careful consideration of the FDA feedback, we determined to redeploy our resources to focus on other ongoing studies of Oral Paclitaxel and our Cell Therapy platform. We are also evaluating Oral Paclitaxel as a monotherapy treatment for patients with cutaneous angiosarcoma, and in combination with pembrolizumab for advanced solid malignancies including gastric or gastroesophageal or non-small cell lung cancer. A study is also being conducted in combination with GlaxoSmithKline’s (“GSK”) dostarlimab in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy setting for breast cancer.
Clinical Development by Indication
 Metastatic Breast Cancer
Phase 3 Study
 Our Phase 3 pivotal study of Oral Paclitaxel in patients with metastatic breast cancer was a randomized, active-controlled clinical trial comparing Oral Paclitaxel monotherapy against IV paclitaxel monotherapy. The trial randomized subjects in a 2:1 ratio to

Oral Paclitaxel, and was designed to compare the safety and efficacy of Oral Paclitaxel with IV paclitaxel. The primary endpoint was ORR (confirmed by scans at two consecutive timepoints) as assessed by RECIST v1.1 criteria, a generally accepted method for assessing tumor response. Blinded assessments of tumor response were made by independent radiologists.
A total of 402 metastatic breast cancer patients were enrolled (Oral Paclitaxel=265 vs. IV paclitaxel=137), which represented the ITT population.
In the final analysis of the primary endpoint of the study, Oral Paclitaxel (205 mg/m2 per day 3 days/week) showed a statistically significant improvement in ORR. Based on ITT analysis, Oral Paclitaxel showed a statistically significant improvement in ORR over IV paclitaxel, with 35.8% ORR, compared to 23.4% for IV paclitaxel, a difference of 12.4% (p=0.011).
 Secondary endpoints in the study included PFS and OS. In December 2020, we presented updated PFS and OS data at the 2020 SABCS. In the ITT population, the median PFS showed a benefit for Oral Paclitaxel versus IV paclitaxel (8.4 months vs. 7.4 months, respectively; hazard ratio (HR) = 0.768; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.584, 1.01; p = 0.046). The median OS data demonstrated a trend favoring Oral Paclitaxel versus IV paclitaxel (22.7 months vs. 16.5 months, respectively; HR = 0.794; 95% CI: 0.607, 1.037; p = 0.082).
Based on data presented at the 2019 SABCS: 31.1% of IV paclitaxel patients experienced grade 2 or above neuropathy versus 7.6% of Oral Paclitaxel patients. The results also showed lower incidence of alopecia compared to IV paclitaxel, with 28.8% of the Oral Paclitaxel group experiencing alopecia versus 48.2% of the IV paclitaxel group in treatment-emergent adverse events of interest. For other treatment-emergent adverse events of interest, there was a higher incidence of neutropenia with CTCAE grade ≥ 3 (29.9% vs. 28.1%; with Grade 4 14.8% vs 8.9%) and gastro-intestinal side effects, such as diarrhea with CTCAE grade ≥ 3 (5.3% vs. 1.5%) and vomiting or nausea with CTCAE grade ≥ 3 (6.8% vs. 0.7%), in the Oral Paclitaxel group as compared to the IV paclitaxel group.
 Based on data presented at the 2020 SABCS: all grades of neuropathy were observed in 22% of Oral Paclitaxel patients versus 64% of IV paclitaxel patients, and grade 3 neuropathy was observed in 2% of Oral Paclitaxel patients versus 15% of IV paclitaxel patients. Also presented were data on the effect of prophylactic treatments on the incidence and severity of gastrointestinal-related adverse events. After approximately 30% of patients were enrolled, the Phase 3 trial protocol was amended to allow patients randomized to the Oral Paclitaxel arm to receive prophylactic pre-medications for gastrointestinal side effects. Overall gastrointestinal (GI)-related adverse events (AEs) were less frequent in the IV paclitaxel arm. GI-related AEs improved in the Oral Paclitaxel arm following the amendment, as measured by lower incidences of grade 2 vomiting before and after amendment (24% vs. 7%) and grade 2 diarrhea before and after amendment (27% vs. 16%).
 On February 26, 2021, we received a CRL from the FDA regarding our NDA for Oral Paclitaxel for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Following the CRL, we held two Type A meetings with the FDA to discuss the deficiencies raised in the CRL, review a proposed design for a new clinical trial intended to address the deficiencies raised in the CRL, and discuss the potential regulatory path forward for Oral Paclitaxel in mBC in the U.S. In October 2021, after careful consideration of the FDA feedback, we determined to redeploy our resources to focus on other ongoing studies of Oral Paclitaxel and our Cell Therapy platform.
On November 29, 2021, we announced the U.K. MHRA validation of the MAA for Oral Paclitaxel, for review. The Phase 3 study of Oral Paclitaxel in MBC (KX-ORAX-001) served as the basis of the MAA.
 Angiosarcoma
 We have also been developing Oral Paclitaxel for the treatment of cutaneous angiosarcoma. Angiosarcomas are rare, aggressive and heterogeneous tumors accounting for approximately 2% of all soft tissue sarcomas. Only limited treatment options for advanced disease exist with poor outcomes and low 5-year survival rates.
 We commenced a study of Oral Paclitaxel monotherapy in the treatment of angiosarcoma in December 2018. At the ASCO 2020 Virtual Scientific Program, we announced interim data from an ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial in which Oral Paclitaxel monotherapy showed encouraging efficacy and tolerability in elderly patients with unresectable cutaneous angiosarcoma, an aggressive malignancy with poor prognosis. The interim results reflect data from 22 evaluable patients out of 26 enrolled patients. The interim data showed a clinical benefit rate (CR+PR+SD) of 100% in 22 evaluable patients who reached their first post treatment efficacy evaluation. All 22 patients experienced reduction in tumor size. Complete responses (CR) were observed in 27.3% of patients (6/22), partial responses (PR) were observed in 22.7% of patients (5/22), and stable disease was observed in 50% of patients (11/22). Oral Paclitaxel has been generally well tolerated in this predominantly elderly population. The study is ongoing and the enrollment goal has been reached.
 Combination studies
 Oral Paclitaxel in combination with pembrolizumab
 We have an ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical study to assess the safety, tolerability and activity of Oral Paclitaxel in combination with an anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD1) antibody (pembrolizumab) in patients with advanced solid malignancies who have

failed treatment with checkpoint inhibitors. The study is being conducted in patients with gastric or gastroesophageal or non-small cell lung cancer that have previously failed treatment with a checkpoint inhibitor. Part 2 of the study in patients with non-small cell lung cancer has initiated.
 I-SPY 2 TRIAL (Oral Paclitaxel in combination with dostarlimab +/- carboplatin)
 In September 2020, we and Quantum Leap Healthcare Collaborative (Quantum Leap) announced the launch of two new study arms of the I-SPY 2 TRIAL to evaluate Oral Paclitaxel with GSK’s dostarlimab, an investigational antibody binding PD-1, in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy setting. Quantum Leap is the trial sponsor and manages all study operations, and Athenex provides Oral Paclitaxel. The goal of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral paclitaxel plus encequidar with dostarlimab +/- carboplatin in Stage 2/3 HER2- breast cancer patients and plus trastuzumab in HER2+ patients, followed, by doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide chemotherapy and surgical resection. The primary objective is to determine whether this regimen increases the probability of pathologic complete response (pCR) over standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone for any of the tumor subtypes established at trial entry, and to determine the predictive probability of success in a subsequent Phase 3 trial. The study is ongoing.
 Other Indications
 We are conducting an MTD (maximum tolerated dose) study of Oral Paclitaxel in combination with ramucirumab in patients with advanced gastric cancer in the U.S. and Asia through a clinical trial collaboration with Lilly. We commenced a study of up to 32 patients in a dose escalation part of the trial with a dose expansion of Oral Paclitaxel in combination with a fixed dose of ramucirumab in July 2017.
The objective of our Phase 1 study was to define the MTD of daily Oral Paclitaxel dosing, starting at 200 mg/m2 for three days in a week, in combination with ramucirumab, which will be dosed every other week. In the first part of the study, 17 subjects were enrolled at doses ranging from 200-300 mg/m2. We defined the MTD dose of Oral Paclitaxel as 200 mg/m2 daily for three consecutive days weekly in combination with ramucirumab. Dose limiting toxicities (“DLTs”) included febrile neutropenia, grade 4 neutropenia and grade 3 gastric hemorrhage. The most frequently reported adverse events were vomiting (70%), neutropenia (59%), decreased appetite (53%), nausea (24%) and mucositis (24%). Enrollment is completed and long term survival follow up has been stopped.
 Overview of Safety Observations in Oral Paclitaxel Studies
Studies to date have indicated that Oral Paclitaxel does not result in hypersensitivity reactions when given without premedication for hypersensitivity type reactions, in contrast to the premedication requirement for IV paclitaxel, namely steroids and antihistamines. No new toxicity, apart from those typically observed with paclitaxel, was observed. Infusion related reactions, including hypersensitivity type reactions, have not been observed in patients administered Oral Paclitaxel. Additionally, severe toxicities associated with IV administration of paclitaxel, including neuropathy and alopecia, are at a lower incidence and severity for Oral Paclitaxel.
As of December 31, 2021, approximately 16% of patients treated in clinical studies with Oral Paclitaxel experienced SAEs that were considered to be related to the study treatment. The most common were neutropenia in approximately 3% of patients and febrile neutropenia in approximately 4.7% of patients; pneumonia in approximately 2.7% of patients; septic shock in approximately 1.7% of patients; sepsis in 1.5% of patients; dehydration in approximately 1.2% of patients; gastroenteritis, anemia, diarrhea, mucositis, gastrointestinal bleeding, vomiting, nausea and hypokalaemia, pneumonitis, colitis, tachycardia and atrial fibrillation, each in less than one percent of patients. Other serious treatment-related infections were reported in approximately 1.7% of patients. Approximately 3.3% of patients had other treatment-related SAEs (one patient each including rectal bleeding, altered state of consciousness, cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, hypotension, pancytopenia, multiorgan failure, renal failure, pleural effusion, supraventricular tachycardia, respiratory failure, malnutrition, dyspnoea, cardiac failure, upper abdominal pain, fatigue, decreased appetite, pulmonary tuberculosis and peripheral sensory neuropathy).
Oral Irinotecan and Encequidar
 Current and Planned Clinical Development
A Phase 1 MTD study has been clinically completed. This study is to determine the MTD of Oral Irinotecan, when given once every three weeks, in subjects with advanced malignancies. We have identified a dosing regimen suitable for Phase 2. However, further development of Oral Irinotecan has been suspended at this time.
 Overview of Safety Observations in Oral Irinotecan Studies
In our Oral Irinotecan clinical studies to date, the SAEs observed that were deemed to be at least possibly related to Oral Irinotecan include diarrhea, rash, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, enteritis, asthenia, neutropenia, increased alanine aminotransferase, increased aspartate aminotransferase, and C diff infection. As the clinical development program is still in its early stages, we do not yet have meaningful statistics on safety, including adverse events, to report.
Oral Docetaxel and Encequidar
 Current and Planned Clinical Studies
A Phase 1 dose escalation U.S. based trial for Oral Docetaxel in patients with various solid tumors given once every three weeks is ongoing. Another Phase 1 study to identify the absolute bioavailability of Oral Docetaxel in prostate cancer patients has been completed. Based on Phase 1 results so far, we believe that we can achieve similar exposure to IV docetaxel with one to three days of dosing every three weeks. Alternative schedules such as weekly or 2 of 3 weeks are also being explored. Further development of Oral Docetaxel has been suspended at this time.
 Overview of Safety Observations in Oral Docetaxel Studies
We expect that the overall safety profile of Oral Docetaxel will be similar to that of IV docetaxel, with differences related to the route of administration. As with Oral Paclitaxel, premedication has not been required and hypersensitivity type reactions have not been observed. As of December 31, 2021, in our Oral Docetaxel clinical studies, the SAEs observed that were deemed to at least possibly related to Oral Docetaxel include gastrointestinal toxicity; vomiting, nausea and diarrhea in 1 subject.
Oral Topotecan and Encequidar
A Phase 1 clinical trial in advanced malignancies for Oral Topotecan has completed enrollment. Further development of Oral Topotecan has been suspended at this time. As the clinical development program has enrolled few patients, we do not have meaningful statistics on safety, including adverse events, to report.
Oral Eribulin and Encequidar
 In October 2018, the FDA allowed our IND application for Oral Eribulin. A Phase 1 study commenced in 2019 to assess the safety, MTD, DLT and absolute bioavailability of Oral Eribulin in subjects with solid tumors. Enrollment into the trial has been suspended, and no further trials are planned at this time. As few patients were enrolled into the trial, we do not have meaningful statistics on safety, including adverse events, to report.
Our Src Kinase Inhibition Platform
 Our Src Kinase inhibition platform technology is based on novel small molecule compounds that have multiple mechanisms of action, including the inhibition of the activity of Src Kinase and the inhibition of tubulin polymerization, which may limit the growth or proliferation of cancerous cells. We believe the combination of these mechanisms of action provides a broader range of anti-cancer activity compared to either mechanism of action alone. Our lead product candidate on our Src Kinase inhibition platform is tirbanibulin ointment. Our other clinical candidates in this platform include tirbanibulin oral and KX2-361.
 Tirbanibulin
Mechanism of Action
Tirbanibulin, formerly known as KX2-391 or KX-01, is a novel small molecule that we discovered and developed, which demonstrates at least two mechanisms of action (“MOAs”) relevant to the potential control of cancer and hyper-proliferative disorders: (1) Src tyrosine kinase inhibition (non-ATP competitive) and (2) tubulin polymerization inhibition. Src Kinase, a tyrosine kinase protein involved in regulating cell growth, is strongly implicated in metastasis. Inhibiting Src Kinase may limit the growth or proliferation of cancerous cell types. Src plays a role in regulating multiple aspects of tumor development, growth and metastases, and its inhibition limits such tumor activity. Interfering with tubulin polymerization activity is a clinically validated mechanism for treating cancer. For both targets tirbanibulin binds at a novel binding site. Taken together, these two MOAs may provide for a potent means of treating cancer and other hyper-proliferative disorders.
 Tirbanibulin Ointment
Tirbanibulin is a compound developed under our Src Kinase inhibition platform that, as a free base, has advantageous physical properties for topical ointment formulations.
Actinic Keratosis
 In December 2020, the FDA approved Klisyri® (tirbanibulin), a microtubule inhibitor, for the topical treatment of AK on the face or scalp. The FDA approved Klisyri based on data from two pivotal, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled Phase 3 trials (KX01-AK-003 and KX01-AK-004) that evaluated the efficacy and safety of tirbanibulin ointment 1% (10mg/g) in adults with AK of the face or scalp. In July 2021, our partner Almirall received approval from the European Commission to market Klisyri® in the same indication. Klisyri® has launched in the US and in certain European countries. Our partner, PharmaEssentia, has initiated trials of tirbanibulin ointment for the treatment of AK, in Japan.
Psoriasis
 Tirbanibulin ointment has shown encouraging preclinical results in treating psoriasis, a chronic autoimmune skin disease that speeds up the growth cycle of skin cells. Psoriasis causes localized or generalized patches of red papules and plaques, covered with white or silver scales and itching. A Phase 1 clinical trial of tirbanibulin ointment 1% in psoriasis, performed by our partner PharmaEssentia, has been completed.
Tirbanibulin Oral
 Development of our oral formulation of tirbanibulin has been suspended at this time.
 KX2-361
KX2-361, formerly known as KX-02, is the second compound we developed using our Src Kinase inhibition platform technology. KX2-361 is a closely related structural analog of tirbanibulin and has been observed to have a similar dual MOA of inhibition of Src activity and microtubule polymerization. Although KX2-361 is an analog of tirbanibulin, it has significantly different physical properties. These properties are designed to allow KX2-361 freely cross the BBB such that the concentration in the brain is equal to, or somewhat greater than, that in the plasma. This trait is uncommon for oncology drugs and highlights the potential for KX2-361 as a novel therapy for unmet medical needs such as brain cancers, including glioblastoma and brain metastases. KX2-361’s multiple MOAs along with its ability to cross the BBB, make it a novel molecule for the treatment of brain tumors. The FDA has granted Orphan Drug Designation to KX2-361 for the treatment of gliomas.
KX2-361 is currently in the early stages of development. In our KX2-361 clinical studies to date, the SAEs observed were thromboembolic events, hyperuricemia and pulmonary embolism. As the clinical development program is still in its early stages, we do not yet have meaningful statistics on safety, including adverse events, to report.
 Further development of KX2-361 has been suspended at this time.
 Our Other Technologies
 Arginine Deprivation Therapy
PT01, the arginine deprivation therapy product, is based on our pegylated genetically engineered human arginase. It targets cancer growth and survival by interrupting the supply of arginine to cancers with disrupted urea cycles such as melanoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and prostate cancer. Our proprietary arginase biologic product is well suited to deplete arginine from the tumors, while healthy cells, capable of producing their own arginine, are largely unaffected. We had enrolled subjects with advanced solid tumors in a study in the US that was intended to determine the dose limiting toxicities, safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of PT01 with administered as a weekly IV infusion. Enrollment into this trial has been suspended, and no further studies are planned at this time.
Proprietary Dual (CYP/P-gp) Inhibitor
 We are developing a proprietary class of “dual” absorption enhancers that are intended to inhibit both the P-gp transporter and the cytochrome p450 3A ("CYP") enzymes within the gastrointestinal tract. These dual absorption enhancers may lead to better performing next-generation oral medicines in our pipeline of clinical products.
The development of these dual absorption enhancers is at the preclinical stage. Proof of concept, providing increased oral bioavailability in preclinical species, has been obtained with several absorption enhancers and candidate drugs. Currently additional filters such as patentability/freedom to operate, physical-chemical characterization, pre-formulation studies, manufacturing analysis and preliminary toxicity testing are being applied to our first group of lead candidates to facilitate election of an IND candidate.
Research and Development
We have drug discovery, drug formulation, clinical and regulatory development and API/drug product manufacturing facilities and capabilities around the world. The U.S. drug discovery, clinical and regulatory development and formulation research facilities are largely concentrated in Buffalo, New York and Cranford, New Jersey. The range of capabilities at these facilities includes medicinal chemistry, biochemistry, cell biology, formulation, chemical manufacturing and control, quality control, pharmacokinetics/ pharmacodynamics (“PK/PD”) and data management, as well as pharmacovigilance, clinical development and regulatory expertise functions. Animal efficacy, PK/PD and toxicology studies are carried out at various contract research organizations, or CROs, around the world in order to facilitate the drug research and development process. We also have research, clinical development and regulatory capabilities in China, the U.K. and Latin America, as well as in Taiwan, where we also have built up data management facility. Our research and development center in Hong Kong concentrates on drug formulation development and evaluation. Our global research and development capabilities and facilities are well integrated with our research and development center in the U.S.

To date, we and our partners have conducted, or are conducting, clinical trials across sites in the U.S., South Korea, New Zealand, Taiwan, China, U.K., Australia, and various countries in Latin America, including Argentina, Guatemala, Honduras, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, the Dominican Republic, and Peru.
Commercialization
 Following the CRL of Oral Paclitaxel in mBC and the decision to redeploy resources to our Cell Therapy technologies and other ongoing studies of Oral Paclitaxel, we have suspended commercial activities for Oral Paclitaxel in the U.S., at this time. Outside of the U.S., we continue to evaluate marketing options, including using our internal resources, partnering with others, or out-licensing the product.
In February 2021 and September 2021, Klisyri® was launched in the U.S. and in Europe, respectively, for the treatment of AK by our partner Almirall. As of December 31, 2021, Klisyri® is available to patients in the U.S., Germany, United Kingdom, and Austria. In 2022, Almirall plans to continue to rollout the launch of Klisyri® throughout Europe. To increase the global reach of tirbanibulin 1% ointment, we have partnered with other third parties and anticipate commercialization efforts outside of the U.S. and E.U. to commence in 2023. For additional information, please see “Business—License and Collaboration Agreements—Tirbanibulin—Almirall License Agreement.” We may also partner with third parties or consider using our internal resources to reach other geographic markets.

Agreements with Suppliers and Marketing Partners
 Gland Term Sheets
 From August 2016 to May 2017, we entered into four binding term sheets with Gland Pharma Ltd (“Gland”) to market twenty-seven of Gland’s products. Gland has obtained FDA approval for twenty-two of such products and has filed an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, in the U.S. for the remaining five products. For each of the licensed products, we will pay a license fee to Gland. Additionally, during the terms of the term sheets we have a profit-sharing arrangement pursuant to which we will pay to Gland between 0% and 60% of the net profits from sales of each of the licensed products, depending on the product. The initial term of each of the Gland term sheets is five years from the launch of each product licensed pursuant to the term sheet, subject to automatic renewal for additional two-year terms, unless terminated by either party upon provision to the other party at least 90 days’ notice in advance of a renewal date. To date, none of the term sheets have been terminated.
 MAIA Agreement
 In December 2018, we entered into a distribution and supply agreement with MAIA Pharmaceuticals (“MAIA”) effective as of October 3, 2018 whereby we acquired the exclusive license to a generic version of an approved product, which we began selling in January 2019. In connection with the execution of this agreement, we agreed to pay an upfront milestone payment in addition to profit sharing of 50% of the net profits from the sales of the licensed product. We also agreed to pay an additional milestone payment to MAIA in the event the FDA approves the ANDA for the licensed product. The initial term of the agreement is for seven years from the launch of the product and is subject to an automatic two-year renewal term unless terminated by either party upon at least 180 days’ notice in advance of the renewal date.
 In December 2019, the agreement with MAIA was amended to grant us the license to a branded product which MAIA holds the approved NDA. In connection with this amendment, we agreed to an upfront milestone payment and 56% of the net profits from sales

of the licensed product. Additionally, we agreed to increase MAIA’s share of the net profits to 70% for both products until certain financial metrics are achieved and shall revert to the initial rates after those metrics are satisfied.
 Ingenus Agreements
 In September 2020, we entered into an asset purchase and sale agreement with Ingenus Pharmaceuticals, LLC (“Ingenus”) whereby we purchased from Ingenus all of their right, title and interest in and to Glycopyrrolate Injection (“Glycopyrrolate”) in the U.S. for $2 million and pursuant to which Ingenus transferred to us the ANDA for Glycopyrrolate.
  In November 2020, we entered into a co-marketing, manufacturing and supply agreement with Ingenus pursuant to which Ingenus will be our exclusive supplier of the Cyclophosphamide Injection and granted us a license to market and sell the product to acute care group purchasing organizations (GPOs) and their entire memberships as provided by said GPOs, integrated delivery networks (IDNs) and to hospitals within the U.S. for a purchase price of $1 million. Under the agreement, we are entitled to 25% of the net profits from our sales of the product and we are entitled to a marketing allowance. The agreement has a 3-year term, which may be extended if we mutually agree.
 In January 2021, we entered into a manufacture and supply agreement with Ingenus for Arsenic Trioxide Injection pursuant to which Ingenus will be our exclusive supplier of the product and granted us a license to market and sell the product to acute care GPOs and their entire memberships as provided by said GPOs, IDNs and to hospitals within the U.S. Under the agreement, we are entitled to 45% of the net profits from our sales of the product and we are entitled to a marketing allowance. The agreement has a 5-year term, which may be extended if we mutually agree.
 Customers and Product Distribution
 We distribute APD products primarily through pharmaceutical wholesalers and, to a lesser extent, specialty distributors that focus on particular therapeutic product categories, for use by a wide variety of end-users, including hospitals, integrated delivery networks and alternative site facilities. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the products we sold through our three largest wholesalers in the U.S., accounted for 49% of our total revenue.
 We utilize an outside third-party logistics contractor to distribute our U.S. products. Since the inception of the launch of our specialty products, the third-party logistics provider has been handling all aspects of our product logistics efforts and related services for us, including warehousing and shipment services, order-to-cash services, contract administration services and chargeback processing. Our products are warehoused and distributed through a third-party logistics provider located in Memphis, Tennessee. Under our agreement with the third-party logistics provider, we maintain ownership of our finished products until sale to our customers. The initial term of the agreement is three years following the initial delivery date and will automatically renew for successive 12-month periods, unless either we or the other party give notice of intent to terminate at least 90 days in advance of such automatic renewal. We may also have the opportunity to terminate the agreement within 30 days of receiving notice of certain price increases by the third-party logistics provider. The agreement also contains customary termination rights for either party, such as in the event of a breach of the agreement.
We have also created a product portal, which allows APD and APS customers in each class to order from us online, and us to distribute directly from our manufacturing facilities. This portal was created primarily due to prohibitions on wholesaling, under Section 503B.
 Global Supply Chain Platform
In 2015, we acquired Polymed Therapeutics Inc. (“Polymed”) and Chongqing Taihao Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., or Taihao. Taihao operates a cGMP high potency oncology API plant based in Chongqing, China (“Taihao API facility”) and Polymed is the U.S. marketing entity for Taihao’s API in North America and Europe.
We suspended production activities at our Taihao API facility in Chongqing, China, in May 2019, based on concerns raised by the Department of Emergency Management of Chongqing (“DEMC”) related to the location of our plant. We subsequently resumed producing API at the Taihao API facility primarily for our ongoing clinical studies and commercial launches of proprietary drugs in accordance with local regulatory guidance, while we started building out Sintaho, a new API facility in Chongqing. In July 2021, we received verbal notice from the DEMC that we will be required to terminate the production activities at its Taihao API facility. We are continuing to engage in dialogue with the DEMC. While we are able to continue producing certain API at the Taihao API facility in limited quantities and a certain extent of our operations are now being conducted at Sintaho, we are in the process of moving the remainder of the operations and production activities to Sintaho and exploring other sources of API, in the event we are unable to reach an agreement with the DEMC for the continued production activities of the Taihao API facility.
 A new API manufacturing facility in Chongqing, China (“New API Facility” or the “Sintaho facility”) was constructed and commenced operations. The facility continues to conduct and complete product qualification activities.
In 2014, we acquired APS (formerly known as QuaDPharma, LLC), one of our suppliers based in Clarence, New York.

Strategic Public-Private Partnerships
 
To date, we have utilized a combination of acquisitions and public-private partnerships to internalize certain key components of our manufacturing and supply chain.
China Partnership
In October 2015, we entered into an agreement with Chongqing Maliu Riverside Development and Investment Co., LTD (“CQ”), which is wholly owned by the Finance Bureau of Banan district of Chongqing, and is authorized to be responsible for investments, financing, infrastructure construction, operations and management in the Chongqing Maliu Riverside Development Zone. Our agreement with CQ provides for the construction of an API plant and a formulation plant in China. After entering into the agreement, and pursuant to its terms, we established a China-based subsidiary that is responsible for the operations of both facilities in July 2016 and committed to a registration capital requirement of no less than $30.0 million. CQ is responsible for the construction of both facilities according to the U.S. cGMP standards. The land and buildings will be owned by CQ, and we will lease the facilities rent-free, for the first 10-year term, with an option to extend the lease for an additional 10-year term, during which, if we are profitable, we will pay a monthly rent of 5 Chinese Renminbi (“RMB”) per square meter of space occupied. We are responsible for the costs of all equipment and technology for the facilities. In January 2021, we accepted the building and the lease became effective. We have finished equipment installation and testing, and commenced production. We have also committed to achieving certain operational, revenue and tax generation milestones within certain time periods once we commence operations. If we are unable to achieve these milestones, CQ will have the opportunity to terminate the agreement and dispose of the plants in its discretion.
 The New API Facility commenced operations in January 2021 and is part of our strategy for vertical integration in order to capture value across the supply chain.
Our goal is to use our public-private partnerships as a capital efficient method for large scale cGMP manufacturing within our supply chain and to facilitate market access in China. We believe those facilities will be adequate and suitable for our operations for the foreseeable future.
New York State Partnership
On February 14, 2022, we completed the sale of our leasehold interest, and certain other related assets, in the new manufacturing facility in Dunkirk, New York (the “Dunkirk Facility”) to ImmunityBio, Inc. (“ImmunityBio”) for approximately $40.0 million. The Dunkirk Facility had been constructed in connection with our agreement with Fort Schuyler Management Corporation (“FSMC”) a not-for-profit corporation affiliated with the State of New York, for a medical technology research, development, innovation and commercialization alliance (the “Alliance Agreement”). Under the Alliance Agreement, FSMC had been responsible for the costs of construction and equipment for the facility up to an aggregate of $200.0 million, plus any additional funds available from the previous $25.0 million grant, and FSMC would retain ownership of the facility and equipment. In a series of agreements with ImmunityBio, we sold our leasehold interest, our interest in certain leased manufacturing equipment and personal property and owned personal property and inventory at the Dunkirk Facility, and our rights in and obligations under our agreements relating to the Dunkirk Facility with the Empire State Development Corporation (“ESD”), FSMC and County of Chautauqua Industrial Development Agency (“CCIDA”) and other parties.
Under the original Alliance Agreement, we had been committed to spending $1.52 billion on operational expenses in the first 10-year term of the Dunkirk Facility and any subsequent extension periods and to hiring 450 employees at our Dunkirk Facility within the first five years of operations, including hiring at least 300 new employees within 2.5 years of the Dunkirk Facility becoming operational. ImmunityBio assumed these capital expenditure and hiring obligations of ours in connection with the purchase of the leasehold interest in the Dunkirk Facility.
We also entered into a preliminary agreement with ImmunityBio, pursuant to which our APS division will have the ability to manufacture our 503B products at the Dunkirk Facility at prices to be determined on a product-by-product basis, provided that the pricing will not exceed ImmunityBio’s costs plus a 15% margin. We expect to enter into a definitive preferred contract manufacturing agreement with ImmunityBio relating to the manufacture of our 503B products.
We did not assign any of our rights to our corporate headquarters in Buffalo, New York, in connection with the sale of the leasehold interest in the Dunkirk Facility and we retained all of our rights and obligations with respect to our corporate headquarters. Under the Alliance Agreement, FSMC agreed to pay up to $25.0 million for the construction of our North American headquarters and formulation lab and equipment in Buffalo, New York. We are sub-leasing the space from FSMC for a 10-year term expiring in October 2025, with an option to extend the term for an additional 10 years. Under the Alliance Agreement, we are obligated to spend $100.0 million in the Buffalo area over the initial 10-year term of the lease and an additional $100.0 million during the second 10-year term if we elect to extend the lease. We also committed to hiring 250 permanent employees in the Buffalo area within the first 5 years of completion of the project. As of December 31, 2021, we had hired 211 permanent employees in the Buffalo area. In the event we

are unable to hire enough employees in the Buffalo area or meet our other obligations under this agreement, FSMC may terminate the agreement and we may have to renegotiate our lease or relocate our North American headquarters.
 License and Collaboration Agreements
Cell Therapy
 Baylor College of Medicine Agreements
 In October 2021, we simultaneously entered into the Second Amended and Restated Exclusive License and Option Agreement (the “Baylor License Agreement”) and the Second Amended and Restated Co-Development Agreement (the “Baylor Co-Development Agreement,” and together with the Baylor License Agreement, the “Baylor Agreements”) with BCM, which were first entered into in 2016 between BCM and Kuur. Under the Baylor Co-Development Agreement, BCM is responsible for developing the cell therapy products using an annual budget paid by us and under the supervision of a joint steering committee composed of five BCM appointees and five of our appointees. The Baylor License Agreement grants us, among other rights, worldwide rights to research, sell, and commercialize NKT, NKT-CAR, and NKT process technology in the prevention, treatment, or modulation of cancer in humans as well as exclusive future oncology and non-oncology and field expansion options. The Baylor Agreements include execution fees, annual fees, royalties, and milestones. Under the Baylor License Agreement, we have agreed to pay BCM up to $128.5 million in the event defined development and sales milestones are achieved, along with tiered royalties at single digit rates based on annual net sales of licensed products and tiered percentages of sublicensing revenue ranging from mid-single digits to royalty rates in the mid-teens. The Baylor Agreements will remain in effect on a country-by-country basis until the expiration of (i) the date of expiration of the last such patent rights issued in such country; or (ii) in the event that no patents issue in such country, the day immediately following the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale in such country. The agreements contain customary termination rights such as for material default or failure, insolvency, or convenience on a product-by-product basis.
TCR-T License Agreement
 In June 2018, we entered into a Share Subscription Agreement with Xiangxue Life Sciences Ltd. (“XLifeSc”), a subsidiary of Xiangxue, to establish, operate and manage a joint venture named Axis Therapeutics Limited (“Axis”) to offer certain goods and services worldwide except in China. Axis is owned 45% by XLifeSc and 55% by us.
Also in June 2018, Axis entered into a license agreement with XLifeSc (the “TCR-T License”) where XLifeSc granted Axis an exclusive, sublicensable right and license to use XlifeSc’s proprietary TCR-T to develop and commercialize therapeutic products for oncology indications worldwide except in China. Axis is responsible for all development, manufacturing and commercialization, and the related costs and expenses, of any product candidates resulting from the agreement. Pursuant to the TCR-T License, following an upfront payment and the achievement of the first regulatory milestone, Axis may be required to make additional cash payments to XLifeSc worth up to $108.0 million in the aggregate upon the occurrence of certain additional regulatory milestones to be achieved in the U.S., the EU, China, and Japan. In addition, XLifeSc is required to pay Axis royalty payments based on certain percentage of aggregate net income generated by sales of any products using the licensed intellectual property in China. The TCR-T License will remain in effect until the expiration of the patent rights licensed under the agreement. The agreement will terminate automatically if the shareholders agreement between XLifeSc and us is terminated. The TCR-T License also contains customary termination rights for either party, such as in the event of a breach of the agreement or the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings by the other party.
Orascovery
 Eli Lilly and Company Agreement
In October 2016, we entered into a Clinical Trial Collaboration and Supply Agreement with Eli Lilly and Company ("Lilly") to jointly conduct a Phase 1b trial of Oral Paclitaxel in combination with Ramucirumab in patients with gastric, gastro-esophageal, and esophageal cancers. Under the terms of the agreement, we are the sponsor of the study and hold the study IND/clinical trial application ("CTA") while all clinical data generated under the study will is jointly owned by us and Lilly. The agreement will remain in effect until the study contemplated by the agreement has been completed. The agreement also contains customary termination rights for either party, such as in the event of a breach of the agreement by the other party, or in the event a regulatory authority takes any action against or raises any objection to the study.
 Quantum Leap Healthcare Collaborative
In September 2020, we announced with Quantum Leap, the launch of two new study arms of the I-SPY 2 TRIAL, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Oral Paclitaxel with dostarlimab +/- carboplatin in stage 2/3 HER2- breast cancer patients and plus trastuzumab in HER2+ patients, followed, if needed, by doxorubicin plus cyclophasamide chemotherapy (AC) and surgical resection of breast tissue.

The trial was designed to rapidly screen promising experimental treatments and identify those most effective in specific patient subgroups based on molecular characteristics (biomarker signatures). The trial is a unique collaborative effort by a consortium that includes the FDA, industry, patient advocates, philanthropic sponsors, and clinicians from 16 major U.S. cancer research centers. Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, Quantum Leap is the trial sponsor and manages all study operations, and Athenex provides Oral Paclitaxel.
 Hanmi License Agreements and Related Out-Licenses
 We entered into a series of license agreements, as amended from time to time, with Hanmi Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (“Hanmi”) pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive, sublicensable license for development and commercialization activities utilizing Hanmi’s patents and know-how related to the Orascovery platform worldwide except in South Korea, and a non-exclusive license to utilize the same intellectual property in manufacturing worldwide for sales inside those territories (the “Hanmi Agreements”). Under the Hanmi Agreements, we are responsible for all clinical studies and development and commercialization activities, and the related expenses, resulting from the agreements.
Under the Hanmi Agreements, we are obligated to pay Hanmi tiered royalty payments in the teens based on aggregate net sales of any products using the licensed intellectual property in the territory. These royalties will be reduced if competing generic products gain market share in the applicable country. We also granted to Hanmi a one-time right of first negotiation to purchase all of our rights in Oral Paclitaxel or Oral Irinotecan under the Hanmi Agreements during development and prior that, at Hanmi’s discretion, requires us to negotiate in good faith the sale of our rights under such agreement to Hanmi at a purchase price determined by an internationally-recognized investment banking firm with an office in Hong Kong at any time prior to the earlier of (1) our first commercial sale of products using such technology or (2) receipt by Hanmi of written notice from our company of the sublicense of the rights in an applicable product to a third party.
 The Hanmi Agreements expire on the earlier of (1) expiration of the last of Hanmi’s patent rights licensed under the agreement or (2) invalidation of Hanmi’s patent rights which are the subject of the agreement, provided that the term will automatically be extended for consecutive one-year periods unless either party gives notice to the other at least 90 days prior to expiration of the patent rights licensed under the agreement or before the then-current annual expiration date of the agreement. The patent rights licensed to us under the Hanmi Agreements have expiry dates ranging from in 2023 to 2033, unless the terms of such licensed patents are extended in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
 We have out-licensed certain of the rights we obtained under the Hanmi Agreements to third parties to develop and commercialize products from the Orascovery platform in certain territories. Under these out-licenses, we are entitled to receive payments and royalties from the licensees, (a portion of which we will be obligated to pay Hanmi under the Hanmi Agreements). These out-license agreements are described below:
 •ZenRx: We granted ZenRx an exclusive, sublicensable license to develop and commercialize Oral Irinotecan and Oral Paclitaxel in Australia and New Zealand in April 2013, and a non-exclusive license to manufacture a certain compound for use only in Oral Irinotecan and Oral Paclitaxel. We may be entitled to receive up to an aggregate of $1.25 million in additional development, regulatory and sales milestone payments under the license agreement with ZenRx. We will also be eligible to receive tiered royalties in the teens on net sales of each product commercialized by ZenRx utilizing the intellectual property that is the subject of the ZenRx License. Such royalties will be reduced by 40% when competing generic products have 30% of the market share in the applicable country and will be eliminated entirely when competing generic products have 60% of the market share in the applicable country. As an incentive to ZenRx to further development and commercialization of Oral Irinotecan and Oral Paclitaxel in the territory, if ZenRx obtains certain regulatory approvals in the territory prior to regulatory approval of those products in either the U.S. or South Korea, we may be required to make payments to ZenRx, at ZenRx’s option, either up to $0.6 million in cash or $0.35 million in cash plus $0.25 million worth of our common stock.
 •PharmaEssentia: We granted PharmaEssentia an exclusive, sublicensable license for development and commercialization of Oral Paclitaxel, Oral Irinotecan, and Oral Docetaxel in Taiwan and Singapore pursuant to a license agreement in December 2013, as amended from time to time. We may be entitled to receive up to an aggregate of $7.5 million in additional development, regulatory and sales milestone payments under this license agreement with PharmaEssentia. We may be obligated to pay PharmaEssentia an aggregate of $0.5 million in incentives if PharmaEssentia achieves certain milestones within designated timeframes. We will also be eligible to receive tiered royalties in the mid-teens on net sales of each product commercialized by PharmaEssentia utilizing the intellectual property that is the subject of this agreement. Such royalties will be reduced by 40% when competing generic products have 30% of the market share in the applicable country and will be eliminated entirely when competing generic products have 60% of the market share in the applicable country. 
 •Xiangxue: We granted Xiangxue an exclusive license to develop and commercialize Oral Paclitaxel, Oral Irinotecan and tirbanibulin ointment in China, Hong Kong, and Macau for any oncological indications as well as other indications that 


we mutually agree to pursue (the “Xiangxue License”). We may be eligible to receive future additional payments up to $138.5 million in the event defined regulatory and sales milestones are achieved, a payment of $20.0 million in the event of a change of control or assignment of rights involving Xiangxue, tiered royalties at rates ranging from the low teens to low twenties based on annual net sales of the licensed products in the territory covered by the license, and a percentage of sublicensing revenue. In November 2021, we regained the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize Oral Paclitaxel, Oral Irinotecan, and tirbanibulin ointment for Hong Kong and Macau for $1.5 million. Before the November 2021 amendment to the license agreement, we recognized revenue in the third quarter of 2020 for a $10.0 million milestone fee from Xiangxue upon meeting the first regulatory milestone under the license agreement, but Xiangxue was unable to make the full payment. We received $1.5 million from Xiangxue in February 2021. Consequently, the Company recorded a provision for the outstanding balance of $8.5 million and $0.4 million related to currency conversion in our financial statements for the three months and year ended December 31, 2020, respectively. We have not yet taken legal action against Xiangxue to enforce the provisions of the license, but we may exercise all rights and remedies available to us under the terms of the license and applicable law at any time.
 Tirbanibulin
 Almirall License Agreement
In December 2017, we entered into a license agreement with Almirall pursuant to which we granted to Almirall an exclusive, sublicensable license of certain of our intellectual property for the development and commercialization of pharmaceutical preparations containing tirbanibulin to treat and prevent skin disorders and diseases in humans in the U.S. and substantially all European countries (including Russia and Turkey). The first label indication is actinic keratosis. In the licensed territory, Almirall also holds a right of first negotiation to license any compound that we may develop in the future with the same mechanism of action as tirbanibulin and for topical administration for the treatment of skin disorders and diseases if we decide to collaborate with a third party regarding that newly developed compound.
Following the receipt of $50.0 million from Almirall in upfront and milestone payments, we may also be entitled to receive an aggregate of $70.0 million in additional milestone payments, as well as sales milestone payments that we estimate will likely total $155.0 million. Almirall will reward Athenex with additional sales milestones should the sales exceed the currently projected amounts. In addition, we are eligible to receive tiered royalty payments for a certain period starting at 15% based on annual net sales of the topical products commercialized by Almirall, utilizing the intellectual property subject to the license agreement, with incremental increases in royalty rates commensurate with increased sales. We may be required to reimburse Almirall in the event Almirall provides notice that certain clinical endpoints under the agreement are not met. Almirall may terminate the agreement in its entirety or with regard to a certain territory in its sole discretion by providing six months’ notice to us. The agreement also contains customary termination rights for both parties, such as in the event of a breach of the agreement or if the other party defaults in performance of its obligations under the agreement.
Other Territories
 In 2021, we entered into licensing agreements with strategic partners such as Seqirus and AVIR, to further the global development and commercialization of products containing tirbanibulin for topical administration. We granted Seqirus an exclusive license to commercialize tirbanibulin in Australia and New Zealand. We granted AVIR an exclusive license to commercialize tirbanibulin in Canada.
We granted PharmaEssentia an exclusive, sublicensable license to use any pharmaceutical preparation containing tirbanibulin for use in treating (i) AK in a territory that includes Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea, (ii) psoriasis and other nonmalignant skin conditions in a territory that includes Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, China, Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore, and Malaysia, and (iii) all other dermatology indications, including skin cancer, in a territory that includes Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and Malaysia. We may be entitled to an aggregate of up to $14.6 million in associated with the achievement of certain development and sales milestones, $0.25 million of which may be paid in the form of PharmaEssentia stock. We will also be eligible to receive tiered royalties ranging from the high single-digits to teens on net sales of each product commercialized by PharmaEssentia, which may be reduced accordingly upon the entrance of competing generic products. Prior to the expiration of the term of each agreement, PharmaEssentia may terminate the agreement in its sole discretion, by providing six months’ notice to us. Subject to certain conditions, we may also terminate the agreement if PharmaEssentia fails to comply with certain development timelines set out in each of the agreements. The agreements also contain customary termination rights for either party, such as in the event of a breach of the agreement or the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings by the other party.
We granted Xiangxue an exclusive license to develop and commercialize ointment preparations of tirbanibulin ointment for certain indications, including actinic keratosis, for China, Hong Kong, and Macau. In November 2021, we regained the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize Oral Paclitaxel, Oral Irinotecan, and tirbanibulin ointment for Hong Kong and Macau for $1.5 million. We may be eligible to receive $40.0 million if the defined regulatory milestones are achieved, sales milestones up to $30.0

million when certain sales targets of tirbanibulin ointment among other products are met, and tiered royalties at rates starting from the low teens. The license may be terminated in its entirety upon the mutual agreement of the parties, by Xiangxue for convenience upon requisite notice, or by either party for material breach as set forth in the license. The license also will be terminated with respect to any licensed product for Xiangxue’s failure to meet agreed upon regulatory milestones with respect to such licensed product.
 Other Product Candidates
 In June 2018, we entered into a license agreement with Avalon Polytom (HK) Ltd. ("Polytom"), an entity affiliated with Avalon Global Holdings Limited ("Avalon"), pursuant to which Polytom granted us an exclusive, sublicensable right and license to develop and commercialize products containing pegylated and cobalt-replaced arginase for the treatment of cancer in humans, apart from ophthalmic uses and use as eye drops, worldwide. Dr. Johnson Lau, our chief executive officer and chairman, and Dr. Manson Fok, one of our directors, collectively have a controlling interest in and serve on the board of directors of Avalon. Also in June 2018, we entered into a license and supply agreement with Avalon HepaPOC Limited ("HepaPOC"), an entity affiliated with Avalon, pursuant to which HepaPOC agreed to exclusively sell to us the meter and consumable strips that can be used to detect galactose concentrations in human blood and granted us an exclusive, sublicensable right and license to use and commercialize the meter and strips for conduct of liver function tests in humans taking our oncology drugs.
For KX2-361, in December 2011, we granted PharmaEssentia an exclusive, sublicensable license to use any pharmaceutical preparation containing KX2-361 for use in treating psoriasis or other non-malignant skin conditions in a territory that includes China, Taiwan, Macau, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan and South Korea. In May 2012, we granted Xiangxue an exclusive, sublicensable license to use certain of our intellectual property to develop and commercialize products containing KX2-361 in all indications for brain tumors in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore.
Competition
The biopharmaceutical industry and the oncology subsector are characterized by rapid evolution of technologies, fierce competition and strong defense of intellectual property. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will have to compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. While we believe that our product candidates, platforms and scientific expertise in the field of biotechnology and oncology provide us with competitive advantages, a wide variety of institutions, including large biopharmaceutical companies, specialty biotechnology companies, academic research departments and public and private research institutions, are actively developing potentially competitive products and technologies. We face substantial competition from biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies developing oncology products. These competitors and their products generally fall within the following categories:
Cell Therapy: Adicet, Allogene, Appia Bio, Atara, Autolus, Biotherapeutics, Cellectis, Celyad, Crispr, Cytovia, Fate Therapeutics, MiNK Therapeutics, Nkarta, ONK Therapeutics, Precision Biosciences, Poseida, and Senti Bio;
Oral administration: Taxol, Abraxane, Cynviloq, Camptosar, Onivyde, Taxotere and Hycamtin; and
 Src Kinase inhibitors: Picato and Temodar.
Many of the companies, either alone or with strategic partners, against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources, and clinical, regulatory, commercialization and manufacturing capabilities than we do. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance, rendering our treatments obsolete or non-competitive. Accelerated merger and acquisition activity in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These companies also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical study sites and patient registration for clinical studies, acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs and for sales in the API business. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Our commercial opportunity could be substantially limited in the event that our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, safer, less toxic, more convenient or less expensive than our comparable products. In geographies that are critical to our commercial success, competitors may also obtain regulatory approvals before us, resulting in our competitors building a strong market position in advance of our products’ entry. We believe the factors determining the success of our programs will be the efficacy, safety and convenience of our product candidates and our access to supply of API.
Intellectual Property
We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technologies, inventions, products and product candidates, methods of manufacture, methods of using our products and product candidates, and improvements thereof that are commercially important to our business. We protect our proprietary intellectual property position by, among others, filing patent applications in the U.S. and in

jurisdictions outside of the U.S. covering our proprietary technologies, inventions, products and product candidates, methods, and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing innovation, and licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary intellectual property position.
Granted patents and pending patent applications related to our platforms and product candidates cover such aspects as composition-of-matter claims to our lead product candidates and their analogs, claims to pharmaceutical compositions comprising such candidates, and claims to methods of making and method of treatment using such candidates. As of February 2, 2022, related to the Src Kinase inhibition platform, we owned approximately 200 granted patents and over 100 pending patent applications, including nine allowed patent applications worldwide. Not accounting for any patent term adjustment, patent term extension or terminal disclaimer, and, assuming that all annuity and/or maintenance fees are paid, the patents and, if granted, patent applications, will expire from 2025 to 2040.
In addition, we have in-licensed various patent, pending patent applications, and technologies. Notably, pursuant to our collaboration with the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at BCM, in October 2021, we announced the allowance of the first U.S. patent related to our CAR-NKT cell therapy, including a composition-of-matter claim comprising a plurality of genetically modified CD62L-positive human NKT cells comprising at least one CAR. In November 2021, we licensed a portfolio of TCRs that recognize “hotspot” mutations in p53, KRAS, and EGFR genes and methods of isolating T-cells that are reactive to p53 and KRAS specific mutated antigens from the National Cancer Institute (NCI), an institute of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). We continue to maintain licenses for patents related to TCR T-cell therapy, the Orascovery platform, and PEGylation of arginases and their use as anti-cancer and anti-viral therapies.
The term of individual patents depends upon the laws of the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing of a non-provisional patent application. In the U.S., the term of a patent may be lengthened by patent term adjustment to compensate the patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trade Office ("USPTO") in examining and granting the patent or may be shortened if the patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed patent. In addition, a patent term may be extended to restore a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of FDA regulatory review. However, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of fourteen years from the date of FDA approval, and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar extensions as compensation for regulatory delays are available in Europe and other jurisdictions. We have sought patent term extensions in the U.S. and Supplementary Protection Certificates in Europe and intend to seek similar regulatory extensions in other jurisdictions when available. However, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and we cannot predict the length of the extensions even if they are granted. The actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a claim-by-claim basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. For a granted patent to remain in force most countries require the payment of annuities or maintenance fees, either yearly or at certain intervals during the term of a patent. If an annuity or maintenance fee is not paid, the patent may lapse irrevocably.
Government Regulation and Product Approval
Governmental authorities in the U.S., at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, approval, quality control, labeling, packaging, promotion, storage, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. In order to be lawfully marketed in the U.S., our therapeutic drug candidates and compounded products must comply with either Section 503B (outsourcing facility) or Section 505 (new drug approval) of the FDCA as applicable, and they will be subject to similar premarket requirements in other countries. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and ensuring compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
U.S. Government Regulation
In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the FDCA and its implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development or approval process, or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. These sanctions could include:
•refusal to approve pending applications; 
 •withdrawal of an approval; 
 •imposition of a clinical hold; 
 •warning or untitled letters; 
 •seizures or administrative detention of product; 


•total or partial suspension of production or distribution; or 
 •injunctions, fines, restitution, disgorgement, refusal of government contracts, or civil or criminal penalties. 
 NDA approval processes
The process required by the FDA before a therapeutic drug product may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
•completion of extensive nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies conducted in accordance with GLPs and other applicable regulations; 
 •submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must be authorized before human clinical trials may begin; 
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with federal regulations and Good Clinical Practices, or GCPs, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors, to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use; 
 •submission to the FDA of an NDA; 
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product candidate is produced to assess readiness for commercial manufacturing and conformance to the manufacturing-related elements of the application, to conduct a data integrity audit, and to assess compliance with cGMP to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to assure the product candidate’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
 •potential FDA audit of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and
 •FDA review and approval of the NDA. 
 Once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical or nonclinical testing stage. Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. Such studies must generally be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s GLPs. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND application. Some nonclinical testing may continue even after the IND application is submitted. In addition to including the results of the nonclinical studies, the IND application will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the first phase lends itself to an efficacy determination. The IND application automatically becomes effective thirty days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the IND on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin. A clinical hold may occur at any time during the life of an IND and may affect one or more specific studies or all studies conducted under the IND application. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, clinical trials cannot commence or recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA.
 The manufacture of investigational drugs for the conduct of human clinical trials is subject to cGMP requirements. Investigational drugs and API imported into the U.S. are also subject to regulation by the FDA relating to their labeling and distribution. Further, the export of investigational drug products outside of the U.S. may be subject to regulatory requirements of the receiving country as well as U.S. export requirements under the FDCA.
All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirements that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Investigators must also provide certain information to the clinical trial sponsors to allow the sponsors to make certain financial disclosures to the FDA. Clinical trials must be conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, research subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness endpoints to be evaluated. Each protocol, and any subsequent material amendment to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND application, and progress reports detailing the status of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA annually. Sponsors also must report to the FDA serious and unexpected adverse reactions in a timely manner. Reporting requirements also apply to, among other things, any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator’s brochure and any findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the product candidate. An institutional review board, or IRB, with jurisdiction at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the protocol before a clinical trial commences at that institution and must also approve the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each research subject or the subject’s legal representative, monitor the study until completed and otherwise comply with IRB regulations.

Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined.
•Phase 1—The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and elimination. In the case of some therapeutic candidates for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product candidate may be inherently too toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. 
 •Phase 2—Clinical trials are performed on a limited patient population intended to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. 
 •Phase 3—Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These studies are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. 
 A pivotal study is a clinical study that adequately meets regulatory agency requirements for the evaluation of a product candidate’s efficacy and safety such that it can be used to justify the approval of the product. Generally, pivotal studies are also Phase 3 studies but may be Phase 2 studies, with the agreement of FDA, if the trial design provides a reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in situations where there is an unmet medical need.
In the case of a 505(b)(2) NDA, which is a marketing application in which the sponsor may rely on investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted, some of the above-described studies and nonclinical studies may not be required or may be abbreviated. The applicant may rely upon the FDA’s prior findings of safety and efficacy for a previously approved product or on published scientific literature in support of its application. Bridging studies, including clinical studies, may be needed, however, to demonstrate that it is scientifically appropriate to rely on the findings of the studies that were previously conducted by other sponsors to the drug that is the subject of the marketing application.
In addition, the manufacturer of an investigational drug in a Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trial for a serious or life-threatening disease is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access to such investigational drug.
The outcome of human clinical trials is inherently uncertain, and Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be successfully completed or may not be completed at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time for a variety of reasons, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
During the development of a new product candidate, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points; specifically, prior to the submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2 and before an NDA application is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date and for the FDA to provide advice on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meeting at the end of Phase 2 to discuss their Phase 2 clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials that they believe will support the approval of the new therapeutic. A sponsor may request a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, the purpose of which is to reach agreement with the FDA on the Phase 3 clinical trial protocol design and analysis that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim. The agreement will be binding on the FDA and may not be changed by the sponsor or the FDA after the trial begins except with the written agreement of the sponsor and the FDA or if the FDA determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or efficacy of the product candidate was identified after the testing began.
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as “Phase 4” clinical trials, may be required after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication.
Concurrent with clinical trials, sponsors usually complete additional animal safety studies, develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing commercial quantities of the product candidate in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the quality, purity and potency of the product candidate. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its proposed shelf-life.
The results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests and other control mechanisms, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. An NDA must also contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indication in all relevant pediatric populations. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each NDA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for each prescription

drug. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, such as where a waiver is necessary to protect the public health, where the fee would present a significant barrier to innovation or where the applicant is a small business submitting its first human therapeutic application for review. Product candidates that are designated as orphan drugs are also not subject to user fees unless the application contains an indication other than an orphan indication.
Within sixty days following submission of an NDA, FDA reviews the application to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to accept any NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA files it. Once the submission is filed, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the NDA. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. FDA seeks to review NDAs for standard review products that are not new molecular entities, or NMEs, within ten months of the date the NDA is submitted, while FDA seeks to review NDAs for standard review NMEs within ten months of the date FDA files the NDA. FDA seeks to review NDAs for priority review products that are not NMEs within six months of the date the NDA is submitted, while FDA seeks to review NDAs for priority review NMEs within six months of the date FDA files the NDA. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and, if so, under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 During the product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, plan is necessary to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes that a REMS plan is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS plan prior to approval. The FDA has authority to require a REMS plan when necessary to ensure that the benefits of a drug outweigh the risks. In determining whether a REMS plan is necessary, the FDA must consider the size of the population likely to use the drug, the seriousness of the disease or condition to be treated, the expected benefit of the drug, the duration of treatment, the seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the drug is a new molecular entity. A REMS plan may be required to include various elements, such as a medication guide or patient package insert, a communication plan to educate health care providers of the risks, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug or other measures that the FDA deems necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. In addition, the REMS plan must include a timetable to assess the strategy at eighteen months, three years and seven years after the strategy’s approval.
The FDA may also require a REMS plan for a drug that is already on the market if it determines, based on new safety information, that a REMS plan is necessary to ensure that the product’s benefits outweigh its risks.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are compliant with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial requirements and GCP requirements. To assure cGMP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production and quality control.
Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive, and the FDA may interpret data differently than the applicant. If the agency decides not to approve the NDA in its then present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA, with no implication regarding the ultimate approvability of the application or the timing of any such approval, if ever. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant must either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, withdraw the application, or appeal the decision.
Even if a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific indications and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing or dispensing in the form of a risk management plan, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as “Phase 4” clinical trials, designed to further assess a drug’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.

Expedited Review and Approval
The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing therapeutic candidates, or provide for the approval of a product candidate on the basis of a surrogate endpoint. Even if a product candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will be lengthened. Generally, therapeutic candidates that are eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of therapeutic candidates to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and fill unmet medical needs. Priority review is designed to give therapeutic candidates that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists an initial review within six months of the date that FDA files the NDA as compared to a standard review time of ten months of the date that FDA files the NDA.
Although Fast Track and priority review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast Track designated product candidate and expedite review of the application for a product candidate designated for priority review. Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a fast track drug concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. The Fast Track program and FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, which are described in Subpart H of 21 CFR Part 314, provide for an earlier approval for a new product candidate that is (1) intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition; (2) generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies and (3) demonstrates an effect on either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. A surrogate endpoint is a laboratory measurement or physical sign used as an indirect or substitute measurement representing a clinically meaningful outcome. As a condition of approval, the FDA will require that a sponsor of a product candidate receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on IMM or other clinical endpoint. The product may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures under certain circumstances.
 In addition to the Fast Track, accelerated approval and priority review programs discussed above, a sponsor may seek a breakthrough therapy designation. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or conditions, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. A breakthrough therapy designation conveys all of the Fast Track program features, as well as more intensive FDA guidance on an efficient drug development program and a commitment from FDA to involve senior managers and experienced review staff in a proactive collaborative, cross-disciplinary review.
Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs and 505(b)(2)NDAs
 NDA applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims covering the applicant’s product or method of using the product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic or 505(b)(2) applicants in support of approval of an ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) application. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown to be bioequivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug. A 505(b)(2) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness but where some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. A 505(b)(2) applicant may be able to rely on published literature or on FDA’s previous findings of safety and effectiveness for an approved drug. A 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted for changes to a previously approved drug, including, for example, in the dosage form, route of administration, or indication.
The ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant is required to make a certification to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved NDA product in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant must certify that: (1) the required patent information has not been filed; (2) the listed patent has expired (3) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (4) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a section viii statement certifying that its proposed ANDA labeling does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.

A certification that the ANDA or 505(b)(2) product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application has been received by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within forty-five days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until the earlier of thirty months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired.
Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our drug candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of fourteen years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND application and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application, except that this review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, if available, we intend to apply for restorations of patent term for some of our currently owned patents beyond their current expiration dates, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA; however, there can be no assurance that any such extension will be granted to us.
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the U.S. to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA, submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA under 505(b)(1) of the FDCA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant Orphan Drug Designation to therapeutic candidates intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects either (1) fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or (2) more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the U.S. a product candidate for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. for that product candidate. Orphan Drug Designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. We have received Orphan Drug Designation for KX2-361 for the treatment of gliomas and Oral Paclitaxel for the treatment of angiosarcomas. After the FDA grants Orphan Drug Designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan Drug Designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
If a product candidate that has Orphan Drug Designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product candidate is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except under limited circumstances, for seven years. Orphan drug exclusivity, however, could also block the approval of one of our therapeutic candidates for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug for the same disease or condition as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be

contained within the competitor’s product candidate for the same indication or disease. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent FDA from approving the same drug for a different disease or a different drug for the same disease.
 Pediatric Exclusivity and Pediatric Use
Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA), certain therapeutic candidates may obtain an additional six months of exclusivity if the sponsor submits information requested in writing by the FDA, referred to as a Written Request, relating to the use of the active moiety of the product candidate in children. Although the FDA may issue a Written Request for studies on either approved or unapproved indications, it may only do so where it determines that information relating to that use of a product candidate in a pediatric population, or part of the pediatric population, may produce health benefits in that population. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly responds to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied. If the FDA determines that information relating to the use of the new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in the population, the clinical study is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request and the reports of FDA-requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection covering the product are extended by six months. In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric studies for most therapeutic candidates, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs and supplements thereto must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must assess the safety and effectiveness of the product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product candidate is safe and effective. The FDA may grant a waiver or a deferral of pediatric studies for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the product candidate is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric studies are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric studies begin. The law requires the FDA to send a PREA Non-Compliance letter to sponsors who have failed to submit their pediatric assessments required under PREA, have failed to seek or obtain a deferral or deferral extension or have failed to request approval for a required pediatric formulation. It further requires the FDA to post the PREA Non-Compliance letter and sponsor’s response.
Post-Approval Requirements
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product candidate reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product candidate may result in restrictions on the product candidate or even complete withdrawal of the product candidate from the market. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product candidate, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval in a supplemental NDA, or sNDA. An sNDA must contain all of the information necessary to support the change. In the case of a new indication, that information usually consists of at least one clinical trial, and often more. Like an NDA, FDA determines whether the sNDA is sufficiently complete to permit review before it files the sNDA. FDA then reviews the sNDA. Like an NDA, FDA can either approve the sNDA or issue a complete response letter outlining the deficiencies in the sNDA. In addition, the FDA may under some circumstances require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved therapeutic candidates that have been commercialized, and the FDA under some circumstances has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product candidate based on the results of these post-marketing programs.
Any therapeutic candidates manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals for prescription drugs are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things:
•reporting and record-keeping requirements; 
 •reporting of adverse experiences; 
 •providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information; 
 •product sampling and distribution requirements; 
 •notifying the FDA and gaining its approval of specified manufacturing or labeling changes and 
 •complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among other things, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in or consistent with the product’s approved labeling, limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. 
 Therapeutic manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacturing of approved therapeutic products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and obtain licenses in certain states and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and some state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities

to assess compliance with cGMP, which imposes extensive procedural, substantive and record-keeping requirements. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations would also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers used. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information, which is publicly available at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed under certain limited circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs. The government recently released a regulation and policy to expand and enhance the requirements related to registering and reporting the results of which may result in greater enforcement of these requirements in the future.
Regulation of Outsourcing Facilities
Pharmaceutical drug compounding is a practice in which a licensed pharmacist, a licensed physician, or in the case of an outsourcing facility, a person under the direct supervision of a licensed pharmacist, combines, mixes, or alters ingredients of a drug to create a medication. We are engaged in the compounding of sterile drugs as an outsourcing facility registered with FDA under FDCA Section 503B. Title I of the Drug Quality and Security Act, the Compounding Quality Act, or CQA, allows a facility that compounds sterile drugs to register with FDA as an outsourcing facility. Once registered (which includes payment of an annual fee, among other requirements), an outsourcing facility must meet certain conditions in order to be statutorily exempt from the FDCA’s new drug approval requirements, the requirement to label products with adequate directions for use, and certain product tracing and serialization requirements. Under the CQA, a drug must be lawfully compounded in compliance with the provisions set forth in Section 503B including FDA’s cGMP regulations and related cGMP guidance for outsourcing facilities in order to remain eligible for the statutory exemptions. The outsourcing facility must also bi-annually report specific information about the products that it compounds, including a list of all of the products it compounded during the previous six months pursuant to Section 503B(b)(2). The source of any bulk substance active ingredient used in compounding must be a Section 510-registered manufacturer, and the substances must be accompanied by a Certificate of Analysis. If the outsourcing facility compounds using bulk drug substances, the bulk drug substances must either appear on FDA’s “interim” Category 1 list of bulk substances that may be used in compounding under Section 503B, which are bulk drug substances for which FDA has determined there is a clinical need for use in compounding. Drugs may also be compounded if an FDA-approved drug product appears on FDA’s published drug shortage list.
FDA has not yet finalized its list of bulk drug substances for which there is a clinical need. Provided certain conditions are met, FDA will exercise enforcement discretion concerning interim Category 1 substances pending evaluation of the substances for inclusion on FDA’s final list of bulk drug substances for which there is a clinical need.
In addition, an outsourcing facility must meet other conditions described in the CQA, including reporting adverse events pursuant to Section 503B(b)(5) of the FDCA, and labeling its compounded products with certain information pursuant to Section 503B(a)(10). Outsourcing facilities are prohibited from transferring or otherwise selling compounded drugs through a wholesale distributor, or from compounding drugs that are essentially copies of commercially available, FDA-approved drugs. Outsourcing facilities are subject to FDA inspection, and FDA conducts inspections on a risk-based frequency under Section 503B(b)(4).
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Reimbursement and Pricing
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval or compound. In the U.S., sales of any products for which we may compound or receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations as well as government payors such as Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and the Department of Veterans Affairs.
The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product is typically separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list or formulary which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Also, third-party payors may refuse to include a particular branded drug on their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available. However, under Medicare Part D—Medicare’s outpatient prescription drug benefit—there are protections in place to ensure coverage and reimbursement for oncology products and all Part D prescription drug plans are required to cover substantially all anti-cancer agents. However, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product

does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be available. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of any products, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. Our drug candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover an approved product as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit.
Government Programs
 Medicaid, the 340B Drug Pricing Program, and Medicare
 Federal law requires that a pharmaceutical manufacturer, as a condition of having its products receive federal reimbursement under Medicaid and Medicare Part B, must pay rebates to state Medicaid programs for all units of its covered outpatient drugs dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program under either a fee-for-service arrangement or through a managed care organization. This federal requirement is effectuated through a Medicaid drug rebate agreement between the manufacturer and the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) administers the Medicaid drug rebate agreements, which provide, among other things, that the drug manufacturer will pay rebates to each state Medicaid agency on a quarterly basis and report certain price information on a monthly and quarterly basis. The rebates are based on prices reported to CMS by manufacturers for their covered outpatient drugs. For innovator products, that is, drugs that are marketed under approved NDAs, the basic rebate amount is the greater of 23.1% of the average manufacturer price (“AMP”) for the quarter or the difference between such AMP and the best price for that same quarter. The AMP is the weighted average of prices paid to the manufacturer (1) directly by retail community pharmacies and (2) by wholesalers for drugs distributed to retail community pharmacies. The best price is essentially the lowest price available to non-governmental entities. Innovator products are also subject to an additional rebate that is based on the amount, if any, by which the product’s current AMP has increased over the baseline AMP, which is the AMP for the first full quarter after launch, adjusted for inflation. For non-innovator products, generally generic drugs marketed under approved abbreviated new drug applications, the basic rebate amount is 13% of the AMP for the quarter. Non-innovator products are also subject to an additional rebate. The additional rebate is similar to that discussed above for innovator products, except that the baseline AMP quarter is the fifth full quarter after launch (for non-innovator multiple source drugs launched on April 1, 2013 or later) or the third quarter of 2014 (for those launched before April 1, 2013). To date, the rebate amount for a drug has been capped at 100% of the AMP; however, effective January 1, 2024, this cap will be eliminated, which means that a manufacturer could pay a rebate amount on a unit of the drug that is greater than the average price the manufacturer receives for the drug.
 The terms of participation in the Medicaid drug rebate program impose an obligation to correct the prices reported in previous quarters, as may be necessary. Any such corrections could result in additional or lesser rebate liability, depending on the direction of the correction. In addition to retroactive rebates, if a manufacturer were found to have knowingly submitted false information to the government, federal law provides for civil monetary penalties for failing to provide required information, late submission of required information, and false information.
 A manufacturer must also participate in a federal program known as the 340B drug pricing program in order for federal funds to be available to pay for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. Under this program, the participating manufacturer agrees to charge certain federally funded clinics and safety net hospitals no more than an established discounted price for its covered outpatient drugs. The formula for determining the discounted price is defined by statute and is based on the AMP and the unit rebate amount as calculated under the Medicaid drug rebate program, discussed above. Manufacturers are required to report pricing information to the Health Resources and Services Administration (“HRSA”) on a quarterly basis. HRSA has also issued regulations relating to the calculation of the ceiling price as well as imposition of civil monetary penalties for each instance of knowingly and intentionally overcharging a 340B covered entity.
 Federal law also requires that manufacturers report data on a quarterly basis to CMS regarding the pricing of drugs that are separately reimbursable under Medicare Part B. These are generally drugs, such as injectable products, that are administered “incident to” a physician service and are not generally self-administered. The pricing information submitted by manufacturers is the basis for reimbursement to physicians and suppliers for drugs covered under Medicare Part B. As with the Medicaid drug rebate program, federal law provides for civil monetary penalties for failing to provide required information, late submission of required information, and false information.
 Medicare Part D provides prescription drug benefits for seniors and people with disabilities. Medicare Part D beneficiaries had a gap in their coverage (between the initial coverage limit and the point at which catastrophic coverage begins) where Medicare did not cover their prescription drug costs, known as the coverage gap. However, by 2020, Medicare Part D beneficiaries will pay 25% of

drug costs after they reach the initial coverage limit - the same percentage they were responsible for before they reached that limit - thereby closing the coverage gap. Most of the cost of closing the coverage gap is being borne by innovator companies and the government through subsidies. Each manufacturer of a drug approved under an NDA is required to enter into a Medicare Part D coverage gap discount agreement and provide a 70% discount on those drugs dispensed to Medicare beneficiaries in the coverage gap, in order for its drugs to be reimbursed by Medicare Part D.
 Federal Contracting/Pricing Requirements
 Manufacturers are also required to make their covered drugs, which are generally drugs approved under NDAs, available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule (“FSS”) of the General Services Administration. The law also requires manufacturers to offer deeply discounted FSS contract pricing for purchases of their covered drugs by the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense (“DoD”), the Coast Guard, and the Public Health Service (including the Indian Health Service) in order for federal funding to be available for reimbursement or purchase of the manufacturer’s drugs under certain federal programs. FSS pricing to those four federal agencies for covered drugs must be no more than the Federal Ceiling Price (“FCP”), which is at least 24% below the Non-Federal Average Manufacturer Price (“Non-FAMP”) for the prior year. The Non-FAMP is the average price for covered drugs sold to wholesalers or other middlemen, net of any price reductions.
 The accuracy of a manufacturer’s reported Non-FAMPs, FCPs, or FSS contract prices may be audited by the government. Among the remedies available to the government for inaccuracies is recoupment of any overcharges to the four specified federal agencies based on those inaccuracies. If a manufacturer were found to have knowingly reported false prices, in addition to other penalties available to the government, the law provides for civil monetary penalties of $100,000 per incorrect item. Finally, manufacturers are required to disclose in FSS contract proposals all commercial pricing that is equal to or less than the proposed FSS pricing, and subsequent to award of an FSS contract, manufacturers are required to monitor certain commercial price reductions and extend commensurate price reductions to the government, under the terms of the FSS contract Price Reductions Clause. Among the remedies available to the government for any failure to properly disclose commercial pricing and/or to extend FSS contract price reductions is recoupment of any FSS overcharges that may result from such omissions.
 Tricare Retail Pharmacy Network Program
 The DoD provides pharmacy benefits to current and retired military service members and their families through the Tricare healthcare program. When a Tricare beneficiary obtains a prescription drug through a retail pharmacy, the DoD reimburses the pharmacy at the retail price for the drug rather than procuring it from the manufacturer at the discounted FCP discussed above. In order for the DoD to realize discounted prices for covered drugs (generally drugs approved under NDAs), federal law requires manufacturers to pay refunds on utilization of their covered drugs sold to Tricare beneficiaries through retail pharmacies in DoD’s Tricare network. These refunds are generally the difference between the Non-FAMP and the FCP and are due on a quarterly basis. Absent an agreement from the manufacturer to provide such refunds, DoD will designate the manufacturer’s products as Tier 3 (non-formulary) and require that beneficiaries obtain prior authorization in order for the products to be dispensed at a Tricare retail network pharmacy. However, refunds are due whether or not the manufacturer has entered into such an agreement.
Branded Pharmaceutical Fee
 A branded pharmaceutical fee is imposed on manufacturers and importers of branded prescription drugs, generally drugs approved under NDAs. The fee is $2.8 billion in 2019 and subsequent years. This annual fee is apportioned among the participating companies based on each company’s sales of qualifying products to or utilization by certain U.S. government programs during the preceding calendar year. The fee is not deductible for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Utilization of generic drugs, generally drugs approved under ANDAs, is not included in a manufacturer’s sales used to calculate its portion of the fee.
 The ACA
 Effective in 2010, the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price, or AMP, to 23.1% of AMP, and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The ACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization as of 2010 and by expanding the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. CMS will expand Medicaid rebate liability to the territories of the U.S. as well, beginning in 2023, if the territories elect to enroll in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. In addition, the ACA provides for the public availability of retail survey prices and certain weighted average AMPs under the Medicaid program. The implementation of this requirement by CMS may also provide for the public availability of pharmacy acquisition cost data, which could influence our decisions related to setting product prices and offering related discounts.

With regard to the 340B program, effective in 2010, the ACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing; although, under the current state of the law, with the exception of children’s hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs when used for the orphan indication.
The adoption of government controls and measures and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could also limit payments for pharmaceuticals.
The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Generic Drugs
Given that we manufacture and market generic drug products, our business may be impacted by laws and policies governing the coverage, pricing and reimbursement of generic drugs. Generic drugs are the same API as initial innovator medicines and are typically more affordable in comparison to the innovator’s products. Sales of generic medicines have benefitted from policies encouraging generic substitution and a general increasing acceptance of generic drugs on the part of healthcare insurers, consumers, physicians and pharmacists. However, while the U.S. generics market is one of the largest in the world, the recent trend of rising generic drug prices has drawn scrutiny from the U.S. government. Specifically, generic drug pricing is the subject of Congressional inquiries and media attention, and many generic drug manufacturers are the targets of government investigations.
In addition, like branded drug manufacturers, generic drug manufacturers are now required to pay an inflation penalty if price increases on generic drugs exceed the rate of inflation.
Also, the ACA revised the methodology for setting Medicaid generic drug reimbursement in order to further limit the reimbursement of generic drugs under the Medicaid program. Specifically, the Federal Upper Limit (“FUL”), which establishes the government’s maximum payment amount for certain generic drugs, is no less than 175% of the weighted average of the most recently reported monthly AMPs for pharmaceutically and therapeutically equivalent multiple source drug products that are available for purchase by retail community pharmacies on a nationwide basis. Similarly, reimbursement for generic drugs is also limited in Medicare Part B, as the Average Sales Price (the metric upon which reimbursement is based or ASP) for multiple-source drugs included within the same multiple-source drug billing and payment code is the volume-weighted average of the various manufacturers’ ASPs for those drug products.
Reimbursement for Compounded Drugs
Given that we intend to compound and sell compounded products, some of which may include APIs that we manufacture, our business may be impacted by the downstream coverage and reimbursement of compounded products. Generally, federal reimbursement is available for compounded drugs but is typically dependent upon whether the individual ingredients or bulk drug substances that make up the compounded product are FDA-approved. Certain of our API products have not yet received FDA approval.
There is a national payment policy for compounded drugs under Medicare Part B, but the policy is unclear because it does not stipulate whether payment is available for ingredients that are bulk drug substances, which are generally not FDA-approved. Under Medicare Part B, claims for compounded drugs are typically submitted using a billing code for “not otherwise classified drugs,” and CMS contractors who process Part B claims may conduct further reviews of outpatient claims to determine whether the drug billed under a nonspecific billing code is a compounded drug and to identify its ingredients in order to make payment decisions. However, CMS contractors who process Part B claims do not always collect information on the FDA-approval status of drug ingredients, and, therefore, payment may be made for ingredients that are not FDA-approved products. Therefore, there is uncertainty as to whether Medicare payments for compounded drugs are consistent with the Medicare Part B policy.
Under Medicare Part D, federal payments are not available for non-FDA-approved products—including bulk drug substances—and inactive ingredients used to make a compounded drug. Insurers that offer Medicare Part D benefits and Part D-only sponsors, generally, pay pharmacies for each ingredient in the compounded drug that is an FDA-approved product and is otherwise eligible for reimbursement under Part D. However, with respect to non-FDA approved bulk drug substances, insurers that offer Medicare Part D benefits and Part D-only sponsors may choose to pay for such bulk substances but may not submit these payments as part of the Part D transaction data CMS uses to determine federal payments to Part D plans.
Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws and Compliance Requirements
We are subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales and marketing programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:
•the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration (a term interpreted broadly to include anything of value, including, for example, gifts, discounts, chargebacks, and credits), directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; 
 •federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, or making a false statement or record material to payment of a false claim or avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money owed to the federal government; 
 •provisions of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes, referred to as the “HIPAA All-Payor Fraud Prohibition,” that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters; 
 •the federal transparency laws, including the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which was part of the ACA, that require manufacturers of certain drugs and biologics to track and annually report payments and other transfers of value they make to U.S. physicians, physician assistants, certain types of advance care nurses, and teaching hospitals, as well as physician ownership and investment interests in the manufacturer, and that such information is subsequently made publicly available in a searchable format on a CMS website; 
 •provisions of HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information and 
 •state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, state transparency reporting and compliance laws; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and which may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 The ACA broadened the reach of the fraud and abuse laws by, among other things, amending the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the applicable criminal healthcare fraud statutes contained within 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b. Pursuant to the statutory amendment, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act or the civil monetary penalties statute. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.

The federal False Claims Act prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services that are false or fraudulent. Although we would not submit claims directly to payors, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. For example, pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under the federal False Claims Act in connection with their alleged off-label promotion of drugs, purportedly concealing price concessions in the pricing information submitted to the government for government price reporting purposes, and allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal health care programs for the product. Penalties for a False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and, although the federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, conduct that results in a False Claims Act violation may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions under the federal False Claims Act, and certain states have enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act.
New Legislation and Regulations
From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the testing, approval, manufacturing, marketing, coverage and reimbursement of products regulated by the FDA or other government agencies. In addition to new legislation, FDA and healthcare fraud and abuse and coverage and reimbursement regulations and policies are often revised or interpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. Most recently, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Reform Act”) was enacted, which, among other things, removes penalties for not complying with the individual mandate to carry health insurance. On June 17, 2021, the United States Supreme Court dismissed a challenge to the constitutionality of the ACA on procedural grounds because the individual mandate was repealed by Congress. It is possible that there will be changes to the ACA in the future. Additional reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenues from therapeutic candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop therapeutic candidates. However, we cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or the impact of potential legislation on us.
Furthermore, in the U.S., the health care industry is subject to political, economic and regulatory influences. Initiatives to reduce the federal budget and debt and to reform health care coverage are increasing cost-containment efforts. We anticipate that federal agencies, Congress, state legislatures and the private sector will continue to review and assess alternative health care benefits, controls on health care spending, and other fundamental changes to the healthcare delivery system. Any proposed or actual changes could limit coverage or the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for health care products and services, which could also result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressures and limit or eliminate our spending on development projects and affect our ultimate profitability. We are not able to predict whether further legislative changes will be enacted or whether FDA or healthcare fraud and abuse or coverage and reimbursement regulations, guidance, policies or interpretations will be changed or what the effect of such changes, if any, may be.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (“FCPA”) prohibits any U.S. individual or business from corruptly offering, paying, promising or authorizing the provision of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, foreign political party or official thereof, or candidate for foreign political office to obtain or retain business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the U.S. to comply with accounting provisions requiring the issuer to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the issuer and its controlled subsidiaries and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls.
Environment
We are subject to inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMP and other U.S. regulatory requirements, including U.S. federal, state and local regulations regarding environmental protection and hazardous and controlled substance controls, among others. Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant expenditures to ensure that we are in compliance with these laws and regulations. We would be subject to significant penalties for failure to comply with these laws and regulations.
China Government Regulation
In the People’s Republic of China (“PRC” or “China,” for the purposes of this document only, except where the context requires otherwise, references to China or the PRC exclude the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau and Taiwan), we operate in an increasingly complex legal and regulatory environment. We are subject to a variety of PRC laws, rules and regulations affecting many aspects of our business. This section summarizes the principal PRC laws, rules and regulations relevant to our business and operations.
Foreign Investment in Pharmaceutical Industry
Foreign investment in China was previously subject to the Catalogue for the Guidance of Foreign Investment Industries (2017 Revision) issued and effective beginning July 28, 2017, and the Special Administrative Measures for the Access of Foreign Investment (2018 Revision) (the “Negative List”) issued and effective beginning July 28, 2018, which together comprised the encouraged foreign-invested industries catalogue and the special administrative measures for the access of foreign investments to the restricted or the prohibited foreign-invested industries. The latter set out restrictions such as percentage of shareholding and qualifications of senior management. The Catalogue of Industries in which Foreign Investment is Encouraged and the Negative List have been revised several times. The most updated Catalogue of Industries in which Foreign Investment is Encouraged revision was issued on December 27, 2020 (the “2020 Catalogue”) and came into effect on January 27, 2021. The most updated Negative List was issued on December 27, 2021 (the “2021 Negative List”) and took effect on January 1, 2022, which further reduced restrictions on foreign investment. The manufacturing and production of new anti-cancer drugs, new cardiovascular medicine and new nervous system drugs all fall within the field of industries in which foreign investment is encouraged in the 2020 Catalogue.
 General Regulations on China Drug Administration
The pharmaceuticals industry in China is mainly regulated and administrated by the National Medical Products Administration (the “NMPA”), under the administration of the State Administration for Market Regulation (the “SAMR”), the National Health Commission (the “NHC”) and the National Health Care Security Administration (the “NHSA”). Pursuant to the Decision of the First Session of the Thirteenth National People’s Congress on the State Council of the PRC (the “State Council”) Institutional Reform Proposal promulgated by the National People’s Congress of the PRC on March 17, 2018, (1) the SAMR was established; and the China Food and Drug Administration (the “CFDA”) ceased to exist, while the NMPA was established under the administration of the SAMR; (2) the National Health and Family Planning Commission ceased to exist, while the NHC shall be established as a department under the State Council, incorporating duties of supervision and management which had been assigned to relevant departments and (3) the NHSA was established as a bureau directly subordinate to the State Council.
 The NMPA, which inherited the drug supervision function from its predecessor the CFDA, is the primary drug regulator responsible for almost all of the key stages of the life-cycle of pharmaceutical products, including preclinical research, clinical trials, marketing approvals, manufacturing, advertising and promotion, distribution and pharmacovigilance.
The PRC Drug Administration Law (the “PRC Drug Administration Law”) promulgated by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress in 1984 and the Implementing Measures of the PRC Drug Administration Law promulgated by the Ministry of Health, or the MOH, in 1989 set forth the legal framework for the administration of pharmaceutical products, including the research, development and manufacturing of drugs.
The PRC Drug Administration Law was revised in February 2001, December 2013, April 2015, and again in August 2019. The purpose of the revisions was to strengthen the supervision and administration of pharmaceutical products and to ensure the quality and safety of those products for human use. The revised PRC Drug Administration Law applies to entities and individuals engaged in the development, production, trade, application, supervision and administration of pharmaceutical products. It regulates and prescribes a framework for the administration of pharmaceutical preparations of medical institutions and for the development, research, manufacturing, distribution, packaging, pricing and advertisement of pharmaceutical products. New Implementing Measures of the PRC Drug Administration Law promulgated by the State Council took effect in September 2002 and was revised in February 2016, and again in March 2019, providing detailed implementing regulations for the revised PRC Drug Administration Law.
The PRC Drug Administration Law was newly revised on August 26, 2019 and came into effect on December 1, 2019. As compared to the old law, the current revised PRC Drug Administration Law mainly includes the following key highlights:
 •The supervision and administration of pharmaceutical products will be improved by emphasizing the responsibility of the enterprise, strengthening the management of drug production process and clarifying the traceability requirements of drug quality and safety;
 •The responsibility for drug supervision will be clarified, and the supervision measures will be improved;
 •The punishment of illegal behaviors will be aggravated by increasing the fine limit, strengthening the punishment for the relevant personnel of pharmaceutical production enterprises and supplementing the responsibility of the drug marketing authorization holder (the “MAH”);
 •The MAH system will be implemented, which will cause the MAH holder to undertake the responsibility of the safety and effectiveness of drugs and to bear legal responsibility during the whole process of development, production, management and use of drugs; and
 •The drug approval system will be reformed, including the abolishment of the separation of GMP and GSP certification. 
 Under these regulations, we need to follow related regulations for preclinical research, clinical trials and production of new drugs.

On April 27, 2021, the General Office of the State Council published the Opinions on Comprehensively Strengthening Regulatory Capacity for Drugs. The Opinions introduced the general requirements and several key tasks and safeguards to improve regulations on drugs, including enhancing drug inspection capability and establishing a national pharmacovigilance system.
 Good Laboratories Practice Certification for Preclinical Research
To improve the quality of preclinical research, the CFDA promulgated the Administrative Measures for Good Laboratories Practice of Preclinical Laboratory in 2003, which was revised in 2017, and began to conduct the certification program of GLP. In addition, the CFDA promulgated the Administrative Measures for the Certification of Good Laboratory Practices of Preclinical Laboratory in April 2007 which determines whether an institution is qualified for undertaking pharmaceutical preclinical research upon the evaluation of the institution’s organizational administration, its research personnel, its equipment and facilities and its operation and management of preclinical pharmaceutical projects. If all requirements are met, a GLP Certification will be issued by the CFDA, and the result will be published on the CFDA’s website.
 Approval for Clinical Trials and Production of New Drugs
According to the Provisions for Drug Registration promulgated by the SAMR in January 2020, which abolished the old Provisions for Drug Registration promulgated by the CFDA in 2007, the PRC Drug Administration Law, the Provisions on the Administration of Special Examination and Approval of Registration of New Drugs, or the Special Examination and Approval Provisions issued by the CFDA in 2009 and the Circular on Information Publish Platform for Pharmaceutical Clinical Trials issued by the NMPA in 2013, we must comply with the following procedures and obtain several approvals for clinical trials and production of new drugs.
Clinical Trial Application
Upon completion of its preclinical research, a research institution must apply for approval of a CTA before conducting clinical trials. According to the Decision of the CFDA on Adjusting the Approval Procedures of the Administrative Approval Items for Certain Drugs promulgated by the CFDA on March 17, 2017, the decision on the approval of clinical trials of drugs enacted by the CFDA can be made by the Center for Drug Evaluation of the CFDA, or the CDE in the name of the CFDA from May 1, 2017. In July 2018, the NMPA promulgated the Announcement on Adjusting Evaluation and Approval Procedures for Clinical Trials for Drugs, which further adjusted for those who apply for drug clinical trials in China, and stipulated that if an applicant does not receive any negative or questioning opinions from the CDE within sixty days after the date of accepting the application and the payment of the fee, drug clinical trials may be conducted in accordance with the plan being submitted.
According to the Provisions for Drug Registration (2020 Revision), a drug clinical trial consists of Phase I clinical trial, Phase II clinical trial, Phase III clinical trial, Phase IV clinical trial, and bioequivalence trial. Pursuant to the characteristics of a drug and the research purpose, the research contents shall include clinical pharmacological research, exploratory clinical trial, confirmatory clinical trial and post-marketing research. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the new Administrative Measures for Good Clinical Practice, which was promulgated by NMPA and NHC on April 23, 2020 and took effect on July 1, 2020, which also sets forth the requirements for conducting the clinical trial, including preparation of clinical trials, clinical trial protocol, duties of the sponsor and investigators and protection of the trial subjects. According to the Announcement on Adjusting Evaluation and Approval Procedures for Clinical Trials for Drugs issued by the NMPA on July 24, 2018, where the application for clinical trial of new drug has been approved, upon the completion of Phases I and II clinical trials and prior to Phase III clinical trial, the applicant shall submit the application for Communication Session to CDE to discuss with CDE the key technical questions including the design of Phase III clinical trial protocol.
 New Drug Application
According to the Provisions for Drug Registration (2020 Revision), upon completion of clinical trials, determination of quality standards, completion of validation of commercial-scale production processes, and preparation for acceptance of verification and inspection for drug registration, the applicant may apply to the NMPA for approval of a new drug application. The NMPA then determines whether to approve the application according to the comprehensive evaluation opinion provided by the CDE of the NMPA. We must obtain approval of a new drug application before our drugs can be manufactured and sold in the Chinese market.
Drug Manufacturing Permit and Good Manufacturing Practice
Pursuant to the PRC Drug Administration Law and its implementing measures, a drug manufacturer must obtain a Drug Manufacturing Permit from the local branch of the NMPA at provincial level before it starts to manufacture drug products. Prior to granting such permit, the relevant government authority will inspect the applicant’s production facilities, and decide whether the sanitary conditions, quality assurance system, management structure and equipment within the facilities have met the required standards. Each Drug Manufacturing Permit is valid for a period of five years and the manufacturer is required to apply for renewal of the permit within six months prior to its expiration date and will be subject to reassessment by the authority in accordance with then prevailing legal and regulatory requirements for the purposes of such renewal. All facilities and techniques used in the manufacture of

products for clinical use or for sale in China must be operated in conformity with GMP guidelines as established by the MOH and CFDA. GMP certification was no longer required from December 2019 and regular and random onsite checking and supervision will be implemented by the relevant authority. Failure to comply with applicable requirements could result in the termination of manufacturing and significant fines. The NMPA promulgated the Administration Measures for Drug Inspection (for Trial Implementation) in May 2021, which provides details of the onsite checking and inspection procedures and requirements after GMP certification was abolished.
 Animal Test Permits
According to Regulations for the Administration of Affairs Concerning Experimental Animals promulgated by the State Science and Technology Commission in November 1988, as revised in January 2011, July 2013, and March 2017, and Administrative Measures on the Certificate for Animal Experimentation (for Trial Implementation) promulgated by the State Science and Technology Commission and other regulatory authorities in December 2001, performing experimentation on animals requires a Certificate for Use of Laboratory Animals. Applicants must satisfy the following conditions:
•Laboratory animals must be qualified and sourced from institutions that have Certificates for Production of Laboratory Animals; 
 •The environment and facilities for the animals’ living and propagating must meet state requirements; 
 •The animals’ feed and water must meet state requirements; 
 •The animals’ feeding and experimentation must be conducted by professionals, specialized and skilled workers or other trained personnel; 
 •The management systems must be effective and efficient; and 
 •The applicable entity must follow other requirements as stipulated by the PRC laws and regulations. 
 Drug Registration Classification and Special Examination and Approval
According to the Provisions for Drug Registration (2007 Revision), drug registration applications are divided into three different types, namely Domestic New Drug Application, Domestic Generic Drug Application and Imported Drug Application. Drugs fall into one of three categories, namely chemical medicine, biological product or traditional Chinese or natural medicine. The registrations of chemical medicines are divided into six categories, among which, a Category 1 drug is a new drug that has never been marketed in any country. However, the Provisions for Drug Registration (2020 Revision) stipulated that drug registration shall be classified into several categories including traditional Chinese drugs, chemical drugs and biological drugs. Among them, the registration applications of chemical drugs shall be categorized by innovative chemical drugs, modified new chemical drugs, generic chemical drugs, etc.
 In March 2016, the CFDA promulgated the Work Plan for Reforming the Chemical Medicines Registration Classification System, under which, the registrations of chemical medicines are divided into five categories as follows:
Category 1: Innovative drugs that are not marketed both domestically and abroad. These drugs contain new compounds with clear structures and pharmacological effects, and they have clinical value.
Category 2: Modified new drugs that are not marketed both domestically and abroad. With known active components, the drug’s structure, phase, prescription manufacturing process, administration route and indication are optimized, and it has obvious clinical advantage.
Category 3: The drugs that are imitated by domestic applicants to original drugs that have been marketed abroad but not domestically. These kinds of drugs are supposed to have the same quality and effects with original drugs. Original drugs are the foremost drugs that are approved to be marketed domestically and /or abroad with complete and full safety and validity data as marketing evidence.
Category 4: The drugs that are imitated by domestic applicants to original drugs that have been marketed domestically. These kinds of drugs are supposed to have the same quality and effects with original drugs.
 Category 5: The drugs that have been marketed abroad are applied to be marketed domestically.
As a support policy and implementing rule of the Provisions for Drug Registration (2020 Revision), the NMPA issued the Chemical Drug Registration Classification and Application Data Requirements in June 2020, effective in July 2020, which reaffirmed the principles of the classification of chemical drugs set forth by the Work Plan for Reforming the Chemical Medicines Registration Classification System, and made minor adjustments to the subclassifications of Category 5. According to such regulation, Category 5.1 are innovative chemical drugs and improved new chemical drugs while Category 5.2 are generic chemical drugs, all of which shall have been already marketed abroad but not yet approved in China.

According to the Special Examination and Approval Provisions for New Drugs, the CFDA conducts special examination and approval for new drugs registration application when:
(1)active ingredients and their preparations extracted from plants, animals and minerals, and newly discovered medical materials and their preparations have not been marketed in China; 
 (2)the chemical raw material medicines as well as the preparations and biological products thereof have not been approved for marketing home and abroad 
 (3)the new drugs are for treating AIDS, malignant tumors and rare diseases, etc., and have obvious advantages in clinic treatment; or 
 (4)the new drugs are for treating diseases with no effective methods of treatment. 
 The Special Examination and Approval Provisions for New Drugs provide that the applicant may file for special examination and approval at the stage of Clinical Trial Application if the drug candidate falls within items (1) or (2), and for drug candidates that fall within items (3) or (4), the application for special examination and approval must be made when filing for production.
Adjustment on the Administration of Imported Drug Registration
On October 10, 2017, the CFDA promulgated the Decision on Adjusting Relevant Matters Concerning the Administration of Imported Drug Registration, effective as of the date of its promulgation, which stipulates that, among others, (1) simultaneous research and application are allowed, meaning that, in the case of a clinical trial concerning a drug subject thereto to be conducted at an international multi-center clinical trial (“IMCCT”) in China, Phase 1 clinical trials of the drug are allowed simultaneously, and the requirement that the drug subject to the clinical trial need to have been previously registered overseas or to have entered a Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trial shall not apply, except for preventative biological products; (2) the drug registration procedure is to be optimized, meaning that, upon the completion of a clinical trial at an IMCCT in China, an applicant may directly file a drug registration application and (3) for a new chemical drug or an innovative therapeutic biological drug for which a clinical trial or market registration is made, in each case as an imported drug, the requirement that such drug has received an overseas license issued by the country or region where the drug’s overseas pharmaceutical manufacturer is located shall not apply.
Changes to the Review and Approval Process
In August 2015, the State Council issued a statement, Opinions on Reforming the Review and Approval Process for Pharmaceutical Products and Medical Devices, which contained several potential policy changes that could benefit the pharmaceutical industry:
•A plan to accelerate innovative drug approval with a special review and approval process, with a focus on areas of high unmet medical needs, including drugs for HIV, cancer, serious infectious diseases, orphan diseases and drugs on national priority lists. 
 •A plan to adopt a policy which would allow companies to act as the marketing authorization holder and to hire contract manufacturing organizations to produce drug products. 
 •A plan to improve the review and approval of clinical trials, and to allow companies to conduct clinical trials at the same time as they are in other countries and encourage local clinical trial organizations to participate in international multi-center clinical trials. 
 In November 2015, the CFDA released the Circular Concerning Several Policies on Drug Registration Review and Approval, which further clarified the following policies potentially simplifying and accelerating the approval process of clinical trials:
•A one-time umbrella approval procedure allowing approval of all phases of a new drug’s clinical trials at once, rather than the current phase-by-phase approval procedure, will be adopted for new drugs’ CTAs. 
 •A fast track drug registration or clinical trial approval pathway will be available for the following applications: (1) registration of innovative new drugs treating HIV, cancer, serious infectious diseases and orphan diseases; (2) registration of pediatric drugs; (3) registration of geriatric drugs and drugs treating China-prevalent diseases; (4) registration of drugs sponsored by national science and technology grants; (5) registration of innovative drugs using advanced technology, using innovative treatment methods, or having distinctive clinical benefits; (6) registration of foreign innovative drugs to be manufactured locally in China; (7) concurrent applications for new drug clinical trials which are already approved in the U.S. or EU, or concurrent drug registration applications for drugs which have applied for marketing authorization and passed onsite inspections in the U.S. or EU and are manufactured using the same production line in China and (8) clinical trial applications for drugs with urgent clinical need and patent expiry within three years, and marketing authorization applications for drugs with urgent clinical need and patent expiry within one year. 


In March 2016, the CFDA issued the Interim Provisions on the Procedures for Drug Clinical Trial Data Verification that provides procedural rules for CFDA’s on-site verification of clinical data before drug approvals.
Also, in February 2016, the CFDA published the Opinions on Implementing a Prioritized Review System to Avoid Drug Review Backlogs, which introduces a prioritized review and approval pathway to clinical trial applications and registration applications of certain drugs as part of CFDA’s ongoing reform of its current drug review and approval system.
The CFDA issued the Procedures for Priority Examination and Approval of Medical Devices (Procedures) on October 25, 2016, which came into effect on January 1, 2017. The Procedures, composed of seventeen articles, specify that the priority in examination and approval shall be given, in relation to the applications of registering Class-III domestic, or Class-II and Class-III imported medical devices, when those applications fall within such categories as diagnosis or treatment of rare disease or malignant tumor with significant clinical advantage. According to the Procedures, the medical device technical evaluation center of the CFDA will tentatively decide on the applicants applying for their project given priority examination and approval, names of their products and the reception numbers and disclose such information on its website for a period of no less than five working days. The Procedures provide that for projects given priority in examination and approval, the medical device technical evaluation center shall communicate with applicants in an active way, as required by applicable provisions, in the course of evaluating relevant technologies and may arrange for special talks when necessary; food and drug administrative departments at provincial levels shall take the review of the registered quality management system of medical devices as priority and the CFDA will prioritize their administrative examination and approval.
In December 2017, the CFDA innovations promulgated the Opinions on Encouraging the Prioritized Evaluation and Approval for Drug, which abolished the Opinions on Implementing a Prioritized Review System to Avoid Drug Review Backlogs. The CFDA would prioritize the examination and approval on applications of new drugs in particular cases, including (1) applications of new drugs with significant clinical value satisfying particular conditions; (2) applications of new drugs with significant clinical advantages preventing or treating particular diseases and (3) other particular conditions.
According to the Announcement on Optimizing the Evaluation and Approval of Drug Registration promulgated by the NMPA and the NHC in May 2018, the Chinese government seeks to further simplify and accelerated the clinical trial approval process.
 The Provisions for Drug Registration (2020 Revision) has incorporated the previous reform in respect of the accelerated approval for clinical trial and drug marketing registration and introduces four procedures for expedited marketing registration of drugs, which are procedures for groundbreaking therapeutic drugs, procedures for conditional approval, procedures for prioritized reviews and approval, and procedures for special examination and approval:
 •Procedures for ground-breaking therapeutic drugs: during the drug clinical trials, for an innovative drug or improved new drug used for prevention and treatment of life-threatening illnesses or illnesses which have a serious impact on quality of life and for which there is no other effective prevention and treatment method or there is adequate evidence to prove that the said innovative drug or modified new drug has obvious clinical advantages over existing treatment approach, the applicant may request for application of procedures for ground-breaking therapeutic drugs.
 •Procedures for conditional approval: during the drug clinical trials, for drugs which fall under the following circumstances, an application for conditional approval of marketing registration may be submitted (i) for drugs for treatment of life threatening illnesses for which there is no effective treatment approach, the clinical trial of drugs already has data to prove efficacy and is able to forecast the clinical value; (ii) for drugs urgently needed for public health, the clinical trial of drugs already has data to prove efficacy and is able to forecast the clinical value; and (iii) for other vaccines urgently needed for major public health emergencies or deemed by the NHC to be urgently needed, its benefits outweigh the risks according to the evaluation.
 •Procedures for prioritized reviews and approval: at the time of the drug marketing registration, drugs have obvious clinical value may apply for application of procedures for prioritized review and approval, including (i) clinically and urgently needed but insufficient drug, innovative drugs and modified new drugs for prevention and treatment of major contagious diseases and rare diseases; (ii) new pharmaceutical product types, dosage form and specifications of pediatric drugs which comply with pediatric physiological characteristics; (iii) vaccines and innovative vaccines urgently needed for prevention and control of diseases; (iv) drug included in the procedures for ground-breaking therapeutic drug; (v) drug which comply with conditional approval criteria; and (vi) other circumstances of prioritized review stipulated by the NMPA.
 •Procedures for special examination and approval: at the time of a threat or occurrence of public health emergency, the NMPA may, in accordance with law, decide to implement special examination and approval for urgently needed drug required for the prevention and treatment during the public health emergency. Drug included in the special examination and approval procedures may, based on special needs of disease prevention and control, be restricted for use within a certain period and scope.
 On July 7, 2020, the NMPA promulgated the Announcement on Promulgating Three Documents Including the Working Procedures for the Evaluation of Breakthrough Therapy Designation Drugs (for Trial Implementation) and Priority Review and Approval Procedures for Drug Marketing Authorizations (for Trial Implementation), which abolished the Opinions on Encouraging

 On November 15, 2021, the CDE of the NMPA issued the Guiding Principles for Clinical Research and Development of Oncology Drugs Oriented by Clinical Value, which emphasized the clinical value-oriented and patient-centered concept during the whole research and development process of oncology drugs.
 PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and Its Implementation
According to the new PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law (the “EIT Law”), effective from January 1, 2008, and amended on February 24, 2017 and December 29, 2018, a uniform income tax rate of 25% is applied equally to domestic enterprises as well as foreign investment enterprises and permit certain High and New Technologies Enterprises (“HNTEs”) to enjoy preferential enterprise income tax rates subject to these HNTEs meeting certain qualification criteria.
The EIT Law and its implementation rules provide that a withholding tax at the rate of 10% is applicable to dividends and other distributions payable by a PRC resident enterprise to investors who are “non-resident enterprises” (that do not have an establishment or place of business in China, or that have such establishment or place of business but the relevant dividend or other distribution is not effectively connected with the establishment or place of business). However, pursuant to the Arrangement between the Mainland and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income effective on December 8, 2006, the withholding tax rate for dividends paid by a Chinese resident enterprise is 5% if the Hong Kong enterprise owns at least 25% of the capital of the Chinese enterprise; otherwise, the dividend withholding tax rate is 10%. According to the Notice of the State Taxation Administration of the PRC (the “STA”) on Issues relating to the Administration of the Dividend Provision in Tax Treaties promulgated on February 20, 2009 and effective on the same day, the corporate recipient of dividends distributed by Chinese enterprises must satisfy the direct ownership thresholds at all times during the twelve consecutive months preceding the receipt of the dividends. The STA promulgated the Notice on Certain Issues of the “Beneficial Owner” in Tax Treaties on February 2, 2018. Pursuant to these regulations and the Administrative Measures for Treaty Treatment for Non-Resident Taxpayers promulgated by the STA in October 2019 and effective from January 1, 2020, non-resident enterprises are required to file information sheets to the competent tax authorities in order to enjoy the favorable treatments under the treaties. However, the relevant tax authorities may check and verify at their discretion, and if a company is deemed to be a pass-through entity rather than a qualified owner of benefits, it cannot enjoy the favorable tax treatments provided in the tax arrangement. In addition, if transactions or arrangements are deemed by the relevant tax authorities to be entered into mainly for the purpose of enjoying favorable tax treatments under the tax arrangement, such favorable tax treatments may be subject to adjustment by the relevant tax authorities in the future.
Pursuant to the Announcement on Continuation of Enterprise Income Tax Policies for Extensive Development in the Western Region issued by the Ministry of Finance (the “MOF”), the STA and the National Development and Reform Commission (the “NDRC”) and effective from January 1, 2021, which partially replaced the Notice on the Relevant Tax Policies for the Implementation of the Strategy of Extensive Development of the Western Regions, under which from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2030, a reduced enterprise income tax rate of 15% is applicable to the enterprises set up in the western regions as designated by the relevant PRC regulations with their main business in the encouraged industries. The encouraged industries are those listed in the Catalog of Encouraged Industries in the Western Regions as promulgated by NDRC. To qualify for the reduced tax rate, an enterprise must derive 60% or more of its revenue from the business listed in the Catalog of Encouraged Industries in the Western Regions.
Regulations Relating to Business Tax and Value-added Tax
 Pursuant to the Temporary Regulations on Business Tax, which were promulgated by the State Council on December 13, 1993 and effective on January 1, 1994, as amended on November 10, 2008 and effective January 1, 2009, any entity or individual conducting business in a service industry is generally required to pay business tax at the rate of 5% on the revenues generated from providing such services.
In November 2011, the MOF and the STA promulgated the Pilot Plan for Imposition of Value-Added Tax to Replace Business Tax (“Pilot Plan”). Since January 2012, the STA has been implementing the Pilot Plan, which imposes value-added tax (“VAT”) in lieu of business tax for certain industries in Shanghai. The Pilot Plan was expanded to other regions, including Beijing, in September

2012 and was further expanded nationwide beginning August 1, 2013. VAT is applicable at a rate of 6% in lieu of business taxes for certain services, and 17% for the sale of goods and provision of tangible property lease services. VAT payable on goods sold or taxable services provided by a general VAT taxpayer for a taxable period is the net balance of the output VAT for the period after crediting the input VAT for the period. In March 2016, the MOF and STA jointly issued the Notice on Adjustment of Transfer Business Tax to Value Added Tax effective from May 2016, according to which PRC tax authorities have started imposing VAT on revenues from various service sectors, including real estate, construction, financial services and insurance as well as other lifestyle service sectors, replacing the business tax.
On November 19, 2017, the Temporary Regulations on Business Tax was abolished and the Interim Regulations of the People’s Republic of China on Value Added Tax was revised by the State Council. According to the revised Interim Regulations of the People’s Republic of China on Value Added Tax, selling goods, providing labor services of processing, repairs or maintenance, or selling services, intangible assets or real property in the PRC, or importing goods to the PRC, shall be subject to value added tax. According to a notice jointly issued by MOF and STA in April 2018, starting from May 1, 2018, the VAT rate will be lowered from 17% to 16% for manufacturing and certain other industries, and from 11% to 10% for transportation, construction, real estate leasing service, sale of real estate, basic telecommunication services and farm produce. According to a notice jointly issued by MOF, STA and the General Administration of Customs in March 2019, from April 1, 2019, the value-added tax rate of 16% will be further lowered to 13% and the value-added tax rate of 10% will be further lowered to 9%.
 Regulations Relating to Environmental Protection
China has adopted extensive environmental laws and regulations with national and local standards for emissions control, discharge of wastewater and storage and transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials. At the national level, the relevant environmental protection laws and regulations include the PRC Environmental Protection Law, the PRC Law on the Prevention and Control of Air Pollution, the PRC Law on the Prevention and Control of Water Pollution, the PRC Law on the Promotion of Clean Production, the PRC Law on the Prevention and Control of Noise Pollution, the PRC Law on the Prevention and Control of Solid Waste Pollution, the PRC Recycling Economy Promotion Law, the PRC Law on Environmental Impact Assessment, the Environmental Protection Tax Law and its implementation rules, and Regulations on the Administration of Pollutant Discharge Permits. In recent years, the PRC Government has introduced a series of new policies designed to generally promote the protection of the environment. For instance, on November 10, 2016, the General Office of the State Council has released the Implementing Plan for the Permit System for Controlling the Discharge of Pollutants (Plan). The Plan proposes the need of instituting a system for enterprises and public institutions to control their respective total amount of pollutants discharged, which shall be connected with the environmental impact assessment system organically. The Plan also stipulates that it is necessary to regulate the orderly issuance of pollutant discharge permits, to make a name list to manage the permission of pollutant discharge, to promote the administration of such permission system per industry and to impose severer administration and control over enterprises and public institutions located at such places where environment quality fails to reach relevant standards. Furthermore, the Plan requires that a national pollutant discharge permit management information platform shall be established by 2017 to strengthen the information disclosure and social supervision.
Regulations Relating to Foreign Exchange and Dividend Distribution
Foreign Exchange Regulation
The Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations, most recently amended in August 2008, are the principal regulations governing foreign currency exchange in China. Under the PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, such as profit distributions and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, may be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (“SAFE”) by complying with certain procedural requirements. In contrast, approval from or registration with appropriate government authorities is required when RMB is converted into a foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of foreign currency-denominated loans.
In November 2012, SAFE promulgated the Circular of Further Improving and Adjusting Foreign Exchange Administration Policies on Foreign Direct Investment (“SAFE Circular 59”), which has been partially repealed and revised. SAFE Circular 59 substantially amends and simplifies the foreign exchange procedure. Pursuant to SAFE Circular 59, the opening of various special purpose foreign exchange accounts, such as pre-establishment expenses accounts, foreign exchange capital accounts and guarantee accounts, the reinvestment of RMB proceeds by foreign investors in China, and remittance of foreign exchange profits and dividends by a foreign-invested enterprise to its foreign shareholders no longer require the approval or verification of SAFE, and multiple capital accounts for the same entity may be opened in different provinces, which was not previously possible. In addition, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Printing and Distributing the Provisions on Foreign Exchange Administration over Domestic Direct Investment by Foreign Investors and the Supporting Documents in May 2013, which specifies that the administration by the SAFE or its local branches over direct investment by foreign investors in China will be conducted by way of registration, and banks must process foreign exchange business relating to the direct investment in China based on the registration information provided by SAFE and its branches.

Under the Circular of the SAFE on Further Improving and Adjusting the Policies for Foreign Exchange Administration under Capital Accounts promulgated on January 10, 2014 and effective from February 10, 2014, administration over the outflow of the profits by domestic institutions has been further simplified. In principle, a bank is no longer required to examine transaction documents when handling the outflow of profits of no more than the equivalent of $50,000 by a domestic institution. When handling the outflow of profits exceeding the equivalent of $50,000, the bank, in principle, is no longer required to examine the financial audit report and capital verification report of the domestic institution, provided that it must examine, according to the principle of transaction authenticity, the profit distribution resolution of the board of directors (or the profit distribution resolution of the partners) relating to this profit outflow and the original copy of its tax record-filing form. After each profit outflow, the bank must affix its seal to and endorsements on the original copy of the relevant tax record-filing form to indicate the actual amount of the profit outflow and the date of the outflow.
On March 30, 2015, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Reforming the Management Approach regarding the Settlement of Foreign Exchange Capital of Foreign-invested Enterprises (“SAFE Circular 19”), which became effective on June 1, 2015. According to SAFE Circular 19, the foreign exchange capital of foreign-invested enterprises may be settled on a discretionary basis, meaning that the foreign exchange capital in the capital account of a foreign-invested enterprise for which the rights and interests of monetary contribution has been confirmed by the local foreign exchange bureau (or the book-entry registration of monetary contribution by the banks) can be settled at the banks based on the actual operational needs of the foreign-invested enterprise. The proportion of such discretionary settlement is temporarily determined as 100%. The RMB converted from the foreign exchange capital will be kept in a designated account, and if a foreign-invested enterprise needs to make further payment from such account, it still must provide supporting documents and go through the review process with the banks.
Furthermore, SAFE Circular 19 stipulates that the use of capital by foreign-invested enterprises must adhere to the principles of authenticity and self-use within the business scope of enterprises. The capital of a foreign-invested enterprise and capital in RMB obtained by the foreign-invested enterprise from foreign exchange settlement must not be used for the following purposes:
(1)directly or indirectly used for the payment beyond the business scope of the enterprises or the payment prohibited by relevant laws and regulations; 
 (2)directly or indirectly used for investment in securities, unless otherwise provided by relevant laws and regulations; 
 (3)directly or indirectly used for granting the entrusted loans in RMB, unless permitted by the scope of business, repaying the inter-enterprise borrowing (including advances by the third party), or repaying the bank loans in RMB that have been sub-lent to the third party; and/or 
 (4)paying the expenses related to the purchase of real estate that is not for self-use, except for the foreign-invested real estate enterprises. 
 On June 9, 2016, SAFE issued the Notice to Reform and Regulate the Administration Policies of Foreign Exchange Capital Settlement to further reform foreign exchange capital settlement nationwide.
 On October 23, 2019, SAFE issued Circular of the SAFE on Further Promoting the Facilitation of Cross-border Trade and Investment, or the Circular 28, which took effect on the same day. Circular 28 allows non-investment foreign-invested enterprises to use their capital funds to make equity investments in China, with genuine investment projects and in compliance with effective foreign investment restrictions and other applicable laws.
 Our PRC subsidiaries’ distributions to the offshore parent and carrying out cross-border foreign exchange activities shall comply with the various SAFE registration requirements described above.
Share Option Rules
Under the Administration Measures on Individual Foreign Exchange Control issued by the People’s Bank of China on December 25, 2006, all foreign exchange matters involved in employee share ownership plans and share option plans in which Chinese citizens participate require approval from SAFE or its authorized branch. In addition, under the Notices on Issues concerning the Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Share Incentive Plans of Overseas Publicly-Listed Companies, commonly known as SAFE Circular 7, or Share Option Rules, issued by the SAFE on February 15, 2012, Chinese residents who are granted shares or share options by companies listed on overseas stock exchanges under share incentive plans are required to (1) register with the SAFE or its local branches; (2) retain a qualified Chinese agent, which may be a PRC subsidiary of the overseas listed company or another qualified institution selected by the PRC subsidiary, to conduct the SAFE registration and other procedures with respect to the share incentive plans on behalf of the participants and (3) retain an overseas institution to handle matters in connection with their exercise of share options, purchase and sale of shares or interests and funds transfers.
 In addition, the STA has issued certain circulars concerning employee share options or restricted shares, including the Circular of the STA on Issues Concerning Individual Income Tax in Relation to Share Options, promulgated in August 2009. Under these circulars, the employees working in China who exercise share options or are granted restricted shares will be subject to PRC individual income tax. The PRC subsidiaries of such overseas listed companies have obligations to file documents related to employee

share options or restricted shares with relevant tax authorities and to withhold individual income taxes of those employees who exercise their share options. If the employees fail to pay or the PRC subsidiaries fail to withhold their income taxes in accordance with relevant laws and regulations, the PRC subsidiaries may face fines or sanctions imposed by tax authorities or other PRC government authorities.
Regulation of Dividend Distribution
The principal laws, rules and regulations governing dividend distribution by foreign-invested enterprises in China are the Company Law of China, as amended, and the Foreign Investment Law, which took effect on January 1, 2020 and replaced the Wholly Foreign-owned Enterprise Law, the Cooperative Joint Venture Law, and the Equity Joint Venture Law. Under these laws, rules and regulations, foreign-invested enterprises may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profit, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Both PRC domestic companies and wholly-foreign owned PRC enterprises are required to allocate at least 10% of their respective accumulated after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund certain capital reserve funds until the aggregate amount of these reserve funds have reached 50% of the registered capital of the enterprises. A PRC company is not permitted to distribute any profits until any losses from prior fiscal years have been offset. Profits retained from prior fiscal years may be distributed together with distributable profits from the current fiscal year.
Labor Laws and Social Insurance
Pursuant to the PRC Labor Law and the PRC Labor Contract Law, employers must execute written labor contracts with full-time employees. All employers must comply with local minimum wage standards. Violations of the PRC Labor Contract Law and the PRC Labor Law may result in the imposition of fines and other administrative and criminal liability in the case of serious violations.
 In addition, according to the PRC Social Insurance Law, employers like our PRC subsidiaries in China must provide employees with welfare schemes covering pension insurance, unemployment insurance, maternity insurance, work-related injury insurance, and medical insurance and housing funds.
Rest of the World Regulation
For other countries outside of the U.S. and China, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, drug licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles having their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
