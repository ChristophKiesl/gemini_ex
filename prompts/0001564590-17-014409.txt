ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 Taxus Cardium was incorporated in Delaware in December 2003. We are an operating company that manages a medical technologies portfolio of equity-based and potential royalty-driven investments as follows: (1) Angionetics, currently a majority-owned subsidiary focused on the late-stage clinical development and commercialization of Generx™, an angiogenic gene therapy product candidate designed for medical revascularization for the potential treatment of patients with myocardial ischemia and refractory angina due to advanced coronary artery disease; (2) Activation Therapeutics, a wholly owned subsidiary focused on the development and commercialization of the Excellagen® technology platform, an FDA-cleared flowable dermal matrix for advanced wound care that we believe has broad potential applications as a delivery platform for small molecule drugs, proteins and biologics; (3) LifeAgain a wholly-owned subsidiary that has developed an advanced medical data analytics (ADAPT®) technology platform focused on developing new and innovative products for the life insurance and healthcare sectors; and (4) a minority investment in Healthy Brands Collective, a functional food and nutraceutical company which acquired the Company’s To Go Brands® business.
 Our business is focused on the acquisition and strategic development of product opportunities or businesses having the potential to address significant unmet medical needs, and having definable pathways to commercialization. Our business model is designed to create a portfolio of opportunities for success, avoiding reliance on any single technology platform or product type. We focus on late-stage product development bridging the critical gap between promising new technologies and product opportunities that are ready for commercialization. As our product opportunities and businesses are advanced and corresponding valuations established, we intend to consider various corporate development transactions designed to place our product candidates into larger organizations or with partners having existing commercialization, sales and marketing resources, and a need for innovative products. Such transactions could involve the sale, partnering or other monetization of particular product opportunities or businesses.
 Business Strategy
 We are currently focused on achieving milestones with the potential to offer significant valuation inflection points of our core biotechnology assets, while evaluating options for sales or other monetization of our non-core investments. The key elements of our business strategy include: 

• | Continue Angionetics’ development and commercialization of Generx™, an angiogenic, gene-based biotherapeutic designed for the treatment patients who have late-stage coronary artery disease and refractory angina and other ischemic heart disorders and medical conditions, including support in the funding and operation of the AFFIRM U.S.-based Phase 3 clinical trial.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Monetize Activation Therapeutics’ FDA-cleared pharmaceutically formulated collagen commercial wound care product Excellagen® through either a sale of Activation Therapeutics or its assets or the establishment of strategic partnership for the sale and distribution of Excellagen in selected U.S.-based vertical market channels.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage Excellagen’s advanced regenerative medicine delivery platform by identifying innovative product extensions for tissue regeneration based on stem cells (including exosomes), biologics, peptides and/or small molecule drugs for future development and commercialization with one or more strategic partners.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Identify a new insurance partner and seek opportunities for the application LifeAgain’s Medical analytics to commercialize “Survivable risk” term life insurance for cancer survivors or others with medical conditions who are currently considered uninsurable based on traditional under writing standards as well as other forms of survivable risk programs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | With the successful monetization of current business interests, we plan to redeploy capital strategically to acquire and develop new and innovative medicine product candidates and create shareholder value.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have yet to generate positive cash flows from operations, and are dependent on equity and debt funding to finance our operations.  We intend to raise capital to finance the operations of Angionetics through a sale of equity in that entity.  Alternatively, we are seeking to raise sufficient capital to finance our operations through the sale of equity or assets in our investments in Activation Therapeutics, LifeAgain and Healthy Brands Collective.  If we fail to complete a financing or conclude such a transaction in a timely manner, we will not generate sufficient cash flows to cover our operating expenses. Our history of recurring losses and uncertainties as to whether our operations will become profitable raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated

financial statements contained in this report do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability of assets or classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.
 Angionetics Inc. (Generx™)
 Angionetics is a majority-owned subsidiary established to hold our Generx™ angiogenic gene therapy product candidate.
 Generx™ has been under clinical development for over a decade, under the continual oversight of our highly experienced management team.  Our management and consulting team have been responsible for the development of Generx from the initial scientific discoveries by researchers at the University of California, San Diego, through the first in-man U.S.-based clinical studies and late stage clinical studies, the acquisition of the Generx development program by Schering AG following the successful completion of a five-year strategic partnership, and the re-acquisition of the Generx development program by Taxus Cardium after Schering AG was acquired by Bayer Healthcare.  Collectively, Angionetics’ small and highly focused management team has over 100 years of experience in the fields of gene therapy, cardiovascular product development and biologics.
 On September 9, 2016, the U.S. FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) cleared Angionetics’ AFFIRM Phase 3 clinical study protocol, thus allowing Angionetics to proceed with late-stage clinical evaluation of GenerxTM.  The AFFIRM study patient population and trial design are based on Ad5FGF-4 responder data from the four prior FDA-cleared clinical studies.  The primary efficacy endpoint is improvement in exercise treadmill test (ETT) duration in GenerxTM -treated patients compared to a placebo control group.  Enrolled patients must have refractory angina, documented clinical evidence of myocardial ischemia, clinically significant limitation of physical activity due to angina, and angina-limited ETT duration of 3-7 minutes.
 On February 3, 2017, Angionetics received notice that the FDA has granted Fast Track designation for the Phase 3 clinical investigation of Generx [Ad5FGF-4] cardiovascular angiogenic gene therapy as a one-time treatment for improving exercise tolerance in patients who have angina that is refractory to standard medical therapy and not amenable to conventional revascularization procedures (coronary artery bypass surgery and percutaneous coronary intervention and stents).  Under the FDA Modernization Act of 1997, designation as a Fast Track product means that FDA will take actions, as appropriate, to expedite the development and review of a biologics license application (BLA) for product approval. The FDA’s Fast Track process is designed to facilitate clinical and commercial development and expedite the review of new drugs and biologics that are intended to treat serious conditions that demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need. 
 After over two decades of basic, pre-clinical and clinical research in the field of gene therapy by universities, research institutes, as well as pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies worldwide, Angionetics’ Generx represents one of only a few cardiovascular DNA-based therapeutic product candidates to successfully advance into late-stage, U.S. Phase 3 clinical study. Our primary business focus is securing the additional capital that we will need to finance the completion of the AFFIRM study.  We estimate that we will need an additional $25 to $50 million in additional capital to complete that study.  We plan to secure that capital through the sale of additional equity or debt securities in that entity. There are no agreements or arrangement for any additional financing in place at this time.
 The Generx™ Product Candidate:  
 Generx™ is a disease-modifying, precision medicine that is designed to improve cardiac perfusion (blood flow) in patients with chronic myocardial ischemia and refractory angina due to advanced coronary artery disease. In our clinical studies, enhanced cardiac perfusion is expected to improve exercise capacity, reduce the frequency of angina (chest pain) attacks and correspondingly reduce the need for certain anti-anginal drugs, and improve overall cardiovascular disease status. Generx has been designed to improve perfusion by promoting the formation of functional coronary collateral blood vessels within the heart. This process, termed “medical revascularization,” represents a fundamentally new mechanism of action that involves the stimulation of the formation of new biological structures in the heart, through arteriogenesis (enlargement of existing arterioles) and angiogenesis (formation on new capillary vessels), as opposed to currently available pharmacologic therapies which only address the symptoms of angina.  
 The Generx product candidate is designed to easily fit within the current practice of medicine, as a ready-to-use, one-time treatment, which is administered by interventional cardiologists using standard cardiac balloon catheters, during an approximately one-hour, out-patient, angiogram-like procedure conducted on a non-acute basis, in a hospital or medical center catheter lab setting.  Interim study results demonstrate effectiveness similar to that of bypass surgery or stents, but in a significantly less costly and less invasive procedure.
 Addressable Market:
 Patients experiencing “refractory angina”--chronic and disabling stable angina despite conventional forms of treatment represent a significant and rapidly growing, “no option” patient population.  According to the 2016 American Heart Association report, there are approximately 15.5 million Americans with coronary artery disease, 50% of whom have symptomatic angina pectoris. Many of these patients (1) have coronary artery disease that is not limited or localized to large vessels, (2) continue to experience angina after coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) or percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), and/or (3) are not suitable candidates for surgical 
 
-5-



interventions.  Based on a study from the Cleveland Clinic [Mukherjee et al., Am J Cardiol. 1999; 84:598-600], it is estimated that approximately 12% of patients with angina due to coronary artery disease are considered not suitable for CABG or PCI. 
 For many patients, there are few treatment options for refractory angina, and currently available alternative therapies do not directly address the reversible, stress-induced perfusion defects responsible for refractory angina. We believe that the Generx angiogenic gene therapy product candidate represents a new and innovative biological tool for the interventional cardiologist and potentially a breakthrough therapy for this very substantial unmet market segment, and for multiple small and orphan medical indications that currently have no specific therapeutic products.
 We estimate that there are approximately 1.0 million patients in the U.S. with refractory angina who may benefit from Generx angiogenic gene therapy, and that the potential addressable market is estimated to range from $3.0 billion in the U.S. and up to $20.0 billion worldwide.
 Generx Clinical Studies and FDA developments:
 The Generx FDA regulatory dossier represents one of the most extensive and advanced DNA-based clinical data platforms ever compiled.  Generx has been evaluated as a treatment for patients with refractory angina in four prior FDA-cleared, multi-center, randomized and placebo-controlled clinical studies (AGENT 1-4, Phase 1/2 to Phase 2b/3) and one small international study (ASPIRE).  The combined AGENT studies have enrolled over 650 patients at over 100 medical centers in the U.S. and Western Europe, and have generated over 2,500 patient years of safety data.
 In these multiple prior clinical studies, the Generx product candidate appeared safe and well-tolerated, and has generated preliminary findings of efficacy in men and women, in measures of cardiac perfusion, cardiac performance, and angina status, including: (1) significant improvement in exercise duration by Exercise Treadmill Testing (ETT); (2) significant improvement in cardiac perfusion as assessed by SPECT imaging, with observed improvements comparable in magnitude to those seen with coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) and angioplasty with the use of stents (PCI); (3) significant and durable improvement in physical exertion capacity, as assessed by functional classification of angina out to 12 months post-treatment; (4) improvement in angina status, as assessed by documented reduction in angina episodes and nitroglycerin usage; and (5) significant reduction in incidence of worsening angina.
 Generx Technology Platform:
 The Generx™ [Ad5FGF-4] angiogenic gene therapy product candidate requires three key elements: a myocardial delivery vector; a therapeutic transgene; and methods of gene delivery. Generx is biologically engineered using an E1-region deleted, replication deficient adenovirus serotype 5 vector to deliver the 621 base pair gene encoding human fibroblast growth factor-4 (FGF-4) under the control of a modified cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. Adenovirus is the most well-characterized and widely used gene therapy vector in human clinical studies, and has cGMP manufacturing and testing standards established by the FDA. The Generx FGF-4 transgene has been engineered to include a signal peptide, which enables effective secretion from cells that express the protein (such as cardiac myocytes).  Our preclinical studies have shown that therapeutic efficacy is significantly increased by the presence of such a signal sequence in the growth factor DNA construct. [Gao et al., Hum Gene Ther. 2005; 16:1058-64] The CMV promoter is capable of driving high levels of transgene protein expression in transfected cells for up to 3 weeks.  This short-term expression is ideal for tissue regeneration clinical applications requiring generation of new biological structures, including promotion of new vessel growth in the heart.
 Identifying the optimal route of administration and delivery parameters for Generx angiogenic gene therapy, such as infusion volume, flow rate, vector concentration and dose, are critical to achieving safe and effective levels of vector uptake and FGF-4 transgene expression. We have developed clinically feasible protocols that fit within current medical practice and that are designed to yield reproducible results and reduce inter-patient variability. Generx is administered by an interventional cardiologist into the coronary arteries under transient ischemic conditions through the use of a standard balloon catheter.  Generx is distributed into the microvascular pathways of the heart, and transfects cardiac cells by binding to cell surface coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptors (CAR). CAR receptors are found throughout the heart, and our research indicates that the binding of Generx to CAR receptors is enhanced by the induction of transient ischemia and the use of agents like nitroglycerin to boost cell permeability during administration.
 The transfected heart cells then express and release FGF-4 protein, which promotes the growth of new blood vessels and increased blood flow to ischemic heart tissue.  Recent Company-sponsored research studies have demonstrated that FGF appears to be a key angiogenic regulatory protein that stimulates the release and action of other angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factors (PDGF), and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), to orchestrate and promote the growth of a functional collateral network in ischemic cardiac tissue. The evidence shows that FGF-4 expressed by Ad5FGF-4 has the capacity to enlarge pre-existing collateral arterioles (arteriogenesis) and to form new capillary vessels (angiogenesis) when driven by cardiac hemodynamic-impairment and ischemic stimuli.  These studies have further demonstrated a synergistic interaction between FGF-4 expressed by Ad5FGF-4, and endogenous vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the promotion of neo-vessel formation, with evidence that FGF controls angiogenesis upstream of VEGF.

Commercialization Developments: 
 Angionetics has continued to refine and advance Generx clinical and commercial development, summarized as follows:
  
• | New Pre-Clinical Research on Ad5 Receptor. The Company and its research collaborators at Emory University completed in vivo preclinical studies demonstrating that intracoronary Ad5-based gene delivery under conditions of transient ischemia enhances transgene expression in the heart by over two orders of magnitude (>100 fold), as compared to prior intracoronary delivery methods, likely due to ischemia-driven up regulation of the cardiac Coxsackievirus-Adenovirus Receptor (CAR) and enhanced Ad5-mediated gene transfer.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | New Delivery Techniques & Higher Dose Level. The completion of further international clinical research confirmed recent innovations covering the use of a balloon catheter and transient ischemia during Generx delivery to improve efficacy responses by leveraging pre-conditioning cardiac physiology and our enhanced understanding of cell surface receptor-mediated uptake. This clinical study also confirmed the safety and efficacy of a new higher single dose level of Ad5FGF-4. Both the new catheter delivery techniques and higher dose level have been integrated into the recently FDA-cleared U.S.-based Phase 3 AFFIRM clinical study protocol. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | New Fundamental Research on FGF Signaling. Company-sponsored research studies have demonstrated that fibroblast growth factor (FGF) appears to be a key angiogenic regulatory protein that stimulates the release and action of other angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factors (PDGF), and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), to orchestrate and promote the growth of cardiac microvasculature (a functional collateral network) in ischemic cardiac tissue.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | New Clinical Data Analytics to Identify Generx Responders. Angionetics has completed an advanced analysis of patient data from prior clinical studies to characterize male and female patient responders and those who are expected to have the highest likelihood to benefit from Generx angiogenic gene therapy. Data from a pilot International study which employed the new transient-ischemia Generx delivery protocol, identified statistically significant improvement in myocardial perfusion, as measured using SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging in patients treated with a single dose of Generx compared to control, which was consistent and confirmatory of findings from a prior FDA-cleared Phase 2 study. In addition to myocardial ischemia, likely responders have been characterized as having significant limitation of functional/exercise capacity due to angina. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | New Simplified Handling Process for Generx. Angionetics has pioneered application of the Becton Dickinson PhaSeal Closed System Transfer Device for DNA-based products to simplify the handling of Generx within the medical center and hospital pharmacy and interventional cardiology catheter labs, and has integrated use of the PhaSeal system into the FDA-cleared Generx AFFIRM Phase 3 clinical study protocol.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Angionetics is committed to applying our first-mover scientific and clinical development leadership position in the field of angiogenic gene therapy for the treatment of patients with a variety of cardiovascular conditions which are related by insufficient cardiac perfusion.

 On September 12, 2016, Angionetics announced that the U.S. FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) had cleared the Generx® product candidate for Phase 3 clinical study as a new, single dose, treatment for patients with myocardial ischemia and refractory angina due to advanced coronary artery disease (the AFFIRM study). Angionetics plans to apply for FDA Fast Track status for the Generx Phase 3 AFFIRM clinical study.  The FDA Fast Track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria.
 After over two decades of basic, pre-clinical and clinical research in the field of gene therapy by universities, research institutes, as well as pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies worldwide, Angionetics’ Generx represents one of only a few cardiovascular DNA-based therapeutic product candidates to successfully advance into late-stage, U.S. Phase 3 clinical study. 
 Activation Therapeutics Inc. (Excellagen®)
 Activation Therapeutics is a wholly-owned subsidiary established to hold and manage our assets related to the Excellagen® product and technology platform.  
 We are looking to monetize Excellagen through the sale of Activation Therapeutics or the technology.  Alternatively, we have sought strategic partners to market and sell Excellagen in the United States and elsewhere through multiple marketing channels. We have been in discussions with parties expressing interest in purchasing the business, however, as of the date of this report, such discussions have not resulted in a completed monetization or strategic partnering transaction. We cannot guarantee that it will accept an offer to purchase the Excellagen business or that any such bona fide offer will be made on acceptable terms and conditions. 
 Without a strategic partner, we do not plan to build inventory or establish an internal marketing and sales force to directly support the commercialization of Excellagen.
 Excellagen® Dermal Wound Matrix: 
 Excellagen has been engineered to activate and promote wound healing through the growth of granulation tissue.  Excellagen is a flowable homogenate of highly purified bovine dermal collagen (Type I) in its native 3-dimensional fibrillar configuration. 
 Excellagen was cleared by FDA via the 510(k) pathway on October 3, 2011 (K110318) for the treatment of chronic dermal wounds including partial and full thickness wounds, pressure ulcers, venous ulcers, diabetic ulcers, chronic vascular ulcers, tunneled/undermined wounds, surgical wounds (donor sites/grafts, post-Moh's surgery, post-laser surgery, podiatric, wound dehiscence), trauma wounds (abrasions, lacerations, second-degree burns, and skin tears) and draining wounds. Excellagen has been classified for reimbursement purposes by the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services as a unique “skin substitute”-- a designation which is consistent with other forms of skin substitutes including living skin equivalents Dermagraft® and Apligraf® and human dermal and amnion placental tissue-based products including Graftjacket® and EpiFix®.
 The Excellagen manufacturing process includes steps by which purified full-length Type I collagen molecules are reassembled into collagen’s native, staggered fibrillar configuration. Scanning electron microscopy has demonstrated Excellagen’s 3-dimensional scaffold structure and histological analysis of Excellagen-treated dermal wounds demonstrates efficient infiltration with fibroblasts, and development of patent blood vessels. Excellagen activates human platelets resulting in release of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Excellagen’s ability to activate platelets is functional/biological evidence of its 3-dimensional fibrillar structure, as it has been demonstrated that this structure (as opposed to monomeric or denatured collagen) is required for effective platelet activation.
 Excellagen is a cost-effective, easy to use, professional product that is conveniently packaged in prefilled, syringes with accessory flexible applicator tips. Excellagen is topically applied in a thin layer directly to the entire wound surface, providing a structural scaffold for cellular infiltration and wound granulation. The flowable format allows immediate, intimate contact with the entire wound surface, including highly contoured wounds, and can also be easily applied to areas of undermining or tunneling. The wound is first prepared by performing sharp debridement using standard methods to remove debris and necrotic tissue, and then Excellagen should be applied in the presence of a small influx of blood. Application of Excellagen in the presence of a small influx of blood cells and platelets likely contributes to its support of a favorable wound healing environment by triggering immediate, localized release of PDGF and other platelet-derived growth factors and cytokines, providing wound healing cues to the responsive cells exposed by debridement. After application, the treated wound is overlaid with a non-adherent dressing. The treated wound (including non-adherent
 dressing) is left undisturbed for one week to allow Excellagen to promote new granulation tissue growth. If the wound is not completely healed, Excellagen may be reapplied weekly.

Excellagen Clinical Studies and FDA approval: 
 Excellagen was studied in a multi-center, randomized, controlled, double-blinded Phase 2b study in patients with diagnosed diabetes (Type I or II) with non-healing ulcers of the lower extremity (with no bone or tendon exposed) that had failed prior therapy, that were present for at least 6 weeks, and were documented to be non-healing (≤ 30% decrease in ulcer area) during a 2-week run-in period under standard of care treatment (debridement, daily saline-moistened gauze, and off-loading). The study control included the conventional Standard of Care or “SOC”; daily saline-moistened gauze dressing changes, offloading, and sharp debridement.  Excellagen was applied only once (day 1) or twice (day 1 and week 4), with offloading and weekly outer dressing changes.
 After the 12 week study period, 45% percent of the patients treated with Excellagen (n=31) achieved complete wound closure.  This was a 45% relative improvement over wounds treated with SOC therapy alone (n=16; 31% closure incidence). There was a 68% relative improvement with Excellagen for wounds achieving 90-100% area reduction during the 12-week evaluation period. In other words, 74% of wounds receiving only one or two applications of Excellagen achieved ≥90% area reduction compared with only 44% of patients receiving daily SOC. The improvement seen with Excellagen compared to SOC was even more dramatic for larger wounds. For wounds that were larger than three centimeters squared, 33% of wounds treated only once or twice with Excellagen achieved complete wound closure at 12 weeks whereas none of the SOC-treated wounds closed.
 In the clinical study, Excellagen was applied to wounds only once or twice (with the second application four weeks after the first).  Excellagen’s FDA clearance and the instructions for use suggest weekly application such that the accelerated healing and granulation tissue development observed in the Phase 2b study can be sustained, potentially further enhancing and accelerating the healing response.  This schedule of weekly application has been followed in post-marketing use with positive reports of rapid, robust granulation tissue formation in chronic diabetic foot ulcers and pressure ulcers that have failed prior therapies.
 Excellazome™ Advanced Wound Care Biologics Research:  
 We believe that Excellagen also represents a unique platform technology for the delivery of biologics for use in regenerative medicine applications. Prior research by Taxus Cardium and its collaborators has demonstrated biocompatibility and functionality of viral-based gene therapies and stem cell biologics when delivered in Excellagen. In addition to DNA- and stem cell-based biologics, Excellagen provides a potential enabling delivery platform for numerous therapeutic product classes, including small molecule drugs, peptides and anti-microbials.
 Activation Therapeutics is developing plans to undertake research and preclinical studies to evaluate the toxicology and mechanism of action with respect to the use of Excellagen as a delivery platform for secreted extracellular vesicles (“Exosomes”), which carry factors that stimulate and augment wound healing.  Exosomes are small (30-100 nm diameter), cell-derived, lipid bilayer-encapsulated vesicles that are naturally secreted by most cell types. Exosomes are found in, and can be isolated from, almost all bodily fluids and the media of cultured cells. Exosome contents include lipids, proteins, nucleic acids, and soluble factors. First identified in 1983, only in recent years has the therapeutic potential of exosomes been recognized and investigated.  They are now known to play a vital role in intercellular communication by delivering their contents to recipient cells, and triggering biologic responses.  In addition, exosomes are key secretory products of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), and recently published preclinical research studies have demonstrated that MSC-derived exosomes can stimulate proliferation and migration of dermal fibroblasts, enhance angiogenesis, and accelerate wound healing in a diabetic mouse model.  We believe that Excellagen could be a valuable delivery platform for exosomes in wound healing applications, by facilitating delivery and potentially augmenting the biological response to exosomes.
 Based on this new and exciting field of research, we currently plan to retain the exclusive rights to develop, market and sell an advanced biologic product extension utilizing Excellagen as a delivery platform for exosomes ( Excellazome ), to stimulate and augment wound healing beyond levels already observed with our Excellagen dermal matrix product.  Advancing the Excellazome biologic product concept to clinical and commercial readiness will require additional process engineering by exosome manufacturers to establish reproducible and scalable procedures that generate well-characterized end products that meet current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) quality standards.
 LifeAgain Insurance Solutions, Inc.
 Our LifeAgain subsidiary has developed an advanced medical data analytics (ADAPT®) technology platform focused on developing new and innovative products for the life insurance and healthcare sectors.  Our initial product offering was Blue Metric term life, an insurance program for men with prostate cancer. LifeAgain established a relationship with Symetra Financial Corporation to provide the insurance policies to men in the United States, based on actuarial information developed with our ADAPT technology. 
 On April 4, 2015, we entered into a license agreement with Shenzhen Qianhi Taxus Industry Capital Management Co., Ltd., a company affiliated with Shanxi Taxus Pharamaceuticals Co. Ltd., for the license of LifeAgain’s ADAPT technology to develop and commercialize survivable risk life insurance products in Greater China.  No products were commercialized or sold based on that license during the year ended December 31, 2015.
 
-9-



On August 11, 2015, Symetra Financial Corporation announced that it entered into a definitive merger agreement with Sumitomo Life Insurance Company pursuant to which Sumitomo Life will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Symetra. Following the transaction, Symetra advised us that it was discontinuing its partnership with LifeAgain.  As a result, we are not currently offering the Blue Metric term life product.
 LifeAgain plans to continue to seek opportunities for the application of its ADAPT medical analytics platform to commercialize “survivable risk” term life insurance for cancer survivors or others with medical conditions who are currently considered uninsurable based on traditional underwriting standards as well as other forms of survivable risk programs.
 Healthy Brands Collective.
 On November 15, 2013, we sold the assets of our To Go Brands subsidiary to Healthy Brands Collective® in exchange for shares of preferred stock representing approximately 4% of Healthy Brand Collective’s fully-diluted common stock.  Healthy Brands Collective® is the trading name for Cellnique Corporation, a privately-held company that has acquired a portfolio of eight independent brand product platforms (prior to To Go Brands) including Cell-nique® , Cherrybrook Kitchen®, Yumnuts®, Living Harvest/Tempt®, Bites of Bliss®, High Country Kombucha® drinks and Organics European Gourmet Bakery™ (formerly Dr. Oetker) natural and organic baking mixes.  
 At the time of the transaction, Healthy Brands Collective had announced plans for an initial public offering.  Healthy Brands Collective has not completed any liquidity event.  During 2015, we took additional impairment against our investment in Healthy Brands Collective, fully reserving our investment.  We are looking for opportunities to monetize our investment in Health Brands Collective, but do not have any arrangements or agreements in place at this time.
 Government Regulation
 New drugs, biologics, devices, and nutraceuticals, are subject to extensive regulation in the United States under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. In addition, biologics are also regulated under the Public Health Service Act. We believe that the pharmaceutical products we are attempting to develop will be regulated either as biological products or as new drugs. Both statutes and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, distribution, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, advertising and other promotional practices involving biologics or new drugs. FDA approval or other clearances must be obtained before clinical testing, and before manufacturing and marketing, of biologics and drugs. Obtaining FDA approval has historically been a costly and time-consuming process. Different regulatory regimes are applicable in other major markets.
 Any gene therapy and other DNA-based products we develop will require regulatory approvals before human trials and additional regulatory approvals before marketing. New biologics are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and the Center for Biological Evaluation and Research and comparable agencies in other countries. Currently, each human-study protocol is reviewed by the FDA and, in some instances, the NIH, on a case-by-case basis. The FDA and the NIH have published guidance documents with respect to the development and submission of gene therapy protocols.
 To commercialize our product candidates, we must sponsor and file an investigational new drug (IND) application and be responsible for initiating and overseeing the human clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy and, for a biologic product, the potency, which are necessary to obtain FDA approval of any such products. For any new drug applications, we will be required to select qualified investigators (usually physicians within medical institutions) to supervise the administration of the products, and we will be required to ensure that the clinical trials are conducted and monitored in accordance with FDA regulations and the general investigational plan and protocols contained in the IND application.
 The FDA receives reports on the progress of each phase of testing, and it may require the modification, suspension, or termination of trials if an unwarranted risk is present to patients. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. The IND application process can thus result in substantial delay and expense. Human gene therapy products, a primary area in which we are seeking to develop products, are a new category of therapeutics. Because this is a relatively new and expanding area of novel therapeutic interventions, there can be no assurance as to the length of the trial period, the number of patients the FDA will require to be enrolled in the trials to establish the safety, efficacy and potency of human gene therapy products, or that the data generated in these studies will be acceptable to the FDA to support marketing approval.
 After the completion of trials of a new drug or biologic product, FDA marketing approval must be obtained. If the product is regulated as a biologic, the Center for Biological Evaluation and Research will require the submission and approval, depending on the type of biologic, of either a biologic license application or a product license application and a license application before commercial marketing of the biologic. If the product is classified as a new drug, we must file a new drug application with the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and receive approval before commercial marketing of the drug. The new drug application or biologic license applications must include results of product development, laboratory, animal and human studies, and manufacturing information. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the new drug application or biologic license applications for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.

the past, new drug applications and biologic license applications submitted to the FDA have taken, on average, one to two years to receive approval after submission of all test data. If questions arise during the FDA review process, the approval process can take more than two years.
 Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data, the FDA may ultimately decide that the new drug application or biologic license application does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and may require additional studies. In addition, the FDA may condition marketing approval on the conduct of specific post-marketing studies to further evaluate safety and effectiveness. Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of pharmaceutical products continues after approval, particularly with respect to compliance with current good manufacturing practices (GMPs), reporting of adverse effects, advertising, promotion and marketing. Discovery of previously unknown problems or failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market, as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions.
 Ethical, social and legal concerns about gene therapy, genetic testing and genetic research could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting the processes we or our suppliers may use. Federal and state agencies, congressional committees and foreign governments have expressed interest in further regulating biotechnology. More restrictive regulations or claims that our products are unsafe or pose a hazard could prevent us from commercializing any such products.
 The approval and/or clearance for marketing of medical devices, such as Excellagen, are also subject to extensive controls by health regulatory and other authorities. Although some devices can be cleared for marketing pursuant to a procedure referred to as an FDA 501(k) clearance, other devices and/or indications may require additional clinical studies and may be subject to even more extensive regulatory and other controls.
 In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations.
 We are also subject to a variety of other regulations in the United States, including those relating to bioterrorism, taxes, labor and employment, import and export, and intellectual property.
 To the extent that we conduct operations outside the United States, any such operations would be similarly regulated by various agencies and entities in the countries in which we operate. The regulations of these countries may conflict with those in the United States and may vary from country to country. In markets outside the United States, we may be required to obtain approvals, licenses or certifications from a country’s ministry of health or comparable agency before we begin operations or the marketing of products in that country. Approvals or licenses may be conditioned or unavailable for certain products. These regulations may limit our ability to enter certain markets outside the United States.
 Competition
 The pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device industries are intensely competitive. Our products and any product candidates developed by us would compete with existing drugs, therapies, bio-therapies, stem cell therapies, medical devices or procedures and with others under development. There are many pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device companies, public and private universities and research organizations actively engaged in research and development of products for the treatment of cardiovascular and related diseases. Many of these organizations have financial, technical, research, clinical, manufacturing and marketing resources that are greater than ours. If a competing company develops or acquires rights to a more efficient, more effective, or safer competitive approach for treatment of the same or similar diseases or conditions we have targeted, or one that offers significantly lower costs of treatment, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
 We believe that the most significant competitive factor in the field of new therapeutics and devices is the effectiveness of a product candidate, as well as its relative safety and cost as compared to other products, product candidates or approaches that may be useful for treating a particular disease condition. 
 Our Generx® alferminogene tadenovec [Ad5FGF-4] Phase 3 product candidate is a first in class, single-dose, disease altering therapeutic specifically targeted for the cardiac micro-vasculature, that is designed to stimulate and augment the formation of new biologic structures in the heart to increase the level of micro-vascularity and enhance cardiac perfusion, and improve cardiac performance, as measured by exercise tolerance and the occurrence and severity of myocardial ischemia-driven angina. Current pharmacologic therapies for patients with CMI are limited to anti-anginal medications to relieve angina chest pain, which are dosed daily or episodically and carry physiologic side effects, and surgical and percutaneous interventions, such as stents or by-pass surgery, to address large vessel coronary artery disease.

We are aware of products currently under development by competitors targeting the same or similar cardiovascular and vascular diseases as our Generx product candidate. These include small molecule drugs and biological treatments using forms of genes and stem cells. 
  
• | Ranexa® (ranolazine; Gilead Sciences, Inc.) is a small molecule drug first approved by the FDA in 2006 for the treatment of chronic angina in patients who have not responded to other anti-anginal drugs (long-acting nitrates, calcium channel blockers and beta blockers). In 2008, the FDA approved Ranexa for first line anti-anginal use. Ranexa is taken twice daily, and FDA approval was based on clinical trial findings that both angina attacks per week and nitroglycerin tablet usage per week were reduced by 33% (from 3 to 2 for both). These studies also report that the response in women only was only about 30% of that seen in men. The mechanism of action of Ranexa’s antianginal effects has not been determined. Based on public disclosures by Gilead, annualized sales of Ranexa total $680 Million.

• | Juventas Therapeutics is developing a non-viral, plasmid gene therapy product candidate (JVS-100) that expresses stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) for advanced ischemic heart failure. SDF-1 has been shown to create a homing signal that recruits the body's own stem cells to the site of injury to induce tissue repair and regeneration. In May 2015, Juventas announced Phase 2 clinical study data showing that chronic heart failure patients receiving a single endomyocardial injection of JVS-100 demonstrated improvements at 12 months after treatment as measured by median change in left ventricle ejection fraction (3.5% over placebo) and left ventricular end-systolic volume (8.5 ml over placebo). In June 2015, Juventas announced that FDA had granted fast track status for JVS-100 and approved a Phase 2b study protocol to evaluate JVS-100 in patients with advanced ischemic heart failure and a prior history of heart attack.

• | Caladrius Biosciences (formerly NeoStem) is developing a stem cell product candidate comprised of autologous bone marrow derived CD34/CXCR4 cells (CLBS10, formerly NBS10) to treat damaged heart muscle following an acute myocardial infarction. CLBS10 is thought to work by increasing microvascular blood flow in the heart muscle via the development and formation of new blood vessels. In November 2014, NeoStem announced initial positive Phase 2 study data in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) treated with intracoronary administration of NBS10. These 6 month results showed a statistically significant mortality benefit (p<0.05) in patients treated with NBS10 as compared to the placebo group; a statistically significant dose-dependent reduction in SAEs (p<0.05); a dose-dependent numerical decrease in major adverse cardiac events; but no meaningful difference in perfusion, as evidenced by SPECT imaging.

• | Baxalta is developing a CD34+ autologous bone marrow-derived stem cell product for refractory angina. In 2011, results from a Phase 2 study were published, with findings of significant improvement in angina frequency and exercise tolerance in patients who received intromyocardial injections of the cells. Status of a Phase III study is unknown.

• | The Neovasc Reducer™ is a stainless steel medical device that is implanted into the coronary sinus using a procedure similar to that used for stent implantation. It is designed to create a focal narrowing in the coronary sinus, resulting in increased back pressure and redistribution of blood into ischemic myocardium. In 2015, results from a Phase 2 study were published, reporting that significantly more patients in the treatment group, as compared to control, had an improvement in CCS class and quality of life at 6 months, but no improvement in exercise time. The Neovasc Reducer is currently available only in the European Union. Additional clinical study is required for U.S. FDA approval.

 Based on our extensive pioneering pre-clinical and clinical work in the field of angiogenic gene therapy and medical revascularization, we have a leadership position that offers significant competitive advantages and multiple barriers to entry. Through these efforts, we have established appropriate dose levels, optimized our manufacturing process, enhanced delivery techniques and simplified product administration. 
  
• | Global Leader in Angiogenic Gene Therapy. Generx has been under clinical development for over a decade, under the continual management of our highly focused team with expertise in myocardial ischemia and angiogenic gene therapy. Generx represents one of only a few cardiovascular DNA-based therapeutic product candidates to successfully advance into late-stage, U.S. Phase 3 clinical study.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Novel Mechanism of Action. The Generx therapeutic product candidate offers a completely novel biologic mechanism of action referred to as “medical revascularization”, in contrast to the classic “mechanical revascularization” procedures that include CABG and PCI.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Late-Stage Clinical Development. The recently FDA-cleared Phase 3 AFFIRM study is preceded in the U.S. by four completed and one early-discontinued study. On a global basis, over 650 patients have been enrolled in FDA-approved studies, 455 of who received a one-time intracoronary administration of Generx, which has consistently been found to be safe and well-tolerated (based on over 2,500 patient years of safety data).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Barriers to Entry. Our know-how and trade secrets, substantial capital investment and the extensive time that would be required to satisfy FDA regulatory hurdles, establish multiple barriers to entry for clinically and commercially comparable gene-based products. Additional protections are afforded to Generx in the U.S. under the Patent Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, which will provide twelve years of market exclusivity in the U.S. from the date the product is registered by the FDA.

• | Cost-Effective Manufacture. The validated Generx cGMP manufacturing process is not anticipated to require significant additional capital investment or major process modifications for commercial manufacture. Product stability enables manufacture in large, cost-effective batch sizes.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fits within Current Medical Practice. Generx therapy is designed to easily fit within the current practice of medicine, as a ready-to-use, one-time treatment, administered by interventional cardiologists during an approximately one-hour, out-patient, angiogram-like procedure.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pipeline of Follow-on Medical Indications. A variety of other cardiovascular conditions, including Cardiac Syndrome X, ischemic heart failure, and Prinzmetal’s and inverse forms of angina, involve insufficient cardiac perfusion and represent unmet medical needs. Patients with these conditions may also benefit from Generx angiogenic gene therapy.

Manufacturing Strategy
 We plan to outsource all product manufacturing to one or more contract manufacturers of clinical drug products that operate manufacturing facilities in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices. We may also seek to refine the current manufacturing process and final product formulation to achieve improvements in storage temperatures and the like.
 In the United States, gene therapy products are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or “FD&C Act,” and the Public Health Service Act, or “PHS Act,” and well as other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. Both the FD&C Act and the PHS Act and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, purity, potency, and efficacy of biological products. The FDA has established guidelines and standards for the development and commercialization of molecular and gene-based drug products i.e.: Guidance for Industry—CMC for Human Gene Therapy INDs November 2004, Sterile Drug Products Produced by Aseptic Processing September 2004, Human Somatic Cell Therapy and Gene Therapy March 1998, PTC in the Characterization of Cell Lines Used to Produce Biologicals July 1993. These industry guidelines, among others, provide essential oversight with regard to process methodologies, product formulations and quality control standards to ensure the safety, efficacy and quality of these drug products.
 We will rely on contract manufacturing for the Generx product candidate.  Based on the recent FDA clearance of the Generx Phase 3 clinical study protocol, all significant Current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) manufacturing factors have been resolved in preparation for a commercial launch.  The cGMP Generx manufacturing processes have been validated and are scalable.  We do not anticipate any significant capital expenditures will be required for Generx commercial manufacture.  
 We have been actively advancing our Generx product candidate's engineering and process technology in preparation for commercialization.  The adenovector Ad5FGF-4 is propagated in suspension cultures of fully characterized HEK 293 cells using serum- free/animal product- free growth medium, and aseptically purified using a combination of chromatography and filtration methods.  The final product is vialed at a defined viral particle (vp) concentration, and stored at -70°C. Clinical doses are expressed in total number of viral particles.  
 Generx's long-term product stability (at the current storage temperature of -70°C) makes it possible to manufacture Generx in large, cost effective batch sizes. Based on the current Generx validated cGMP manufacturing processes, we believe that the manufacture of Generx can be scaled to large batch quantities (up to approximately 2.0 million doses annually) without the need for significant additional capital investment or major process technology engineering.  This flexibility will allow the manufacture of Generx at a highly economical direct cost, which could yield gross margins that would be approximately equivalent to a classic small molecule drug model. This would represent a significant commercial advantage in the market, and could be orders of magnitude lower than the expected high cost associated with the manufacture of complex donor-based autologous cell therapies, that are currently under development by other biotechnology companies for cardiovascular applications.  
 We have established validated test methods and product specifications to ensure that each batch of Generx meets rigorous quality control standards. These quality control test methods include a cell-based vessel formation bioactivity assay that measures and confirms the pro-angiogenic potency of each newly manufactured batch of Generx.  
 As a result, important process improvements were achieved enabling much higher manufacturing process yields.  Anticipated Generx direct manufacturing costs are expected to be highly favorable, capable of generating gross margins greater than 85%.
 Marketing and Sales
 Our product candidates, such as Generx must undergo clinical trials before any marketing and sales can begin. If we should obtain marketing approvals, we do not currently have the financial resources and internal capabilities to market and sell Generx.  Angionetics may develop a direct and highly-focused internal marketing and sale force for the Generx product candidates, or establish strategic partnerships and alliances with pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical device and cardiac theranostic companies for the marketing and sale of Generx in the United States. Outside the U.S., we expect to rely on strategic partnerships and distributors for marketing and sales of Generx product candidates. However, our marketing and sales strategies may vary by product, medical indication and the size of the addressable market.

For our Excellagen wound care product, we expect to engage in sales principally through or in collaboration with a sales and distribution partner and/or strategic partners. In the past we have entered into distributions agreements for Excellagen, including sales and distribution agreements to market and sell Excellagen to U.S. government medical providers, including Veterans Administration and military hospitals.  We did not have the funds to build inventory, to secure reimbursement from third party payor systems, or to support the advertising campaign to generate demand for Excellagen.  As our partners did not generate material sales, those distribution arrangements terminated and were not renewed.  We did not generate any sales of Excellagen in 2015 or 2016, and have written-off, all of our inventory. We do not expect to generate meaningful levels of sales for Excellagen until strategic partnerships are established, together with sufficient funding to support a product launch into select vertical markets.  
 Licensing and Intellectual Property
 Our business strategy is focused on the acquisition and development of a portfolio of product opportunities which involves a variety of intellectual property rights, including patent prosecution and inbound and outbound licensing transactions.
 In October 2005, we completed a transaction with Schering AG Group, Germany (now part of Bayer AG) and related licensors, including the University of California and New York University, for the transfer or license of certain assets and technology for potential use in treating ischemic and other cardiovascular conditions. Under the terms of the transaction, we paid Schering a $4 million fee, and would be required to pay a $10 million milestone payment upon the first commercial sale of each resulting product. We also may be obligated to pay the following future royalties to Schering: (i) 5% on net sales of an FGF-4 based product such as Generx, or (ii) 4% on net sales of other products developed based on technology transferred to Cardium by Schering. 
 As part of the Schering transaction, we acquired rights and corresponding obligations under the Regents of the University of California (Regents) September 1995 agreement, as amended. Under the University of California agreement, we are obligated to pay (1) an annual royalty fee of 2% based on net sales of products incorporating the technology licensed under the agreement, and (2) a minimum annual royalty fee (which may be offset against the net sales-based royalty fee) $100,000 for 2010, $100,000 for 2011, $150,000 for 2012, $150,000 for 2013 and $200,000 for 2014 and thereafter, payable on February 28 of the following year. We incurred the minimum license fee in 2013 and 2012. We may cancel that agreement at any time with 60 days’ notice, following which we would continue to be responsible only for obligations and liabilities accrued before termination.
 The primary U.S. patent covering certain methods of gene therapy, covered by this University of California license agreement has expired, and the Company did not dispute the University’s decision to terminate this license agreement.  As a result of such action, the University of California has asserted certain claims and unpaid expenses relating to this license agreement and asserted that an outstanding balance totaling $1,006,709.  As of December 31, 2016, the Company had an accrued unpaid balance totaling $782,836. The Company booked an additional $223,873 to reflect the amount asserted by the University of California. While the Company has fully accounted for such amounts claimed due and payable the Company retains the right to challenge any amounts asserted to be outstanding.
 As part of the Schering transaction, we acquired rights and corresponding obligations under the New York University March 1997 Agreement as amended, under which we may be obligated to pay an annual fee of $50,000 per year through the completion of the first full year of sales licensed technology as well as ongoing patent expenses incurred in connection with the licensed technologies. Should licensed products under the agreement reach the stage of filing of a product license application (PLA) and PLA approval or foreign equivalent thereof, we may be obligated to pay up to an aggregate amount of approximately $1.8 million for each product in milestone payments. In addition, beginning in the year in which we complete one full year of sales of licensed products and continuing thereafter until the agreement terminates or expires, we may also be obligated to pay annual royalty fees equal to 3% on net sales of products incorporating the licensed technology.
 In August 2006, we acquired the rights to various technologies and products now part of our Activation Therapeutics subsidiary. In connection with that acquisition we acquired the rights to use certain patented technology related to a growth factor DNA in exchange for royalty payments. Our Excellagen product does not contain the growth factor DNA, and we do not have any ongoing material commitments or royalty obligations with respect to the new Excellagen product candidate. We are looking to develop extensions to that platform, including the patented growth factor DNA, which would require the payment of royalties if a product is ultimately developed and approved.
 We expect to continue evaluations of the safety, efficacy and possible commercialization of our product candidates and technologies as they advance in development. On the basis of such evaluations, we may alter our current research and development programs, clinical studies, partnering or other development or commercialization activities. Accordingly, we may elect to amend or cancel, from time to time, one or more of our arrangements with third parties, subject to any applicable accrued liabilities and fees. Alternatively, the other parties to such arrangements may, in certain circumstances, be entitled to terminate the arrangements. Further, the amounts payable under certain of our arrangements may depend on the number of products or indications for which any particular technology is used. Thus, any statement of potential fees payable by us under each agreement is subject to a high degree of potential variation from the amounts indicated.

Although we or our licensors may file and prosecute patent applications related to various technologies under license or development, or seek to protect some technologies in other ways such as through the maintenance of trade secrets, our product candidates are based on complex and rapidly evolving technologies. There are a number of additional uncertainties affecting our ability to enforce any of our intellectual property rights as described below under Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property and Potential Litigation. There can be no assurance that any intellectual property assets, or other approaches to marketing exclusivity or priority, would be sufficient to protect our commercialization opportunities, nor that our planned commercialization activities will not infringe any intellectual property rights held or developed by third parties.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2016, we had six full-time employees. We anticipate relying on an outsource model for most of our significant operations, and do not expect our employee headcount to increase significantly during the next 12 months while our products and product candidates advance. Our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining agreement and we have not experienced any work stoppages as a result of labor disputes.
