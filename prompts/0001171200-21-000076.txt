Franchising Programs
 Orkin Franchises
 
The Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Orkin Systems, LLC (“Orkin Systems”), began its domestic Orkin franchise program in the U.S. in 1994, and established its first international franchise in 2000. It has since expanded to Central and South America, the Caribbean, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and Africa. The Company continues to expand its growth through the franchise program of its Orkin brand. This program is primarily used in smaller markets where it is currently not economically efficient to establish and operate a company-owned Orkin branch. Domestic Orkin franchises are subject to a contractual buyback provision at Orkin System’s option with a pre-determined purchase price using a formula applied to revenues of the franchise. International Orkin franchise agreements also contain an optional buyback provision, but it is subject to the franchisee’s renewal option.

Seasonality
 The business of the Company is affected by the seasonal nature of the Company’s pest and termite control services. The increase in pest presence and activity, as well as the metamorphosis of termites in the spring and summer (the occurrence of which is determined by the timing of the change in seasons), has historically resulted in an increase in the revenue of the Company’s pest and termite control operations during such periods as evidenced by the following chart.

 | Total Net Revenues | 
(in thousands) | 2020 | | 2019 | | | 2018
First quarter | $ | 487,901 | | $ | 429,069 | | $ | 408,742 
Second quarter | | 553,329 | | | 523,957 | | | 480,461

Years ended December 31, | $ | 2,161,220 | | $ | 2,015,477 | | $ | 1,821,565

Materials and Supplies
 The Company has relationships with a national pest control product distributor and other suppliers for pest and termite control treatment products. The Company maintains a sufficient level of chemicals, materials and other supplies to fulfill its immediate servicing needs and to alleviate any potential short-term shortage in availability from its national network of suppliers. Additionally, the Company procured adequate supplies of gloves, masks, sanitization chemicals and other personal protective equipment that were in high demand during the pandemic.

Competition
 The Company believes that, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries Orkin, LLC (“Orkin”), Western Industries-North, LLC (“Western Pest Services”), The Industrial Fumigant Company, LLC (“IFC”), HomeTeam Pest Defense, Inc. (“HomeTeam”), Crane Acquisition, Inc. (“Crane Pest Control”), Waltham Services, LLC (“Waltham”), Trutech, LLC (“Trutech”) PermaTreat Pest Control Company, Inc. (“Permatreat”), Critter Control, Northwest Exterminating Co., LLC (“Northwest”), Okolona Pest Control, Inc. (“OPC”), Clark Pest Control of Stockton, Inc. (“Clark Pest Control”), McCall Service NW, LLC (“McCall”), Orkin Canada Corporation (“Orkin Canada”), Critter Control British Columbia, Inc. (“Critter Control Canada”), Allpest Pest Control (“Allpest”), Murray Pest Control, Scientific Pest Management, Statewide Rollins Pty Ltd (“Statewide”), Adams pest Control Pty Ltd (“Adams”), Safeguard Pest Control and Environmental Services Limited (“Safeguard”), AMES Group Limited (“AMES”), Guardian Pest Control Ltd (“Guardian”), Albany Environmental Services Ltd (“Albany”), Van Vynck Environmental Services Ltd (“Van Vynck”), and Aardwolf Pestkare (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“Aardwolf”), it competes favorably with competitors as the world’s largest pest and termite control company. The Company’s major competitors include Terminix, Ecolab, Rentokil and Anticimex.
 The principal methods of competition in the Company’s pest and termite control markets are quality of service, customer proximity, guarantee terms, reputation for safety, technical proficiency, and price.
Research and Development
 Expenditures by the Company on research activities relating to the development of new products or services are not significant. Some of the new and improved service methods and products are researched, developed and produced by unaffiliated universities and companies. Also, a portion of these methods and products are produced to the specifications provided by the Company.
 The Company maintains a close relationship with several universities for research and validation of treatment procedures and material selection.
 The Company conducts tests of new products with the specific manufacturers of such products.  The Company also works closely with leading scientists, educators, industry consultants and suppliers to improve service protocols and materials.
 Environmental and Regulatory Considerations
The Company’s business is subject to various legislative and regulatory enactments including, but not limited to, environmental laws, antitrust laws, employment laws (including wage and hour laws, payroll taxes and anti-discrimination laws), immigration laws, motor vehicle laws and regulations, human health and safety laws, securities laws including, but not limited to, SEC regulations, and federal, state and local laws and regulations governing worker safety and the pest and termite control industry. Compliance with these requirements may have a material effect on the Company’s capital expenditures, earnings, and competitive position.
Environmental, Health and Safety Matters 
 Specifically, our businesses are subject to various international, federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding environmental, health and safety matters. Among other things, these laws regulate the emission or discharge of materials into the environment, govern the use, storage, treatment, disposal, transportation and management of hazardous substances and wastes and protect the health and safety of our employees. These laws also impose liability for the costs of investigating and remediating, and damages resulting from, present and past releases of hazardous substances, including releases by prior owners or operators of sites we currently own or operate. Compliance with environmental, health and safety laws increases our operating costs, limits or restricts the services we provide and subjects us to the possibility of regulatory or private actions or proceedings.
Consumer Protection, Privacy and Solicitation Matters
 Additionally, we are subject to international, federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations designed to protect consumers generally, including laws governing lending, debt collection and consumer finance, consumer privacy and fraud, the collection and use of consumer data, telemarketing and other forms of solicitation. The telemarketing rules adopted by the Federal Communications Commission pursuant to the Federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 and the Federal Telemarketing Sales Rule issued by the Federal Trade Commission govern our telephone sales practices. The CAN-SPAM Act regulates our email solicitations and the Consumer Review Fairness Act regulates consumer opinions on social media regarding our products and services. The California Consumer Privacy Act provides consumers the right to know what personal data we collect, how it is used, and the right to access, delete and opt out of the sale of their personal information to third parties. If we were to fail to comply with any of these applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to substantial fines or damages, be involved in lawsuits, enforcement actions and other claims by third parties or governmental authorities, suffer losses to our reputation and our business or suffer the loss of licenses or penalties that may affect how the business is operated, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Franchise Matters
 
Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to various international, federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations governing franchise sales, marketing and licensing and franchise trade practices generally, including applicable rules and regulations of the Federal Trade Commission. These laws and regulations generally require disclosure of business information in connection with the sale and licensing of our franchises. Certain state regulations also affect our ability as a franchisor, to revoke or refuse to renew a franchise. From time to time, we and one or more franchisees have, and may in the future become, involved in a dispute regarding the franchise relationship, including payment of royalties or fees, location of branches, advertising, purchase of products by franchisees, non-competition covenants, compliance with our standards or franchise renewal criteria. Any such franchise dispute could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
 Human Capital
We believe one of the largest contributors to our Company’s success is the quality of our people. Attracting, developing and retaining high-quality talent is the primary objective of our human capital management. The development and retention of high-quality talent leads to a better customer experience and better customer retention. We develop and engage our people through our best-in-class training at all levels of our organization.
 As of December 31, 2020, the Company had 15,616 employees. Approximately 14,200 of our employees were located in the United States, with approximately 13,500 employees at U.S. branch offices. Of the U.S. employees, less than 5% are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement.

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
 We make it a priority to promote and create a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace that results in higher levels of satisfaction and engagement, stronger staff retention, higher productivity, and a heightened sense of belonging. Our mission is to have a culture of inclusion, where all individuals feel respected, are treated fairly, with an equitable opportunity to excel. To reinforce our mission, we launched a new global Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiative in 2020. A key component of this initiative is our newly-formed Inclusion Advisory Council made up of employees from several different brands across the United States and Canada. Our council is currently focused on evaluating company policies, increasing employee awareness, and conducting employee listening sessions. Our goal is to create organizational change focusing on inclusion for all employees.
Health and Safety 
 We are committed to the health and safety of our employees and trade customers. During fiscal 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Rollins quickly implemented our pre-established business continuity plans. When state and local shelter-in-place restrictions were put in place, we experienced a smooth transition to a work-from-home environment for administrative staff and we limited traffic in and out of our branch locations. Employees receive regular emails with updated CDC guidelines, contact information for our Employee Assistance Program, and good news stories from various departments or branches to boost morale.
Community Involvement 
 We offer employees the opportunity to participate in various community outreach programs and believe that this commitment helps the Company to meet its goals of attracting, developing and retaining high-quality employees. We created Rollins United in 2019 to unify our brands’ philanthropic visions and consolidate our community outreach efforts. Our overarching goal is to create a significant impact in local communities over an extended period of time. The core mission of Rollins United is that everyone deserves a safe place to live, work, and play.

Item 1.A. | Risk Factors 
----------+------------------------------------------------------

 You should consider carefully the following risk factors before making an investment decision with respect to our securities. You are cautioned that the risk factors discussed below are not exhaustive.
 Risks Related to our Brand and Certain Intellectual Property Rights
Our business depends on our strong brands and failing to maintain and enhance our brands and develop a positive client reputation could hurt our ability to retain and expand our base of customers.
 Our strong brands, Rollins, Orkin, HomeTeam, Clark Pest Control, Western, Northwest, IFC, Crane Pest Control, Waltham, Trutech, PermaTreat, Critter Control, Safeguard Pest Control, Aardwolf Pestkare, OPC, and other strong brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business.  Maintaining and enhancing our brands increases our ability to enter new markets and launch new and innovative services that better serve the needs of our customers.  Our brands may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including, among others, reputational issues and product/technical failures.  Further, if our brands are significantly damaged, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.  We continue to develop strategies and innovative tools to gain a deeper understanding of customer acquisition, retention and client replacement in order to more effectively expand and retain our customer base. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to remain a service leader and continue to provide high-quality pest control services that are truly beneficial and play a meaningful role in people’s lives.
 Our brand recognition could be impacted if we are not able to adequately protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights that are material to our business.
 Our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our rights to service marks, trademarks, trade names and other intellectual property rights we own or license, particularly our registered brand names and service marks, Orkin®, Orkin Canada®, HomeTeam Pest Defense®, TAEXX®, Clark Pest Control®, Western Pest Services®, Northwest Exterminating®, Critter Control®, IFC®, Trutech®, Waltham Pest Services®, OPC Services®, Perma Treat Pest and Termite Control®, Crane Pest Control®, Murray Pest Control®, Allpest®, Statewide Pest Control®, Safeguard the Pest Control People®, Aardwolf Pestkare®, Adams Pest Control™, McCall® and others. Although we have sought to register or protect many of our marks either in the United States or in the countries in which they are or may be used, we have not sought to protect our marks in every country. Furthermore, because of the differences in foreign trademark, patent and other intellectual property or proprietary rights laws, we may not receive the same protection in other countries as we would in the United States. If we are unable to protect our proprietary information and brand names, we could suffer a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary information, or to defend against claims by third parties that our products, services or activities infringe their intellectual property rights.

Our franchisees, subcontractors, and vendors could take actions that could harm our business.
 Our franchisees, subcontractors, and vendors are contractually obligated to operate their businesses in accordance with the standards set forth in our agreements with them and applicable laws and regulations. Each franchised brand also provides training and support to franchisees. However, franchisees, subcontractors, and vendors are independent third parties that we do not control, and who own, operate and oversee the daily operations of their businesses. As a result, the ultimate success of any franchise operation rests with the franchisee. If franchisees do not successfully operate their businesses in a manner consistent with required standards, royalty payments to us will be adversely affected and our brands’ image and reputation could be harmed. This could materially adversely impact our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Similarly, if subcontractors, vendors and franchisees do not successfully operate their businesses in a manner consistent with required laws, standards and regulations, we could be subject to claims from regulators or legal claims for the actions or omissions of such third-party distributors, subcontractors, vendors and franchisees. In addition, our relationship with our franchisees, subcontractors, and vendors could become strained (including resulting in litigation) as we impose new standards or assert more rigorous enforcement practices of the existing required standards. These strains in our relationships or claims could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
 From time to time, we receive communications from our franchisees regarding complaints, disputes or questions about our practices and standards in relation to our franchised operations and certain economic terms of our franchise arrangements. If franchisees or groups representing franchisees were to bring legal proceedings against us, we would vigorously defend against the claims in any such proceeding. Our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted, and the price of our common stock could decline.
 Risks Related to the Global Economy and Public Health Crises
 Economic conditions may materially adversely affect our business.
 Pest and termite services represent discretionary expenditures to many of our residential customers. If consumers restrict their discretionary expenditures, we may suffer a decline in revenues from our residential service lines. Economic downturns can also adversely affect our commercial customers, including food service, hospitality and food processing industries whose business levels are particularly sensitive to adverse economies. For example, we may lose commercial customers and related revenues because of consolidation or cessation of commercial businesses or because these businesses switch to a lower cost provider.
 Our business, results of operations and financial condition is impacted by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the restrictions put in place in connection therewith.
 We  have and continue to respond to the global outbreak of COVID-19 by taking steps to mitigate the potential risks posed to us by its spread and the impact of the restrictions put in place by the local, state and federal governments to protect the population. However, the resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic in key areas of our operations may require us to implement additional restrictions on our operations. We continue to execute our business continuity plan and have implemented a comprehensive set of new protocols for the health and safety of our employees, customers, and business partners, such as wearing masks, gloves, and other personal protective equipment, social distancing, utilizing electronic documents and sanitizing high touch surfaces, among others. Our employees transitioned to work-from-home during fiscal 2020 where appropriate. However, due to the speed and scope with which the COVID-19 situation has evolved and the uncertainty of its duration and the timing of recovery, we are not able at this time to predict the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition. In addition, the unprecedented uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, due to rapidly changing governmental directives, public health challenges and progress, macroeconomic consequences, and market reactions thereto, also makes it more challenging for our management to estimate the future performance of our business and develop strategies to generate growth or achieve our objectives for 2021 and beyond.
 Risks Related to our Labor Force
 Our inability to attract and retain skilled workers may impair growth potential and profitability.
 Our ability to remain productive and profitable will depend substantially on our ability to attract and retain sales and service operations professional workers, develop leadership and implement diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Our ability to expand our operations is in part impacted by our ability to increase our labor force. The demand for employees is high, and the supply is limited. A significant increase in the wages paid and benefits offered by competing employers could result in a reduction in our labor force, increases in our labor costs, or both. If either of paid these events occurred, our capacity and profitability could be diminished, and our growth potential could be impaired.

Risks Related to our Business, Industry and Operations
 We face risks regarding our ability to maintain our competitive position in the pest control industry in the future.
 We operate in a highly competitive industry. Our revenues and earnings are affected by changes in competitors’ prices and general economic issues. We compete with other large pest control companies, as well as numerous smaller pest control companies, for a finite number of customers. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the market areas that we serve are service quality, terms of guarantees, reputation for safety, technical proficiency and price. Although we believe that our experience and reputation for safety and quality service are excellent, we cannot assure investors that we will be able to maintain our competitive position.
 We may not be able to identify, complete or successfully integrate acquisitions.
 Acquisitions have been and may continue to be an important element of our business strategy. We cannot assure investors that we will be able to identify and acquire acceptable acquisition candidates on terms favorable to us in the future. We cannot assure investors that we will be able to integrate successfully the operations and assets of any acquired business with our own business. Any inability on our part to integrate and manage the growth from acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
 Expanding into international markets presents unique challenges, and our expansion efforts with respect to international operations may not be successful.
 An element of our strategy includes further expansion into international markets. Our ability to successfully operate in international markets may be adversely affected by political, economic and social conditions beyond our control, local laws and customs, and legal and regulatory constraints, including compliance with applicable anti-corruption and currency laws and regulations, of the countries or regions in which we currently operate or intend to operate in the future. Risks inherent in our existing and future international operations also include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, difficulties in identifying and gaining access to local suppliers, suffering possible adverse tax consequences from changes in tax laws or the unfavorable resolution of tax assessments or audits, maintaining product quality and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights. Additionally, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an adverse effect on the financial results of our international operations.
 Our operations are affected by adverse weather conditions.
 Our operations are directly impacted by the weather conditions worldwide. The business of the Company is affected by the seasonal nature of the Company’s pest and termite control services. The increase in pest presence and activity, as well as the metamorphosis of termites in the spring and summer (the occurrence of which is determined by the timing of the change in seasons), has historically resulted in an increase in the revenue and income of the Company’s pest and termite control operations during such periods. The business of the Company is also affected by extreme weather such as drought which can greatly reduce the pest population for extended periods.

Risks Related to Cybersecurity, Privacy Compliance and Business Disruptions 
 The Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries could suffer disruption to business operations and face economic and reputational damage, as well as be subject to fines, penalties and private litigation, if there is unauthorized access to or unintentional distribution of personal, financial, proprietary, confidential, or other protected data or information the Company is entrusted to keep about its customers, employees, business practices, or third parties.
 Our internal information technology (“IT”) systems contain certain personal, financial, health, or other protected and confidential information that is entrusted to us by our customers and employees.  Our IT systems also contain the Company’s and its wholly-owned subsidiaries’ proprietary and other confidential information related to our business, such as business plans, customer lists and product and service development initiatives. We also grant third-party business partners and service providers access to such information in order to facilitate business operations and administer benefits.  Employees, third-party business partners, and service providers can knowingly or unknowingly disseminate such information or serve as an entry point for bad actors to access such information. Vulnerabilities from growth, acquisitions, and integration with new systems also exist. 
 Our privacy compliance and digital risk management initiatives focus on the threats and risks to enterprise information and the underlying IT systems processing such information as part of the implementation of business processes.  The Company also relies on, among other things, commercially available vendors, cyber protection systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of protected information and data. The systems currently used for transmission and approval of payment card transactions, and the technology utilized in payment cards themselves, all of which can put payment card data at risk, meet standards set by the payment card industry (“PCI”). We have also implemented policies and procedures, internal training, system controls, and constant monitoring and audit processes to protect the Company from internal and external vulnerabilities and to comply with consumer privacy laws in the areas in which we operate.  Further, the Company limits retention of certain data, encrypts certain data and otherwise protects information to comply with consumer privacy laws in the areas in which we operate.
 We continue to evaluate and modify our systems and protocols for data security compliance purposes, and such standards may change from time to time. We monitor certain third-party business partners and service providers for compliance and vulnerabilities.  Activities by bad actors, changes in computer and software capabilities and encryption technology, new tools and discoveries, cloud applications, changes in multi-jurisdictional regulations, and other events or developments may result in a compromise or breach of our systems. Any compromises, breaches, application errors  or human mistakes related to our systems or failures to comply with applicable standards could not only disrupt our financial operations, including our customers’ ability to pay for our services and products by credit card or their willingness to purchase our services and products, but could also result in violations of applicable laws, regulations, orders, industry standards or agreements and subject us to costs, penalties and liabilities which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, a breach of data security or failure to comply with rigorous multi-jurisdictional consumer privacy requirements could expose us to customer litigation, regulatory actions and costs related to the reporting and handling of such a violation or breach.
 Risks Related to Legal, Regulatory and Risk Management Matters
 We are from time to time subject to lawsuits, investigations and other proceedings which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and our operations may be adversely affected if we fail to comply with applicable law or other governmental regulations, including environmental and other regulations relating to the pest control industry.

10
--

In the normal course of business, we are involved in various claims, arbitrations, contractual disputes, investigations and litigation, including claims that our services or vehicles caused damage or injury, claims that our services did not achieve the desired results, claims related to acquisitions, allegations by federal, state or local authorities, including the SEC, of violations of regulations or statutes, claims related to wage and hour law violations and claims related to environmental matters.  These claims, proceedings or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Additionally, our business is significantly affected by and subject to regulation by various federal, state, provincial, regional and local governments in the countries in which we operate, including, but not limited to, environmental laws, antitrust laws, consumer protection laws, employment laws, including wage and hour laws, payroll taxes and anti-discrimination laws, immigration, human health and safety laws and other regulations relating to the pest control industry.
 We are unable to predict whether such laws will, in the future, materially affect our operations and financial condition or whether any changes will require us to incur substantial increases in costs in order to comply with such changes. Penalties for noncompliance with these laws may include investigations, criminal sanctions or civil remedies, including, but not limited to, cancellation of licenses, fines, and other corrective actions, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 The ongoing SEC investigation and any potential related litigation entail risks and uncertainties.
 The SEC is conducting an investigation, which the Company believes is primarily focused on how it established accruals and reserves at period-ends and the impact of those accruals and reserves on reported earnings. The investigation relates to period-ends for periods beginning January 1, 2015.  The Company is fully cooperating with the SEC’s investigation.  The Company’s Audit Committee retained independent counsel to conduct an internal investigation into matters related to the SEC investigation and, in particular, the Company’s processes for establishing and adjusting reserves for each quarter in the relevant periods. The internal investigation was concluded in October 2020. Based on the results of the internal investigation, it was determined that there was a significant deficiency in the Company’s internal controls relating to the documentation and review of accounting entries for certain reserves and accruals.  The Company has subsequently reevaluated and strengthened its internal controls over financial reporting, including improving processes and procedures and supporting documentation and providing additional training, which has resulted in the remediation of the significant deficiency. The Company, after consultation with the Audit Committee and independent counsel, believes that its financial statements filed with the SEC on Forms 10-K and 10-Q for the relevant periods fairly present in all material respects its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as of their respective balance sheet dates and for the periods then ended.
 The SEC’s investigation is ongoing, however, and there can be no assurance that the SEC or another regulatory body will not make further regulatory inquiries or pursue action against the Company and its senior officers that could result in potentially significant sanctions and penalties, or that could require the Company to take additional remedial steps.  Potential sanctions against the Company and/or individuals could include penalties, injunctions, and cease-and-desist orders. Further, the Company may be subject to litigation from third parties related to the matters under review by the SEC.  Accordingly, the ongoing SEC investigation and any potential related litigation could result in distraction to management and entail risks and uncertainties the outcome of which could adversely affect our financial results and our reputation.
 
Product, service or other related liability claims could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial position and results of operations.
The handling, storage, transportation, and use of chemical products required to provide pest control service involves inherent exposure to potential product liability claims, service level claims, and related adverse publicity. Additionally, hazards could potentially cause injury, damage to, or destruction of, property or equipment and environmental contamination or other environmental damage, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Also, the occurrence of disruptions, shutdowns or other material operating problems at our facilities or those of our suppliers or customers due to any of these risks could adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our operations as a whole, including our results of operations and cash flows, both during and after the period of operational difficulties. We maintain product and general liability insurance, however, there can be no assurance that the types or levels of coverage maintained are adequate to cover these potential significant and catastrophic risks. In addition, we may not be able to continue to maintain our existing insurance coverage or obtain comparable or additional insurance coverage at a reasonable cost, if at all, in the event a significant product or service claim arises.
  
11
--

Our risk management and safety programs may not have the intended effect of reducing our liability for personal injury or property loss.
Our safety record is critical to our reputation. Many of our clients require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to provide service and bid for contracts, and many contracts provide for automatic termination or forfeiture of some or all of our contract fees or profit in the event we fail to meet certain measures. Accordingly, if we fail to maintain adequate safety standards, we could suffer reduced profitability or the loss of projects or clients, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 We attempt to mitigate risks relating to personal injury or property loss through the implementation of company-wide safety management efforts designed to decrease the incidence of accidents or events that may occur. It is expected that any such decreases could also have the effect of reducing our insurance costs. However, incidents involving injury or property loss may be caused by multiple potential factors, a significant number of which are beyond our control. Therefore, there is no guarantee that our risk management and safety programs will have the desired effect of controlling all potential costs and liability exposure.
 Our enterprise risk management program may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risks.
 We maintain an enterprise risk management program that is designed to identify, assess, mitigate, and monitor the risks that we face. There can be no assurance that our frameworks or models for assessing and managing known risks, compliance with applicable law, and related controls will effectively mitigate risk and limit losses in all market environments or against all types of known and unknown risk in our business. If conditions or circumstances arise that expose flaws or gaps in our risk management or compliance programs, the performance and value of our business could be materially adversely affected.
 The Company maintains insurance and other traditional risk-shifting tools to manage certain types of risks. However, such tools are subject to terms such as deductibles, retentions, limits and policy exclusions, as well as risk of denial of coverage, default or insolvency. If we suffer unexpected or uncovered losses, or if any of our insurance policies are terminated for any reason or are not effective in mitigating our risks, we may incur losses that are not covered or that exceed our coverage limits and could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.
 Risks Related to our Capital and Ownership Structure
 The Company’s management has a substantial ownership interest; public stockholders may have no effective voice in the Company’s management.
 The Company has elected the “Controlled Company” exemption under Section 303A of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) Listed Company Manual. The Company is a “Controlled Company” because a group that includes the Company’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Gary W. Rollins, and certain companies under his control, controls in excess of fifty percent of the Company’s voting power. As a “Controlled Company,” the Company need not comply with certain NYSE rules.
 Rollins, Inc.’s executive officers, directors and their affiliates hold directly, or through indirect beneficial ownership, in the aggregate, approximately 54 percent of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, these persons will effectively control the operations of the Company, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions such as acquisitions and approval of matters requiring stockholder approval. This concentration of ownership could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control of the Company at a premium.

--

Our management has a substantial ownership interest, and the availability of the Company’s common stock to the investing public may be limited.
 The availability of Rollins’ common stock to the investing public would be limited to those shares not held by the executive officers, directors and their affiliates, which could negatively impact Rollins’ stock trading prices and affect the ability of minority stockholders to sell their shares. Future sales by executive officers, directors and their affiliates of all or a portion of their shares could also negatively affect the trading price of our common stock.
 Provisions in Rollins, Inc.’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may inhibit a takeover of the Company.
 Rollins, Inc.’s certificate of incorporation, bylaws and other documents contain provisions including advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and staggered terms for the Board of Directors. These provisions may make a tender offer, change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by the Company’s Board of Directors more difficult or expensive.
