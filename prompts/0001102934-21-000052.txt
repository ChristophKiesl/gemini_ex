ITEM 1. BUSINESS
OUR COMPANY
CMC Materials, Inc., which was incorporated in the state of Delaware in 1999, is a leading global supplier of consumable materials to semiconductor manufacturers and pipeline companies. We operate our business within two reportable segments: Electronic Materials and Performance Materials.
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
Effective October 1, 2020, the Company changed its name from “Cabot Microelectronics Corporation” to “CMC Materials, Inc.”
On April 1, 2021 (“ITS Acquisition Date”), the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of International Test Solutions, LLC (“ITS”) (“ITS Acquisition”), which designs and produces high-performance consumables used to optimize critical semiconductor testing processes. This acquisition expands our product offering within the Electronic Materials business segment. The Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K include the financial results of ITS from the ITS Acquisition Date. See Note 4 of “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the ITS Acquisition.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we made a strategic decision to exit the wood treatment business by approximately early calendar year 2022, and focus our strategy and future capital investments on our other businesses. Leading up to the planned closure of the Matamoros and Tuscaloosa facilities, we intend to continue to operate the existing facilities and serve our wood treatment customers. For additional information, refer to Note 10 of “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
ELECTRONIC MATERIALS SEGMENT
The Electronic Materials segment consists of our chemical mechanical planarization (“CMP”) slurries, CMP pads, electronic chemicals, and materials technologies businesses. These businesses supply consumable products used in integrated circuit (“IC”) device manufacturing and other aspects of the semiconductor and data storage industries. 
IC devices, or “chips”, are components in a wide range of electronic systems for computing, communications, manufacturing and transportation. The multi-step manufacturing process for IC devices typically begins with a circular wafer of pure silicon, which then undergoes a process of alternating insulating and conducting layers until the desired wiring within the IC device is achieved. At the conclusion of the process, the wafer is cut into individual IC devices, which are then packaged to form individual chips. Consumers most frequently encounter IC devices in smart phones and tablets, desktop or laptop computers, automotive applications, gaming devices, and televisions. 
CMP SLURRIES AND CMP PADS
The Company develops, produces, and sells CMP slurries for polishing a wide range of materials used in IC devices, including tungsten, dielectric materials, copper, tantalum (commonly referred to as “barrier”), and aluminum, and for polishing bare silicon wafers, as well as disk substrates and magnetic heads used in hard disk drives. We also develop, manufacture, and sell CMP polishing pads, which are used in conjunction with slurries in the CMP process. Our CMP pads can be used on a variety of polishing tools and wafers, over a range of technology nodes and applications, including tungsten, copper, and dielectrics.
 CMP slurries and pads (“CMP consumables”) are used to remove excess material that is deposited during the IC manufacturing process and to level and smooth the surfaces of the layers of IC devices via a combination of chemical reactions and mechanical abrasion, leaving minimal residue and defects on the surface, with only the material necessary for circuit integrity remaining. CMP enables IC device manufacturers to produce smaller, faster, and more complex IC with a greater density of transistors. CMP also helps reduce the number of defective or substandard IC devices, which increases the device yield. An effective CMP process is achieved through technical optimization of the CMP consumables in conjunction with an appropriately designed CMP process and generally requires slurries and pads to be qualified in its processes through an extensive series of tests and evaluations. While this qualification process varies depending on numerous factors, it can be costly and may take six months or longer to complete. IC device manufacturers usually assess quality, cost, time required, and impact on production when they consider implementing or switching to a new CMP slurry or pad.

ELECTRONIC CHEMICALS
In our electronic chemicals business, we offer semiconductor-grade wet chemicals with purities that extend to the parts-per-trillion (ppt) level. We produce and sell high-purity process chemicals through the formulation, purification, and blending of acids, solvents, and other wet chemicals primarily used to etch, clean, and dry silicon wafers during the production of semiconductors, photovoltaics (solar cells), and flat panel displays. 
Our electronic chemicals products include sulfuric, phosphoric, nitric and hydrofluoric acids, ammonium hydroxide, hydrogen peroxide, isopropyl alcohol, other specialty organic solvents and various blends of chemicals. As the IC manufacturing process moves to more advanced technology nodes and the complexity of the process continues to increase, quality and purity of the materials become even more critical to the device yield. Increasing levels of purity and achieving lower levels of variation in our electronic chemicals business are required to enable next-generation IC technologies. Our advanced chemical purification technologies, including distillation, ion exchange, gas adsorption, and filtration, are designed to provide consistently low contaminant levels in a variety of high-purity process chemicals. We continue to work to develop industry-leading metrology and analytical methods to measure the purity levels achieved.
MATERIALS TECHNOLOGIES
In our materials technologies business, which comprises the ITS business, we develop and manufacture high-performance consumable products for cleaning advanced probe cards and test sockets at semiconductor manufacturing facilities. These engineered polymer solutions improve customer yields and throughput in wafer and package test operations at semiconductor device manufacturers, foundries, and outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) facilities. We also design innovative polymer products for semiconductor fabs that improve front-end tool uptime and reduce operating costs.
STRATEGY
Technology and innovation are vital to our Electronic Materials business, and we devote significant resources to research and development. We believe our focused effort on advanced technologies with technology-leading customers enables us to provide more compelling new products as semiconductor devices continue to advance. We focus our research and development activity to deliver innovative consumable products for advanced applications for our technology-leading customers. We have strategically located our research and development and clean room facilities, manufacturing operations, and related quality, field application, technical and customer support teams close to our customers to be responsive to their needs, which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage. 
We also focus on building close relationships with our customers. We collaborate with them to identify and deliver new and improved solutions, to integrate our products into their manufacturing processes, and to assist them with supply, warehouse and inventory management. 
We believe another competitive advantage is product and supply chain quality. Our customers demand continuous improvement in our products, in terms of product performance, quality and consistency. In pursuit of this, we work to continuously improve and innovate with respect to our own products, and as part of that, we require our raw materials suppliers, who provide us with certain important elements of our CMP slurries, pads and electronic chemicals, to do the same. We believe our capabilities in supply chain management and quality systems differentiate us from our competitors, and that our worldwide CMP consumables manufacturing plants and global network of suppliers also provide supply chain flexibility as needed. In our electronic chemicals business, we are responsible for product performance, purity levels and analytical testing, and in our view, our ability to maintain high quality levels and superior supply chain process is a competitive advantage. 
INDUSTRY TRENDS
SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY 
Demand within the semiconductor industry is driven by smart phones, tablets, personal computers (“PCs”), servers, and a wide range of other electronic applications, including high-performance computing and artificial intelligence. Over time, overall semiconductor industry demand has fluctuated as a result of numerous factors, including the changing mix of demand drivers, semiconductor fab utilization, pressure to reduce costs, and the pace of technology advancement.
Over the past decade there has been a significant shift in semiconductor industry demand from IC devices for PCs to hand-held consumer electronic devices. Future demand for advanced semiconductor devices is expected to be driven by applications such as high performance computing, virtual and augmented reality, artificial intelligence, and 5G, as well as increased demand for greater connectivity with remote work and learning requirements, wearables, peripherals, the internet of things, and increased semiconductor content in automobiles. While demand conditions may fluctuate, we continue to believe that semiconductor industry demand will grow over the long term based on increased usage of IC devices in existing applications as well as future applications.
INDEX

Over the past several years, we have seen consolidation in the customer base within the semiconductor industry. Costs to achieve the required scale in manufacturing within the semiconductor industry continue to rise, along with the related costs of research and development, and larger manufacturers generally have greater access to the resources necessary to manage their businesses than do smaller participants. 
As demand for more advanced and lower cost electronic devices grows, there is ongoing pressure on IC device manufacturers to reduce their costs. Manufacturers have historically reduced cost and simultaneously improved device performance by migrating to smaller technology nodes. To achieve performance and cost improvements, semiconductor manufacturers are placing greater emphasis on new device architectures, including 3D memory and FinFET. Many manufacturers reduce costs by pursuing ever-increasing scale in their operations, while seeking to reduce their production costs by increasing their production yields regardless of their scale. However, as the industry continues to shrink dimensions, leading edge technology node transitions are becoming more challenging due to technical and physical obstacles, and the pace of technology change has slowed. Thus, semiconductor manufacturers look for semiconductor materials products, such as CMP consumables and electronic chemicals, to help enable the achievement of technology progression with quality and performance attributes that can help them achieve their overall performance targets, cost structure, and to drive yield improvement. 
DEMAND
Demand for our CMP consumables and electronic chemicals products reflects semiconductor industry demand patterns in terms of growth, cyclicality and seasonality, and varying demand for specific device types. Consistent with other participants in the semiconductor industry, we experienced increased demand from our customers in our fiscal 2021 from the prior year, as certain sectors such as cloud, PCs and servers continued to show strength, driven by the initial economic recovery from the Pandemic, particularly in the industrial and automotive sectors. Over the long term, we anticipate worldwide demand for CMP consumables and electronic chemicals used by IC device manufacturers to grow as a result of expected long-term growth in wafer starts, and the trend to more advanced technologies. With respect to CMP consumables, we believe there will continue to be an associated increase in the number of CMP polishing steps required to produce these advanced devices, and the introduction of new materials that are expected to require CMP. With respect to electronic chemicals, we believe there will be increasing demand as customers are transitioning to advanced technology nodes, which require an increasing number of processing steps used on each wafer and materials with higher purity levels. 
COMPETITION
We compete in the semiconductor industry, which is characterized by technology advances, demanding requirements for product quality and consistency, and lower cost of ownership. We face competition from other suppliers of electronic materials. We believe we are the leading global supplier of CMP slurries, with a broad range of innovative solutions. Our CMP slurry competitors range from small companies that compete with a single product or in a single geographic region, to divisions of global companies with multiple lines of CMP products. With respect to CMP polishing pads, DuPont has held the leading position in this area for many years. Several other companies also participate in CMP consumables. 
For our electronic chemicals business, there are various competitors with whom we compete in different regions, through both localized production and importation. These competitors include Avantor, BASF, Honeywell, Kanto Corporation and Technic, among others. We believe our business in Europe is comparable to other providers, and other than in Singapore, at present we do not participate materially in the business in Asia.
CUSTOMERS, SALES, AND MARKETING
Within the semiconductor industry, our customers are generally producers of logic or memory IC devices, or providers of IC foundry services. Some logic customers, and so-called “fabless” companies, outsource some or all the production of their devices to foundries, which provide contract manufacturing services, in order to avoid the high cost of process development, construction and operation of a fab, or to provide additional capacity when needed.
We market our products primarily through direct sales to our customers, although we use distributors in certain areas, such as in China. We believe this strategy of primarily direct sales provides us an additional means to collaborate closely with our customers and provides our customers with the most efficient means by which to procure our products. As part of our sales process, our logistics and sales personnel provide supply, warehouse and inventory management services for our customers. 
For additional information on our customers, refer to Note 2 of “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND TECHNICAL
 As technology advances and semiconductor materials and designs increase in complexity, these challenges require significant investments in research, development and technical support (“R&D”), and we plan to continue to devote significant resources to R&D, and balance our efforts between shorter and longer-term industry needs. 
INDEX

Our global R&D team includes experts from the semiconductor industry and scientists and engineers from key disciplines required for the development of high-performance CMP consumable products. We operate CMP-related R&D facilities primarily in the U.S., with certain development capabilities in Taiwan and South Korea, as well as in Singapore for data storage products, and in Japan for silicon wafer products. We also operate electronic chemicals product development facilities in the U.S., Europe, and Singapore. In addition to R&D, we have a global team focused on quality improvements and analytical developments. 
RAW MATERIALS SUPPLY
