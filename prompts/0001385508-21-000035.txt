 Item 1. Business. 
Our Company
    Opiant Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“we”, “our” or the “Company”) is a specialty pharmaceutical company developing medicines for addictions and drug overdose. We were incorporated in the State of Nevada in June 2005 as Madrona Ventures, Inc. and, in September 2009, we changed our name to Lightlake Therapeutics Inc. In January 2016, we again changed our name to Opiant Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
    On October 2, 2017, we changed our state of incorporation from the State of Nevada to the State of Delaware pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated October 2, 2017 whereby we merged with and into our recently formed, wholly-owned Delaware subsidiary, Opiant Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 

    We developed NARCAN® (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray (“NARCAN®”), a treatment to reverse opioid overdose. This product was conceived and developed by us, licensed to Adapt Pharma Operations Limited (“Adapt”), an Ireland based pharmaceutical company in December 2014 and approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in November 2015. Emergent BioSolutions, Inc. acquired Adapt in October of 2018 and Adapt became its wholly owned subsidiary (collectively with Adapt, "EBS")
    Our current pipeline includes medicines in development for Opioid Overdose Reversal (“OOR”), Alcohol Use Disorder (“AUD”), Opioid Use Disorder (“OUD”), and Acute Cannabinoid Overdose (“ACO”). We are also pursuing other treatment opportunities within the addiction and drug overdose field.
    We have not had a bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceeding. We are required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to the clinical testing and manufacturing and sale of pharmaceutical products.

Principal Products or Services and Markets
Opioid Overdose Reversal
    Naloxone is a medicine that can reverse opioid overdose and until November 2015, was only approved by the FDA as an injection. Administered as a nasal spray, naloxone can be used more widely to prevent opioid overdose deaths.
    There is a large and growing addressable market for opioid overdose reversal agents driven by sales into first responder institutions, and patients via pharmacies. The current institutional market includes first responders, including fire departments, emergency medical services, federal law and local law enforcement. The co-prescribing of opioid overdose reversal agents alongside prescription opioids, has also driven growth. It is estimated that only 5 percent of at risk patients have a naloxone prescription. Currently there are only eleven states that have some form of mandatory co-prescription legislation, and this is expected to increase.
    We believe that in 2022 the addressable market for opioid reversal agents could exceed $1.0 billion, with approximately fifty percent from institutional sales and fifty percent from retail sales, which includes primarily pharmacy sales and co-prescription.

    In December 2014, we entered into a license agreement with Adapt, which subsequently became a wholly owned subsidiary of EBS (the “Adapt Agreement”). The Adapt Agreement has no set duration but may be terminated, among other ways, by Adapt/EBS in its sole discretion, either in its entirety or in respect of one or more countries, at any time by providing 60 days prior notice to us. Pursuant to the Adapt Agreement, EBS has a global license to develop and commercialize our nasal naloxone Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product. In February 2015, EBS received “Fast Track” designation by the FDA and in July 2015, EBS submitted a New Drug Application ("NDA") to the FDA for NARCAN®. In November 2015, NARCAN® was approved by the FDA for the emergency treatment of a known or suspected opioid overdose. In May 2016, EBS submitted a new drug submission ("NDS") for NARCAN® to Health Canada. In October 2016, Health Canada approved Adapt’s naloxone hydrochloride nasal spray to treat opioid overdose, to be marketed as NARCAN®. In exchange for licensing our treatment to EBS, we receive up to double-digit percentage royalties on net sales. 

    In October 2016, one of our patents for NARCAN® became listed in the FDA publication, Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book, patent number 9468747, which patent expires on March 16, 2035.

    On December 13, 2016, we entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “SWK Purchase Agreement”) with SWK Funding LLC (“SWK”) pursuant to which we sold, and SWK purchased, our right to receive, commencing on October 1, 2016, all Royalties (as defined in the SWK Purchase Agreement) arising from sales pursuant to the Adapt Agreement, of NARCAN® or any other product, subject to certain conditions and limitations. As of December 31, 2017, all amounts due SWK under the SWK Purchase Agreement have been paid. SWK retains a 10% interest for all royalties and milestones that the Company received in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and will receive in future years. 
    In addition, on December 13, 2016, in connection with the SWK Purchase Agreement, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Adapt Agreement (the “Adapt Amendment”) which amends the terms of the Adapt Agreement relating to the grant of a commercial sublicense outside of the U.S and diligence efforts for commercialization of our nasal naloxone opioid 
overdose reversal treatment (“OORT”). Under the terms of the Adapt Amendment, EBS is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize OORT in the United States In the event that EBS wishes to grant a commercial sublicense to a third party in the European Union or the United Kingdom, we have agreed to negotiate an additional amendment to the Adapt Agreement to include reduced financial terms with respect to the commercial sublicense in such territory. Under the terms of the Adapt Agreement, we would receive an escalating double-digit percentage of all net revenue received by EBS from a commercial sublicensee in the European Union or the United Kingdom. Net revenue received by EBS from a commercial sublicensee in European Union or the United Kingdom would be included in determining sales-based milestones due to us.

    In January 2017, the FDA approved the 2mg formulation of NARCAN® for opioid-dependent patients expected to be at risk for severe opioid withdrawal in situations where there is a low risk for accidental or intentional opioid exposure by household contacts.

    In March 2017, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) issued U.S. Patent Numbers 9,480,644 and 9,561,177 covering methods of use for NARCAN®. In December 2018, the USPTO issued U.S. Patent, No. 10,085,937, covering methods of use for the four-milligram formulation of NARCAN® for the treatment of opioid overdose. These patents are listed in the FDA publication, Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book, and expire on March 16, 2035.
In March 2019, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Adapt Agreement (“Amendment No. 2”) where certain modifications were made to the Adapt Agreement (See “Net Profit Interests” contained in Item 7 of this Annual Report - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations).
OPNT003 - Nasal Nalmefene for OOR

    In 2017, NIH leadership called for the development of a stronger, longer-acting formulations of antagonists to counteract the very high potency synthetic opioids that are now claiming thousands of lives each year.
On February 12, 2018, we announced positive data from a Phase 1 clinical study of OPNT003 (nasal nalmefene) and provided an update at a meeting held on February 8, 2018 with the FDA regarding our planned development program. OPNT003 is in development as a potent long-acting opioid antagonist for the treatment of opioid overdose. Based on feedback from the FDA in connection with this meeting, we intend to pursue a 505(b)(2) development path, with the potential to submit an NDA for the drug and nasal delivery device combination in 2021. Nalmefene as an injection was previously approved by the FDA for treating suspected or confirmed opioid overdose. The 505(b)(2) pathway allows companies to rely in part on the safety and efficacy for a previously approved FDA product and to supplement this data with a more limited set of their own studies to satisfy FDA requirements, as opposed to conducting the full array of preclinical and clinical studies that would typically be required.
    Data generated in a Phase 1 study completed under a clinical trial agreement with the National Institute on Drug Abuse (“NIDA”) provided the basis for the FDA meeting. These preliminary data demonstrate that our nasal nalmefene formulation containing a proprietary absorption enhancer (Intravail®, which we licensed from Aegis Therapeutics LLC) resulted in rapid increases in plasma levels with an onset faster than an intramuscular injection and a comparatively long half-life (6.7-7.8 hours). Naloxone, the only FDA medication currently approved to treat opioid overdose, has a half-life of approximately 2 hours.
    On January 27, 2020, the Company received a letter from the FDA formalizing a "clinical hold", that was discussed during a telephone conversation on January 16, 2020, on the pharmacokinetic study for the Company's product candidate OPNT003 (nasal nalmefene) as a potent long-acting opioid antagonist for the treatment of opioid overdose. The FDA requested additional information be provided to evaluate the sensitization and irritation endpoints of the final finished device. On May 8, 2020, the Company received a letter from the FDA lifting the clinical hold.
In February of 2021, we dosed the first patient in the confirmatory pharmacokinetic study for OPNT003. The open label randomized, crossover study will enroll 68 healthy volunteers and determine the pharmacokinetic profile of nasal administered nalmefene compared to intramuscularly administered nalmefene. We anticipate full enrollment in April of 2021 with top-line data in June of 2021. 
We also anticipate commencing patient dosing in mid-March of 2021 for a pharmacodynamic study for OPNT003. The protocol for this study has been filed with the FDA and we have received Institutional Review Board approval to initiate the study. We anticipate top-line data the start of the fourth quarter of 2021. 
    We have full commercial rights to OPNT003 and we were awarded a grant of approximately $7.4 million from the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”). The grant provides us with additional resources for the ongoing development of OPNT003. We have been awarded approximately $5.6 million funded through the period ended March 31, 2021, with the balance of $1.8 million expected to be funded, subject to available funds and satisfactory progress on the development of OPNT003. We have also received a contract for approximately $8.1 million from the Biological Advance Research and Development Agency (“BARDA”) to fund the development of OPNT003 through to NDA submission. BARDA has awarded approximately $6.5 million of the contract through December 20, 2021, with the balance expected to be funded, subject to satisfactory project progress, availability of funds and certain other conditions. 
    Synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl, are now responsible for more overdose deaths than both heroin and prescription opioids, with over 37,334 fatalities linked to synthetic opioids in 2019. Fentanyl and derivatives, such as carfentanil, are particularly dangerous because of a long half-life of seven to ten hours that may require continuous monitoring of overdose victims and repeated dosing with naloxone to initially resuscitate a patient and to prevent relapse. A long-acting opioid overdose reversal drug may reduce this burden.
    An easy-to-use nasal formulation of nalmefene with a rapid onset and long duration of action would be suitable for non-medically trained persons to administer. If approved by the FDA, OPNT003 may also be especially useful in rural areas, where a rapidly growing number of overdoses are occurring, and where access to emergency medical response may be delayed by hours. In addition, since high potency synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl, can be weaponized, OPNT003 may also be suitable as an antidote in a civilian mass casualty event.
OPNT002 - Nasal Naltrexone for Alcohol Use Disorder ("AUD")

    We are developing OPNT002, nasal naltrexone for AUD. Alcohol triggers the release of naturally occurring endorphins, which then bind to the opioid receptors in the brain, leading to dopamine release in the brain's reward center.  Naltrexone is thought to reduce heavy drinking through the blockade of these opioid receptors, which results in dampening of alcohol-induced dopamine release and reward. Naltrexone is currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of AUD as a tablet and depot injection. However, in contrast to current naltrexone formulations OPNT002 will be taken nasally on an "as needed" basis, in anticipation of drinking or once drinking has started in order to reduce alcohol intake.  We anticipate that taking our product on an as-needed basis could improve patient compliance and enable a patient to regain control of their drinking, especially in situations where heavy drinking is otherwise habitual. Furthermore, we expect patients to have high rates of adherence, because they will not be required to abstain and potentially go through detoxification and withdrawal prior to initiating OPNT002 therapy, unlike the typical situation with existing medicines for AUD. 
    We have generated encouraging Phase 1 clinical data demonstrating rapid nasal absorption of OPNT002, which supports its suitability for use on an as needed basis, as high levels of naltrexone can be delivered within minutes, which is likely to be very important during a period of craving.  The Company has also received feedback from the FDA on our proposed 505(b)(2) development plan, which accepts a harm reduction-based primary endpoint rather than a primary endpoint based on abstinence. 
    In October of 2019, we completed a dose ranging study, confirming the suitability of our OPNT002 formulation of AUD. 
During 2020, we had planned to begin patient enrollment for a double blind, placebo controlled Phase 2 study of OPNT002 in AUD. This study will enroll approximately 300 patients in Europe and the United Kingdom. However, due to the ongoing COVID-19 global health pandemic, we paused the initiation of recruitment for the Phase 2 study of OPNT002 for AUD. 
There are approximately 16.3 million people in the U.S. who suffer from some form of AUD. According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, only 2.5% of these individuals receive pharmacotherapy for this condition. Feedback from our primary market research strongly supports nasal naltrexone as a product that could also be used in a primary care setting as well as by addiction specialists and in addiction treatment centers.
OPNT004 - Drinabant Injection for Acute Cannabinoid Overdose ("ACO")
On December 26, 2018, we entered into an exclusive global licensing agreement with Sanofi for the development and commercialization of drinabant for the treatment of acute cannabinoid overdose ("ACO"). We intend to develop drinabant, a selective, high affinity cannabinoid CB-1 receptor antagonist, as an injectable for administration in an emergency department setting. In a proof of principle study that Sanofi completed with 36 patients, oral drinabant blocked both subjective and objective psychological effects of inhaled delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol ("THC"). Sanofi also generated extensive safety data in Phase 1 and 2 studies with more than 700 subject for up to 24 weeks.
    ACO is most frequently linked to the ingestion of “edibles” containing large quantities of THC and the abuse of synthetic cannabinoids (often referred to as “K2” and “Spice”) that are more potent and yet cheaper than cannabis.  Edibles, sold as brownies, cookies and candies, pose particular risks for children, who can consume these by accident.  Based on 2014 rates from the National Emergency Department sample and United States Census Bureau figures, we estimate that ACO resulted in more than one million emergency department visits in the United States in 2016. With an increasing number of states legalizing cannabis for personal and recreational use, ACO rates are expected to rise. Features of ACO produced by edibles and synthetic cannabinoids can include psychosis, panic and anxiety, feelings of paranoia, agitation, hallucinations, nausea, vomiting and cardiac arrhythmias. These symptoms often require emergency medical attention and can take hours to days to resolve. There are currently no FDA approved treatments for ACO.
    In January 2020, we signed a Letter of Intent with the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences ("NCATS") to collaborate on the development of OPNT004. NCATS is one of 27 divisions and centers of the NIH. NCATS will provide development resources around certain pre-clinical activities and studies to support our planned filing of an Investigational New Drug ("IND") application for OPNT004. This collaboration will be carried out under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with the Company and the NIH.
Opioid Use Disorder

    OUD is a major global health issue, particularly in the United States, where opioid misuse, in particular involving opioid painkillers and subsequent addiction, has become widespread. Given the increase in prevalence, OUD has now been classified in the United States as a public health crisis. As prescription opioid painkillers have become more difficult to obtain due to tighter controls for distribution and prescribing, and abuse deterrent formulations have become available, there has been an increase in heroin use, which is cheaper and often easier to obtain than painkillers. At the same time, the availability and abuse of synthetic opioids, including fentanyl and its derivatives (fentanyl has been estimated to be at least 50 times more potent than heroin) has become more widespread, further driving the recent increase in deaths from opioid overdose in the U.S.
    Current FDA approved treatments for opioid addiction are methadone-based and buprenorphine-based substitution therapies, and the use of naltrexone (an opioid antagonist), available as both a tablet and depot injection. Most substitution therapies, are opioid-based treatments, that for many patients are undesirable, as there is frequently diversion and misuse of these treatments amongst patients with OUD. Therefore, being able to provide a vaccine to patients that potentially provides 
specific immunity against heroin and its metabolites without the need for prior detoxification and enabling patients to remain opioid-free is an attractive solution.

    In October 2016, we in-licensed OPNT005, a heroin vaccine from Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (“WRAIR”). This is an early stage pre-clinical asset and requires further pre-clinical research before human testing. In October 2018, researchers at the U.S. Military HIV Research Program at the WRAIR and SUNY Upstate Medical University in Syracuse, NY, were awarded a grant by NIH to advance OPNT005, through Phase 1/2a clinical trials to assess its safety and efficacy. 

Other Activities
In November 2016, Opiant Pharmaceuticals UK Limited (“OPUK”) was incorporated under the Companies Act of 2006 as a private company. OPUK is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and Dr. Roger Crystal, our Chief Executive Officer and a director, and David O'Toole, our Chief Financial Officer and Secretary, serve as the sole directors of OPUK. 
On June 22, 2017, we entered into a license agreement with Aegis Therapeutics LLC ("Aegis") (the “Aegis License Agreement”) and a related supply agreement (the “Supply Agreement”) pursuant to which we were granted an exclusive license (the “License”) to Aegis’ proprietary chemically synthesizable delivery enhancement and stabilization agents, including, but not limited to, Aegis’ Intravail® absorption enhancement agents, ProTek® and HydroGel® (collectively, the “Technology”) to exploit (a) the Compounds (as such are defined in the Aegis License Agreement) and (b) a product containing a Compound and formulated using the Technology (“Product”), in each case of (a) and (b) for any and all purposes. The Aegis License Agreement restricts our ability to manufacture any Aegis excipients included in the Technology (“Excipients”), except for certain instances of supply failure, supply shortage or termination of the Supply Agreement, and we shall obtain all supply of such Excipients from Aegis under the Supply Agreement. The Aegis License Agreement also restricts Aegis’s ability to compete with us worldwide with respect to the Exploitation (as defined in the Aegis License Agreement) of any therapeutic containing a Compound or derivative or active metabolite of a Compound without our prior written consent. The effective date of the Aegis License Agreement and the Supply Agreement is January 1, 2017.

    As consideration for the grant of the License, we agreed to pay Aegis two upfront payments, of which we may elect to pay up to 50% by issuing our Common Stock to Aegis, with the number of shares to be issued equal to 75% of the average closing price of our Common Stock over the 20 trading days preceding the date of payment. The Aegis License Agreement also provides for (A) additional developmental milestone payments for each Product containing a different Compound equal to up to an aggregate of $1.8 million, (B) additional commercialization milestone payments for each Product containing a different Compound equal to up to an aggregate of $5.0 million, and (C) single low digit royalties on the Annual Net Sales (as defined in the Aegis License Agreement) of all Products during the Royalty Term (as defined in the Aegis License Agreement) according to a tiered royalty rate based on Annual Net Sales of the Products by us, our sublicensees and affiliates. We shall also pay to Aegis a sublicense fee based on a sublicense rate to be negotiated in good faith by the parties. The Aegis License Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, ownership, patent rights, confidentiality, indemnification and insurance provisions. The Aegis License Agreement shall expire upon the expiration of our obligation to pay royalties under such Aegis License Agreement; provided, however, that we shall have the right to terminate the License granted on a product-by-product or country-by-country basis upon 30 days’ prior written notice to Aegis.
    Under the terms of the Supply Agreement, Aegis shall deliver to us any preclinical, clinical and commercial supply of the Excipients, which Aegis sources from various contract manufacturers. The Supply Agreement has a term of 20 years but shall terminate automatically in the event of expiration or termination of the Aegis License Agreement or at any time upon the written agreement of both parties. The Supply Agreement contains customary provisions relating to pricing for such materials, forecasts, delivery, inspection, indemnification, insurance and representations, warranties and covenants. The Supply Agreement includes technology transfer provisions for the transfer of all materials and know-how specific to the manufacturing of the Excipients that is necessary or useful for us to manufacture such Excipients. We do not have the right to manufacture such Excipients except in the event that Aegis is unable to supply and sell any portion of the material to us (subject to a 60-day cure period). 
    On December 3, 2018, Neuralis, Inc. completed its acquisition of Aegis. As a result of the acquisition, Neuralis succeeded to all obligations under the Aegis License Agreement.
    On September 10, 2018, we entered into a development and manufacturing agreement for OPNT003 (nasal nalmefene), a potent, long-acting opioid antagonist for the treatment of opioid overdose with Consort Medical plc ("Consort"), a leading contract development and manufacturing organization. Under this agreement, Aesica and Bespak, wholly-owned subsidiaries of Consort, will work with us to produce a pre-filled delivery nasal spray with nalmefene. As part of the agreement, Aesica will supply Opiant with clinical samples and registration batches for the purposes of performing clinical studies and obtaining regulatory approvals. Further, upon approval by the FDA, Aesica and Bespak will manufacture and supply the commercial device for us. On October 28, 2020, the Company notified Aesica that, effective immediately, we were terminating the Agreement pursuant to Section 18.2(a) of the Agreement.    
On July 22, 2020, we entered into a Project Scope Agreement ("PSA") pursuant to a Master Services Agreement ("MSA") with Summit Biosciences, Inc. ("Summit"), to support the development and manufacture of a nasal spray device for opioid overdose, with the ability to expand to additional programs in the future. In accordance with the PSA, Summit will develop and produce certain pre-filled nasal spray products using a device previously evaluated as part of other FDA-approved nasal spray products. We will pay Summit estimated costs and fees up to approximately $7.2 million. 
On October 26, 2020, we entered into a Master Services Agreement (“MSA”) with AptarGroup, Inc. (“Aptar”) to provide non-exclusive technology access and co-development services for the development and submission of an opioid antagonist for the treatment of opioid overdose using Aptar’s nasal Unidose device (the “UDS Device”). In addition to the cost of the UDS Devices, we expect to spend up to approximately $5.2 million over the course of the development program.
Competition
    The specialty pharmaceutical industry is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological progress. Certain pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies and academic and research organizations currently engage in, or have engaged in, efforts related to the discovery and development of new medicines for the treatment of substance use, addictive and overdose. Significant levels of research in chemistry and biotechnology occur in universities and other nonprofit research institutions. These entities have become increasingly active in seeking patent protection and licensing revenues for their research results. They also compete with us in recruiting skilled scientific talent. Some of these companies are larger and better-funded than us and there are no assurances that we can effectively compete with these competitors. Potential competitors include Emergent BioSolutions Inc., Adial Pharmaceuticals , Adamis Pharmaceuticals Corp., Harm Reduction Therapeutics, Hikma Pharmaceuticals, Amphastar, Indivior PLC, Alkermes PLC, H. Lundbeck A/S, Teva, Shire PLC, Orexo AB, BioDelivery Services International, Inc., Braeburn Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and BioCorRx, Inc.
    With respect to NARCAN®, we face competition from other treatments, including injectable naloxone, auto-injectors and improvised nasal kits. Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, Inc. competes with NARCAN® with their naloxone injection. Kaléo competes with NARCAN® with their auto-injector known as EVZIO™ (naloxone HCl injection) Auto-Injector. On April 19, 2019, the FDA announced approval of Teva’s ANDA for a generic version of NARCAN®. On June 5, 2020, the District Court for the District of New Jersey entered a decision in the patent litigation regarding NARCAN® (naloxone HCl) Nasal Spray 4mg/spray product. The Court ruled in favor of Teva giving it the opportunity to launch a generic version of NARCAN®. Our commercial partner EBS, has appealed the decision to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Although NARCAN® was the first FDA-approved naloxone nasal spray for the emergency reversal of opioid overdoses and has advantages over certain other treatments, we expect the treatment to face additional competition. For example, Hikma Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Orexo AB and Harm Reduction Therapeutics have development programs for novel naloxone nasal spray formulations intended for use in opioid overdose reversal.

Regulation

Government Regulation and Product Approval 
    Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state, and local levels, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, product approval, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing changes, packaging, storage, record-keeping, labeling, promotion, advertising, sales, distribution, marketing, and import and export of drugs and biologic products. All of our foreseeable product candidates are expected to be regulated as drugs. In particular, therapeutic product candidates for human use are subject to rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and other requirements of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FFDCA”), implemented by the FDA, as well as similar statutory and regulatory requirements of foreign countries. The processes for obtaining regulatory approval in the United States. and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along 
with ongoing compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities both pre- and post-commercialization, are a significant factor in the production and marketing of our products and our R&D activities and require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Any failure by us or our collaborators, licensors or licensees to obtain, or any delay in obtaining, regulatory approvals or in complying with other regulatory requirements could adversely affect the commercialization of product candidates then being developed by us and our ability to receive product or royalty revenues.
    The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the FFDCA and the FDA's implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA's refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices regulations; 
•submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin; 
•approval by an independent internal review board ("IRB"), at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated; 
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies according to Good Clinical Practice 
("GCP") regulations, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use; 
•preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA; 
•satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice ("cGMP") to assure that the facilities, methods, and controls are adequate to preserve the drug's identity, strength, quality, and purity; and 
•FDA review and approval of the NDA.
    The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates (or those of our collaborators or licensees) will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. 
    An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, to the FDA as part of the IND. The sponsor must also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the initial clinical study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the initial clinical study lends itself to an efficacy evaluation. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions related to a proposed clinical study and places the study on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical study can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance, and may be imposed on all product candidates within a certain pharmaceutical class. The FDA also can impose partial clinical holds, for example, prohibiting the initiation of clinical studies of a certain duration or for a certain dose. 
    All clinical studies must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCP regulations. These regulations include the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical study. Further, an IRB must review and approve the plan for any clinical study before it commences at any institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and re-approve the study at least annually. An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical study are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the information regarding the clinical study and the 
consent form that must be provided to each clinical study subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical study until completed. Each new clinical protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted for FDA review, and to the IRBs for approval. Protocols detail, among other things, the objectives of the clinical study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety. Study sites are subject to inspection for compliance with GCP. 
    Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the NIH, for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website. 
    Human clinical studies are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
•Phase 1. The product is initially introduced into a small number of healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product is suspected or known to be unavoidably toxic, the initial human testing may be conducted in patients. 
•Phase 2. Involves clinical studies in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and schedule. 
•Phase 3. Clinical studies are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These clinical studies are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. 
    Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical studies must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
U.S. Review and Approval Processes 
    Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical studies, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA for a new drug, requesting approval to market the product. 
    The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of a substantial application user fee although a waiver of such fee may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. For example, the agency will waive the application fee for the first human drug application that a small business or its affiliate submits for review. The sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual program user fees. 
    In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, an NDA application (or supplements to an application) for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen, or new route of administration must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective, unless the applicant has obtained a waiver or deferral. 
    In 2012, the FDASIA amended the FDCA to require that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan ("PSP"), within sixty days of an End-of-Phase II meeting or as may be 
agreed between the sponsor and the FDA. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. The FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical studies, and/or other clinical development programs. 
    The FDA also may require submission of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy ("REMS") to mitigate any identified or suspected serious risks. The REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools. 
    The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an application for filing. In this event, the application must be re-submitted with the additional information. The re-submitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review to determine whether the product is safe and effective for its intended use. 
    The FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. An advisory committee is a panel of experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, who provide advice and recommendations when requested by the FDA. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions. 
    Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure clinical data supporting the submission were developed in compliance with GCP.
    The approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or may require additional clinical data or other data and information. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical studies are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than an applicant interprets the same data. 
    After the FDA's evaluation of an application, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter to indicate that the review cycle is complete and that the application is not ready for approval. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met to secure final approval of the application and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing for the FDA to reconsider the application. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical studies. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the application, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application or request an opportunity for a hearing. 
    Even with submission of additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA's satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. 
    If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical studies, to further assess safety and effectiveness after approval and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. 
After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Abbreviated New Drug Applications ("ANDAs") and Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications 
    Most drug products obtain FDA marketing approval pursuant to an NDA for innovator products, or an ANDA for generic products. Relevant to ANDAs, the Hatch-Waxman amendments to the FDCA established a statutory procedure for submission and FDA review and approval of ANDAs for generic versions of branded drugs previously approved by the FDA (such previously approved drugs are also referred to as listed drugs). Because the safety and efficacy of listed drugs have already been established by the brand company (sometimes referred to as the innovator), the FDA does not require a demonstration of safety and efficacy of generic products. However, a generic manufacturer is typically required to conduct bioequivalence studies of its test product against the listed drug. The bioequivalence studies for orally administered, systemically available drug products assess the rate and extent to which the API is absorbed into the bloodstream from the drug product and becomes available at the site of action. Bioequivalence is established when there is an absence of a significant difference in the rate and extent for absorption of the generic product and the listed drug. In addition to the bioequivalence data, an ANDA must contain patent certifications and chemistry, manufacturing, labeling and stability data. 
    The third alternative is a special type of NDA, commonly referred to as a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, which enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA's findings of safety and efficacy of an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application. Section 505(b)(2) NDAs often provide an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The applicant may rely upon the FDA's findings with respect to certain preclinical or clinical studies conducted for an approved product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for certain label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
    In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents of the applicant or that are held by third parties whose claims cover the applicant's product. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the Orange Book. Any subsequent applicant who files an ANDA seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must make one of the following certifications to the FDA concerning patents: (1) the patent information concerning the reference listed drug product has not been submitted to the FDA; (2) any such patent that was filed has expired; (3) the date on which such patent will expire; or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. This last certification is known as a paragraph IV certification. A notice of the paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved NDA to which the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application refers. The applicant may also elect to submit a "section viii" statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. 
    If the reference NDA holder or patent owners assert a patent challenge directed to one of the Orange Book listed patents within 45 days of the receipt of the paragraph IV certification notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the paragraph IV certification expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. The ANDA or 505(b) (2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the branded reference drug has expired as described in further detail below. Thus approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA or ANDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired, and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
Post-Approval Requirements
    Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to extensive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping (including certain electronic record and signature requirements), periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of certain adverse experiences, deviations, and other problems with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. 
    The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market. Products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. Further, manufacturers must continue to comply with cGMP requirements, which are extensive and require considerable time, resources and ongoing investment to ensure compliance. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. 
    Manufacturers and certain other entities involved in the manufacturing and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. The cGMP requirements apply to all stages of the manufacturing process, including the production, processing, sterilization, packaging, labeling, storage and shipment of the product. 
    Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 
    The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an application. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product's safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
    The FDA may withdraw a product approval if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, problems with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market.
    Potential implications include required revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
•warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; 
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals; 
•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or 
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
    In addition, the distribution of prescription drugs is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act ("PDMA"), which regulates the distribution of the products and product samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the 
registration and regulation of distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. 
    From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition to new legislation, FDA regulations, guidance, and policies are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our product candidates. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or FDA regulation or policy changes will be enacted or implemented and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 
    In the United States, sales of any products for which we (or our collaborators or licensees) may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. 
    Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. Some of the additional requirements and restrictions on coverage and reimbursement levels imposed by third-party payors influence the purchase of healthcare services and products. 
    Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drugs on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication, or place drugs at certain formulary levels that result in lower reimbursement levels and higher cost-sharing obligation imposed on patients. Moreover, a payor's decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Further, one payor's determination to provide coverage does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement may differ significantly from payor to payor. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain and maintain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of any products, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit.
    The United States government and state legislatures have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and coverage and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. Adoption of government controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could exclude or limit our drugs and product candidates from coverage and limit payments for pharmaceuticals. 
    In addition, we expect that the increased emphasis on managed care and cost containment measures in the United States by third-party payors and government authorities to continue and will place pressure on pharmaceutical pricing and coverage. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
