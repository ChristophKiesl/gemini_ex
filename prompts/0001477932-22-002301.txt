Item 1. Business

Our financial statements are stated in United States Dollars (US$) and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.

In this annual report, unless otherwise specified, all dollar amounts are expressed in United States dollars and all references to “common shares” refer to the common shares in our common stock.

General Overview

As used in this current report and unless otherwise indicated, the terms “we”, “us” and “our” mean nDivision Inc., unless otherwise indicated.

nDivision Inc. (“nDivision” or the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the state of Texas. nDivision’s registered office is located at 7301 N. State Highway 161, Suite 100, Irving, TX, 75039. The Company provides managed IT services and project-based professional services in the information technology industry, selling its services directly to customers and through global service providers (GSP). The Company operates in most states of the United States of America.

On February 13, 2018, Go2Green Landscaping, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “Registrant”) executed an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with nDivision Inc, and NDI Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Registrant (“Acquisition”) whereby Acquisition was merged with and into nDivision (the “Merger”) in consideration for Twenty Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand (27,500,000) newly-issued shares of Common Stock of the Company (the “Merger Shares”).

As a result of the Merger, nDivision became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Registrant and following the consummation of the Merger and giving effect to the issuance of the Merger Shares and the retirement of 10,000,000 shares of the then 14,400,000 shares issued and outstanding of the Registrant by its principal stockholders, the stockholders of nDivision beneficially owned approximately Seventy percent (70%) of the issued and outstanding Common Stock of the Registrant.

For accounting purposes, nDivision was deemed to be the accounting acquirer in the transaction and, consequently, the transaction was treated as a recapitalization of the Company. Accordingly, nDivision’s assets, liabilities and results of operations are the historical consolidated financial statements of the Company and the Company’s assets, liabilities and results of operations are consolidated with nDivision effective as of the date of the Merger. No step-up in basis or intangible assets or goodwill was recorded in this transaction.

On February 26, 2018, the Company executed an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Gamwell Technologies Inc., a Texas corporation (“Gamwell”). Gamwell is engaged in the business of providing managed services, VOIP telephone, security consulting and professional services to its customers.

Our Current Business

nDivision supports organizations in their journey towards digital transformation using advanced technologies across the datacenter, cloud, network and end user help desk. Progressive Chief Information Officers (“CIOs”) want to reduce the proportion of their IT budget that is spent on KTLO (Keeping The Lights On) and pivot towards initiatives that make the organization more effective and more efficient; however, IT Operations is still a critical business function and cannot be compromised. In the past, service providers have promised lower costs and improved service levels through labor arbitrage, achieved by utilizing offshore resources. Unfortunately, this has rarely lived up to expectations, and has generally resulted in poor service levels and constant additional costs for ‘out of scope’ work. nDivision takes a radically different approach. It hires some of the best talent in the industry, harnesses technologies like automation, artificial intelligence, machine learning and cognitive learning to dramatically reduce costs and drive up service levels. nDivision’s business model is driven by state-of-the-art technologies, low overheads through strategies that include remote working, a flat organizational structure and highly motivated & talented U.S. based employees. The net effect is a very competitive value proposition and delighted customers. nDivision’s services are industry segment agnostic and its customers range from a small and midsize business (“SMB”), through midmarket and large enterprise (the largest customer is a Fortune 500 account). It provides remote support for customer IT operations in 32 countries and across six continents. One of the top ten global technology distributor ($60bn+ revenues) recently entered into an agreement with nDivision to resell nDivision's services through its approximately 50,000 resellers in the U.S.
Services and Solutions

Autonomic Services

SINGLE PANE-OF-GLASS IT OPERATIONS
nDivision uses an integrated IT Operations platform, not a collection of tools. It is made up of over 20 different modules, all of which were developed from the ground up (i.e. no acquired IP) and are fully ITIL compliant. Organizations can choose to implement some or all of the modules, for the same all-inclusive price. Every function is available through a single pane-of-glass, providing visibility and control of incidents, remediation, assets, change management, problem management, knowledge management, SOP’s, etc.
INTEGRATED CMDB
An accurate Configuration Management Database (CMDB) is the heart of ITSM (IT Service Management). Very few major organizations have an accurate CMDB, and many of those who are trying to get there are using a spreadsheet. nDivision’s platform has an integrated CMDB that is controlled by the change management module, making it very difficult to add, remove or change Configuration Items without maintaining the integrity of the CMDB. Further, the CMDB within nDivision’s platform can store correlations and dependencies, which improves incident management, and is invaluable when planning major changes such as datacenter and/or cloud migrations.
AUTOMATIONS
There are a number of tools available that allow automations to be scripted, however, nDivision's platform provides a framework for automations spanning multiple areas such as infrastructure, operating systems, hypervisors, services, databases and major applications. These automations run across solutions from all the major vendors and can either run as standard or using a WYSIWYG ‘drag and drop’ approach, can be quickly customized to match an organization’s SOP’s. In fact, if an asset is IP-addressable, can accept keyboard-based commands and generate outputs, it can be part of an automation.
SMART IT SUPPORT
This is nDivision’s packaged 24/7 ‘all-in’ remote IT support service for Small Businesses (it is typically aimed at customers with between 10 and 100 IT users) and spans IT infrastructure (servers, storage and networking), and end user help desk support including devices (laptops, desktops, tablets and mobile phones).  SMART IT Support has three levels of service: Essential, Advanced and Premium.  Advanced includes the same service options as Essential but includes additional security-related and Microsoft cloud services, whereas Premium includes more advanced security-related and Microsoft cloud services.  Each of the three service options is priced per user, per month.  The quantities of infrastructure equipment and user devices included in the service is calculated as a ratio of the number of users under contract, with additional items charged for on a per item per month basis.  SMART IT Support provides Small Businesses with comprehensive IT support at a competitive price-point, backed by industry-leading services levels.  SMART IT Support’s transparent and published pricing makes it easy for Small Businesses to budget for their IT Support, and customers enjoy the benefits of nDivision’s autonomic services, staffed 24/7 network operations center and deep technical resources.

AUTONOMIC MANAGED SERVICE (AMS)
nDivision’s AMS makes extensive use of automation which often resolves incidents without any human involvement; this is referred to as Autonomic Resolution. In other cases, the automation will attempt to fix the problem, but if it can't, it gathers all the relevant information at the time that an incident occurs and automatically escalates the ticket to a human engineer; this is referred to as Autonomic Assistance. Sometimes, the platform will notify a human engineer that it has resolved a particular incident multiple times in a given time period and will automatically escalate the incident to Problem Management. There are also some situations where an incident cannot be addressed autonomically and a human will have to investigate the incident and carry out remediation. Where an organization does not want to use its human labor for tasks that cannot be carried out autonomically, nDivision’s AMS provides an ITIL Level 1 Autonomic Managed Service (L1 AMS) and an ITIL Level 2 Autonomic Managed Service (L2 AMS).
END USER HELP DESK
nDivision understands that every minute that an end user is unable to access an IT service or technology costs the organization money. If that user is a knowledge-worker, C-level executive or other key resource, the costs can be significantly higher. Furthermore, equipment costs may only represent 20% of the Total Cost of Ownership, with support costs representing the other 80%. Therefore, optimizing access to technology is a critical area of cost-saving and improved productivity.

Many organizations find that providing a multi-tiered Help Desk for its end users can be challenging. Often, Tier 2 resources cannot be spared to address complex end user issues, which leads to protracted user response and resolution times. Also, when resources are limited, providing a high level of support outside of business hours and over weekends can be difficult to do effectively.

Our Proactive service provides a single point of contact for ticketing and remediation through email, web or by phone, and is charged for based on the number of devices. We install an agent on each device that allows us to quickly provide remote control support and keep patches up to date. The service includes anti-virus & anti-malware protection (or we can leverage the customer’s) and software distribution for operating systems and applications. Bare metal backups and recovery is an optional service. We leverage manufacturer warranties or a spares program, as needed. All support staff for our Proactive service are based in the U.S.

Our real-time Executive Dashboard provides data on the quality of service (each interaction can be rated by the user), call center statistics (abandonment, talk time, hold time, etc.), inventory data (asset type, operating system, location, etc.) and patching data (installed, missing approved and failed). The Speed of Service metrics includes service level achievement, speed by priority, speed by time and speed by support team member. The Resolved Tickets metrics includes count by team, percentage closed by team, mean time to respond and mean time to resolve. Custom views can also be created as a separate services engagement.

Sales and Marketing

We market and sell our services directly through our professional staff, senior management and direct sales personnel operating out of our business development offices and from home-based locations. We also partner with a number of global service providers (GSPs) that either resell our services across the U.S. or recommend our services to their targeted customers.
Customers

The services we provide are distributed among a number of customers, however a loss of a significant customer or a few significant customers in a short period of time could have a significant impact on our business and could materially reduce revenues. However, the services we provide directly to our customers are multi-year contracts with automatic renewals for at least a year, unless at least ninety (90) days’ notice is served to end the contract at the end of the current term. This provides time for us to adjust our resources accordingly and minimize the impact to cash flow. The services that we provide to our larger customers are typically critical to their operations and a termination of our services and therefore have a high renewal rate. The volume of work performed for specific customers is likely to vary from month to month, but these are typically not material variances.

Competition

The markets for our services are highly competitive, characterized by a large number of participants and subject to rapid change. Competitors may include systems integration firms, contract programming companies, application software companies, cloud computing service providers, traditional consulting firms, professional services groups of computer equipment companies, infrastructure management and outsourcing companies and boutique digital companies. Our direct competitors in large accounts include, among others, Accenture, Atos, Capgemini, Deloitte Digital, DXC Technology, Unisys, HCL Technologies, IBM Global Services, Infosys Technologies, NTT Data, Tata Consultancy Services, Unisys and Wipro. In addition, we compete with numerous smaller local companies in the various geographic markets in which we operate.

The principal competitive factors affecting the markets for our services include the provider’s reputation and experience, vision and strategic advisory ability, digital services capabilities, performance and reliability, responsiveness to customer needs, financial stability, corporate governance and competitive pricing of services. Accordingly, we rely on the following to compete effectively:


· | investments in state-of-the-art technologies; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | our recruiting, training and retention model; 
· | our 24/7 remote global service delivery model; 
· | an entrepreneurial culture and approach to our work; 
· | strategic partnerships with global service providers; 
· | customer referrals; 
· | investment in process improvement and knowledge capture;

· | continual service improvement, project management capabilities and technical expertise. 

Intellectual Property

We provide value to our customers based, in part, on our proprietary business processes, methodologies, reusable knowledge capital and other intellectual property (“IP”) assets. We recognize the importance of IP and its ability to differentiate us from our competitors. We seek IP protection for some of our innovations and rely on a combination of IP laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our IP and our brand. We have registered, and applied for the registration of, U.S. and international trademarks, service marks, domain names and copyrights. While our proprietary IP rights are important to our success, we believe our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular IP right, or any particular group of patents, trademarks, copyrights or licenses.
Employees

We had 45 employees at the end of 2021. We are not party to any collective bargaining agreements.
