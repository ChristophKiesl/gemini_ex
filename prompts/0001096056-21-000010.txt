We have a global presence, operating 16 manufacturing plants in the U.S., the U.K., Canada and China, of which four relate to discontinued operations and also have a joint venture in Japan. We employ approximately 1,400 people, including temporary staff, of which approximately 200 relate to discontinued operations. In 2020, our net sales from continuing operations were $324.8 million (2019: $373.4 million, 2018: $401.9 million) and our net income from continuing operations was $20.8 million (2019: $8.7 million, 2018: $27.7 million).
Luxfer operates in two business segments - Elektron and Gas Cylinders.
Elektron Segment
Our Elektron Segment focuses on specialty materials based primarily on magnesium and zirconium. In 2020, sales from our Elektron Segment represented approximately 56% (2019: 59%, 2018: 62%) of our consolidated net sales from continuing operations. Our top ten customers represented 38% of segment sales. No customer represented 10% or more of our Elektron Segment sales.
Key product lines include: 
•Advanced lightweight, corrosion-resistant and heat- and flame-resistant magnesium alloys including our dissolvable SoluMag® alloy. 
•Magnesium powders used in countermeasure flares that protect aircraft from heat-seeking missiles and also for heating pads for self-heating meals used by the military and emergency-relief agencies.
•High-performance zirconium-based materials and oxides used as catalysts and in the manufacture of advanced ceramics, fiber-optic fuel cells, and many other performance products. 
•Magnesium, copper, and zinc photoengraving plates for graphic arts and luxury packaging. 
Gas Cylinders Segment
Our Gas Cylinders Segment manufactures and markets specialized, highly-engineered cylinders using carbon composites and aluminum alloys. In 2020, sales from our Gas Cylinders Segment represented approximately 44% (2019: 41%, 2018: 38%) of our consolidated net sales. Our top ten customers represented 63% of segment sales. One customer represented 15% and another represented 14% of our Gas Cylinders Segment sales with no other customer greater than 10%.
Key product lines include:
•Carbon composite cylinders for self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), used by firefighters and other emergency-responders. Our products are also used by scuba divers and personnel in potentially hazardous environments such as mines.
•Cylinders used for containment of oxygen and other medical gases used by patients, healthcare facilities and laboratories.
•Carbon composite cylinders for compressed natural gas (CNG) and hydrogen containment in alternative fuel (AF) vehicles. 
Our Superform aluminum superplastic forming business operating from sites in the U.S. and the U.K, and our U.S. aluminum gas cylinder business were historically included in the Gas Cylinders segment. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, we have reflected the results of operations of these businesses as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income for all periods presented, as we look to divest these businesses and exit certain markets. As a result, for all periods presented we have reclassified all income and expenses as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income and the assets and liabilities as held-for-sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
All information included within this section relates to continuing operations, unless otherwise stated
Financial Information about Segments and Geographic Areas
See Note 17 ("Segmental Information") to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our operating segments and our geographic areas.
Suppliers and raw materials
Elektron Segment
Key raw materials used by our Elektron Segment are magnesium, zircon sand and rare earths.
The world demand for magnesium is around one million metric tons per year. China provides about 70% of the world supply. Western primary production is, however, significant, from North American suppliers, Dead Sea Magnesium in Israel, RIMA Industrial in Brazil and two smelters in Russia. We purchase approximately 40% our magnesium needs from China. We use only U.S.-sourced materials for our products sold to the U.S. military, for which U.S. sourcing is mandatory. 
We generally purchase raw materials from suppliers on a spot basis under standard terms and conditions. We have supply contracts in place with U.S. Magnesium for raw material purchases of magnesium ingot for both military and commercial applications. The military contract covers magnesium purchases through December 31, 2023, whereas the commercial contract covers through December 31, 2021.
We purchase and process zircon sand, which is found in heavy-minerals sand, titanium dioxide and other products. Global production of zircon is estimated at approximately 1.5 million metric tons. We source premium-grade zircon sand from suppliers in South Africa and Australia. We also purchase intermediate zirconium chemicals from suppliers in China; the level of these purchases is based on a number of factors, including required properties and relative market prices.
There are 17 rare earth metals that are reasonably common in nature. Usually found mixed together with other mineral deposits, these rare earths have magnetic and light-emitting properties that make them invaluable to high-technology manufacturers. These are ingredients in our zirconium chemical and magnesium alloy products, with our main requirement is for cerium, which we use in automotive catalysis compounds because of its unique oxygen-storage capabilities.
Gas Cylinders Segment
A key material in the Gas Cylinder segment is high-strength carbon fiber used in our composite products. Our main suppliers are Toray and Mitsubishi. In recent years, carbon fiber shortages have occurred from increased demand for commercial aerospace and military applications. Over time, we have built relationships with our suppliers, providing them predictable requirements and fixed-price annual contracts to encourage successful procurement of our required volume of carbon fiber.
In 2020, we purchased approximately 40% of our aluminum from Rio Tinto Alcan and its associated companies, and aluminum represented approximately 40% of the segment's raw material costs in the year.
The price of aluminum has been somewhat volatile in the past and while we pass on most price movements to our customers, sometimes through contractual cost-sharing formulas, doing so can be more difficult or time consuming with our higher-value products.

Seasonality
Historically,we have shutdown periods at most of our manufacturing sites during which we carry out maintenance work. Shutdowns typically last two weeks in the summer and one to two weeks around the year-end holidays, resulting in reduced levels of activity in the second half of the year compared to the first half. Third-quarter and fourth-quarter sales and operating profit can be affected by our own shutdowns and by shutdowns by various industrial customers. In particular, we have found that our fourth-quarter results are generally lower, since many customers reduce production activity from late November through December. However, due to shutdowns at both Luxfer and customer plants in the first half of 2020, we have not seen this similar trend, with results improving during the latter months as demand has increased after the initial lockdowns enforced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We also operate in various geographic areas that are susceptible to bad weather during winter months, such as Calgary, Canada, and various U.S. eastern states. Bad weather can unexpectedly disrupt production and shipments from our manufacturing facilities, which can lead to reduced revenue and operating profits. We also manufacture products that are used in graphic arts and premium packaging, demand for which increases in the run up to the year-end holidays.
Research and Development
Luxfer recognizes the importance of research in materials science and the need to develop innovative new products to meet future needs of customers and to continue providing growth opportunities for the business. Each year, we invest in the development of new products and processes directed towards transportation, defense and emergency response, healthcare and general industrial end-markets. Our product development projects also include utilizing skills of our wider commercial technical sales staff, manufacturing engineers and general management, many of whom are highly qualified scientists and engineers. A large proportion of senior sales and management time is spent overseeing development of products and working with customers on integrating our products and solutions into their product designs.
To provide customers with improving products and services, we invest in new technology and research and employ some of the world's leading specialists in materials science and metallurgy. Our engineers and metallurgists collaborate closely with our customers to design, develop and manufacture our products. We also co-sponsor ongoing research programs at major universities in the U.S., Canada and Europe. Thanks to the ingenuity of our own research and development teams, Luxfer has developed a steady stream of new products, most recently including:

Intellectual Property
Luxfer relies on a combination of patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, proprietary manufacturing processes and design rights, together with non-disclosure agreements and technical measures, to establish and protect proprietary rights in our products. Our Elektron Segment holds key patents related to protected applications, including numerous aerospace alloys and magnesium-gadolinium alloys, as well as patents related to environmental applications, including water-treatment products and our specialized G4 process used to manufacture zirconium-cerium oxides for emissions-control catalysts. The Segment also has patented technology for magnesium-based flameless heater pads used to heat meals and beverages. Key patents held by our Gas Cylinders Segment relate to composites and alloys for pressurized hollow bodies. No individual patent or such intellectual property is considered material to either the Elektron or Gas Cylinders segment.
In certain areas, we rely more heavily upon trade secrets and unpatented proprietary know-how than patent protection in order to establish and maintain our competitive advantage. We generally enter into non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements with our employees and subcontractors, as well as our customers and vendors.
Human Capital Management 
As of December 31, 2020, the Company employed approximately 1,400 people worldwide, including approximately 200 individuals that relate to our discontinued operations. Of the roughly 1,200 employees related to our continuing operations, approximately 700 are employed in the United States and approximately 500 are employed outside the United States. 
Luxfer's workforce is one of our greatest sources of sustainable value. Our ability to deliver on our objectives and build lasting relationships with our customers depends on the capabilities, attraction and retention of the talented individuals who come to work every day.

▪Community Involvement. Through the investment and involvement of our businesses, sites and employees, we leverage our skills and experience to make a difference in the world through community activities, donations, and employee engagement initiatives that are consistently encouraged and sponsored by our Executive Leadership Team. Luxfer and its business units support a wide variety of charitable causes through both volunteer hours and monetary contributions. Among others, our business units have partnered with Air Ambulance Charity, American Red Cross, Boys and Girls Club of Cincinnati, Feed America, the Piedmont Rescue Mission, Pratham, United Way, and the Veterans Food Bank of Calgary. We also participate in annual blood drives, canned food drives, community clean up events, and holiday gift drives. Luxfer encourages all employees to participate in volunteer activities on an individual basis as well. Our Volunteer Time Off (VTO) program was rolled out to US employees and will soon be extended to all Luxfer employees. Full-time employees can volunteer one working day per calendar year toward a non-profit or charitable organization of their choice, and such day is considered paid time off. Further, Luxfer Gas Cylinders has teamed with United Way to implement an Employee Fair Share Program. Employees are encouraged to donate one hour of pay per month to United Way, and, in exchange, Luxfer provides the participant with one additional vacation day. Through the Fair Share Program, Luxfer Gas Cylinders’ Riverside facility donated $35,000 to United Way, which included both employee and company contributions. Moreover, our business units are committed to providing educational opportunities and work experience to students in our communities. We offer a number of internship and apprenticeship opportunities in various fields. We have developed a Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) apprenticeship program to encourage students to pursue careers in STEM fields. 
▪Employee Safety. The safety, health, and well-being of all Luxfer employees and our associates is fundamental to delivering sustainable and positive economic performance. We are committed to being an industry leader in safety, and we foster a culture that integrates safety into all activities. To achieve this, Luxfer has established well-defined health and safety policies and procedures, as well as ongoing employee training, which codify our standards for respecting and protecting our employees, the public, and our associates. We regularly conduct gap analyses and develop safety goals and objectives for all functional business units. We monitor, review, and discuss our performance in respect of these objectives and our policies as part of our enterprise-wide risk management system. Moreover, safety measurements are integrated into the performance evaluations of our Executives, proving our dedication to the health and safety of our employees. We emphasize safe behavior and encourage suggestions, ideas, and observations from our workforce. We have implemented a “safety moment” process, which increases employee awareness to workplace and day-to-day hazards while delivering key messages to reduce or minimize the risk of those hazards causing injury. We strive to begin each meeting with a safety moment, and some of our facilities have reserved time each week for a safety moment. Additional safety efforts include: monthly safety meetings with all employees, safety audits by management, safety audits by selected employees, and the inclusion of safety initiatives as part of select employees' incentive plans. Through these safety efforts, many of our facilities' safety records have improved year-over-year. The Company utilizes a mixture of leading and lagging indicators to assess the health and safety performance of its operations. Lagging indicators include the OSHA Total Recordable Incident Rate ("TRIR") and the Lost Time Accidents (“LTA”). Leading indicators include reporting and closure of all near miss events and safety concerns identified. Reported total workforce numbers include employees and supervised contractors. In fiscal year 2020, the Company had a TRIR of 1.85, an LTA of 8 and 0 work-related fatalities
▪Employee Health and Well-Being Section: Promoting the health and well-being of our employees increases productivity, improves morale, creates a positive work environment, and reduces healthcare costs. Luxfer offers several health and wellness benefits that encourage employees to improve their personal health. For example, we implemented a smoking cessation program in the US, under which employees who successfully complete the 90-day program are rewarded with discounted insurance rates. We also implemented the Luxfer Employee Healthy Lifestyle program in the US, which will soon be available to all Luxfer employees worldwide. The purpose of the program is to encourage employees to take steps towards improving their health by offering some reimbursement for certain gym/fitness center memberships and for weight loss programs/group exercise classes. Furthermore, we provide access to wellness clinics and funded counseling sessions to improve our employees’ physical and mental health. Health and wellness information is regularly provided to our employees through notices posted in readily accessible areas and in our company newsletters to ensure that every employee has an opportunity to take advantage of these benefits. We believe that by supporting our employees’ individual health, we can build a healthier workforce.
