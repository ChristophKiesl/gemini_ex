ITEM 1. BUSINESS
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Form 10-K”), references to the “Company” and to “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Parabellum Acquisition Corp. References to our “Sponsor” refer to Parabellum Acquisition Partners, LLC, an affiliate of Mr. Narbeh Derhacobian, our Executive Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President and Secretary, and Mr. Ron Shelton, our Chief Financial Officer.
Parabellum Acquisition Corp. is a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on February 5, 2021. The Company was formed for the purpose of effectuating a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses (“business combination”). The Company is an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies.
As of December 31, 2021, the Company had not commenced any operations. All activity for the period of February 5, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021 relates to the Company’s formation and its initial public offering (the “Initial Public Offering”).
The registration statements for the Company’s Initial Public Offering became effective on September 27, 2021 (the “Registration Statement”). On September 30, 2021, the Company consummated the Initial Public Offering of 12,500,000 units (the “Units” and, with respect to the shares of Class A common stock included in the Units sold, the “Public Shares”), at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $125,000,000, which is described in Note 3 to the financial statements included in this Annual Report. On October 15, 2021, the underwriter exercised in full its over-allotment option to purchase additional 1,875,000 Units at a price of $10.00 per Unit.
Each Unit consists of one Public Share and three-quarters (3/4) of a warrant. Each whole warrant is exercisable for one share of Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per full share (each a “Public Warrant”).
Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the sale of 6,225,000 warrants (each, a “Private Placement Warrant” and, collectively, the “Private Placement Warrants”) at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant in a private placement to the Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of $6,225,000, which is described in Note 1 to the financial statements included in this Annual Report. On October 15, 2021, concurrently with the exercise of the over-allotment option by the underwriter, the Sponsor purchased additional 375,000 Private Placement Warrants generating additional aggregate gross proceeds of $375,000.
An aggregate of nine (9) qualified institutional buyers or institutional accredited investors’ groups (collectively, the “Anchor Investors”) were allocated and purchased a total of 11,137,500 Units or 77.5% of the outstanding Units following the Initial Public Offering and exercise of the over-allotment option by the underwriter, for gross proceeds of approximately $111.4 million.
In addition, subject to each Anchor Investor purchasing 100% of the Units allocated to it, in connection with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Sponsor sold a portion of Founder Shares to each Anchor Investor, or an aggregate of 495,000 Founders Shares to all Anchor Investors. The Company estimated the aggregate fair value of these Founder Shares attributable to Anchor Investors to be approximately $2.93 million, or $5.93 per share. Simultaneously with the exercise of the over-allotment option by the underwriter, the Company sold the additional total of 112,500 Founder Shares to the Anchor Investors. The Company estimated the aggregate fair value of these Founder Shares to be approximately $667,125, or $5.93 per share. The excess of the fair value of the Founder Shares was determined to be a contribution from the sponsor for offering costs in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5T. Offering costs were accounted for as described in Note 2 to the financial statements included in this Annual Report.
Following the closing of the Initial Public Offering on September 30, 2021, and the exercise of the over-allotment option by the underwriter on October 15, 2021, an amount of $145,187,500 ($10.10 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants was placed in a trust account (the “Trust Account”).

As of the IPO Date, transaction costs amounted to $10,343,978, consisting of $2,500,000 of underwriting fees, $4,375,000 of deferred underwriting fees, $2,930,399 representing the aggregate fair value of Founder Shares sold to Anchor Investors and $538,579 of other offering costs. The Company’s remaining cash after payment of the Initial Public Offering costs is held outside the Trust Account for working capital purposes. Of the total transaction costs of $10,343,978 as of the IPO date, $9,809,375 was allocated to the Class A common stock and $534,603 was allocated to the Public Warrants.
As of October 15, 2021, transaction costs related to the exercise of the over-allotment option amounted to $1,941,520, consisting of $375,000 of underwriting fees, $656,250 of deferred underwriting fees, $680,802 representing the aggregate fair value of Founder Shares sold to Anchor Investors, and $229,468 of other offering costs. Of the total transaction costs of $1,941,520 related to the exercise of the over-allotment option, $1,865,801 was allocated to the Class A common stock and $75,719 was allocated to the Public Warrants.
The Company’s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a business combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete a business combination successfully. NYSE rules provide that the business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the Trust Account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the signing a definitive agreement to enter a business combination. The Company will only complete a business combination if the post- business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). There is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully effect a business combination.
The Company will provide its holders of the outstanding Public Shares (the “public stockholders”) with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a business combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek stockholder approval of a business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion. The public stockholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially anticipated to be $10.10 per Public Share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations). There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of a business combination with respect to the Company’s warrants.
The Company will proceed with a business combination only if the Company has net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 either prior to or upon such consummation of a business combination and, if the Company seeks stockholder approval, a majority of the shares voted are voted in favor of the business combination. If a stockholder vote is not required by law and the Company does not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation”), conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a business combination. If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or the Company decides to obtain stockholder approval for business or other reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If the Company seeks stockholder approval in connection with a business combination, the holders of the Company’s shares prior to the Initial Public Offering (the “initial stockholders”) have agreed to vote their Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5 to our financial statements) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of approving a business combination. Additionally, each public stockholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or don’t vote at all.
Notwithstanding the above, if the Company seeks stockholder approval of a business combination and it does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% or more of the Public Shares, without the prior consent of the Company.

The Sponsor has agreed (a) to waive its redemption rights with respect to its Founder Shares and Public Shares held by it in connection with the completion of a business combination, (b) to waive its liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares if the Company fails to complete a business combination by March 30, 2023, (c) not to propose an amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (i) to modify the substance or timing of the Company’s obligation to allow redemption in connection with the Company’s initial business combination or to redeem 100% of its Public Shares if the Company does not complete a business combination by March 30, 2023 or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity, unless the Company provides the public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment, or (iii) in the context of a tender offer made by the Company to purchase Public Shares.
The Company will have until March 30, 2023 to complete a business combination (the “Combination Window”). If the Company does not complete a business combination within the Combination Window, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company’s remaining stockholders and the Company’s board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Company’s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to the Company’s warrants, which will expire worthless if the Company fails to complete a business combination within the Combination Window.
The Sponsor has agreed to waive its liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares if the Company fails to complete a business combination within the Combination Window. However, if the Sponsor acquires Public Shares in or after the Initial Public Offering, such Public Shares will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account if the Company fails to complete a business combination within the Combination Window. The underwriter has agreed to waive its rights to its deferred underwriting commission (see Note 6 to our financial statements) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a business combination within the Combination Window and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the Initial Public Offering price per Unit ($10.00).
In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed to be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (1) $10.10 per Public Share or (2) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay our taxes. This liability will not apply with respect to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account and except as to any claims under the Company’s indemnity of the underwriter of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (except the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account.
