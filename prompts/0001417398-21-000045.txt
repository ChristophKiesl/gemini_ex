Item 1.        BUSINESS

In this section of the Form 10-K, we provide you a general overview of the Company, including a high-level review of our reportable segments and how we operate. We then present our reportable operating segments in greater detail, including the products we manufacture and sell, how those products are distributed and to whom, with whom we compete, the key inputs to production, and an explanation of our business strategies.  We also provide you information on any key patents, trademarks, 
and regulatory matters important to our business.  Finally, we provide you a brief background on our executive officers so that you can understand their experience and qualifications.

GENERAL
Hillenbrand (www.Hillenbrand.com) is a global diversified industrial company with multiple leading brands that serve a wide variety of industries around the world. Hillenbrand’s portfolio is composed of three reportable operating segments: Advanced Process Solutions, Molding Technology Solutions, and Batesville®. Advanced Process Solutions operating companies design, develop, manufacture, and service highly engineered industrial equipment and systems around the world. Molding Technology Solutions is a global leader in highly engineered and customized equipment and systems and service in plastic technology and processing. Batesville is a recognized leader in the death care industry in North America. 
Hillenbrand was incorporated on November 1, 2007, in the state of Indiana and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “HI” on April 1, 2008.  “Hillenbrand,” “the Company,” “we,” “us,” “our,” and similar words refer to Hillenbrand, Inc. and its subsidiaries unless context otherwise requires. 
Although Hillenbrand has been a publicly traded company since 2008, the businesses owned by Hillenbrand have been in operation for many decades.
Between 2010 and 2018, Hillenbrand completed acquisitions of multiple companies that currently comprise the Advanced Process Solutions reportable operating segment. As discussed in Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K, on November 21, 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of Milacron Holdings Corp. (“Milacron”) through a merger of its wholly-owned subsidiary with and into Milacron, resulting in ownership of 100% of Milacron common stock that was issued and outstanding after the acquisition. The acquisition has provided Hillenbrand with increased scale and meaningful product diversification, enhancing its ability to serve customers with expanded capabilities across the plastics value chain. 
The Molding Technology Solutions reportable operating segment, which includes Milacron, and the Advanced Process Solutions reportable operating segment have complementary product lines with excellent positions across the plastics value chain. This provides the opportunity to leverage and combine our shared technologies and capabilities to create innovative solutions that will have a positive impact for our customers around the world and provide new profitable growth opportunities for Hillenbrand in areas such as biodegradable plastics and recycling. We have an outstanding global footprint, which we expect to leverage to accelerate geographic and aftermarket growth. We believe our combined scale and purchasing power will generate procurement savings across the entire enterprise. Our complementary business process capabilities enable us to implement best practices across key functional areas to improve both our efficiency and effectiveness. Finally, the Hillenbrand Operating Model (“HOM”) provides a clear methodology and set of tools to improve our businesses. Implementing the model at Milacron helps us achieve our strategic goals and build a strong foundation for the future.
Divestitures
On March 30, 2020, the Company completed the divestiture of its Cimcool business (“Cimcool”), which represented the former Fluid Technologies reportable segment of Milacron before its acquisition by the Company. The results of operations and cash flows of the Company include Cimcool from November 21, 2019 through March 30, 2020.
Following the acquisition of Milacron, and as a result of our regular review of our portfolio, in 2020 we identified certain smaller businesses that we no longer believed to be a strategic fit within our portfolio. As a result, we announced in August 2020 our decision and intent to exit the TerraSource Global and flow control businesses. The Company has now completed these announced divestitures. On December 31, 2020, the Company completed the divestiture of Red Valve. The results of operations and cash flows of the Company include Red Valve through December 31, 2020. On March 10, 2021, the Company completed the divestiture of ABEL. The results of operations and cash flows of the Company include ABEL through March 10, 2021. On October 22, 2021, the Company completed the divestiture of TerraSource Global. As this divestiture occurred after the end of the fiscal year, the results of operations and cash flows of the Company for all periods presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K include TerraSource Global. For further information, see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K.
Acquisitions
Acquisitions remain an important part of our strategy. We look to invest in acquisitions that we believe can make our businesses stronger and accelerate profitable growth. We are committed to a disciplined approach, with a goal to ensure the investments we make align with our strategy to create value for our shareholders.

How We Operate
We strive to provide superior return for our shareholders, exceptional value for our customers, and great professional opportunities for our employees, and to be responsible to our communities through deployment of the HOM. The HOM is a consistent and repeatable framework designed to produce sustainable and predictable results.  The HOM describes our mission, vision, values and mindset as leaders; applies our management practices in Strategy Management, Segmentation, Lean, Talent Development, and Acquisitions; and prescribes three steps (Understand, Focus, and Grow) designed to make our businesses both bigger and better.  Our goal is to continue developing Hillenbrand as a world-class global diversified industrial company through the deployment of the HOM.
Our strategy is to leverage our historically strong financial foundation and the implementation of the HOM to deliver sustainable profit growth, revenue expansion and substantial free cash flow and then reinvest available cash in new growth initiatives focused on building platforms with leadership positions in our core markets and near adjacencies, both organically and inorganically, in order to create shareholder value. 
In fiscal 2021, we began aligning sustainability with the HOM. We believe sustainability to be a source of value creation that must be aligned with the core strategy of the Company. We expect to continue developing this part of our strategy as we grow in our sustainability practice. Among other things, we believe climate change will require meaningful action on a global scale, and we expect that further developing our understanding of our energy consumption and emissions will be an important part of examining the challenges posed by climate change, as well as continuing to develop our sustainability strategy. To date, our costs relating to addressing climate change have not been material.
Human Capital Resources
Employee Profile
At September 30, 2021, we had approximately 10,500 employees worldwide. Approximately 3,800 employees were located within the United States (“U.S.”) and 6,700 employees were located outside of the U.S., primarily throughout Europe and Asia. Approximately 66% of our workforce within the U.S. is composed of skilled and unskilled labor, and the remaining population includes administrative and support staff, and technical engineers that design, build, install and service our highly engineered industrial equipment.
Approximately 2,200 employees in North America and Europe work under collective bargaining agreements. Hillenbrand strives to maintain satisfactory relationships with all its employees, including the unions and workers’ councils representing those employees. As a result, we have not experienced a significant work stoppage due to labor relations in more than 20 years.
Health and Safety
The health and safety of our employees is our highest priority, and this is consistent with our operating philosophy. To better understand employee safety at the site level, we have developed safety scorecards and share best practices between sites. We currently collect scorecard information primarily from Batesville and Advanced Process Solutions sites in the U.S., but have plans to expand. Our newly reorganized Health & Safety Council is composed of representatives from across the Company and coordinates health and safety matters like our scorecards. This Council is responsible for driving and implementing a uniform Health & Safety approach across the Company. This Council provides an opportunity to share best practices and allows for more collaboration for unique and innovative solutions to other challenges shared amongst the group. In addition to common lagging indicators, such as injury performance, the scorecards highlight leading indicators such as safety observations and near-misses, as well as other proactive actions taken at the site to ensure worker safety.
We continue to prioritize health and safety while responding to the changing dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic around the globe. Our responses have included:
•Encouraging employee vaccination and sponsoring vaccine clinics;
•Initiating regular communication regarding impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including health and safety protocols and procedures;
•Implementing protocols to address actual and suspected COVID-19 cases and potential exposure;
•Adding work from home flexibility where able to do so;
•Establishing new physical distancing procedures;
•Adjusting attendance policies to encourage those who are sick to stay home;
•Increasing cleaning protocols across all locations; and
•Restricting all domestic and international non-essential travel for all employees.
All of our companies manufacture products deemed essential to the critical infrastructure, including health and safety, food and agriculture, and energy, and as a result, the majority of our production sites continued operating during the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, we have invested in creating physically safe work environments for our employees.
Total Rewards
As part of our compensation philosophy, we believe that we must offer and maintain market competitive total rewards programs for our employees in order to attract and retain superior talent. These programs not only include base wages and incentives in support of our pay for performance culture, but also health, welfare, and retirement benefits. We focus many programs on employee wellness and have implemented solutions including onsite wellness centers, mental health support, telemedicine, and healthy weight loss programs. We believe that these solutions have helped us successfully manage healthcare and prescription drug costs for our employee population.
In the U.S., the Company matches contributions to a tax-qualified defined contribution savings plan (the “Savings Plan”) for all eligible employees not accruing legacy pension benefits, in an amount equal to 50 cents for every dollar contributed by the employee until the employee contributions reach six percent of his or her eligible compensation. Additionally, whether or not such employees contribute to the Savings Plan, the Company provides an automatic Company contribution per pay period to the Savings Plan for all such employees. All contributions by employees and the automatic Company contribution are fully vested immediately. The Company matching contributions do not vest until after three years of credited service, at which point further Company matching contributions vest immediately when made. Employees are encouraged to participate in their own retirement savings. We no longer provide new pension benefits for U.S. employees, but continue pensions in other jurisdictions, where required by law.
Talent
Talent Development is one of the pillars of the HOM, and succession planning for critical roles is a cornerstone of our talent program. Our key talent philosophy is to develop talent from within and supplement with external hires. This approach has yielded a deep understanding among our employee base of our businesses, our products, and our customers, while adding new employees and ideas in support of our continuous improvement mindset. We believe that our average employee tenure across the globe — 10 years as of the end of the fiscal year 2021 — reflects the engagement of our employees on these topics. Our talent acquisition team uses internal and external resources to recruit highly skilled and talented workers, and we encourage employee referrals for open positions. 
Once employees are on board, development plans are created and monitored for critical roles to ensure progress is made along established timelines. Development plans also intersect with our mission, particularly as we strive to be responsible to our communities. Hillenbrand also actively encourages our leaders and top talent to participate on local non-profit boards through our ‘Get On Board’ initiative. We believe that this helps us increase our commitment to serve the needs of the local communities in which we operate while simultaneously providing leadership development opportunities for our associates.
The Company’s commitment to diversity is embodied in our corporate governance standards, which require members of the Company’s Board of Directors to be diverse in terms of gender and of race and ethnicity, and other characteristics, including background, perspective, knowledge, skills, and experience. Our diversity and inclusion initiatives support our goal that everyone throughout the Company is engaged in creating an inclusive workplace, and we continue to work on building diverse talent pools as part of our recruitment efforts. Specifically, our Compensation Committee added the creation of specific plans to increase workforce diversity as part of our executive management team’s collective performance goals relating to diverse talent pools. We strive to promote human rights, education around sexual harassment, and to build a culture of inclusion through our “respect in the workplace” training across the Company. 
Data Security
Our company approach to data security begins with our corporate culture. Security begins at the top of our organization, where Company leadership consistently communicates the requirements for vigilance and compliance throughout the organization, and then leads by example. The cybersecurity program is led by Hillenbrand’s Chief Information Security Officer, who provides quarterly updates to the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, annual updates to the Board of Directors, and regular reports to the Executive Management Team about the program, including information about cyber risk management governance and the status of ongoing efforts to strengthen security effectiveness. 
We also educate and share best practices globally with our employees to raise awareness of data security threats. As part of our onboarding process, we train all new employees on IT security and maintain an annual retraining for all employees on information security. As part of our training program, we teach employees how to recognize and properly respond to phishing and social engineering schemes. Hillenbrand has deployed a phishing detection system to report suspicious emails, which are flagged for further review, as well as an automated monthly process to retrain employees who do not maintain an acceptable pass rate on our phishing recognition training.
REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS
Advanced Process Solutions

Advanced Process Solutions designs, engineers, manufactures, markets, and services differentiated process and material handling equipment and systems for a wide variety of industries, including plastics, food and pharmaceuticals, chemicals, fertilizers, minerals, energy, wastewater treatment, forest products, and other general industrials.  Advanced Process Solutions uses its strong applications and process engineering expertise to solve problems for customers.  Its highly engineered capital 
equipment and systems offerings require aftermarket service and/or parts replacement, providing an opportunity for ongoing revenue at attractive margins.
In August 2020, we announced our decision and intent to divest TerraSource Global and the flow control businesses. TerraSource Global and the flow control businesses manufactured equipment and systems primarily in the minerals and mining, forest products, and water and wastewater treatment industries. With the divestitures of the TerraSource Global (subsequent to September 30, 2021) and the flow control businesses during fiscal 2021, Advanced Process Solutions has effectively ceased to offer flow control solutions and size reduction equipment.

Advanced Process Solutions:  Products and Services

Advanced Process Solutions’ product portfolio has grown through a series of acquisitions over the past ten years and includes products and services for compounding, extrusion, and material handling, as well as screening and separating. During the fiscal year, the Advanced Process Solutions’ product portfolio also included flow control and size reduction equipment, all of which have been divested. Advanced Process Solutions’ product lines are supported by aftermarket parts and services, which represented approximately 31% of Advanced Process Solutions’ total net revenue during 2021. Products are offered under brand names that are recognized among the leaders in their respective categories. 
•Compounding, Extrusion, and Material Handling Equipment, and Equipment System Design

◦Twin screw compounding and extrusion machines range from small laboratory compounding machines to high performance, high throughput extrusion systems. Small and mid-sized compounders are used by customers in engineered plastics, masterbatch, PVC, recycling, biodegradable products, and other applications for the plastics, chemical, food, and pharmaceutical industries.  Extrusion systems are sold to customers in multiple industries.  All of these extrusion products are sold under the Coperion® brand.
◦Material handling equipment includes pneumatic and hydraulic conveying equipment for difficult-to-move materials; high-precision feeders that can operate at both very high and very low fill rates; blenders for pellets and powders; and rotary valves, diverter valves, and slide-gate valves used for feeding, dosing, discharge, and distribution during pneumatic conveying.  The proprietary equipment is highly engineered and designed to solve the needs of customers for customized solutions.  Material handling equipment is sold to a variety of industries, including plastics, food and pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and minerals.  These products are sold under the Coperion® and Coperion K-Tron® brands.
◦Compounding, extrusion, and material handling equipment can be sold as a complete system, where strong application and process engineering expertise is used to design and create a broad system solution for customers.  Systems can range from a single manufacturing line to large scale manufacturing lines and turnkey systems.  Larger system sales are generally fulfilled over 18 to 24 months.  Some portion of revenue for large system sales typically comes from third-party-sourced products that carry only a small up-charge. As a result, margin percentages tend to be lower on these large system sales when compared to the rest of the reportable operating segment.  
•Screening and Separating Equipment

◦Screening and separating equipment sorts dry, granular products based on the size of the particles being processed.  This equipment is sold under the Rotex® and BM&M® brands to customers in a variety of industries including proppants, fertilizers, chemicals, agricultural goods, plastics, forest products, and food processing. A majority of the equipment uses a unique technology based on a specific gyratory-reciprocating motion that provides an optimal material distribution on the screens, gentle handling of particles, and accurate separations.
•Aftermarket parts and service 

◦Aftermarket parts and service are a major component of most of Advanced Process Solutions’ product lines.  Service engineers and technicians are located around the globe to better respond to customers’ machines and systems service needs.  Advanced Process Solutions offers its customers services such as consulting, training, maintenance and repairs, spare parts, and modernization solutions.  
Advanced Process Solutions:  Sales, Distribution, and Operations

Advanced Process Solutions sells equipment and systems throughout the world using a combination of direct sales and a global network of independent sales representatives and distributors.  A part of Advanced Process Solutions’ sales is made through independent sales representatives who are compensated by commission.  

Equipment and systems orders are often for unique, engineered-to-order items. Products are either assembled and tested at an Advanced Process Solutions facility and then shipped to a customer or are assembled at the customer’s desired location.

We expect that future net revenue associated with Advanced Process Solutions will be influenced by order backlog because of the lead time involved in fulfilling engineered-to-order equipment for customers. Backlog represents the amount of consolidated revenue that we expect to realize on contracts awarded to Advanced Process Solutions. Though backlog can be an indicator of future net revenue, it does not include projects and aftermarket orders that are booked and shipped within the same quarter.  The timing of order placement, size of order, extent of customization, and customer delivery dates can create fluctuations in backlog and revenue.  Revenue attributable to backlog may also be affected by foreign exchange fluctuations for orders denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars or by provisions for cancellation, termination, or suspension at the discretion of the customer.
Advanced Process Solutions:  Customers

Advanced Process Solutions has customers in a wide range of industries, including plastics, food and pharmaceuticals, chemicals, fertilizers, minerals, energy, and forest products.  These customers range from large, Fortune 500 global companies to regional and local businesses.  No one Advanced Process Solutions customer accounted for more than 10% of Hillenbrand’s consolidated net revenue during 2021.  For large or customized orders, customers generally pay a deposit and make progress payments in accordance with the project progress.  Often, long-term relationships are established with these customers.

Advanced Process Solutions’ sales are diversified by end markets, and further penetration of these end markets is an important element of its strategy. Geographically, approximately 26% of Advanced Process Solutions’ net revenue in 2021 came from the Americas, 46% from Asia, and 28% from EMEA (Europe, the Middle East, and Africa).
We believe that long-term growth for this segment is driven by megatrends such as a rapidly growing middle class in China and India and a growing global population, resulting in rising demand for products sold in many of the end markets that Advanced Process Solutions serves, including durable plastic goods and food.  These trends include increased use of lightweight plastics in the automotive industry to improve fuel efficiency; more effective packaging in emerging markets to improve food shelf life, freshness, and safety; a variety of applications in the medical space designed to improve safety, drug and therapy delivery, and durability; increased use of engineered plastics in construction that are more durable, lightweight and require little maintenance; increased use of biopolymers to help preserve the environment; and more sustainable food sources such as plant-based proteins. Additionally, we expect Advanced Process Solutions to be able to leverage its technical know-how to win in emerging end markets such as recycling and biodegradable plastics. While overall demand for these products is expected to increase over the long run, we expect short-term periodic fluctuations in demand from time-to-time.

Advanced Process Solutions:  Competition

Advanced Process Solutions holds leading positions in key industries and has strong brand name recognition because of its commitment to serving the broad needs of customers through the design and quality of products, extensive application and process engineering expertise, product support services, and its unique ability to provide compounding, extrusion and material handling equipment as a complete system that optimizes output, quality, and energy efficiency to achieve a lower overall cost of ownership for its customers. 
Advanced Process Solutions brands face strong competition in the markets where they compete. Competitors range in size from small, privately-held companies serving narrow market segments or geographical areas to larger, well-known global companies serving national and international markets with multiple product lines.  We believe Advanced Process Solutions’ diversification into multiple industries and markets, its base of aftermarket business, and its strong worldwide network of suppliers and dealers will allow it to maintain leadership positions even during economic downturns.
Advanced Process Solutions:  Raw and Component Materials

The manufacturing of the Advanced Process Solutions’ products involves the machining and welding of raw materials (primarily sheet metals and steel) and castings that are assembled with other component parts purchased from third-party suppliers that generally require particular specifications or qualifications. Although most of these raw materials and components are generally available from several sources, some of these items are currently purchased from single sources.  Volatility in the prices Advanced Process Solutions pays for raw materials used in its products has a direct effect on profitability. Advanced Process Solutions regularly takes steps designed to mitigate the impact of volatility in raw and component material prices, including executing Lean initiatives and various pricing and sourcing actions.  In instances where third-party suppliers are depended upon for outsourced products or components, there is risk of customer dissatisfaction with the quality or performance of the products sold due to supplier failure.  In addition, difficulties experienced by third-party suppliers can interrupt the ability to obtain the outsourced product and ultimately to supply products to customers.  We believe Advanced Process Solutions has taken reasonable steps to mitigate recent increases to these risks. See Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for a more in-depth discussion of Risk factors that could impact Advanced Process Solutions’ ability to fulfill customer obligations.

Molding Technology Solutions offers its customers service, consulting, training, maintenance and repairs, spare parts, and retrofits and rebuilds.  
Molding Technology Solutions:  Sales, Distribution, and Operations
Molding Technology Solutions sells equipment and systems throughout the world using a combination of direct sales and a global network of independent sales representatives and distributors.  A part of Molding Technology Solutions’ sales is made through independent sales representatives who are compensated by commission.  
Molding Technology Solutions does not typically have long-term supply agreements with customers, and terms are generally negotiated on an individual order basis. Pricing is set at the time of order, typically on a customized basis for each product. Raw materials and component purchases are managed based on order trends and mid-term contracts with strategic vendors, allowing Molding Technology Solutions to partially mitigate the risk of short-term changes in raw material and components pricing. The majority of hot runner and mold base equipment orders are fulfilled within three months. The majority of injection molding and extrusion equipment orders are fulfilled within twelve months, but we expect some future net revenue associated with injection molding and extrusion equipment will be influenced by order backlog because of the lead time in fulfilling some engineered-to-order products. Backlog represents the amount of consolidated net revenue that we expect to realize on contracts awarded to Molding Technology Solutions. Though backlog can be an indicator of future revenue, it does not include projects and aftermarket parts orders that are booked and shipped within the same quarter. The timing of order placement, size of order, extent of customization, and customer delivery dates can create fluctuations in backlog and revenue. Revenue attributable to backlog may also be affected by foreign exchange fluctuations for orders denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, or by provisions for cancellation, termination, or suspension at the discretion of the customer.
Molding Technology Solutions:  Customers
Molding Technology Solutions has customers in a wide range of industries, including automotive, medical, consumer goods, packaging, construction and electronics. These customers range from large, Fortune 500 global companies to regional and local businesses, including original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), molders and mold-makers. Molding Technology Solutions has long-standing relationships with its largest customers, having served many of them for over 30 years. No one Molding Technology Solutions customer accounted for more than 10% of Hillenbrand’s consolidated net revenue during 2021. Customers purchasing injection molding or extrusion machines generally pay a deposit and make progress payments prior to shipment. 
Molding Technology Solutions’ sales are further diversified by end markets, and continued expansion into these end markets is an important element of its strategy. Geographically, approximately 53% of Molding Technology Solutions’ net revenue in 2021 came from the Americas, 30% from Asia, and 17% from EMEA (Europe, the Middle East, and Africa).
Global population growth, coupled with continued urbanization, increased purchasing power and improved lifestyle in emerging markets has resulted in greater demand for a broad range of finished plastic products in many segments of the economy, including automotive, medical, construction and consumer products. We believe Molding Technology Solutions’ strong global presence positions it well to benefit from this growth. Molding Technology Solutions has made significant investments in China and India in order to capitalize on the projected growth in plastics in these markets.
Molding Technology Solutions: Competition
Molding Technology Solutions holds leading positions in key industries because of design and quality of products, extensive application and process engineering expertise, product support services, brand name recognition, and commitment to serving the broad needs of customers. 
Molding Technology Solutions brands face strong competition in the markets where they compete. Competitors range in size from small, privately-held companies serving niche industries or geographical areas to larger, well-known global companies serving national and international markets with multiple product lines.  We believe Molding Technology Solutions’ leading product quality and design inclusion in a number of flagship products, diversification into multiple industries and markets, its base of aftermarket parts business, and its strong worldwide network of suppliers and dealers will allow it to maintain leadership positions even during economic downturns.
Molding Technology Solutions:  Raw and Component Materials
Steel, which Molding Technology Solutions sources both directly and indirectly through its component suppliers, is the primary material used in the manufacturing of its products. Molding Technology Solutions does not enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge its commodity price risk and currently does not have a significant number of long-term supply contracts with key suppliers. Molding Technology Solutions has developed a global network of reliable, low-cost suppliers in order to secure its supply needs.
Volatility in the prices Molding Technology Solutions pays for raw materials used in its products, including sheet metals and steel, has a direct effect on profitability. Molding Technology Solutions regularly takes steps designed to mitigate the impact of volatility in raw and component material prices, including executing Lean initiatives and various pricing and sourcing actions. Where possible, Molding Technology Solutions seeks alternative sources and, in some situations, is able to reformulate product with alternative materials without impacting performance, environmental, and health and safety features. We believe that Molding Technology Solutions has taken reasonable steps to mitigate recent increases to these risks. See Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for a more in-depth discussion of Risk factors that could impact Molding Technology Solutions’ ability to source the necessary materials to fulfill customer obligations.

As the needs of funeral professionals and consumers have evolved, Batesville has expanded its offerings with innovative products, value-added services, and digital tools to help funeral directors assist families in creating meaningful services.  Today, the company provides solutions under three primary platforms: (1) Burial Solutions, which includes burial caskets and accounts for the majority of Batesville’s net revenue, (2) Cremation Options®, and (3) Technology Solutions. 
•Burial Solutions
◦As a recognized leader in the death care industry in North America, Batesville has been on the forefront of product innovation for more than 80 years. The company has introduced new interior and exterior design elements, materials, finishes, and proprietary features that align with consumer trends and preferences, while adding value for funeral professionals and consumers. Batesville’s product portfolio covers the full spectrum in variety and value, with metal and wood caskets to appeal to different consumers. In addition to its product breadth, Batesville offers training, merchandising, and marketing materials to educate funeral directors and consumers on product and service options.
•Cremation Options®
◦The Cremation Options® platform is focused on helping funeral professionals profitably serve the growing number of consumers choosing cremation.  Batesville offers a broad line of cremation caskets, containers, urns, remembrance jewelry, and keepsakes. As with Burial Solutions, Batesville offers training, merchandising, and marketing resources to support funeral directors and consumers who select cremation. 
•Technology Solutions
◦Batesville’s technology solutions enhance the consumer experience and create business efficiencies for nearly 6,500 funeral homes and cemeteries across North America. The company offers a suite of integrated, easy-to-use technology products and services, including funeral home websites, e-commerce solutions, digital selection and arrangement software, and business management systems for funeral homes and cemeteries.
Batesville also offers an expansive assortment of personalization and memorialization elements that can be incorporated into products and services to capture the individuality of the loved one and create a unique and meaningful experience for the family. Personalization is available on both burial and cremation products using Batesville’s proprietary LifeSymbols® designs, LifeStories® medallions and keepsakes, LifeView® panels, embroidered tribute panels, and MemorySafe® Drawer. Funeral directors can also create themed obituaries, personalize video tributes, and provide other tailored offerings for families using Batesville’s web technology.
Batesville:  Sales, Distribution, and Operations
Batesville-branded caskets are marketed by a direct sales force and through digital channels only to licensed funeral professionals operating licensed funeral establishments throughout the U.S., Puerto Rico, Canada, Mexico, and Australia.  Batesville also markets its products to select independent distribution facilities as well as full-service funeral establishments offering funeral products in conformance with state law in states that do not have specific licensing requirements.
Batesville has sales contracts in place with certain national death care service providers and also serves approximately 11,500 independent, privately owned funeral homes across North America.  None of Batesville’s customers accounted for more than 10% of Hillenbrand’s consolidated net revenue during 2021.
Batesville:  Customer Preferences and Demographics
The death of a family member causes most people to seek the services of a state-licensed funeral director.  Although caskets and urns can be purchased from a variety of sources, including internet sellers and casket stores, the overwhelming majority of consumers who arrange a funeral purchase these products directly from a funeral home. Historically, consumer spending on caskets and urns has not kept pace with inflation, negatively impacting product mix. This macroeconomic trend in consumer spending may continue, which would result in mix decline in the foreseeable future.
Demand for Batesville products and services is partially impacted by a few key external factors: U.S. and Canadian population demographics, the number of deaths annually, and the rate at which consumers select cremation. The combination of these primary factors has negatively impacted the burial volume trend over the past several decades, although periodic fluctuations in mortality rates such as seasonal outbreaks of illnesses or a pandemic can also impact demand and net revenue in a given quarter and year. As a percentage of total deaths, the estimated cremation rate at the end of calendar 2020 was approximately 56.1% in the U.S. and 73.1% in Canada (Source: Cremation Association of North America).  
Batesville:  Competition
Batesville is a recognized leader in the death care industry, competing with several national and regional casket manufacturers, as well as more than 100 independent casket distributors, most of whom serve fairly narrow geographic segments.  Some non-traditional death care providers, such as large discount retail stores, casket stores, and internet casket retailers also sell caskets directly to consumers.  The industry has seen foreign manufacturers, mostly from China, import caskets into the U.S. and Canada.  It is estimated that sales from these non-traditional and foreign providers collectively currently represent less than 10% of total casket sales in North America. We expect declining casket demand and existing domestic over-capacity to continue to put added economic pressures on casket manufacturers and distributors. 
Batesville:  Raw Materials and Working Capital
Batesville uses carbon and stainless steel, copper and bronze sheets, wood, fabrics, finishing materials, plastic, and zinc in the manufacture of its caskets.  Although most of these raw materials are generally available from several sources, some are currently procured from a single source.
Volatility in raw material prices due to inflation or tariffs, including steel, fuel, and petroleum-based products, has a direct effect on Batesville’s profitability.  The company generally does not engage in hedging transactions for these purchases but does enter into fixed-price supply contracts at times.  Batesville regularly takes steps designed to mitigate the impact of volatility in raw material and fuel prices, including executing Lean initiatives and various sourcing actions. Although most of these raw materials and components are generally available from several sources, some of these items are currently purchased from single sources. We believe that Batesville has taken reasonable steps to mitigate recent increases to these risks. See Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for a more in-depth discussion of Risk factors that could impact Batesville’s ability to source the necessary materials to fulfill customer obligations.
Most of Batesville’s sales are made pursuant to supply agreements with its customers, and historically it has instituted annual price adjustments to help offset some, but not necessarily all, raw material cost increases.
Batesville maintains an adequate level of working capital to support the needs of its business. There are no unusual industry practices or requirements affecting working capital that are significant to understanding Batesville’s business.  
Batesville:  Strategy
While we believe there are opportunities to generate additional revenue within a wider range of death care products and services, sustaining volume in the burial casket space continues to be a top priority.  Batesville’s leadership team is focused on three strategic initiatives to sustain burial volume and support profitability:
•Grow leadership position in the death care industry
•Focus on building and delivering value propositions that align with the needs of each customer segment to continue Batesville’s mission of helping families honor the lives of those they love®.
•Utilize technology to enhance consumer experience and create efficiencies for customers
•Offer a suite of integrated, easy-to-use technology products and services.
•Use the HOM principles and tools to strengthen our leadership position and maintain an optimal cost structure to support profitability
•Continually improve processes to be more consistent and efficient and to yield industry leading quality products and services that our customers value.
HILLENBRAND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

We own a number of patents on our products and manufacturing processes and maintain trade secrets related to manufacturing processes.  These are important patents and trade secrets, but we do not believe any single patent or trade secret, or related group of patents or trade secrets is of material significance to our business as a whole. We also own a number of trademarks and service marks relating to products and services which are of importance.  We believe the marks Coperion®, Coperion K-Tron®, TerraSource Global®, Pennsylvania Crusher®, Gundlach®, Jeffrey Rader®, K-Tron®, Rotex®, BM&M® were material to our Advanced Process Solutions reportable segment for the year ended September 30, 2021.  As discussed above, with the divestiture of TerraSource Global subsequent to September 30, 2021, Advanced Process Solutions no longer owns the TerraSource Global®, Pennsylvania Crusher®, Gundlach®, and Jeffrey Rader® marks. We believe the marks Milacron®, DME® and Mold-Masters® are material to our Molding Technology Solutions reportable operating segment. We believe the trademark Batesville® is material to our Batesville reportable operating segment.

Our ability to compete effectively depends, to an extent, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our intellectual property. In the past, certain of our products have been copied and sold by others and could continue to be.  Hillenbrand vigorously seeks to enforce its intellectual property rights.  However, we may not be sufficiently protected by our various patents, trademarks, and service marks, and they may be challenged, invalidated, cancelled, narrowed, or circumvented.  Beyond that, we may not receive the pending or contemplated patents, trademarks, or service marks for which we have applied or filed.

HILLENBRAND REGULATORY MATTERS

Advanced Process Solutions, Molding Technology Solutions, and Batesville reportable operating segments are subject to a variety of federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental, health, and safety concerns, including the handling, storage, discharge, and disposal of hazardous materials used in or derived from our manufacturing processes.  We are committed to operating all our businesses in a manner that protects the environment and makes us good corporate citizens in the communities in which we operate.  In 2021, we established an Environmental Council, which includes the top operational leaders at each of our businesses to facilitate and drive environmental priorities. The Environmental Council is working to maintain environmental regulatory compliance while enhancing business performance. While we believe that continued compliance with current federal, state, local and foreign laws relating to the protection of the environment will not have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position, future events or changes in existing laws and regulations or their interpretation may require us to make additional expenditures in the future.  The cost or need for any such additional expenditure is not known.
