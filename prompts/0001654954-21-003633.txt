 Business.


 In this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this "Form 10-K"), we refer to RumbleOn, Inc., as "RumbleOn," "RMBL," the "Company," "we," "us," and "our," and similar words. All share amounts included in this Form 10-K have been adjusted for the one-for-twenty reverse stock split of our Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, effective May 20, 2020.
 Overview
 
 RumbleOn, Inc., a Nevada corporation, is a technology driven, motor vehicle dealer and e-commerce platform provider disrupting the vehicle supply chain using innovative technology that aggregates, processes and distributes inventory in a faster and more cost-efficient manner.
 
 We operate an infrastructure-light platform that facilitates the ability of all participants in the supply chain, including RumbleOn, other dealers and consumers to Buy-Sell-Trade-Finance-Transport pre-owned vehicles. Our goal is to transform the way VIN-specific pre-owned vehicles are bought and sold by providing users with the most comprehensive, efficient, timely and transparent transaction experiences. While our initial customer facing emphasis through most of 2018 was on motorcycles and other powersports, in 2019 we enhanced our platform to accommodate nearly any VIN-specific vehicle, and via our October 2018 acquisition of Wholesale, Inc., we made a concerted effort to grow our cars and light truck categories. In August 2020, we launched RumbleOn 3.0, bringing traditional brick and mortar powersports dealers across the country online. Then, in March 2021, we announced a definitive agreement to combine our ecommerce platform with the RideNow powersports group, the nation's largest powersports retailer. Completion of this transaction is subject to a number of conditions, but we expect to close the business combination during the second or third quarter of 2021.

  Recent Developments
 
  RideNow Transaction
 
 On March 12, 2021, we announced a definitive agreement to combine with the RideNow dealership group, the nation’s largest powersports retailer, to create the only omnichannel customer experience in powersports and the largest publicly traded powersports dealership platform (the “RideNow Transaction”). Under the terms of the definitive agreement, we will combine with up to 46 entities operating under the RideNow brand for a total consideration of up to $575.4 million, consisting of $400.4 million of cash and approximately 5.8 million shares of our Class B Common Stock. We will finance the cash consideration through a combination of up to $280.0 million of debt and the remainder through the issuance of new equity. We have has entered into a commitment letter with Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. (“Oaktree”) to provide for the debt financing, subject to certain conditions (the “Oaktree Financing”). The number of shares to be issued to RideNow is subject to increase as described in the definitive agreement. The RideNow Transaction is subject to successful completion of the debt and equity financing, RumbleOn stockholder approval, manufacturer approval, other federal and state regulatory approvals, and other customary closing conditions as described in the definitive agreement. We expect to close the RideNow Transaction during the second or third quarter of 2021. The foregoing description of the definitive agreement and debt financing does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the Plan of Merger and Equity Purchase Agreement, dated March 12, 2021, Registration Rights and Lock-Up Agreement, dated March 12, 2021, Commitment Letter, dated March 12, 2021, and Warrant, dated March 12, 2021, copies of which are incorporated by reference to this report as Exhibits 2.4, 10.33, 10.31 and 4.11. See the section titled Subsequent Events in the MD&A included in this report for a discussion of the RideNow Transaction and Oaktree Financing.
 Our Model
 
 RumbleOn's goal is to disrupt the inefficient, friction-laden pre-owned vehicle supply chain through the use of innovative technology. We have created a modern, technology-based platform to acquire and distribute inventory transparently and efficiently at value-oriented prices. We intend to leverage this platform to maximize the overall profit and return on vehicles that RumbleOn buys/sells for its own account, as well to provide both dealers and consumers technology-based tools, financing and logistics-based solutions to simplify their business or aid them through the complex process of buying/selling a vehicle.
 
 Our model is anchored on powerful technology that enables RumbleOn to efficiently acquire, process (including reconditioning, photos and inspection), market and distribute vehicles to dealers and consumers. Collectively, this allows us to maximize inventory value and reduce inventory risk as we effect the entire vehicle supply chain in a faster and more cost-efficient manner. There are two critical inputs that are key to understanding how we do this: 1) our innovative technology and 2) our inventory management.
 
  Innovative Technology
 
 Technology underpins everything at RumbleOn. If you want to disrupt an industry, you have to have answer two fundamental questions:
 
  1)            
 What can we do to eliminate existing customer pain points?


  2)            
 How do we remove friction from a marketplace?


 We leverage technology to drive change in an industry that is as old as the automobile or motorcycle itself. At a high-level, we believe there are two main areas where leveraging these innovations provides us a competitive advantage and eliminates existing customer pain points and removes friction from a marketplace – 1) our proprietary supply chain and distribution software and 2) and our mobile-first web application strategy.
 
 We utilize internally developed software and real time APIs to look at the overall supply chain and reconfigure inventory for the purpose of acquisition and distribution. Our technology aggregates multiple data sources in real-time, tracking and cataloging inventory across the country.
 
 We analyze real-time market data to inform our acquisition decisions, continually capturing and archiving such data using advanced algorithms, to calibrate pricing and estimate freight and reconditioning expenses. The values are then used in our Cash Offer tool to quickly determine a fair and reasonable, non-negotiable offer.

 Lastly, we continue to enhance our website and mobile application to provide not only a compelling user experience, from the front-end user interface and powerful search tools to enabling secure data, document and payment exchanges between parties, but also to help optimize search engine marketing and lower overall cost of customer acquisition. For example, the RumbleOn app has features such as auto-populating details into the Cash Offer tool when a customer scans their VIN, we introduced simplified uploading of vehicle photos by app users, we integrate technologies to try and block inappropriate content on our Classifieds site, and we are creating fun social experiences like our Road Trip Planner and successful blog campaigns. We announced the launch of RumbleOn 3.0 in August of 2020. At that time, we had more than 18,000 powersport listings on our site, from over 130 dealer locations around the country. We’ve since massively scaled the offering, and currently have more than 50,000 listings from over 300 dealer locations from coast to coast on our platform.
 
 The business combination with RideNow is a natural evolution of our RumbleOn 3.0 strategy. This combination will create the only omnichannel customer experience in powersports and the largest publicly traded powersports dealership platform. With more than 7,000 powersports dealers in the US and 85% of these dealers who own only a single location, this industry remains ripe for consolidation. Our technology, OEM relationships, winning culture and new financial partners make us the partner of choice for dealers around the country. Many of them, like RideNow, will get to know us through RumbleOn 3.0.
 
  Inventory Management
 
 We believe our ability to access and acquire inventory efficiently and cost effectively, from both consumers and dealers, is a key differentiator for RumbleOn. Using pre-owned retail and wholesale vehicle market data obtained from a variety of internal and external data sources, we evaluate a significant number of vehicles daily across both online and traditional auction/dealer-based channels to determine their fit with end-buyer demand, internal profitability targets and our existing inventory needs by make, model, condition and price point.
 
 The supply of pre-owned vehicles is influenced by a variety of factors, including: the total number of vehicles in operation; the rate of new vehicle sales, which in turn generate pre-owned vehicles; the number of pre-owned vehicles sold or remarketed through our consumer and dealer channels; model-year changes; fleet turnover; seasonality; natural disasters; and economic downturns.
 
 As such, we are very focused on nimbly managing our overall inventory and strive to maintain our current average days to sale under 30 days. We believe this not only minimizes potential impacts on profits from the items described above but also provides us significant competitive benefits; namely: i) we have flexibility to adjust our inventory in response to unforeseen market dynamics – such as adverse weather conditions, including tornadoes and hurricanes, or other events or conditions that impact purchasing decisions, including disruptions in the domestic and global economy due to the COVID-19 pandemic (discussed below); and ii) we can make swift decisions to capitalize on market anomalies or leverage arbitrage opportunities that may benefit our volume and margins in a more consistent fashion.
 
 To support our emphasis on inventory management and reduction of capital investment needs, we leverage a robust partner network that manages the reconditioning, inspections and distribution of our inventory. Our current regional partners are located in the cities below:
 
  Cincinnati, OH; Dallas, TX; Las Vegas, NV;
  Atlanta, GA; Statesville, NC; Philadelphia, PA; Nashville, TN;
  Orlando, FL; San Diego, CA; San Francisco, CA;
  West Palm Beach, FL
  
 Every unit of inventory we acquire is posted immediately to both our website and Dealer Direct virtual inventory tool, as well as sent to one of our regional partners who then uploads photos, prepares detailed inspection reports, reconditions the vehicle to a dealer's expectation and sets the vehicle for live auction sale in the near future. If the vehicle is sold to a consumer, it is reconditioned to the appropriate level for the buyer, which reduces unnecessary reconditioning costs and enables us to protect our margin when selling directly to a dealer who might prefer to manage or perform much of the reconditioning to their standards. More importantly, we are able to quickly establish new regional partners as needed to reduce our cost of sales and freight expense while creating more capacity for over-all sales growth. Currently, there are hundreds of potential expansion locations that welcome the opportunity for their business. These are owned by the likes of Cox Automotive (Manheim); Copart (National Powersports Auctions); KARS (Adesa auctions) just to name a few.

  Competitive Positioning
 
 We believe we are disrupting a massive opportunity in the market and unlike others, we are using this data-powered technology to serve consumers, dealers and service providers across the entire supply chain. Our comprehensive offering includes the following:

Dealers | Consumers | Other 
---------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+---------------------
Dealer to Consumer Sales | Consumer to Consumer Sales | Lender Listing Site 
Dealer to Dealer Sales | Online Cash Offers from RumbleOn | Dealer Listing Site 
Online Cash Offers from RumbleOn | Classifieds (including transaction support) | Data Aggregation 
Inventory Management | Finance a Purchase | Auction Locations 
Dealer Branded Cash Offers | Warranty Products | Transport Providers 
Dealer Listing Site | Inspection Services | Inspection Services 
Logistics Support | Logistics Support | Peer-to-Peer Payment



 Presently we are buying and selling our entire inventory and delivering the same customer experience across our websites – rumbleon.com, RumbleOn Dealer Direct and other URL's also represented as powered by RumbleOn - providing us with a strategic advantage of having vertical brands. These solutions exist as separate websites and each fills a gap in the legacy buying and selling experience while taking advantage of vertical search of the same inventory across multiple consumer and dealer channels.
 
 RumbleOn.com is our primary national online consumer facing platform. Consumers can currently get a real Cash Offer for their vehicle as well as purchase vehicles through this website. Customers can pay for their vehicle using cash or they may select from a range of finance options from unrelated third parties such as banks or credit unions, as well as RumbleOn Finance, our own financing platform. Additionally, customers have the option to protect their vehicle with Extended Protection Plans ("EPPs") and vehicle appearance protection products as part of our online checkout process. EPPs include extended service plans which are designed to cover unexpected expenses associated with mechanical breakdowns and guaranteed asset protection, which is intended to cover the unpaid balance on a vehicle loan in the event of a total loss of the vehicle or unrecovered theft as well as other traditional protection products.
 
 RumbleOn Dealer Direct is currently being used by multiple dealers which allows them to leverage the RumbleOn inventory as a virtual inventory of their own at wholesale prices without having to wait for auction day.
 
 Wholesale Inc. and GotSpeed (formerly known as AutoSport), Powered by RumbleOn (as well as any other sub-brands we may utilize) – The significant local brand awareness these parallel sites provide allows us to take advantage of existing organic search benefits and customer goodwill by creating a locally branded website with most of the same functionality as RumbleOn.com.
 
 RumbleOn Classifieds was launched in December 2018 and is a one-stop free listing site for consumers who wish to pursue peer-to-peer transactions, similar to Craigslist. Consumers list the vehicle at the price they wish. RumbleOn then offers both buyers and sellers a suite of option tools to facilitate the transaction process, including assistance with titles, documentation, third-party inspection, financing, funds-transfer, and logistics. Classifieds allows us to not only buy more inventory from unsuccessful listings, but more importantly provide consumers who were unwilling to accept the RumbleOn Cash Offer price an opportunity to stay in the RumbleOn network.
 
 RumbleOn Finance is our wholly owned consumer finance entity that provides vehicle buyers competitive borrowing alternatives fully underwritten internally. During the second half of 2019, RumbleOn Finance began originating finance transactions on powersports.
 
  Our Market / Competition
 
 We participate in both the automotive and powersports markets.

  Automotive
 
 The U.S. used car marketplace is highly fragmented, and we face competition from franchised dealers, who sell both new and used vehicles; independent used car dealers; online and mobile sales platforms; and private parties. There are approximately 18,000 franchised automotive dealerships, which sell both new and used vehicles, as well as approximately 43,000 used car independents in the U.S. according to NADA and Borrell Associates' 2017 Outlook, respectively. Moreover, the top 100 car retailers control approximately 8.6% of the used car market share in 2018 according to Automotive News.
 
 Collectively, there were approximately 273 million registered vehicles in operation in 2018. Additionally, in 2019 automakers sold approximately 17 million new cars and approximately 41 million used cars were sold, many of which were accompanied by trade-ins. Lastly, the National Auto Auction Association and Cox Automotive estimate there are more than 16 million vehicles annual sold through wholesale channels, with approximately 9.6 million sold through auctions , the vast majority of which are run through the two largest auction participants, Manheim and Adesa, 4.9 million dealer-to-dealer and 2.1 direct to consumer or offsite/online.
 
 Based on the large number of new and used vehicles being sold each year, coupled with the relatively small market share of any single used car seller, we believe that both sources of used vehicles, and our ability to sell them, will continue to be sufficient to meet our current and future needs.
 
  Powersports
 
 We currently operate in the powersports and recreational vehicle market with significant scale and breadth of products. The Motorcycle Industry Council estimates that in 2018, 10.1 million U.S. households owned the 12.2 million motorcycles. Of these, 87% of these were on-highway models, our initial targeted segment. According to the Powersports Business 2020 Market Data Book, pre-owned motorcycle registrations were 1 million units in 2019 with new unit sales of approximately 281,179. The owner demographic is favorable to the market outlook as millennials and baby boomers are maturing into the median ranges. The owner group is characterized by brand loyal riding enthusiasts.
 
 Our initial focus was on pre-owned Harley-Davidson motorcycles as it provided a targeted, identifiable segment to establish the functionality of the platform and the RumbleOn brand. Harley-Davidson is a highly regarded and dominant brand in the motorcycle market, (representing approximately 50% market share of new 601cc+ on-road motorcycles according to both Harley-Davidson public filings and the Motorcycle Industry Council) and there were approximately 3.1 million Harley Davidson riders in 2019, up approximately 55,00 from the prior year per the IHS Markit Motorcycles in Operations data. As our business has evolved, we have expanded into other powersports and recreational vehicle with a strong emphasis on the “other" brands of motorcycles (Honda, Yamaha, Kawasaki, Suzuki, etc.), which essentially doubled the available market and is a natural extension as these vehicles are often sold or traded for Harley-Davidson vehicles. The “other" market and dealer profile closely mirror that of the Harley-Davidson market although it is more highly fragmented and the average pre-owned vehicle selling price is less than a pre-owned Harley Davidson. In addition, many of the “other" dealers also retail other powersport vehicles including ATVs, UTVs, snowmobiles and personal watercraft providing RumbleOn an opportunity for product extensions by leveraging existing regional partner relationships.
 
 The ATV, UTV/side-by-side, snowmobile and personal watercraft vehicle, or PWC, markets, are a logical next extension for our platform, as there is significant overlap in the motorcycle dealer base with dealers of these products. According to estimates from the Powersports Business 2020 Market Data Book, approximately 930,000 ATV/UTV/side-by-sides and 55,000 snowmobiles sold world-wide in 2019, and there are estimated to be approximately 1.2 million snowmobiles registered in the United States with another 600,000 in Canada. Lastly, according the Powersports Business 2020 Market Data Book, in 2019 there were more than 73,000 new PWCs sold in the United States and there are currently more than 1.2 million PWCs registered in the United States.

 During the third quarter of 2020 we launched RumbleOn.com version 3.0 consistent with our plan to allow dealers to leverage our marketplace to list their inventory and receive corresponding leads for future fees for things such as cash offers, pre-qualification for lending and many others both present and future. At the request of many dealers and as part of the 3.0 launch, we also released our highly anticipated B2B powersports dealer only marketplace we call Dealer Direct, which enabled us to be the first to offer a pure online solution for dealer-to-dealer transactions in powersports. This online dealer platform has proven to be extremely successful for dealers in the auto segment through a host of providers and, while in the early stages, in 2020 we enrolled in excess of 200 dealers with over 40,000 available listings. Dealer Direct has not only allowed for higher margins on our owned inventory distribution but in future periods will allow for revenue from multiple transaction fees charged to dealers. By aggregating inventory on 3.0 from across the country, we are able to offer dealers access to our host of software solutions to improve their business and put them in a position to participate in pure online transactions and while increase our reach with valuable content and data from the site.
 
 The United States pre-owned powersports and recreational vehicle marketplace is highly fragmented, and we face competition from franchised dealers, who sell both new and pre-owned vehicles; independent dealers; online and mobile sales platforms; and private parties. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our industry are delivering an outstanding consumer experience, competitive sourcing of vehicles, breadth and depth of product selection, and value pricing. Our competitors vary in size and breadth of their product offerings. We believe that our principal competitive advantages in pre-owned vehicle sales includes our ability to provide a high degree of customer satisfaction with the buying experience by virtue of our low, no-haggle prices and our 100% online marketplace platform including our website and mobile web application and our ability to make a cash offer to purchase a vehicle with our customer-friendly sales process and our breadth of selection of the most popular makes and models available on our website. In addition, we believe our willingness to make a cash offer to purchase a customer's vehicle, whether or not the customer is buying a vehicle from us, provides a competitive sourcing advantage for vehicle sales allowing us to offer value-oriented pricing. We believe the principal competitive factors for our ancillary products and services include an ability to offer a full suite of products at competitive prices delivered in an efficient manner to the customer. We compete with a variety of entities in offering these products including banks, finance companies, insurance and warranty providers and extended vehicle service contract providers. We believe our competitive strengths in this category will include our ability to deliver products in an efficient manner to customers utilizing our technology and our ability to partner with key participants in each category to offer a full suite of products at competitive prices. Lastly, additional competitors may enter the businesses in which we will operate.
 
 The supply of pre-owned vehicles, including powersports, automobiles and light trucks, is influenced by a variety of factors, including: the total number of vehicles in operation; the rate of new vehicle sales, which in turn generate pre-owned vehicles; and the number of pre-owned vehicles sold or remarketed through our consumer and dealer channels. Based on the large number of new and used vehicles being sold each year, coupled with the relatively small market share of any single used vehicle seller, we believe that both sources of used vehicles, and our ability to sell them, will continue to be sufficient to meet our current and future needs.
 
  Seasonality
 
 Historically, both the automotive and powersport industries have been seasonal with traffic and sales strongest in the spring and summer quarters. Sales and traffic are typically slowest in the winter quarter but increase typically in February and March, coinciding with tax refunds and improved weather conditions. Given this seasonality, coupled with the fact that we are a growing company, leads us to expect our quarterly results of operations, including our revenue, gross profit, profit/loss, and cash flow to vary significantly in the future, based in part on vehicle buying patterns. Over time, we expect to normalize to seasonal trends in both markets, with the corresponding impact that may result from the overall economic conditions.
 Nashville Tornado
 
 On March 3, 2020, a severe tornado struck the greater Nashville area causing significant damage to our facilities including contents and inventory held for sale. The Company maintains insurance coverage for damage to its facilities and inventory, as well as business interruption insurance. The loss comprises three components: (1) inventory loss, currently assessed by the insurance carrier at approximately $13,000,000; (2) building and personal property loss, primarily impacting our leased facilities, currently assessed by the insurance carrier at $2,783,000; and (3) loss of business income, for which we have coverage in the amount of $6,000,000.

 All three components of our loss claim have been submitted to its insurers. The Company’s inventory claim is subject to a dispute with the carrier as to the policy limits applicable to the loss; however, the insurer has advanced $5,615,268 against the final settlement. The building insurer has agreed to pay $2,778,000 on the building and personal property loss, reflecting a complete recovery, net of $5,000 reflecting our deductible. The insurer has made an interim payment on the building and personal property loss of $2,269,507 to the landlord. The loss of business income claim is ongoing and remains in the process of negotiation, however, the insurer has advanced $250,000 against the final settlement. The Company believes there will be a recovery of all three loss components, however no assurance can be given regarding the amounts, if any, that will be ultimately recovered or when any such recoveries will be made.

  COVID-19 Pandemic
 
 The rapid spread of COVID-19 since March 2020 has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders and shutdowns. These measures have impacted and may further impact all or portions of our workforce and operations, the behavior of our customers, and the operations of our partners, vendors, and suppliers. While the federal and state governments have taken measures to try to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, there is considerable uncertainty regarding such measures and potential future measures. The COVID-19 situation has created an unprecedented and challenging time for our Company. Our current focus is on positioning the Company for a strong recovery when this crisis is over. During 2020 we took steps to reduce our inventory and align our operating expenses to the state of the business. We plan to continue to operate as permitted to support our customers’ needs for reliable vehicles and to provide as many jobs as possible for our associates; however, in April 2020 we laid-off 169 associates. Future restrictions on our access to and utilization of our logistics and distribution network, our corporate offices, the inspection and reconditioning centers of our partners, and/or our support operations or workforce, or similar limitations for our partners, vendors, or suppliers, and restrictions or disruptions of transportation, could further limit our ability to conduct our business and have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects. There is no certainty that measures taken by governmental authorities will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, and our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed.
 Outlook
 
 The COVID-19 pandemic effect on commercial activity and the significant damage sustained to our wholesale automotive business from a tornado in early March 2020 had a significant negative impact on the growth in unit volume and revenue for our powersports, automotive and transportation businesses for the year ended December 31, 2020. Based on the evolving aspects of COVID-19 and uncertainty surrounding its future development, it may continue to have a negative impact on unit volumes and revenue in future periods. Since the significant decrease in demand experienced in early March through mid-April, we have seen monthly unit sales and revenue increase sequentially month-over-month through July 2020. However, during the six-month period ended December 31, 2020, our average days to sale decreased and average selling prices increased as dealers saw high industry-wide market prices. The effect of these higher market prices resulted in lower levels of inventory available to purchase for resale causing a decline in unit sales beginning in September as compared to July and August. This supply and demand imbalance continued to impact the historically seasonally adjusted fourth quarter volume, particularly given the worldwide rise in COVID-19 cases. As the impact of COVID-19 abates over time, we anticipate that unit purchasing levels and sales will return to or exceed levels experienced in the first quarter of 2020 as we increase penetration in existing markets and add new dealers, however we can provide no assurance as to when and how quickly COVID-19 impacts will continue to abate or if spikes in COVID-19 infections will further negatively impact the economy generally or our business.
 
 The extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak ultimately impacts our business, sales, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity will depend on the success of the roll out of the vaccines and the efficacy of the vaccines and other future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Even after the COVID-19 outbreak has subsided, we may continue to experience significant impacts to our business as a result of its global economic impact, including any economic downturn or recession that has occurred or may occur in the future.

  Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights
 
 Our brand image and intellectual property are an important element of our business strategy.  As of December 31, 2020, we have a trademark registration for "RumbleOn" in the United States as well as with the Madrid Protocol, a patent covering near field communications to store and retrieve vehicle information, and various applications pending with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
 Government Regulation
 
 Various aspects of our business are or may be subject, directly or indirectly, to U.S. federal and state laws and regulations. Failure to comply with such laws or regulations may result in the suspension or termination of our ability to do business in affected jurisdictions or the imposition of significant civil and criminal penalties, including fines or the award of significant damages against us and our dealers in class action or other civil litigation.
 State Motor Vehicle Sales, Advertising and Brokering Laws
 
 The advertising and sale of new or pre-owned motor vehicles is highly regulated by the states in which we do business. Although we do not anticipate selling new vehicles, state regulatory authorities or third parties could take the position that some of the regulations applicable to new vehicle dealers or to the manner in which automobiles, powersports and recreational vehicles are advertised and sold generally are directly applicable to our business. If our products and services are determined to not comply with relevant regulatory requirements, we could be subject to significant civil and criminal penalties, including fines, or the award of significant damages in class action or other civil litigation as well as orders interfering with our ability to continue providing our products and services in certain states. In addition, even absent such a determination, to the extent dealers are uncertain about the applicability of such laws and regulations to our business, we may lose, or have difficulty increasing the number of dealers in our network, which would affect our future growth.
 
 Several states have laws and regulations that strictly regulate or prohibit the brokering of motor vehicles or the making of so-called "bird-dog" payments by dealers to third parties in connection with the sale of motor vehicles through persons other than licensed salespersons. If our products or services are determined to fall within the scope of such laws or regulations, we may be forced to implement new measures, which could be costly, to reduce our exposure to those obligations, including the discontinuation of certain products or services in affected jurisdictions. Additionally, such a determination could subject us to significant civil or criminal penalties, including fines, or the award of significant damages in class action or other civil litigation.
 
 In addition to generally applicable consumer protection laws, many states in which we may do business either have or may implement laws and regulations that specifically regulate the advertising for sale of new or pre-owned automobiles, powersports and recreational vehicles. These state advertising laws and regulations may not be uniform from state to state, sometimes imposing inconsistent requirements on the advertiser. If the content displayed on the websites we operate is determined or alleged to be inaccurate or misleading, we could be subject to significant civil and criminal penalties, including fines, or the award of significant damages in class action or other civil litigation. Moreover, such allegations, even if unfounded or decided in our favor, could be extremely costly to defend, could require us to pay significant sums in settlements, and could interfere with our ability to continue providing our products and services in certain states.
 
  Federal Advertising Regulations
 
 The Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") has authority to take actions to remedy or prevent advertising practices that it considers to be unfair or deceptive and that affect commerce in the United States. If the FTC takes the position in the future that any aspect of our business constitutes an unfair or deceptive advertising practice, responding to such allegations could require us to pay significant damages, settlements, and civil penalties, or could require us to make adjustments to our products and services, any or all of which could result in substantial adverse publicity, loss of participating dealers, lost revenue, increased expenses, and decreased profitability.
  
  
8


  
 
  Federal Antitrust Laws
 
 The antitrust laws prohibit, among other things, any joint conduct among competitors that would lessen competition in the marketplace. Some of the information that we may obtain from dealers may be sensitive and, if disclosed inappropriately, could potentially be pre-owned by dealers to impede competition or otherwise diminish independent pricing activity. A governmental or private civil action alleging the improper exchange of information, or unlawful participation in price maintenance or other unlawful or anticompetitive activity, even if unfounded, could be costly to defend and adversely impact our ability to maintain and grow our dealer network.
 
 In addition, governmental or private civil actions related to the antitrust laws could result in orders suspending or terminating our ability to do business or otherwise altering or limiting certain of our business practices, including the manner in which we handle or disclose pricing information, or the imposition of significant civil or criminal penalties, including fines or the award of significant damages against us in class action or other civil litigation.
 
 The foregoing description of laws and regulations to which we are or may be subject is not exhaustive, and the regulatory framework governing our operations is subject to continuous change. The enactment of new laws and regulations or the interpretation of existing laws and regulations in an unfavorable way may affect the operation of our business, directly or indirectly, which could result in substantial regulatory compliance costs, civil or criminal penalties, including fines, adverse publicity, loss of participating dealers, lost revenue, increased expenses, and decreased profitability. Further, investigations by government agencies, including the FTC, into allegedly anticompetitive, unfair, deceptive or other business practices by us, could cause us to incur additional expenses and, if adversely concluded, could result in substantial civil or criminal penalties and significant legal liability.
 
  Employees
 
 As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 157 full time and two part-time employees.
 
  Corporate History
 
 RumbleOn, Inc. was originally incorporated in the State of Nevada in October 2013 as a development stage company under the name Smart Server, Inc. In July 2016, Berrard Holdings Limited Partnership ("Berrard Holdings") acquired 273,750 shares of common stock of the Company from the prior owner of such shares pursuant to an Amended and Restated Stock Purchase Agreement, dated July 13, 2016. The shares acquired by Berrard Holdings represented 99.5% of the Company's then issued and outstanding shares of common stock. Steven Berrard, a director and our Chief Financial Officer, has voting and dispositive control over Berrard Holdings.
 
 In October 2016, Berrard Holdings sold an aggregate of 165,625 shares of the Company's common stock to Marshall Chesrown, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and certain other purchasers.
