Recent Developments
In March of 2020, the spot price of West Texas Intermediate ("WTI") crude oil declined over 50% in response to actual and forecasted reductions in global demand for crude oil due to the COVID-19 pandemic coupled with announcements by Saudi Arabia and Russia of plans to increase crude oil production in an effort to protect market share. OPEC, its members and other state-controlled oil companies ultimately agreed to reduce production following the crude oil price collapse and many operators

shut-in production in the United States in an effort to address rapidly collapsing demand. While crude oil prices have recovered some of their losses since reaching record low levels in April of 2020, the spot price of Brent and WTI crude oil averaged $42 and $39 per barrel during 2020 – down 35% and 31%, respectively, from their comparable 2019 averages. The ultimate magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, the timing and extent of governmental restrictions placing limitations on the mobility and ability to work of the worldwide population, and the related impact on crude oil prices, the global economy and capital markets remains uncertain. While it is difficult to assess or predict with precision the broad future effect of this pandemic on the global economy, the energy industry or us, we expect that the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to adversely affect demand for our products and services in 2021.
Demand for most of our products and services depends substantially on the level of capital expenditures invested in the oil and natural gas industry, which reached 15-year lows in 2020. The decline in crude oil prices, coupled with higher crude oil inventory levels in 2020, caused rapid reductions in most of our customers' drilling, completion and production activities and their related spending on products and services, particularly those supporting activities in the U.S. shale play regions. These conditions have and may continue to result in a material adverse impact on certain customers' liquidity and financial position, leading to further spending reductions, delays in the collection of amounts owed and, in certain instances, non-payments of amounts owed. Additionally, future actions among OPEC members and other oil producing nations as to production levels and prices could result in further declines in crude oil prices, which would prove detrimental, particularly given the weak demand environment for crude oil and associated products caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
Following the unprecedented events commencing in March 2020, we immediately began aggressive implementation of cost reduction initiatives in an effort to reduce our expenditures to protect the financial health of our company, including the following:
•reduced headcount by 32% between December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020;
•reduced capital expenditures in 2020 by 77% compared to 2019;
•reduced annual short-term and long-term incentive awards; and
•consolidated and closed certain facilities.
Given the COVID-19 induced economic destruction, we assessed the carrying value of goodwill and other assets based on the industry outlook regarding overall demand for and pricing of our products and services. As a result of these events, actions and assessments, we recorded the following charges during 2020:
•non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $406.1 million to reduce the carrying value of our reporting units to their estimated fair value;
•non-cash impairment charges of $31.2 million to reduce the carrying value of inventory to its estimated realizable value;
•non-cash impairment charges of $12.4 million to decrease the carrying value of our fixed assets and leases to their estimated realizable value; and
•employee severance and restructuring charges of $9.1 million.
As discussed in more detail under "– Liquidity, Capital Resources and Other Matters – Financing Activities – Revolving Credit Facility," we amended our existing Revolving Credit Facility (as defined herein) during the second quarter of 2020. In connection with this amendment, the Revolving Credit Facility size was reduced from $350 million to $200 million, with advances subject to a monthly borrowing base calculation, in exchange for suspension of the existing financial covenants from July 1, 2020 through March 30, 2021.
On February 10, 2021, as discussed in more detail under "– Liquidity, Capital Resources and Other Matters – Financing Activities – Asset-based Revolving Credit Facility," we entered into a new senior secured credit facility in order to extend maturity, which provides for a $125.0 million asset-based revolving credit facility (the "Asset-based Revolving Credit Facility") under which credit availability is subject to a monthly borrowing base calculation. The Asset-based Revolving Credit Facility matures in February 2025. Concurrent with entering into the Asset-based Revolving Credit Facility, the existing Amended Credit Agreement (as defined herein) was terminated.
In addition, as discussed in more detail under "– Liquidity, Capital Resources and Other Matters – Financing Activities – 1.50% Convertible Senior Notes due February 2023," we opportunistically purchased a total of $34.9 million principal amount of our 1.50% convertible senior notes (the "Notes") for $20.1 million in cash and recognized non-cash gains totaling $10.7 million during 2020.

See Note 3, "Asset Impairments and Other Charges," Note 4, "Details of Selected Balance Sheet Accounts," Note 6, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," Note 7, "Long-term Debt," and Note 8, "Operating Leases," to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K for further discussion.
Our Industry
We provide a broad range of products and services to our customers through each of our business segments. See Note 15, "Segments and Related Information," to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K for financial information by segment along with a geographical breakout of revenues and long-lived assets for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020. Demand for our products and services is cyclical and substantially dependent upon activity levels in the oil and natural gas industry, particularly upon the willingness of our customers to invest capital in the exploration for and development of crude oil and natural gas reserves. Our customers' capital spending programs are generally based on their outlook for near-term and long-term commodity prices, economic growth, commodity demand and estimates of resource production. As a result, demand for our products and services is largely sensitive to expectations regarding future crude oil and natural gas prices.
Our reported 2020 results of operations reflect the negative impact of the unprecedented decline in crude oil prices starting in March and April of 2020 stemming from the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic and continued uncertainties related to future crude oil demand. The spot price of WTI crude oil averaged $39 per barrel in 2020, down 31% from the comparable prior-year average. The decline in crude oil prices, coupled with high crude oil inventory levels, has had a negative impact on customer drilling, completion and production activity. Additionally, our operations were negatively impacted by the government-imposed business closures and mandates outside of the United States enacted in an effort to control the COVID-19 pandemic, which limited wellsite operations and required us and a number of our suppliers to temporarily cease certain operations.
Our historical financial results reflect the cyclical nature of the oilfield services industry – witnessed by periods of increasing and decreasing activity in each of our operating segments. Lower oil and natural gas prices in 2019 and 2020 have caused a reduction in most of our customers' drilling, completion and other production activities and related spending on our products and services. The reduction in demand from our customers has resulted in an oversupply of many of the services and products we provide. Such oversupply has substantially reduced the prices we can charge our customers for many of our products and services. While oil prices improved from record low levels in April of 2020, these price improvements have not resulted in significant, sustained global improvements in the demand or the prices we are able to charge for our products and services. The U.S. rig count declined 454 rigs, or 56%, since December 31, 2019 to a total of 351 active rigs working as of December 31, 2020. While activity is improving off of 2020's low levels, we expect activity to be tempered in 2021 as our customers strive for spending levels that are within their capital budgets and cash flow targets. This may cause continued weak demand for, and prices of, our products and services, which would adversely affect our future results of operations, cash flows and financial position. For additional information about activities in each of our segments, see "Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."
Our Well Site Services segment is primarily affected by drilling and completion activity in the United States, including the Gulf of Mexico, and, to a lesser extent, the rest of the world. U.S. drilling and completion activity and, in turn, our Well Site Services segment results, are sensitive to near-term fluctuations in commodity prices, particularly WTI crude oil prices, given the call-out nature of our operations in the segment.
Similarly, demand for our Downhole Technologies segment products is predominantly tied to land-based oil and natural gas exploration and production activity levels in the United States and, to a lesser extent, internationally. The primary driver for this activity is the price of crude oil and, to a lesser extent, natural gas. In past years, operator spending in our industry has been particularly focused on crude oil and liquids-rich exploration and development in the U.S. shale plays utilizing enhanced horizontal drilling and completion techniques.
Demand for the products and services supplied by our Offshore/Manufactured Products segment is generally driven by both the longer-term outlook for commodity prices and changes in land-based drilling and completion activity. Over recent years, lower crude oil prices, coupled with a relatively uncertain outlook around shorter-term and possibly longer-term commodity price improvements, caused exploration and production companies to reevaluate their future capital expenditures in regards to deepwater projects since they are expensive to drill and complete, have long lead times to first production and may be considered uneconomical relative to the risk involved. Bidding and quoting activity, along with orders from customers, for deepwater projects improved in 2019 from 2018 levels. However, with reduced market visibility given the significant decline in crude oil prices which began in March of 2020 and associated reductions in customer spending, the segment's 2020 bookings were lower than the levels achieved in 2019.

Well Site Services
Overview
For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, our Well Site Services segment generated approximately 31%, 42% and 44%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue. Our Well Site Services segment includes a broad range of equipment and services that are used to drill for, establish and maintain the flow of oil and natural gas from a well throughout its life cycle. In this segment, our operations primarily include completion-focused equipment and services and, to a much lesser extent, land drilling services in the United States. Our completion equipment and services are used in both onshore and offshore applications throughout the drilling, completion and production phases of a well's life cycle.
Well Site Services Market
Demand for our completion and drilling services is predominantly tied to the level of oil and natural gas exploration and production activity on land in the United States. The primary driver for this activity is the price of crude oil and, to a lesser extent, natural gas. Activity levels have been, and we expect will continue to be, highly correlated with hydrocarbon commodity prices.
Our Well Site Services business, which is primarily marketed through the brand names Oil States Energy Services, Falcon, Tempress and Capstar Drilling, provides a wide range of services used in the onshore and offshore oil and gas industry, including:
•wellhead isolation services;
•frac valve services;
•wireline and coiled tubing support services;
•flowback and well testing, including separators and line heaters;
•downhole extended-reach technology;
•thru-tubing milling and fishing services;
•pipe recovery systems;
•gravel pack and sand control operations on wellbores;

•blowout preventer ("BOP") services; and
•drilling services.
As of December 31, 2020, we provided completion and drilling services through approximately 30 locations serving our customers in the United States, including the Gulf of Mexico, and international markets. Employees in our Well Site Services segment typically rig up and operate our equipment on the well site for our customers. Our equipment is primarily used during the completion and production stages of a well. We typically provide our services and equipment based on daily rates which vary depending on the type of equipment and the length of the job. Billings to our customers typically separate charges for our equipment from charges for our field technicians. We own patents or have patents pending covering some of our technology, particularly in our wellhead isolation equipment and downhole extended-reach technology product lines. Our customers in this segment include major, independent and private oil and gas companies and other large oilfield service companies. No customer in Well Site Services represented more than 10% of our total consolidated revenue in any period presented. Competition in the Well Site Services segment is widespread and includes many smaller companies, although we also compete with the larger oilfield service companies for certain equipment and services.
Downhole Technologies
Overview
For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, our Downhole Technologies segment contributed approximately 15%, 18% and 20%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue. This segment is comprised of the GEODynamics, Inc. ("GEODynamics") business we acquired in January 2018 (the "GEODynamics Acquisition") and provides oil and gas perforation systems, downhole tools and services in support of completion, intervention, wireline and well abandonment operations. This segment designs, manufactures and markets its consumable engineered products to oilfield service as well as exploration and production companies.
-7-


Downhole Technologies Market
Similar to our Well Site Services segment, demand for our Downhole Technologies segment products is predominantly tied to land-based oil and natural gas exploration and production activity levels in the United States. The primary drivers for this activity are the price of crude oil and, to a lesser extent, natural gas. Activity levels have been, and we expect will continue to be, highly correlated with hydrocarbon commodity prices. Demand for this segment's products is also influenced by continued trends toward longer lateral lengths, increased frac stages and more perforation clusters to target increased unconventional well productivity, which requires ongoing technological and product development.
Products
Product and service offerings for this segment utilize innovations in perforation technology through patented and proprietary systems combined with advanced modeling and analysis tools. Our expertise has led to the optimization of perforation hole size, depth, and quality of tunnels, which are key factors for maximizing the effectiveness of hydraulic fracturing. Additional offerings include proprietary toe valve and frac plug products, which are focused on zonal isolation for hydraulic fracturing of horizontal wells, and a broad range of consumable products, such as setting tools and bridge plugs, that are used in completion, intervention and decommissioning applications.
Customers and Competitors
Our customers in the Downhole Technologies segment include other oilfield services companies as well as major, independent and private oil and gas companies. No customer in this segment represented more than 10% of our total consolidated revenue in any period presented. Competition in the Downhole Technologies business is widespread and includes many smaller companies, although we also compete with the larger oilfield service companies for certain products and services.
Offshore/Manufactured Products
Overview
For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, our Offshore/Manufactured Products segment generated approximately 54%, 40% and 36%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue. Through this segment, we provide technology-driven, highly-engineered products and services for offshore oil and natural gas production systems and facilities, as well as certain products and services to the offshore and land-based drilling and completion markets. Products and services used primarily in deepwater producing regions include our FlexJoint® technology, advanced connector systems, high-pressure riser systems, compact valves, deepwater mooring systems, cranes, subsea pipeline products, specialty welding, fabrication, cladding and machining services, offshore installation services and inspection and repair services. In addition, we design, manufacture and market numerous other products and services used in both land and offshore drilling and completion activities and by non-oil and gas customers, including consumable downhole elastomer products used in onshore completion activities, valves and sound and vibration dampening products used in military applications. We have facilities that support our Offshore/Manufactured Products segment in Arlington, Houston and Lampasas, Texas; Houma, Louisiana; Oklahoma City and Tulsa, Oklahoma; the United Kingdom; Brazil; Singapore; Spain; India; Thailand; Vietnam; and the United Arab Emirates.
Offshore/Manufactured Products Market
The market for products and services offered by our Offshore/Manufactured Products segment centers primarily on the development of infrastructure for offshore production facilities and their subsequent operations, exploration and drilling activities, and to a lesser extent, on-vessel construction, refurbishments or upgrades. Demand for oil and natural gas, and the related drilling and production in offshore areas throughout the world, particularly in deeper water, drive spending for these activities. Sales of our shorter-cycle products to land-based drilling and completion markets are driven by the level and complexity of drilling, completion and workover activity, particularly in the United States.
Products and Services
In operation for more than 75 years, our Offshore/Manufactured Products segment provides a broad range of products and services for use in offshore development and drilling activities. This segment also provides products for onshore oil and natural gas, defense and general industries. Our Offshore/Manufactured Products segment is dependent in part on the industry's continuing innovation and creative applications of existing technologies. To that end, we are in the early stages of bidding on projects that facilitate the development of alternative energy sources, including offshore wind opportunities. We own various patents covering some of our technology, particularly in our connector and valve product lines.

Offshore Development and Drilling Activities. We design, manufacture, inspect, assemble, repair, test and market equipment for mooring, pipeline, production and drilling risers, and subsea applications along with equipment for offshore vessel and rig construction. Our products are components of equipment used for the drilling and production of oil and natural gas wells on offshore fixed platforms and mobile production units, including floating platforms, such as tension leg platforms, floating production, storage and offloading ("FPSO") vessels, Spars (defined below), and other marine vessels and offshore rigs. Our products and services include:
•flexible bearings and advanced connection systems;
•casing and conductor connections and joints;
•subsea pipeline products;
•compact ball valves, manifold system components and diverter valves;
•marine winches, mooring systems, cranes and other heavy-lift rig equipment;
•production, workover, completion and drilling riser systems and their related repair services;
•BOP stack assembly, integration, testing and repair services;
•consumable downhole products; and
•other products and services, including welding, cladding and other metallurgical technologies.
Flexible Bearings and Advanced Connection Systems. We are the key supplier of flexible bearings, or FlexJoint® connectors, to the offshore oil and natural gas industry as well as weld-on connectors and fittings that join lengths of large diameter conductors or casing used in offshore drilling and production operations. A FlexJoint® is a flexible bearing that allows for rotational movement of a riser or tension leg platform tether while under high tension and/or pressure. When positioned at the top, bottom, or, in some cases, middle of a deepwater riser, it reduces the stress and loads on the riser while compensating for pitch and rotational forces on the riser as the production facility or drilling rig moves with ocean forces. FlexJoint® connectors are used on drilling, production and export risers and are used increasingly as offshore production moves to deeper water.
Drilling riser systems provide a vertical conduit between the floating drilling vessel and the subsea wellhead. Through the drilling riser, the drill string is guided into the well and drilling fluids are returned to the surface. Production riser systems provide the vertical conduit for the hydrocarbons from the subsea wellhead to the floating production facility. Oil and natural gas flows to the surface for processing through the production riser. Export risers provide the vertical conduit from the floating production facility to the subsea export pipelines. Our FlexJoint® connectors are a critical element in the construction and operation of production and export risers on floating production systems in deepwater.
Floating production systems, including tension leg platforms, FPSO facilities and Spars, are a significant means of producing oil and natural gas, particularly in deepwater environments. We provide many important products for the construction of these facilities. A tension leg platform ("TLP") is a floating platform that is moored by vertical pipes, or tethers, attached to both the platform and the sea floor. Our FlexJoint® tether bearings are used at the top and bottom connections of each of the tethers, and our Merlin™ connectors are used to efficiently assemble the tether joints during offshore installation. An FPSO is a floating vessel, typically ship shaped, used to produce and process oil and natural gas from subsea wells. A "Spar" is a floating vertical cylindrical structure which is approximately six to seven times longer than its diameter and is anchored in place. Our FlexJoint® connectors are used to attach the various production, injection, import or export risers to all of these floating production systems.
Casing and Conductor Connections and Joints. Our advanced connection systems provide connectors used in various drilling and production applications offshore. These connectors are welded onto pipe to provide more efficient joint to joint connections with enhanced tensile and burst capabilities that exceed those of connections machined onto plain-end-pipe. Our connectors are reusable and pliable and, depending on the application, are equipped with metal-to-metal seals. We offer a suite of connectors offering differing specifications depending on the application. Our Merlin™ connectors are our premier connectors combining superior static strength and fatigue life with fast, non-rotational make-up and a slim profile. Merlin™ connectors have been used in sizes up to 60 inches (outside diameter) for applications including open-hole and tie-back casing, offshore conductor casing, pipeline risers and TLP tendons which moor the TLP to the sea floor.

Subsea Pipeline Products. We design and manufacture a variety of equipment used in the construction, maintenance, expansion and repair of offshore oil and natural gas pipelines. New construction equipment includes:
•pipeline end manifolds and pipeline end terminals;
•deep and shallow water pipeline connectors;
•midline tie-in sleds;
•forged steel Y-shaped connectors for joining two pipelines into one;
•pressure-balanced safety joints for protecting pipelines and related equipment from anchor snags or a shifting sea-bottom;
•electrical isolation joints; and
•hot-tap clamps that allow new pipelines to be joined into existing lines without interrupting the flow of petroleum products.
We provide diverless connection systems for subsea flowlines and pipelines. Our HydroTech® collet connectors provide a high-integrity, proprietary metal-to-metal sealing system for the final hook-up of deep offshore pipelines and production systems. They also are used in diverless pipeline repair systems and future pipeline tie-in systems. Our lateral tie-in sled, which is installed with the original pipeline, allows a subsea tie-in to be made quickly and efficiently using proven HydroTech® connectors without costly offshore equipment mobilization and without shutting off product flow.
We provide pipeline repair hardware, including deepwater applications beyond the depth of diver intervention. Our products include:
•repair clamps used to seal leaks and restore the structural integrity of a pipeline;
•mechanical connectors used in repairing subsea pipelines without having to weld;
•misalignment and swivel ring flanges; and
•pipe recovery tools for recovering dropped or damaged pipelines.
Compact Ball Valves, Manifold System Components and Diverter Valves. Our Piper Valve division designs and manufactures compact high-pressure valves and manifold system components for all environments of the oil and gas industry including onshore, offshore, drilling and subsea applications. Our valve and manifold bores are designed to closely match the inside diameter of the required pipe schedule to eliminate piping transition areas, minimize erosion and system friction pressure loss, and to result in a more efficient flow path. Our floating ball valve design with its large ball/seat interface has over 30 years of proven field application in upstream unprocessed produced liquids and gasses, providing reliable service. Oil States Piper Valve Optimum Flow Technology allows end users to maximize space, minimize weight and increase production.
Marine Winches, Mooring Systems, Cranes and other Heavy-Lift Rig Equipment. We design, engineer and manufacture marine winches, mooring systems, cranes and certain rig equipment. Our Skagit® winches are engineered for mooring floating and semi-submersible drilling rigs as well as positioning pipelay and derrick barges, anchor handling boats and jack-ups. Our Nautilus® marine cranes are used on production platforms throughout the world. We also design and fabricate rig equipment such as automatic pipe racking systems, BOP handling equipment, and handling equipment used in the installation of offshore wind turbine platforms. Our engineering teams, manufacturing capability and service technicians, who install and service our products, provide our customers with a broad range of equipment and services to support their operations. Aftermarket service and support for our installed base of equipment to our customers is also an important source of revenue to us.
Production, Workover, Completion, Drilling and Mining Riser Systems and their related repair services. Utilizing our welding technology group's expertise, we continue to extend the boundaries of our Merlin™ connector technology with the design and manufacture of multiple riser systems. The unique Merlin™ connection is a proven, robust solution for even the most demanding high-pressure (up to 20,000 psi) riser systems used in high-fatigue, deepwater applications. Our riser systems are designed to meet a range of static and fatigue stresses on par with those of our Tension Leg Element connectors. The connector can be welded or machined directly onto upset riser pipe and provide sufficient material to perform repair or "re-cuts" after extended service. We believe that our marine riser offers superior tension capabilities together with one of the fastest run times in the industry. Auxiliary riser system components and running tools, along with full-service inspection and repair of these riser systems are available.
In 2020, we were awarded a contract to design and supply a new deepwater riser system (including automated tooling, a control system and marine riser) to collect polymetallic nodules from the sea floor. This mining riser system applies our 30-plus years of experience in providing marine riser systems for the oil and gas industry to a new market, not tied to energy prices.

BOP Stack Assembly, Integration, Testing and Repair Services. While not typically a manufacturer of BOP components, we design and fabricate lifting and protection frames for BOP stacks and offer the complete system integration of BOP stacks and subsea production trees. We can provide complete turnkey and design fabrication services. We also design and manufacture a variety of custom subsea equipment, such as riser flotation tank systems, guide bases, running tools and manifolds. In addition, we also offer BOP and drilling riser testing and repair services.
Consumable Downhole Products. North American shale play development has expanded the need for more advanced completion tools. In order to reduce well completion costs, minimizing the time to drill out tools is very important. Our Offshore/Manufactured Products segment has leveraged its knowledge of molded thermoset composites and elastomers to help meet this demand. For example, we have had success in developing and producing composite drillable zonal isolation tools (i.e., bridge/frac plugs) utilizing design and production techniques that reduce cost while still delivering high-quality performance. Time to drill out is significantly reduced in comparison to other filament wound products in the market. Our products include:
•Swab Cups - used primarily in well servicing work;
•Rod Guides/Centralizers - used in both drilling and production for pipe protection;
•Gate Valve and Butterfly Valve Seats – we service many markets in the valve industry including well completion, refining, and distribution;
•Casing and Cementing Products – we are a custom manufacturer of cementing plugs, wellbore wipers, valve assemblies, combination plugs, specialty seals and gaskets; and
•Service Tools – our products include frac balls, packer elements, zonal isolation tools, as well as many custom molded products used in the well servicing industry.
Other Products & Services. Our Offshore/Manufactured Products segment also produces a variety of products for use in industrial, military and other applications outside the oil and gas industry. For example, we provide:
•sound and vibration isolation equipment for marine vessels;
•metal-elastomeric FlexJoint® bearings used in a variety of naval and marine applications;
•products used in the construction and maintenance of offshore wind projects; and
•drum-clutches and brakes for heavy-duty power transmission in the mining, paper, logging and marine industries.
Backlog
Offshore/Manufactured Products' backlog consists of firm customer purchase orders for which contractual commitments exist and delivery is scheduled. Backlog in our Offshore/Manufactured Products segment was $219 million as of December 31, 2020, compared to $280 million as of December 31, 2019 and $179 million as of December 31, 2018. We expect approximately 75% of our backlog as of December 31, 2020 to be recognized as revenue during 2021. In some instances, these purchase orders are cancellable by the customer, subject to the payment of termination fees and/or the reimbursement of our costs incurred. While backlog cancellations have historically been insignificant, we incurred cancellations totaling $2.2 million during 2020 and $5.0 million during 2019, which we believe is attributable to lower commodity prices, the resultant decrease in capital spending by our customers and, in some cases, the financial condition of our customers. Additional cancellations may occur in the future, which would reduce our backlog. Backlog is an important indicator of future Offshore/Manufactured Products' shipments and major project revenues; however, backlog as of any particular date may not be indicative of our actual operating results for any future period. The offshore construction and development business is characterized by lengthy projects and a "long lead-time" order cycle. The change in backlog levels from one period to the next does not necessarily evidence a long-term trend.
Regions of Operations
Our Offshore/Manufactured Products segment provides products and services to customers in the major offshore crude oil and natural gas producing regions of the world, including the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, Brazil, West Africa, the North Sea, Azerbaijan, Russia, India, Southeast Asia, China, the United Arab Emirates and Australia. In addition, we provide shorter-cycle products to customers in the land-based drilling and completion markets in the United States and, to a lesser extent, outside the United States.
-11-


Customers and Competitors
We market our products and services to a broad customer base, including direct end-users, engineering and design companies, prime contractors, and at times, our competitors through outsourcing arrangements. While no customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues in 2020 or 2019, Halliburton Company individually accounted for 10% of our total consolidated revenues in 2018. Our main competitors in this segment include OneSubsea (a division of Schlumberger Limited), National Oilwell Varco, Inc., Baker Hughes Company, Hutchinson Group (a subsidiary of Total S.A.), Sparrows Offshore Group LTD, Oceaneering International, Inc., Raina Engineers and AFG Holdings, Inc.
Seasonality of Operations
Our operations are directly impacted by customer budgets and seasonal weather conditions in certain areas in which we operate, most notably in the Rocky Mountain and Northeast regions of the United States, where severe winter weather conditions can restrict access to work areas. In addition, summer and fall completion and drilling activity can be restricted due to hurricanes and other storms prevalent in the Gulf of Mexico and along the Gulf Coast. As a result, full-year results are not likely to be a direct multiple of any particular quarter or combination of quarters.

As of December 31, 2020, we had a total of 2,338 full-time employees, 33% of whom are in our Well Site Services segment, 10% of whom are in our Downhole Technologies segment, 54% of whom are in our Offshore/Manufactured Products segment, and 3% of whom are in our corporate headquarters. During 2020, our company-wide workforce was reduced 32% following the unprecedented decline in crude oil prices following the demand destruction caused by the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. See "– Recent Developments" for further discussion of personnel reductions and other cost control measures implemented during 2020 aimed at reducing costs and protecting the financial health of our company. We were party to collective bargaining agreements covering fewer than 100 employees located outside the United States as of December 31, 2020. We believe we have good labor relations with our employees.
Safety
The health and safety of our employees, contractors, business partners, visitors and the communities where we work is a cornerstone of our culture, "Safety Focus from the Top." We are transparent in our communications about our health, safety and environment ("HSE") commitment to employees, contractors, vendors, suppliers and customers. We solicit input to improve our programs and employee participation is a vital element in our success.
We establish global targets in an effort to promote HSE improvement and monitor our performance through real-time reporting. Executive management and operations personnel review incidents and loss trends on a weekly basis and we update our board of directors no less than monthly. For divisional and operational teams, a portion of their annual incentive compensation is linked to established safety metrics.
We seek to encourage our employees to actively participate in HSE initiatives through safety committees, behavior-based observations, and employees stopping work if at-risk conditions are observed, among other aspects of our safety management system. We monitor global compliance with our internal policies and procedures, internationally recognized/certified management systems and all applicable national, state, local and international laws and regulations.
COVID-19 Response
Our dedicated employees across the globe provided essential services to the energy industry during 2020 and continue to do so in 2021. The COVID-19 outbreak expanded into a global pandemic in early 2020 – requiring swift and effective responses by us in order to protect the health and safety of our employees and others, as well as the communities in which we operate.
We implemented measures to enable our employees to work safely, including: adjustments to facility workflows and operating schedules; enhanced cleaning procedures; health monitoring procedures; and strict travel protocols. Additionally, when possible, we requested that employees work from home to limit social contact in support of government instructions.

Diversity
We recognize that our employees are critical to our long-term success. Our operations are global and demand a diverse workforce, which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage and allows us to better understand and communicate with a diverse population of constituents. Our strong focus on innovation necessitates an equally strong focus on technical skills and training programs, which we believe creates high performing teams that can arrive at better solutions to problems. We strive to cultivate a culture and work environment that enables us to attract, train, promote, and retain a diverse group of skilled individuals who collectively enable us to safely provide quality, innovative solutions to our customers while remaining considerate of the environment and of our communities.
We strive to align our national and cultural diversity with our global operations. For example, 74% of our full-time employee base was in the United States where we generated 73% of our revenues in 2020. We have and continue to remain focused on improving gender balance across our field and manufacturing operations, technical, business and management roles. As of December 31, 2020, women made up approximately 18% of our global workforce. Additionally, approximately 20% of our executive and senior management roles in 2020 were held by women, including our Chief Executive Officer and President who has served in this role and as a member of our Board since 2007.
Hiring, Training and Development of our Workforce
Our employee hiring, training, career development and retention practices are key to our success. We recruit and train our employees while providing competitive wages and benefits. Our industry is cyclical leading to varying headcount needs during industry cycles. We prioritize recalling our experienced employees for manufacturing and field positions to the extent possible as conditions improve following an industry downturn such as the one experienced in 2020.
We invest in continual training and development of our employees through technical and non-technical courses and programs. Employee training and development includes course work as well as on the job mentoring – emphasizing, among others matters, safety, ethical behavior, compliance with our internal policies and laws and regulations, protection of the environment, and skills and competencies necessary for a specific position. In addition to internal training and development, we also value the benefits of continuing formal education and maintain an educational assistance program that reimburses eligible expenses from accredited institutions. 
Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Matters
Our business operations are subject to stringent environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations that may be imposed domestically at the federal, regional, state, tribal and local levels or by foreign governments. Numerous governmental entities, including domestically the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives ("ATF"), a law enforcement agency under the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA") and analogous state agencies, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them, often requiring difficult and costly actions. These laws and regulations may, among other things, (i) require the acquisition of permits to conduct drilling and other regulated activities; (ii) restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment or injected into subsurface formations in connection with oil and natural gas drilling and production activities and wellsite support services; (iii) limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; (iv) impose stringent regulations on the licensing or storage and use of explosives; (v) require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations, such as requirements to close pits and plug abandoned wells or decommission offshore facilities; (vi) impose specific safety and health criteria addressing worker protection; and (vii) impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from drilling operations and well site support services.
The more significant of these existing environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations include the following U.S. legal standards, as amended from time to time:
•the Clean Air Act ("CAA"), which restricts the emission of air pollutants from many sources and imposes various pre-construction, operational, monitoring and reporting requirements, and that the EPA has relied upon as authority for adopting climate change regulatory initiatives relating to greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions;
•the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act ("CWA"), which regulates discharges of pollutants from facilities to state and federal waters and establishes the extent to which waterways are subject to federal jurisdiction and rulemaking as protected waters of the United States;
-13-


•the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, which subjects owners and operators of vessels, onshore facilities, and pipelines, as well as lessees or permittees of areas in which offshore facilities are located, to liability for removal costs and damages arising from an oil spill in waters of the United States;
•U.S. Department of the Interior ("DOI") regulations, which govern oil and natural gas operations on federal lands and waters and impose obligations for establishing financial assurances for decommissioning activities, liabilities for pollution cleanup costs resulting from operations, and liabilities for pollution damages;
•the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 ("CERCLA"), which imposes liability on generators, transporters, disposers and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur;
•the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA"), which governs the generation, treatment, storage, transport, and disposal of solid wastes, including oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes and hazardous wastes;
•the Safe Drinking Water Act ("SDWA"), which ensures the quality of the nation's public drinking water through adoption of drinking water standards and controlling the injection of waste fluids into below-ground formations that may adversely affect drinking water sources;
•the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, which requires facilities to implement a safety hazard communication program and disseminate information to employees, local emergency planning committees, and response departments on toxic chemical uses and inventories;
•OSHA, which establishes workplace standards for the protection of the health and safety of employees, including the implementation of hazard communications programs designed to inform employees about hazardous substances in the workplace, potential harmful effects of these substances, and appropriate control measures;
•the Endangered Species Act ("ESA"), which restricts activities that may affect federally identified endangered and threatened species or their habitats through the implementation of operating restrictions or a temporary, seasonal, or permanent ban in affected areas;
•the National Environmental Policy Act, which requires federal agencies, including the DOI, to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to impact the environment and that may require the preparation of environmental assessments and more detailed environmental impact statements that may be made available for public review and comment;
•the U.S. Department of Transportation regulations, which relate to advancing the safe transportation of energy and hazardous materials, including explosives, and emergency response preparedness; and
•regulations adopted by the ATF, that impose stringent licensing conditions with respect to the acquisition, storage and use of explosives for well site support services in the oil and natural gas sector.
Additionally, there exist regional, state, tribal and local jurisdictions in the United States where we operate that also have, or are developing or considering developing, similar environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations governing many of these same types of activities. Outside of the United States, there are countries and provincial, regional, tribal or local jurisdictions therein where we are conducting business that also have, or may be developing, regulatory initiatives or analogous controls that regulate our environmental-related activities. While the legal requirements imposed in foreign countries or jurisdictions therein may be similar in form to U.S. laws and regulations, in some cases, the actual implementation of these requirements may impose additional, or more stringent, conditions or controls that can significantly restrict, delay or cancel the permitting, development or expansion of a project or significantly increase the cost of doing business. Any failure by us to comply with these laws, regulations and regulatory initiatives or controls may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil, and criminal penalties; the imposition of investigatory, remedial, and corrective action obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures; the occurrence of restrictions, delays or cancellations in the permitting, development or expansion of projects; and issuance of injunctions restricting or prohibiting some or all of our activities in a particular area. We have incurred and will continue to incur operating and capital expenditures, some of which may be material, to comply with environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations. Historically, our environmental and worker safety compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business and operational results.
We own, lease or operate numerous properties that have been used for wellsite support services for many years. We also have acquired certain properties supportive of oil and natural gas activities from third parties whose actions with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons, hazardous substances or wastes at or from such properties were not under our control prior to acquiring them. Under environmental laws and regulations such as CERCLA and RCRA, we could incur 
-14-


strict joint and several liability due to damages to natural resources or for remediating hydrocarbons, hazardous substances or wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators. Moreover, an accidental release of materials into the environment during the course of our operations may cause us to incur significant costs and liabilities. We also could incur costs related to the clean-up of third-party sites to which we sent regulated substances for disposal or to which we sent equipment for cleaning, and for damages to natural resources or other claims related to releases of regulated substances at or from such third-party sites.
Over time, both in the United States and in foreign countries, the trend in environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations is to typically place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may adversely affect the environment or expose workers to injury. If existing regulatory requirements or enforcement policies change or new regulatory or enforcement initiatives are developed and implemented in the future, we or our customers may be required to make significant, unanticipated capital and operating expenditures. Examples of recent regulations or other regulatory initiatives in the United States include the following:
•Hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions, but the practice continues to attract considerable public, scientific and governmental attention in certain parts of the country, resulting in increased scrutiny and regulation, including by federal agencies. At the federal level, the EPA asserted federal regulatory authority under the SDWA over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuels and published permitting guidance for such activities. Additionally, the EPA issued a final regulation under the CWA prohibiting discharges to publicly owned treatment works of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities. In late 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that "water cycle" activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under certain circumstances. Also in 2016, the federal Bureau of Land Management ("BLM") under the Obama Administration published a final rule imposing more stringent standards on hydraulic fracturing on federal lands; however, in late 2018, the BLM under the Trump Administration published a final rule rescinding the 2016 final rule. Since that time, litigation challenging the BLM's 2016 final rule and the 2018 final rule has resulted in rescission in federal courts of both the 2016 rule and the 2018 final rule but appeals of one or both of those decisions are expected. Notwithstanding these regulatory developments, the Biden Administration could seek to pursue legislative, regulatory or executive initiatives that restrict hydraulic fracturing activities on federal lands. For example, the Biden Administration issued an order temporarily suspending the issuance of new leases and authorizations on federal lands and waters for a period of 60 days beginning on January 20, 2021, and subsequently issued a second order in January 2021 suspending the issuance of new leases on federal lands and waters pending completion of a study of current oil and gas practices. Although these suspensions do not limit existing operations under valid leases and are not applicable to tribal lands that the federal governmental holds in trust, further constraints may be adopted by the Biden Administration in the future. At the state level, many states have adopted legal requirements that have imposed new or more stringent permitting, public disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities, including states where our oil and gas exploration and production customers operate. States could also elect to place prohibitions on hydraulic fracturing and local governments may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place or manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular.
•Induced seismicity. In recent years, wells in the United States used for the disposal by injection of flowback water or certain other oilfield fluids below ground into non-producing formations have been associated with an increased number of seismic events, with research suggesting that the link between seismic events and wastewater disposal may vary by region and local geology. The U.S. geological survey has in the recent past identified six states with the most significant hazards from induced seismicity: Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arkansas. In response to these concerns, regulators in some of the states in which our oil and gas exploration and production customers operate have adopted additional requirements related to seismicity and its potential association with hydraulic fracturing. For example, Oklahoma and Texas have issued rules for wastewater disposal wells that imposed certain permitting and operating restrictions and reporting requirements on disposal wells in proximity to faults. States such as Oklahoma have also issued orders, from time to time, for certain wells where seismic incidents have occurred to restrict or suspend disposal well operations. Another consequence of seismic events may be lawsuits alleging that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal. In countries outside of the United States where we or our customers conduct operations, there may exist similar governmental restrictions or controls over well disposal activities in an effort to limit the occurrence of induced seismicity.
•Offshore marine safety. In the United States, President Biden has placed a moratorium on new oil and natural gas leases on federal lands and waters, including the federal Outer Continental Shelf ("OCS"), and he may pursue regulatory initiatives, executive actions and legislation in support of his regulatory agenda. Additionally, regulatory agencies under the Biden Administration may issue new or amended rulemakings regarding deepwater leasing, 
-15-


permitting or drilling that could result in more stringent or costly restrictions, delays or cancellations to our oil and gas exploration and production customers with respect to their offshore operations. For example, as discussed under "Hydraulic Fracturing" above, the Biden Administration has suspended the issuance of authorizations for oil and gas activities on federal lands and waters, although the suspension does not limit existing operations under valid leases. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management ("BOEM") and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement ("BSEE") have over the past decade, primarily under the Obama Administration, imposed more stringent permitting procedures and regulatory safety and performance requirements with respect to new wells to be drilled in federal waters. However, in recent years under the Trump Administration, there have been actions by BSEE or BOEM seeking to mitigate or delay certain of those more rigorous standards. For example, in 2016, the BOEM under the Trump Administration imposed a delay in, and ultimately rescinded in 2020, the implementation of a Notice to Lessees and Operators ("NTL") issued by BSEE under the Obama Administration that would have bolstered supplemental bonding procedures for the decommissioning of offshore wells, platforms, pipelines, and other facilities by oil and natural gas exploration and production operators on the OCS. BSEE and BOEM under the Biden Administration may reconsider rules and regulatory initiatives implemented under the Trump Administration and pursue legislation, regulations, executive actions or other regulatory initiatives that impose more stringent standards. Additionally, the Biden Administration may seek to pursue executive actions and legislation that would restrict, delay or cancel prospective leasing or drilling activities on the OCS or significantly increase financial assurances of operators for decommissioning of offshore facilities on the OCS. Our customers compliance with such new, more stringent legal requirements may result in increased costs for us or our customers and could adversely affect, delay or curtail new or ongoing drilling and development efforts by our customers. Outside of the United States, there are countries and provincial, regional, tribal or local jurisdictions therein where our customers are conducting business that also have, or may be developing, regulatory initiatives or analogous controls that regulate the permitting and regulatory safety and performance aspects of those customers’ development and production activities, which could significantly restrict, delay or cancel the leasing, permitting, development or expansion of an offshore energy project or substantially increase the cost of doing business offshore.
•Ground-level ozone standards. In 2015, the EPA under the Obama Administration issued a final rule under the CAA, making the National Ambient Air Quality Standard ("NAAQS") for ground-level ozone more stringent. Since that time, the EPA has issued area designations with respect to ground-level ozone and final requirements that apply to state, local, and tribal air agencies for implementing the 2015 NAAQS for ground-level ozone and, more recently, in December 2020, the EPA, under the Trump Administration, published a final action that, upon conducting a periodic review of the ozone standard in accord with CAA requirements, elected to retain the 2015 ozone NAAQS without revision on a going-forward basis. However, several groups have filed litigation over this December decision, and the NAAQS may be subject to further revision under the Biden Administration. State implementation of the revised NAAQS could, among other things, require installation of new emission controls on some of our or our customers' equipment, result in longer permitting timelines, and significantly increase our or our customers' capital expenditures and operating costs.
•Waters of the United States. In 2015, the EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ("Corps") under the Obama Administration released a final rule outlining federal jurisdictional reach under the CWA over waters of the United States, including wetlands; however, the 2015 rule was repealed by the EPA and the Corps under the Trump Administration in a final rule that became effective in December 2019 and they also published a final rule in April 2020 re-defining the term "waters of the United States" as applied under the CWA and narrowing the scope of waters subject to federal regulation. The April 2020 final rule is subject to various pending legal challenges and there is an expectation that this final rule will be reconsidered by the Biden Administration. To the extent that the EPA and the Corps under the Biden Administration revises the June 2020 final rule in a manner similar to or more stringent than the original 2015 final rule, or if any challenge to the June 2020 final rule is successful and the 2015 final rule or a revised rule again expands the scope of the CWA's jurisdiction in areas where we or our customers conduct operations, such developments could delay, restrict or halt permitting or development of projects, result in longer permitting timelines, or increased compliance expenditures or mitigation costs for our and our customers’ operations, which may reduce the rate of production from operators.
•Climate change. In the United States, no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented at the federal level, but President Biden may pursue new climate change legislation, executive actions or other regulatory initiatives to limit GHG emissions. Moreover, with the U.S. Supreme Court finding that GHG emissions constitute a pollutant under the CAA, the EPA has adopted rules that, among other things, establish construction and operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources, require the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas system sources, and impose new standards reducing methane emissions from oil and gas operations through limitations on venting and flaring and the implementation of enhanced emission leak detection and repair requirements. In recent years, there has been considerable uncertainty 
-16-


surrounding regulation of methane emissions, as the EPA under the Obama Administration published final regulations under the CAA establishing new source performance standards ("NSPS") for methane in 2016, but since that time the EPA has undertaken several measures for stationary sources of air emissions, including publishing the September 2020 final rule policy and technical amendments to the NSPS. The policy amendments, effective September 14, 2020, notably removed the transmission and storage sector from the regulated source category and rescinded methane and volatile organic compounds requirements for the remaining sources that were established by former President Obama's Administration, and the technical amendments, effective November 16, 2020, included changes to fugitive emissions monitoring and repair schedules for gathering and boosting compressor stations and low-production wells, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, and more. Various states and industry and environmental groups are separately challenging both the original 2016 standards and the EPA's September 2020 final rules and on January 20, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that, among other things, directed the EPA to reconsider the technical amendments and issue a proposed rule suspending, revising or rescinding those amendments by no later than September 2021. A reconsideration of the September 2020 policy amendments is expected to follow. The January 20, 2021 executive order also directed the establishment of new methane and volatile organic compound standards applicable to existing oil and gas operations, including the production, transmission, processing and storage segments. Additionally, various states and groups of states have adopted or are considering adopting legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that are focused on such areas as greenhouse gas cap and trade programs, carbon taxes, reporting and tracking programs, and restriction of emissions. At the international level, there exists the United Nations-sponsored "Paris Agreement," which is a non-binding agreement for nations to limit their greenhouse gas emissions through individually-determined reduction goals every five years after 2020. While the United States had withdrawn from the Paris Agreement, President Biden has signed executive orders to recommit the United States to the Paris Agreement and to direct the federal government to formulate the United States' emissions reduction goal under the agreement. With the United States recommitting to the Paris Agreement, executive orders may be issued or federal legislation or regulatory initiatives may be adopted to achieve the agreement's goals. Separately, on January 27, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that commits to substantial action on climate change, calling for, among other things, the increased use of zero-emissions vehicles by the federal government, the elimination of subsidies provided to the fossil fuel industry, and an increased emphasis on climate-related risks across government agencies and economic sectors. Litigation risks are also increasing, as a number of states, municipalities and other plaintiffs have sought to bring suit against the largest oil and natural gas exploration and production companies in state or federal court, alleging, among other things, that such energy companies created public nuisances by producing fuels that contributed to global warming effects, such as rising sea levels, and therefore, are responsible for roadway and infrastructure damages as a result, or alleging that the companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change for some time but defrauded their investors by failing to adequately disclose those impacts. There are also increasing financial risks for fossil fuel producers and other companies supportive of the oil and natural gas industry as shareholders and bondholders currently invested in fossil-fuel energy companies concerned about the potential effects of climate change may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investments into non-fossil fuel energy related sectors. Institutional lenders who provide financing to fossil-fuel energy companies also have become more attentive to sustainable lending and investment practices and some of them may elect not to provide funding for fossil fuel energy companies. Additionally, there is the possibility that financial institutions will be required to adopt policies that limit funding for fossil fuel energy companies. Recently, President Biden signed an executive order calling for the development of a climate finance plan and, separately, the Federal Reserve announced that it has joined the Network for Greening the Financial System, a consortium of financial regulators focused on addressing climate-related risks in the financial sector. Finally, increasing concentrations of GHG in the Earth's atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods, rising sea levels and other climatic events.
While we maintain insurance coverage for certain environmental and occupational health and safety risks that we believe is consistent with insurance coverage held by other similarly situated industry participants, our insurance does not cover any penalties or fines that may be issued by a government authority. In addition, it is possible that other developments, such as stricter and more comprehensive environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations, claims for damages to property or persons or disruption of our customers' operations resulting from our actions or omissions, and imposition of penalties due to our operations, could have a material adverse effect on us and our results of operations.
