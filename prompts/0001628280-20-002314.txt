Recent Developments
On May 6, 2019, the Company and an ad hoc group of Lenders (the “Ad Hoc Group”) and certain other Lenders (together with the Ad Hoc Group, the “Standstill Lenders”) entered into the Original Standstill Agreement to the Company’s Term Loan Agreement, among the Company and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Loan Parties”), the Lenders and the Administrative Agent. Pursuant to the terms of the Original Standstill Agreement, the Company was required to enter into a Comprehensive Amendment. If the Company did not enter into the Comprehensive Amendment by December 13, 2019 or refinance or otherwise address the outstanding loans, an event of default would occur under the Term Loan Agreement. On December 15, 2019, the Loan Parties entered into a First Amendment to Standstill Agreement and Second Amendment to Credit Agreement with certain Standstill Lenders, pursuant to which the maximum duration of the “Standstill Period” was extended from December 13, 2019 to February 7, 2020.
On February 12, 2020, the Loan Parties entered into the Comprehensive Amendment in the form of the Second Amended Standstill Agreement with certain Standstill Lenders. Pursuant to the terms of the Second Amended Standstill Agreement, the duration of the “Standstill Period” was extended from February 7, 2020 until the earliest of the delivery of a notice of termination of the Standstill Period by the Standstill Lenders upon the occurrence of (i) a default under the loan agreement, or (ii) a breach of, or non-compliance with certain provisions of the Second Amended Standstill Agreement. Among other things, the Second Amended Standstill Agreement also (i) provides that, during the extended Standstill Period, neither the Administrative Agent nor the Lenders may exercise their default-related rights and remedies with respect to specified events of default under the Term Loan Agreement, and (ii) provides that we will market and conduct a sale process for substantially all of the Company’s assets in accordance with certain milestones (the “Sale Process”). The Sale Process may be consummated out-of-court to the extent permitted by the Lenders or on an in-court basis, potentially through the filing of Chapter 11 cases under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
See Note 21 - “Subsequent Events”, Item 7 - “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Risk Factors” - “There is no assurance that we will be able to comply with the covenants in the Second Amended Standstill Agreement and Term Loan Agreement or successfully execute the Sale Process contemplated thereby, creating substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. ” and - “Our limited liquidity could materially and adversely affect our business operations.” for more information on the Second Amended Standstill Agreement, the Sale Process, and the risks related thereto. Refer to Note 2 - “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for further discussion of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern and Note 7 - “Financing Arrangements” for further detail of our debt obligations as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Our Strategy

Our strategy is focused on the development and marketing of specialized generic and branded pharmaceuticals, OTC drug products and animal health products. We endeavor to maximize shareholder value by quickly adapting to market conditions, patient demands and customer needs.

We strive to improve cash flow and profitability and generate growth through: new product launches resulting from research and development successes, improving operational execution, improving and optimizing our cash flow and leveraging our customer relationships and market leadership. We remain committed to research and development with a focus on our core product areas of ophthalmics, injectables, oral liquids, otics, topicals, inhalants and nasal sprays.

Additionally, where possible we have historically sought to grow our business through strategic mergers, acquisitions, business development and licensing activities that provide the ability to move into new product areas or to expand our reach in existing product areas. In previous years, the Company completed numerous mergers, acquisitions and product acquisitions that resulted in significant growth.

Our Competitive Strengths

In order to successfully execute our strategy, we must continue to capitalize on our core strengths:

Research and development expertise in alternative dosage forms.  Our R&D efforts are primarily focused on the development of generic products that are in dosage forms other than oral solid dose. We consider dosage forms outside of oral solid dose to be “alternative dosage forms”. These products typically have fewer competitors in mature markets, are more difficult to develop and manufacture and can carry higher profitability over time than oral solid dose products.  The alternative dosage form products that we focus on are primarily those that we can manufacture, namely: ophthalmics, injectables, oral liquids, otics, topicals, inhalants and nasal sprays.

Alternative dosage form manufacturing expertise. Our manufacturing network specializes in alternative dosage form products. Four of our five manufacturing facilities are U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved, including:

•Decatur, Illinois facility, which specializes in sterile products, primarily injectables;
•Somerset, New Jersey facility, which specializes primarily in sterile ophthalmic products;

• | Amityville, New York facility, which specializes in topical creams, gels and ointments, oral liquids, otic liquids, nasal sprays, sterile ophthalmic products and unit dose oral liquid products; and

•Hettlingen, Switzerland facility, which specializes primarily in sterile ophthalmic products.

Our Paonta Sahib, Himachal Pradesh, India manufacturing facility is not FDA approved. The Paonta Sahib facility is a sterile injectable facility with separate areas dedicated to general injectable products, carbapenem injectable products, cephalosporin injectable products and hormonal injectable products. The Company continues to explore strategic alternatives for exiting our Paonta Sahib, Himachal Pradesh, India manufacturing facility.

Established portfolio of generic, branded, OTC and animal health products.  We market a diverse portfolio of generic prescription pharmaceutical products, branded prescription pharmaceutical products, OTC brands, various private-label OTC pharmaceutical products and a number of prescription animal health products. For our human prescription products, our diverse portfolio of alternative dosage form products allows us to provide a single source of these products for our customers. Our OTC and animal health portfolios are largely complementary to our human prescription products, allowing us to leverage our manufacturing and marketing expertise.
 Targeted sales and marketing infrastructure.  We maintain a targeted sales and marketing infrastructure to promote our branded, generic, OTC and animal health products, primarily in the United States. We leverage our sales and marketing infrastructure to not only promote our branded portfolio, but also to sell our multisource generic products directly into physician offices, hospital systems and group purchasing organizations.

Significant management expertise.  Our senior management team has a demonstrated track record of building and operating pharmaceutical companies through product development, in-licensing and acquisitions.

Our Areas of Focus

Alternative dosage form generics.  Our core area of focus is generic prescription pharmaceutical products in alternative dosage forms. We market a portfolio of multisource prescription pharmaceutical products in injectable, ophthalmic, topical, oral and inhaled liquid, nasal spray and otic dosage forms. We also market select oral solid dose formulations.

Specialty brands.  Alongside our generic prescription pharmaceutical products, we market a portfolio of branded prescription pharmaceutical products, primarily in the ophthalmology area. While we continue to focus primarily on generic products, our branded portfolio allows us to leverage our sales and manufacturing infrastructure and deepen our relationships with customers.

OTC products.  Our Akorn Consumer Health division (“ACH”) markets a portfolio of OTC brands and various formulations of private-label OTC pharmaceutical products. Our flagship OTC brand is TheraTears® Therapy for Your Eyes®, which is a family of therapeutic eye care products including dry eye therapy lubricating eye drops, antimicrobial eyelid cleanser and eye nutrition supplements. We also market several specialty OTC products including, Zostrix®, MagOx®, Maginex®, Multi-betic® and Diabetic Tussin®.
Specialized Animal Health Products.  We market a portfolio of branded and generic, companion animal prescription pharmaceutical products under the Akorn Animal Health label. Our major animal health products include Anased® and VetaKet®, veterinary sedatives; Tolazine® and Yobine®, sedative reversing agents; and Butorphic®, a pain reliever.

New Product Development

We seek to continually grow our business by developing new products.  Internal R&D projects are carried out at our R&D facilities located in Vernon Hills, Illinois and Cranbury, New Jersey. The majority of our product development activity takes place at our R&D facilities, while our manufacturing facilities provide support for the later phases of product development and exhibit batch production.  We believe that having our own dedicated R&D facilities allows us to increase the size of our product pipeline and shorten the time between project start and filing with the FDA.

In addition to our internal development work, we strategically partner with drug development and contract manufacturing companies (“CMOs”) throughout the world for the development of drug products that we believe will complement our existing product offerings, but for which we may lack the expertise to develop, or the capability, capacity or cost-efficiencies to manufacture.  We may owe payments to these partners from time to time based on their achievement of certain milestones, such as filing and launch of the subject development product.  Our development partners may receive milestone payments or royalties from the sales of the product.

R&D costs are expensed as incurred. Such costs amounted to $37.5 million, $47.3 million and $45.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. This includes internal and external R&D expenses and milestone fees paid to our strategic partners.

During the year ended December 31, 2019, we submitted one new Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”) filing to the FDA. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we submitted two ANDA filings, and during the year ended December 31, 2017, we submitted five ANDA filings to the FDA.

Akorn and its partners received five ANDA product approvals from the FDA in the year ended December 31, 2019; eight ANDA approvals during the year ended December 31, 2018 and twenty-six ANDA approvals and one New Drug Application (“NDA”) approval during the year ended December 31, 2017.

As of December 31, 2019, we had 34 ANDA filings under FDA review. We plan to continue to regularly submit additional filings based on perceived market opportunities, as well as review existing filings for commercial viability.

See “Government Regulation” and Item 1A. - “Risk Factors” — “Our growth depends on our ability to timely and efficiently develop and successfully launch and market new pharmaceutical products.”

Strategic Mergers and Acquisitions

We have historically sought to expand, and we may seek to expand in the future, through the acquisition of products and companies in areas that we believe offer attractive opportunities for growth. Below is a summary of recent merger and acquisition activity. See Item 1A. - “Risk Factors” for a description of risks that accompany our business and acquisitions.

Terminated Merger Agreement. On April 24, 2017, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Fresenius Kabi AG, a German stock corporation (“Parent”), Quercus Acquisition, Inc., a Louisiana corporation 
and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”) and, solely for purposes of Article VIII thereof, Fresenius SE & Co. KGaA, a German partnership limited by shares, which Merger Agreement subsequently resulted in litigation and ultimate termination. For a more detailed description of the litigation, please see Note 19 - “Legal Proceedings.”
Akorn AG (formerly Excelvision AG).  To expand our ophthalmic manufacturing capacity and capabilities, our Luxembourg subsidiary, Akorn International S.à r.l., closed a share purchase agreement on January 2, 2015, with Fareva SA to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Excelvision AG, a Swiss company (“Excelvision AG”). Excelvision AG was a contract manufacturer located in Hettlingen, Switzerland specializing in ophthalmic products. On April 1, 2016, the name of Excelvision AG was changed to Akorn AG.

VersaPharm. On August 12, 2014, we completed the acquisition of VPI Holdings Corp. (“VPI”), the parent company of VersaPharm Incorporated, a Georgia corporation (“VersaPharm”) (the “VersaPharm Acquisition”). VersaPharm was a developer and marketer of multisource prescription pharmaceuticals. VersaPharm’s product portfolio, pipeline and development capabilities were complementary to the Hi-Tech Pharmacal Co., Inc. (“Hi-Tech”) acquisition, described below, through which we acquired manufacturing capabilities needed for several of VersaPharm’s marketed and pipeline products.

Hi-Tech Pharmacal Co., Inc.  On April 17, 2014, we completed the acquisition of Hi-Tech, which developed, manufactured and marketed generic and branded prescription and OTC drug products, and specialized in liquid and semi-solid dosage forms (the “Hi-Tech Acquisition”). Hi-Tech’s ECR Pharmaceuticals subsidiary (“ECR”), which marketed branded prescription products, was divested during the year ended December 31, 2014.

The Hi-Tech Acquisition complemented and expanded our manufacturing capabilities and product portfolio by diversifying our offerings to our retail customers beyond ophthalmics to other niche dosage forms such as oral liquids, topical creams and ointments, nasal sprays and otics. The Hi-Tech Acquisition also enhanced our new product pipeline. Further, the Hi-Tech Acquisition added branded OTC products in the categories of cough and cold, nasal sprays and topicals to our TheraTears® brand of eye care products.

Business Development and Licensing

Supplemental to our strategic mergers and acquisitions strategy, we have also sought to enhance our generic and branded product lines through the acquisition or licensing of on-market or in-development products that expand or complement our current branded and generic product portfolio. Below is a summary of product acquisition and licensing transactions that we made from 2013 to 2019.

Lloyd Products Acquisition.  To expand our animal health product portfolio, our wholly-owned subsidiary Akorn Animal Health, Inc. entered into a definitive product acquisition agreement on October 2, 2014, with Lloyd, Inc. to acquire certain rights and inventory related to a portfolio of animal health injectable products used in pain management and anesthesia.

Xopenex Product Acquisition.  To expand our prescription product portfolio of respiratory products, we entered into a definitive product acquisition agreement with Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc., on October 1, 2014, to acquire certain rights and inventory related to Xopenex® Inhalation Solution (levalbuterol hydrochloride). 

Zioptan® Product Acquisition.  To expand our branded ophthalmology portfolio, we acquired the rights to the U.S. NDA for Zioptan®, a prescription ophthalmic eye drop indicated for reducing elevated intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension, from Merck, Sharp and Dohme Corp. (“Merck”) on April 1, 2014. 

Betimol Product Acquisition.  To expand our branded ophthalmology portfolio, we acquired the rights to the U.S. NDA for Betimol®, a prescription ophthalmic eye drop indicated for the reduction of eye pressure in glaucoma patients, from Santen Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., (“Santen”) on January 2, 2014. 

Merck Products Acquisition.  On November 15, 2013, we acquired three ophthalmic U.S. NDAs from Merck:


• | AzaSite® — (azithromycin ophthalmic solution), a prescription sterile eye drop solution used to treat bacterial conjunctivitis;


• | Cosopt® — (dorzolamide hydrochloride and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution), a prescription sterile eye drop solution that is used to reduce intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension; and


• | Cosopt® PF — a preservative free version of Cosopt®, supplied in sterile, single-use containers.


This acquisition expanded our line of prescription ophthalmic products to include additional branded products. The acquisition included our acquisition of a Merck subsidiary corporation, Inspire Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Inspire”), which was and continues to be the holder of the product rights to AzaSite®.

Our Segments

The Company has identified two reportable segments. These segments are the Prescription Pharmaceuticals Segment and the Consumer Health Segment.

Prescription Pharmaceuticals Segment.  Our Prescription Pharmaceuticals segment primarily consists of generic and branded prescription pharmaceuticals in a variety of dosage forms, including sterile ophthalmics, injectables and inhalants and non-sterile oral liquids, topicals, nasal sprays and otics. We also market a number of pain management drugs, including drugs subject to the Controlled Substances Act. The segment represented 88.5% of our net revenue in 2019. See Note 12 - “Segment Information” for further detail on the Prescription Pharmaceuticals segment.

While the majority of sales within the Prescription Pharmaceuticals segment are derived from generic products, Akorn markets a line of branded ophthalmic and respiratory products including brands such as Akten®, a topical ocular anesthetic gel, AzaSite®, an antibiotic used to treat bacterial conjunctivitis, Cosopt®, Cosopt® PF, Betimol® and Zioptan®, which are used in the treatment of glaucoma, and Xopenex® Inhalation Solution, used in the treatment or prevention of bronchospasm.
Consumer Health Segment.  Our Consumer Health segment primarily consists of branded and private-label OTC products and animal health products dispensed by veterinary professionals. Our branded and private-label OTC products are primarily focused on ophthalmics including a leading dry eye treatment TheraTears® Therapy for Your Eyes®. We also market other OTC consumer health products including Mag-Ox®, a magnesium supplement, and the Diabetic Tussin® line of cough and cold products.  Our animal health portfolio is focused on products complementary to our human health prescription portfolio, leveraging our R&D and manufacturing capabilities for alternative dosage form products. Major products within our animal health portfolio include Anased® and VetaKet® veterinary sedatives; Tolazine® and Yobine®, sedative reversing agents; and Butorphic®, a pain reliever. See Note 12 - “Segment Information” for further detail on the Consumer Health segment.
Our Products

Our major products are listed alphabetically below.


• | AK-FLUOR® (fluorescein injection, USP). We market our branded fluorescein injection as AK-FLUOR® 10% (100 mg/mL) and 25% (250 mg/mL). AK-FLUOR® is indicated in diagnostic fluorescein angiography or angioscopy of the retina and iris vasculature. 


• | Atropine Sulfate Ophthalmic Solution. We received approval of our NDA for Atropine Sulfate Ophthalmic Solution, USP, 1% in July 2014. We had previously been marketing this product as an unapproved product.

We acquired the rights to the U.S. NDA for Cosopt® PF (2% Dorzolamide Hydrochloride 0.5% and Timolol Maleate supplied in sterile, single-use containers), a preservative-free prescription ophthalmic eye drop indicated for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension who are insufficiently responsive to beta-blockers, through the Merck Products Acquisition on November 15, 2013. 


• | Dehydrated Alcohol Injection. We began marketing Dehydrated Alcohol Injection, USP in 1997. Our Dehydrated Alcohol Injection is not an FDA approved product and in early 2020, we ceased distribution of this unapproved product. 


• | Ephedrine Sulfate Injection. We originally began marketing Ephedrine Sulfate Injection, USP, 50 mg/mL in 1 mL single-dose ampules in 1997 as an unapproved product. In March 2017, we received FDA approval of our NDA for Ephedrine Sulfate Injection. 


• | Lidocaine Hydrochloride Jelly, USP 2%. Lidocaine HCI 2% Jelly is a sterile, aqueous product that contains a local anesthetic agent and is administered topically. 


• | Myorisan™ (isotretinoin capsules, USP). We acquired Myorisan™ isotretinoin capsules, USP, in 10 mg, 20 mg and 40 mg strengths through the VersaPharm Acquisition. We subsequently received approval for the 30 mg strength in 2015. 


• | Phenylephrine Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution. We began marketing Phenylephrine Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution, USP, 2.5% shortly after FDA approval of our NDA in January 2015. 


• | TheraTears® Dry Eye Therapy Lubricant Eye Drops. TheraTears® is an over-the-counter eye drop that is used as a lubricant to relieve dryness of the eye. TheraTears® unique hypotonic and electrolyte balanced formula replicates healthy tears.

We acquired the rights to the U.S. NDA for Zioptan® (tafluprost ophthalmic solution) 0.0015%, a preservative-free prescription ophthalmic eye drop indicated for reducing elevated intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension, from Merck, in April 2014. 


Several of the products discussed above have generic equivalent competitors. In the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company estimates that none of its products represented 10% or more of total net revenue.

Sales and Marketing

We rely on our sales and marketing teams to help us maintain and, where possible, increase market share for our products.  Our sales organization is structured as follows:

(1) | field sales teams focused on branded ophthalmology products;


(2) | field sales teams focused on institutional markets;


(3) | inside sales team focused on customers in smaller markets; and


(4) | national accounts sales team focused on wholesalers, distributors, retail pharmacy chain and group purchasing organizations (“GPOs”).


Our field sales representatives promote ophthalmic products directly to glaucoma specialists, retinal surgeons and ophthalmologists, and other pharmaceutical products directly to hospitals in order to support contract compliance and pull-through against existing contracts. Our inside sales team augments our outside sales teams to sell products in markets where field sales would not be cost effective. Our national accounts sales team seeks to establish and maintain contracts with wholesalers, distributors, retail pharmacy chains and GPOs. As of the year ended December 31, 2019, we utilized a sales force of 70 field and inside sales representatives to promote our product portfolio. To support our sales efforts, we also have a customer service team and a marketing department focused on promoting and raising awareness about our product offerings.

Competition

Prescription Pharmaceuticals.  The sourcing, marketing and manufacturing of pharmaceutical products is highly competitive, with many established manufacturers, suppliers and distributors actively engaged in all phases of the business. We compete principally on the quality of our products and services, reliability of our supply, breadth of our portfolio, depth of our customer relationships and price. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources, including greater sales volume, larger sales forces and greater manufacturing capacity. See Item 1A. - “Risk Factors” - “Sales of our products may be adversely affected by further increases in competition” for more information.
Generic Pharmaceuticals.  Companies that compete with our generic pharmaceuticals portfolio include Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (“Teva”), Apotex Inc., Fresenius Kabi AG, Hikma Pharmaceuticals plc, Novartis International AG (through their Sandoz subsidiary), Alcon Inc., Perrigo Company plc, Pfizer Inc., Mylan N.V., Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. and Bausch Health Companies Inc., among others.

Branded Pharmaceuticals.  Companies that compete with our branded pharmaceuticals portfolio include Allergan plc, Alcon Inc., Pfizer Inc. and Bausch Health Companies Inc., among others. Additionally, potential generic entrants with equivalent products referencing our branded products present an additional competitive threat.

Consumer Health.  Like our Prescription Pharmaceuticals segment, the sourcing, manufacturing and marketing of Consumer Health products is highly competitive, with many established manufacturers, suppliers and distributors actively engaged in all phases of the business. With the Company’s relatively small OTC and animal health product portfolio, many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources, including greater sales volume, larger sales forces and greater manufacturing capacity. Within this market, we compete primarily on product offering, as well as price and service.

The companies that compete with our Consumer Health segment include both generic and name brand companies such as Johnson & Johnson, Perrigo Company plc., Pfizer Inc., and Bausch Health Companies Inc., among others.

Seasonality

The majority of our products do not experience significant seasonality.  We do market certain prescription pharmaceutical and consumer health products for the treatment of allergies which typically generate consumer demand in the warmer months as well as cough and cold products which typically generate higher consumer demand in the colder months, but we do not believe these products materially impact our overall sales trends. Additionally, we market antidote products through our Prescription Pharmaceuticals segment, the sales of which are largely timed to the expiration of existing stock held by our customers.
Major Customers

For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, a high percentage of our sales were to the three large wholesale drug distributors noted below.  These three wholesale drug distributors account for a significant portion of our gross sales, net revenue and accounts receivable in both of our segments. The three large wholesale drug distributors are:

• | AmerisourceBergen Corporation (“Amerisource”);


• | Cardinal Health, Inc. (“Cardinal”); and


• | McKesson Corporation (“McKesson”).


On a combined basis, these three wholesale drug distributors accounted for approximately 82.6% of our total gross sales and 60.3% of our net revenue in the year ended December 31, 2019, and 83.4% of our gross accounts receivable as of December 31, 2019. The difference between gross sales and net revenue is that gross sales is calculated before allowances for chargebacks, rebates, administrative fees and others, promotions and product returns (See Note 2 - “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for more information).
The table below presents the percentages of our total gross sales, net revenue and gross trade accounts receivable attributed to each of these three wholesale drug distributors as of and for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively:

 | 2019 | 2018 | 2017 
 | GrossSales | NetRevenue | GrossAccountsReceivable | GrossSales | NetRevenue | GrossAccountsReceivable | GrossSales | NetRevenue | GrossAccountsReceivable
Amerisource | 20.8% | 20.3% | 22.0% | 20.5% | 20.9% | 17.9% | 23.6% | 19.1% | 26.3% 
Cardinal | 21.2% | 16.9% | 15.6% | 20.7% | 15.8% | 19.3% | 17.5% | 17.9% | 21.1% 
McKesson | 40.6% | 23.1% | 45.8% | 41.8% | 25.0% | 48.3% | 39.1% | 26.5% | 38.6% 
Combined Total | 82.6% | 60.3% | 83.4% | 83.0% | 61.7% | 85.5% | 80.2% | 63.5% | 86.0% 
Other | 17.4% | 39.7% | 16.6% | 17.0% | 38.3% | 14.5% | 19.8% | 36.5% | 14.0% 
Combined Total | 100.0% | 100.0% | 100.0% | 100.0% | 100.0% | 100.0% | 100.0% | 100.0% | 100.0% 

Amerisource, Cardinal and McKesson are key distributors of our products, as well as a broad range of healthcare products for many other companies. None of these distributors is an end user of our products. Generally speaking, if sales to any one of these distributors were to diminish or cease, we believe that the end users of our products would likely find little difficulty obtaining our products from another distributor; however, the loss of one or more of these distributors, together with a delay or inability to secure an alternative distribution source for end users, could have a material negative impact on our revenue, business, financial condition and results of operations.
We consider our business relationships with Amerisource, Cardinal and McKesson to be in good standing and we currently have fee for services contracts with each of them; however, a change in purchasing patterns, a decrease in inventory levels, an increase in returns of our products, delays in purchasing products and delays in payment for products by one or more of these distributors could have a material negative impact on our revenue, business, financial condition and results of operations. See Item 1A. - “Risk Factors” — “We depend on a small number of wholesalers to distribute our products, the loss of any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business” for more information.
Backorders
As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $4.4 million of products on backorder as compared to approximately $28.2 million of backorders as of December 31, 2018 and $12.2 million as of December 31, 2017.
Foreign Sales
During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, approximately $13.2 million, or 1.9% of net revenue, $16.4 million, or 2.4% of net revenue, and $25.5 million or 3.0% of net revenue, respectively, was related to sales to customers in foreign countries.
Our business is subject to risks of currency fluctuations, governmental actions and other governmental proceedings abroad. We do not regard these risks as a deterrent to conducting our operations abroad or further expansion abroad; however, we closely review our methods of operations and seek to adopt strategies responsive to changing economic and political conditions.
Suppliers
We require raw materials and components to manufacture and package pharmaceutical products. The principal components of our products are active and inactive pharmaceutical ingredients and certain packaging materials. Certain of these materials are available from only a single source and, in the case of many of our products, only one supplier of raw materials has been identified and qualified. Because FDA approval of drugs requires manufacturers to specify their proposed suppliers of active ingredients and certain packaging materials in product applications, FDA approval of any new supplier would be required if such materials were no longer available from the specified supplier. The qualification of a new supplier could delay our development and marketing efforts. If for any reason we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of any of the raw materials or components required to produce and package our products, we may not be able to manufacture our products as planned. In addition, certain of the pharmaceutical products that we market are manufactured by third parties that serve as our only supplier of those products.  Any delays or failure of a contract manufacturing partner to supply finished goods timely or in adequate volume could impede our marketing of those products.
No supplier represented 10% or more of our purchases in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 or 2017.  See Item 1A. - “Risk Factors” - “Many of the raw materials and components used in our products come from a single source, the loss of any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business” and “A significant portion of our revenues are generated through the sale of products manufactured by third parties, the loss or failure of any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations” for more information.
Manufacturing
We operate manufacturing facilities in Decatur, Illinois; Somerset, New Jersey; Amityville, New York and Hettlingen Switzerland. In addition, we own a manufacturing facility in Paonta Sahib, Himachal Pradesh, India that is not currently manufacturing any products for sale. See Item 2 - “Properties”, for more information. Through these manufacturing facilities we manufacture a diverse assortment of sterile and non-sterile pharmaceutical products including oral liquids, otics, nasal sprays, liquid injectables, lyophilized injectables, topical gels, creams and ointments; and ophthalmic solutions, suspensions and ointments for both of our reportable segments. By location, these include:

• | Somerset, New Jersey — sterile ophthalmic solutions and ointments and sterile topical gels;


• | Decatur, Illinois — sterile liquid and lyophilized injectables and sterile ophthalmic solutions;


• | Amityville, New York — sterile ophthalmic solutions and suspensions, otic solutions, and non-sterile nasal sprays, topical ointments and creams, oral liquids, and liquid unit dose cups;


• | Hettlingen, Switzerland — sterile ophthalmic solutions, suspensions, gels and ointments; and


• | Paonta Sahib, Himachal Pradesh, India — sterile liquid injectables including cephalosporins, carbapenems, hormones and general injectables. The Company continues to explore strategic alternatives for exiting our Paonta Sahib, Himachal Pradesh, India manufacturing facility. 

Patents, Trademarks and Proprietary Property

We consider the protection of our patents, trademarks and proprietary rights important to maintaining and growing our business.  Through acquisitions, we also acquired rights to the trade names for the branded, prescription ophthalmic products AzaSite®, Betimol®, Cosopt® PF, and Zioptan®, respiratory product Xopenex®, as well as OTC products TheraTears®, Sterilid®, Mag-Ox®, Multi-betic® and Zostrix®. We are committed to maintaining and defending these trade names as they are important in supporting the success and growth of this business. In addition, we maintain and defend trademarks related to a number of internally-developed products, as well as others licensed from third parties.
We have sought, and intend to continue to seek, patent protection in the United States and selected foreign countries where deemed appropriate and advantageous to us.
We also rely upon trade secrets, unpatented proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation to maintain and develop our competitive position. We enter into confidentiality agreements with certain of our employees pursuant to which such employees agree to assign to us any inventions relating to our business made by them while in our employ; however, there can be no assurance that others may not acquire or independently develop similar technology or, if patents are not issued with respect to products arising from research, that we will be able to maintain information pertinent to such research as proprietary technology or trade secrets. For more information, see Item 1A. - “Risk Factors” - “Third parties may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights and may prevent or delay us from manufacturing and selling some of our new products” and “Our patents and proprietary rights may be challenged, circumvented or otherwise compromised by competitors, which may result in our protected products losing their market exclusivity and becoming subject to generic competition before their patents expire.”
Government Regulation
Pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors are subject to extensive regulation by government agencies, including the FDA, the Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”), the FTC and other federal, state and local agencies, as well as their international equivalents. The development, testing, manufacturing, processing, quality, safety, efficacy, packaging, labeling, recordkeeping, distribution, storage and advertising of our products, and disposal of waste products arising from such activities, are subject to regulation by the FDA, DEA, FTC, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency. Similar state and local agencies also have jurisdiction over these activities. Noncompliance with applicable United States and/or state or local regulatory requirements, or their international equivalents, can result in fines, injunctions, penalties, mandatory recalls or seizures, suspensions of production, recommendations by the FDA against governmental contracts and criminal prosecution. In addition, we are subject to oversight from federal and state government benefit programs, healthcare fraud and abuse laws and international regulations in jurisdictions in which we manufacture or sell our pharmaceutical products.
FDA.  The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FDC Act”) and other federal statutes and regulations govern or influence the development, testing, manufacture, labeling, storage and promotion of products that we manufacture and market. The FDA inspects drug manufacturers and storage facilities to determine compliance with its current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) regulations, non-compliance with which can result in fines, recall and seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, refusal to approve NDAs and ANDAs and criminal prosecution. Under the FDC Act, the federal government has extensive administrative and judicial enforcement authority over the activities of finished drug product manufacturers to ensure compliance with FDA regulations. This authority includes, but is not limited to, the authority to initiate judicial action to seize unapproved or non-complying products, to enjoin non-complying activities, to halt manufacturing operations that are not in compliance with cGMP, to recall products, to seek civil and monetary penalties and to criminally prosecute violators. Other enforcement activities include refusal to approve product applications, withdrawal of previously approved applications or prohibition on marketing of certain unapproved products.

FDA approval is required before any prescription drug products can be marketed. New drugs require the filing of an NDA, including clinical studies demonstrating the safety and efficacy of the drug. Generic drugs, which are therapeutic equivalents of existing brand name drugs, require the filing of an ANDA. An ANDA does not, for the most part, require clinical studies since safety and efficacy have already been demonstrated by the product originator; however, the ANDA must provide data to support the bioequivalence of the generic drug product. The time required by the FDA to review and approve NDAs and ANDAs is variable and, to a large extent, beyond our control. 
In 2018, our Decatur, Illinois and Somerset, New Jersey manufacturing facilities were inspected by the FDA and received Official Action Indicated status as an outcome of the inspections. We received warning letters in January and June of 2019 related to the 2018 inspections at our Decatur and Somerset facilities, respectively. The Company submitted comprehensive responses to the warning letters in 2019. Our Amityville, New York facility was inspected by the FDA in 2019 and received Voluntary Action Indicated status as an outcome of the inspections.
DEA.  We manufacture and distribute several controlled drug substances, the distribution and handling of which are regulated by the DEA, which imposes, among other things, certain licensing, security and record-keeping requirements, as well as quotas for the manufacture, purchase, storage and sale of controlled substances. Failure to comply with DEA regulations (and similar state and international regulations) can result in fines or seizure of product. There have not been any material fines, seizures or interruptions resulting from DEA inspections in any of the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.
We are subject to periodic inspections by the DEA in facilities where we manufacture, process or distribute controlled substances.  In 2019, the DEA inspected our Decatur, Illinois and Amityville, New York facilities with no observations.
See Item 1A. - “Risk Factors” - “Risks Related to Regulations” category for more information.
Government Benefit Programs.  We sell products that can be subject to the statutory and regulatory requirements for Medicaid, Medicare, TRICARE and other government healthcare programs. These regulations govern access and reimbursement levels, including that all pharmaceutical companies pay rebates to individual states based on a percentage of sales arising from Medicaid-reimbursed products. We are also subject to price ceilings for select products sold through the military TRICARE program. U.S. federal and state governments may continue to enact legislation and other measures aimed at containing or reducing payment levels for prescription pharmaceuticals paid for in whole or in part with government funds. We cannot predict the nature of such potential future measures or the impact on our profitability. See Item 1A. - “Risk Factors” - “Any failure to comply with the complex reporting and payment obligations under Medicare, Medicaid and other government programs may result in litigation or sanctions,” for more information. 
Anti-Corruption and Anti-Kickback Laws.  We are subject to various federal, state and local laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. In the United States, there are various federal and state anti-kickback laws that prohibit payment or receipt of kickbacks, bribes or other remuneration intended to induce the purchase or recommendation of healthcare products and services or reward past purchases or recommendations. Violations of these anti-kickback laws can lead to civil and/or criminal penalties, including fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs. The Company and its employees are subject to the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), as well as other international anti-corruption laws. See Item 1A. - “Risk Factors” - “Failure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could subject us to, among other things, penalties and legal expenses that could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results,” for more information.
Privacy and Data Protection Laws.  We are subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) of 1996, as well as various state privacy and data protection laws. We also are subject to privacy laws in Switzerland, where one of our manufacturing facilities is located.
Other Health Care Laws. We are also subject to other healthcare laws, notably:

• | Federal Civil False Claims Act. We are also subject to the provisions of the federal civil False Claims Act and, in particular, actions brought pursuant to the False Claims Act’s whistleblower or qui tam provisions. The civil False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring civil actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted or caused the submission of a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. In recent years, the number of suits brought by private individuals has increased dramatically. In addition, various states have enacted false claim laws analogous to the False Claims Act. Many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payer and not merely a federal healthcare program. 


• | Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act. The Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act mandates annual reporting of various types of payments to physicians and teaching hospitals. Under the regulations, applicable drug, biological, device, and medical supply manufacturers are required to report to CMS payments or other transfers of value made to healthcare professionals and teaching hospitals. Failure to comply with required reporting requirements could subject pharmaceutical manufacturers and others to substantial civil monetary penalties. 

Government Contracts
We maintain distribution contracts with the U.S. Federal Government, including the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, among others. We are subject to federal regulations governing government contractors.
Employees
As of December 31, 2019, we had a total of 2,227 employees globally, based in the following locations:

United States of America | 1,731
India | 264 
Switzerland | 232 
Total | 2,227

We believe we have good relations with our employees. Our employees are not represented by collective bargaining agreements.
Environment
Our operations are subject to foreign, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other matters, the generation, handling, storage, transport, treatment and disposal of, or exposure to, prescription drugs and toxic and hazardous substances. Violation of these laws and regulations, which frequently change, can lead to substantial fines and penalties. Some of our operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and limit pollution. We believe that our facilities are in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and we do not anticipate any material adverse effect from compliance with foreign, federal, state and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment.
