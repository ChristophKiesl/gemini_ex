Overview of Our Company

Cross Country Healthcare, Inc. (Nasdaq: CCRN) is a leader in providing total talent management including strategic workforce solutions, contingent staffing, permanent placement, and consultative services for healthcare customers. Leveraging our 35 years of industry expertise and insight, we solve complex labor-related challenges for customers while providing high-quality outcomes and exceptional patient care. As a multi-year Best of Staffing® Award winner, we are committed to an exceptionally high level of service to both our clients and our healthcare professionals. Our Company was the first publicly traded staffing firm to obtain The Joint Commission Certification, which we still hold with a Letter of Distinction. In February 2021, Cross Country Healthcare earned Energage's inaugural 2021 Top Workplaces USA award. We have a longstanding history of investing in our diversity, equality, and inclusion strategic initiatives as a key component of the organization’s overall corporate social responsibility program which is closely aligned with its core values to create a better future for its people, communities, the planet, and its shareholders.
Leveraging national and in-market staffing teams, we place highly qualified healthcare professionals in virtually every specialty on travel and per diem assignments, local short-term contracts, and permanent positions. Our diverse customer base includes both public and private acute care and non-acute care hospitals, outpatient clinics, ambulatory care facilities, single and multi-specialty physician practices, rehabilitation facilities, urgent care centers, public and charter schools, correctional facilities, government facilities, pharmacies, and many other healthcare providers. By utilizing the solutions we offer, customers are able to better plan their personnel needs, talent acquisition and management processes, strategically flex and balance their workforce, access quality healthcare personnel, and provide continuity of care for improved patient outcomes. We believe that our strategic mix of national and in-market footprint provides a unique value proposition, as we are able engage with a broader pool of talent and offer customers a more consultative approach relying on our understanding of the local markets they serve.
The healthcare staffing industry continues to evolve, with both healthcare providers and professionals demanding speed and placing heavier reliance on technology for fulfillment and delivery activities. The US Healthcare Staffing Market Assessment April 14, 2020 update estimates that in 2018, 16% of aggregate travel nurse revenue reported was billed to a standalone vendor management system (VMS).
Recognizing this trend, we embarked on a path of digital transformation and innovation across our business with continuous investments in expanding our technology capabilities both on the candidate engagement and customer facing fronts. Areas of investment include recruitment and candidate nurturing tools, market analytics, mobile applications and self-serve capabilities, programmatic advertising, social media, and other technology which we believe will enhance our recruiting capabilities.
In 2020, we successfully implemented our new applicant tracking system (ATS) for our travel business and launched Cross Country Marketplace, our proprietary on-demand staffing platform, which is a one-stop, self-service portal for healthcare professionals that greatly improved the candidate experience. The new ATS is designed to modernize the way our delivery teams operate while improving the experience of our candidates, and is just one component of our larger technology ecosystem that will drive greater productivity as well as growth in both revenue and profitability.
We have executed multiple initiatives to enhance our position as a leading, consultative, and strategic partner in the healthcare industry. Some of our key focus areas included personalizing the candidate experience, delivering a superior customer experience, infusing technology-enablement to drive efficiencies and increased productivity, and continuing our commitment to clinical excellence. As part of our growth strategy, we will continue to optimize technologies by upgrading and integrating the middle and back-office platforms, and bringing our IT infrastructure and business processes onto a single cohesive platform. We expect these initiatives to drive growth through better operational execution, enhanced productivity, and a world-class client and candidate experience. 
Our goal is to continue to grow shareholder value by continuing to deepen our relationship with current customers and healthcare professionals, expanding the number and types of new customers we serve, growing the supply and types of specialties of our healthcare professionals, improving our operating leverage through growth and cost containment, and strengthening and broadening our market presence. This will require our continued focus on: (i) providing our workforce solutions offerings to new customers; (ii) expanding the services we provide to our current customers; (iii) further diversifying our customer base; (iv) improving our capture rate for current managed service programs (defined below) customers; (v) accessing more candidates; and (vi) continuing to modernize our technologies and processes to optimize our relationships with our healthcare professionals and customers.
To successfully execute our business strategy, we rely on our experienced and innovative executive and operational teams. Our executive team has extensive experience in the staffing, workforce solutions, technology services, and healthcare industries. We also foster a culture of performance, talented leadership, and collegiality that promotes the achievement of both company and personal goals. Our Co-Founder & Chief Executive Officer, as well as our Executive Vice President of Operations, have been named to the Staffing Industry Analysts’ 2020 Staffing 100 List of the most notable leaders in the industry, and two other executives were recently included on Staffing Industry Analysts’ 2019 Global Power 150 - Women in Staffing List that recognizes the 100 most influential women in the Americas and 50 additional women internationally. One of those executives was included again in 2020. In 2020, one of our female healthcare leaders became the first locum tenens director elected to the National Association Medical Staff Services Board of Directors. In addition, our Chief Clinical Officer joined the Joint Commission’s Healthcare Staffing Advisory Council, a newly formed committee of staffing experts to help evaluate healthcare organizations.
COVID-19 and Our Business
In many ways, COVID-19 has reinforced our value proposition in the market for offering a flexible, rapid, and cost-effective means for delivering critical care to millions of Americans across thousands of facilities. Throughout the pandemic, we have been a leader in supporting our customers and ensuring the health and safety of our employees. As part of our COVID-19 response, we established a cross-functional team to ensure rapid response to our customers’ needs and a set of pricing guidelines to ensure we could deliver at competitive rates. As a result, we successfully staffed thousands of highly-qualified professionals on COVID-19 response assignments throughout the year. Our healthcare professionals have exemplified compassion and dedication while continuing to care for COVID-19 patients on the front lines every day, often times at personal risk.
The pandemic also drove unprecedented volatility in demand throughout the year with rising needs for critical responders in the hardest hit states, followed by declines in orders, as many hospitals encountered lower census, worker furloughs, and mandatory deferrals for elective procedures, as well as school closures. As states gradually reopened and health systems began resuming normal operations across the nation, demand rebounded, especially for surgical and anesthesia specialties. Given the uncertainty caused by COVID-19, many hospital systems are seeking greater certainty and flexibility and as a result, we have generally seen higher bill rates and shorter assignment lengths to provide the critical resources needed. We continue to work with clients on ensuring competitive bill rates, as well as seeking new ways to deliver our services, such as a heavier reliance on tele-services for allied specialties, especially for our education clients.
Corporate Social Responsibility
Our growth strategy integrates corporate social responsibility, designed to solicit engagement with, and involvement of, our key stakeholders – employees, stockholders, customers, suppliers, and society, to fulfill our responsibility to be good corporate citizens. Our mission to deliver quality patient care extends to our community and we are committed to action that fosters positive impacts in the communities we serve. We strive to make connections and contributions in every city where we have employees, providers, and operations – giving back in meaningful ways based on local community needs. During 2019, we announced a partnership with a local nursing college to pursue collaborative research and advance educational training activities to prepare the next generation of caring nurse leaders. As part of this initiative, we sponsored 10 scholarships for nursing students in 2020. This investment serves to improve the long-term supply of nurses, and enhances our reputational value to healthcare professionals, the community, and our customers. 
Compassion is one of our core values, which is why we participate in numerous events with a variety of non-profit organizations including the DAISY Foundation. During the year, we also engaged in other investments in our community, such as our sponsoring and participating in Light the Night benefiting the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, providing sponsorships for various healthcare research and funding initiatives, as well as working as a team on other fundraising efforts for charities such as Breast Cancer Foundation, March of Dimes, American Heart Association, American Red Cross, Humane Society, Make a Wish Foundation, Ronald McDonald House, and Spirit of Giving Holiday Gift Drive. 
Our principles of good environmental practice and sustainability include a dedication to minimizing our corporate carbon footprint by encouraging telecommuting, carpooling, energy efficiency, and embracing more flexible work policies, including a virtual work environment. We are eco-conscious when purchasing office materials and minimizing paper consumption, and we participate in various recycling programs for paper, glass, metals, and most forms of plastic. In 2019, we participated in a tree planting initiative, which when fully grown, these trees will provide a day’s supply of oxygen for up to 24 people and can be home to hundreds of species of insects, mammals, and plants. We are committed to conducting business at the highest ethical standards and having a positive social and environmental impact across our national footprint.
Services
Increasingly, we are called upon by our customers to provide creative and innovative talent sourcing strategies across the continuum of care. Over the past several years, our workforce solutions have evolved into a total talent management approach as our customers focus on maintaining high-quality patient outcomes, while improving their total labor management to address complex financial, compliance, and other challenges in the healthcare industry. As part of the evolution of our services, we consider the following: (i) solving the immediate and future needs of our customers and expanding our relationships with them; (ii) enhancing our network of healthcare professionals by improving their experience, and deepening our relationship with them; (iii) expanding our service offerings to reduce sensitivity to economic cycles; (iv) expanding our expertise with various healthcare solutions in various geographic areas of the U.S.; (v) continuing to diversify our customer base to enhance our long-term business prospects; and (vi) enhancing and expanding our technology capabilities to deliver efficient and automated services to our customer healthcare facilities. Today, our workforce solutions include:
•Managed Service Programs (MSPs). As healthcare providers continue to adopt centralized, outsourced models for managing contingent labor for both clinical and non-clinical needs, we offer an MSP in which we manage all or a portion of the customer’s staffing needs. This includes both the placement of our own healthcare professionals and the utilization of other staffing agencies to fulfill the customer’s staffing needs. We have been a market leader in this area since launching our first MSP in 2003, and over the years, we have grown our relationships and matured the generational models of MSPs. Today, we service more than 70 customers across more than 700 facilities, with estimated spend under management of approximately $500 million annually. The benefits to our customers include cost optimization, increased certainty of supply, and visibility into their labor needs and usage, as well as market insight from our industry expertise on a broad range of topics. 
•Internal Resource Pool Consulting & Development (IRP). An IRP is typically set up in conjunction with a central staffing office to ensure that supplemental staffing needs are first filled through resource pool staff before utilizing other options, such as agency or overtime. We strategically partner with our customers to design and deploy, administer and manage an IRP or to optimize an existing IRP to create efficiencies, patient care, and cost effectiveness by balancing their workforce mix to meet their current needs. 
•Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO). Through our RPO services, we offer our customers targeted recruitment solutions designed to increase core staff while reducing dependency on contract labor. Our RPO program provides support to replace or complement a customer’s existing internal recruitment functions for permanent hiring needs, and is delivered to healthcare organizations throughout the country and serves to provide creative, cost and operationally efficient hiring support and labor optimization, which leads to improvements in quality of care.
•Optimal Workforce Solutions (OWS). OWS provides an outsourced solution to healthcare facilities, managing staff across a vast range of support areas, including paraprofessionals, patient care associates, certified nursing assistants, sitters/observation, patient transport, environmental service, food service, linen distribution, and case management RNs.
•Project Management. Periodically, our clients have urgent needs that fall outside the scope of an MSP arrangement and require a more focused effort to place staff within a very short window. For example, as healthcare systems continue to upgrade their electronic medical records or encounter a labor disruption, we can provide comprehensive project management, a deployment of a full staffing plan, and ultimately an organized volume of quality healthcare professionals during the process so that our customers may continue to deliver quality care.
Our business consists of three business segments: (i) Nurse and Allied Staffing; (ii) Physician Staffing; and (iii) Search. For additional information concerning our business segments, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Segment Results. Through our business segments, we provide our healthcare customers with a wide range of solutions as described above and staffing services as set forth below.

(1)Nursing and Allied Staffing. The Nurse and Allied Staffing segment provides workforce solutions and traditional staffing, including temporary and permanent placement of travel nurses and allied professionals, as well as per diem and contract nurses and allied personnel. We market our services to hospitals and other customers, as well as reach out to our healthcare professionals through our Cross Country Nurses®, Cross Country Allied®, Cross Country Medical Staffing Network®, Cross Country Workforce Solutions®, and Cross Country Education® brands. Our Nurse and Allied Staffing revenue and contribution income is set forth in Note 18 - Segment Data to the consolidated financial statements.
A majority of our revenue is generated from staffing registered nurses on long-term travel contract assignments (typically, 13 weeks in length) at hospitals and health systems. Additionally, we staff registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, certified nurse assistants, advanced practitioners, pharmacists, and more than 100 specialties of allied professionals on local per diem and short-term assignments in a variety of clinical and non-clinical settings. We also provide clinical and non-clinical professionals on long-term assignments to clients such as public and charter schools, correctional facilities, skilled nursing facilities, and other non-acute settings.
(2)Physician Staffing. Our Physician Staffing segment provides licensed practitioners across a broad array of specialties, as well as certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs), nurse practitioners (NPs), and physician assistants (PAs) under our Cross Country Locums® brand on temporary assignments throughout the United States. The diverse list of clients we serve include healthcare facilities, such as acute and non-acute care facilities, medical group practices, government facilities, and managed care organizations. We recruit these professionals nationally and place them on assignments varying in length from several days up to one year. Our Physician Staffing revenue and contribution income is set forth in Note 18 - Segment Data to the consolidated financial statements.
(3)Search. We serve as a direct-hire talent acquisition partner to healthcare organizations and academic institutions throughout the nation providing a full suite of prescriptive talent management solutions, including flexible talent delivery models such as retained, outsourced, and contingent. The revenue and contribution income of our Search segment is set forth in Note 18 - Segment Data to the consolidated financial statements. Our Cross Country Search® brand delivers tailored and flexible retained, contingent, and outsourced solutions by employing a team of highly specialized and tenured professionals that leverage subject matter expertise, leading recruitment technologies, and a consultative approach to talent acquisition. We recruit and place executive leadership talent for healthcare and academic institutions through our Cejka Search by Cross Country® brand.
Our Business Model
The recruitment and retention of a sufficient number of qualified healthcare professionals to work temporary assignments on our behalf is critical to the success of our business. Healthcare professionals choose temporary assignments for a variety of reasons that include seeking flexible work opportunities, seeking higher compensation, exploring diverse practice settings, 
building skills and experience by working at prestigious healthcare facilities, working through life and career transitions, and as a means of access into a permanent staff position all while practicing in the most appreciated and highly altruistic trade.
(1)Our Healthcare Professionals. Our company is well positioned to attract candidates, as nurses and allied professionals routinely seek a wide range of diverse assignments in attractive locations, with competitive compensation and benefit packages, scheduling options, as well as a high level of service. In addition, we believe nurses and allied professionals are confident we will be able to offer them new assignments as they complete their current assignment. Each of our nurse and allied healthcare professionals is employed by us and is typically paid hourly wages and any other benefits they are entitled to receive during the assignment period. In addition, our competitive benefits generally include professional liability insurance, a 401(k) plan, health insurance, reimbursed travel, per diem allowances, and housing. In response to COVID-19, our Company frequently offers qualified healthcare professionals compensation during quarantine when they are unable to provide services due to potential exposure.
Recruiters are an essential element of our Nurse and Allied Staffing business, and are responsible for establishing and maintaining key relationships with candidates for the duration of their assignments with us. Recruiters match the supply of qualified candidates with the demand for open orders needed by our customers. While word-of-mouth and referrals, especially from current and former healthcare professionals we have placed, continue as our leading channel of access to candidates, we also market our brands through strategic sourcing initiatives including programmatic strategic sourcing and extensive utilization of social media and mobile applications, which has become an increasingly important component of our recruitment efforts. In addition to maintaining engaging and intuitive websites to allow potential applicants to obtain information about our Company and assignment opportunities, we recently deployed Cross Country Marketplace, as a mobile application to support the candidates throughout their experience with Cross Country.
Cross Country Locums recruits and contracts with physicians and advanced practice professionals to provide medical services for its healthcare customers. Each physician or advanced practice professional is an independent contractor and enters into an agreement with Cross Country Locums to provide medical services at a particular healthcare facility or physician practice group based on terms and conditions specified by that customer. California is the only state to mandate that Advanced Practitioners be treated as a W-2 employee. Physicians and advanced practice professionals are engaged to provide medical services for a healthcare customer ranging from a few days up to a year. We believe physicians are attracted to us because we offer a wide variety of assignments, competitive fees, medical malpractice insurance, and a high level of service. Cross Country Locums relies on word-of-mouth and referrals, but also markets online through programmatic sourcing strategies and through extensive social media campaigns.
(2)Sales and Marketing. We take an enterprise sales approach in marketing our full capabilities across the continuum of care to hospitals, healthcare facilities, schools, and other organizations across the United States addressing total talent management needs. We provide flexible workforce solutions to the healthcare and school markets customizing delivery of diversified offerings meeting the specific needs of each customer.
Our traditional staffing channels include temporary and permanent placement of travel nurses and allied professionals, local nurses and allied staffing, advanced practitioners, physicians, and substitute teachers through the delivery brands including Cross Country Nurses®, Cross Country Allied®, Cross Country Medical Staffing Network®, Cross Country Search®, Cross Country Workforce Solutions®, and Cross Country Education®. Our recruiters leverage the Company’s extensive databases of clinicians and healthcare professionals, as well as their expertise in their given specialties, to qualify and place candidates.
(3)Credentialing and Quality Management. We screen all of our candidates prior to placement through our credentialing departments. Our credentialing processes are designed to ensure that our professionals have the requisite skillsets required by our customers, as well as the aptitude to meet the day-to-day requirements and challenges they would typically encounter on assignments where they are placed. The credentialing of our nurse and allied healthcare professionals is designed to align with the guidelines of The Joint Commission, a national accrediting body, to ensure quality care. Our Cross Country University division, accredited by the American Nurse Credentialing Center, offers training, assessment, and professional development to further ensure the quality of the personnel we place on assignment. Our physician credentialing entity, Credent, is also certified by the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA).
(4)Payment for Services. We negotiate payment for services with our customers based on market conditions and needs. We generally bill our nurse and allied employees at an hourly rate which includes all employer costs, including 
payroll, withholding taxes, benefits, professional liability insurance, meals and incidentals, and other requirements, as well as any travel and housing arrangements, where applicable. Our shared service center processes hours worked by field employees in the time and attendance systems, which in turn generate the billable transactions to our customers. Hours worked by independent contractor physicians are reported to our Cross Country Locums office. For our Search businesses, we typically bill our customers a candidate acquisition fee and we are reimbursed for certain marketing expenses.
(5)Operations. Our businesses are operated through a relatively centralized business model servicing all assignment needs of our healthcare professional employees, physicians, and customer healthcare facilities primarily through operation centers located in Boca Raton, Florida; Woodland Hills, California; and Berkeley Lake, Georgia. In addition to the key sales and recruitment activities, certain of these centers also perform support activities such as coordinating housing, payroll processing, benefits administration, billing and collections, travel reimbursement processing, customer service, and risk management.
(6)Information Systems. Various information systems are utilized to run our customer relationship management, recruitment, and placement functions based on our different brands. Some of these sophisticated applications are proprietary and are hosted in Tier 1 hosting facilities while other systems are Software as a Service (SaaS) based and hosted by our vendor partners. Our systems maintain detailed information about our customer required skillsets and status which assist us in enabling fulfillment and assignment renewals. Our databases contain an extensive pool of existing and potential customers and all related recruitment and sales activity. Our financial and human resource systems are managed on leading enterprise resource planning software suites that manage certain aspects of accounts payable, accounts receivable, general ledger, billing, and human capital management. All of our systems are managed by our onshore and offshore Information Technology team. We continue to focus on cybersecurity risks and have engaged third parties to assist us in monitoring and managing our systems and devices and detecting cyber threats and stopping breaches.
(7)Risk Management, Insurance, and Benefits. Our risk management program is designed to ensure prompt notification of incidents by customers, clinicians, and independent contractors, educational training to our employees, loss analysis, and prompt reporting procedures to reduce our risk of exposure. While we cannot predict the future, we continuously review facts and incidents associated with professional liability and workers’ compensation claims in order to identify trends and reduce our risk of loss in the future where possible. We consider assessments provided by our customers and we work with clinicians and experts from our insurance carriers to determine employment eligibility and potential exposure.
We provide workers’ compensation insurance coverage, professional liability coverage, and healthcare benefits for our eligible employed temporary professionals. We record estimates of the ultimate cost of, and reserves for, workers' compensation and professional liability benefits based on actuarial models prepared or reviewed by an independent actuary using our loss history as well as industry statistics. In determining our reserves, we include reserves for estimated claims incurred but not reported. On a quarterly basis, we estimate the healthcare claims that have occurred but have not been reported based on our historical claim submission patterns. The ultimate cost of workers’ compensation, professional liability, and health insurance claims will depend on actual amounts incurred to settle those claims and may differ from the amounts reserved for such claims.
The Company maintains a number of insurance policies including general liability, workers’ compensation, fidelity, employment practices liability, fiduciary, directors and officers, cyber, property, and professional liability policies. These policies provide coverage subject to their terms, conditions, limits of liability, and deductibles, for certain liabilities that may arise from our operations. There can be no assurance that any of the above policies will be adequate for our needs, or that we will maintain all such policies in the future.
Our Geographic Markets and Client Base
In 2020, 2019, and 2018, primarily all of our revenue was generated in the United States, and all of our long-lived assets were located in the United States and India. We provide our staffing services and workforce solutions in all 50 states. During 2020, the largest percentage of our revenue was concentrated in California, New York, and Florida. We provide services to public and private acute care and non-acute care hospitals, outpatient clinics, ambulatory care facilities, single and multi-specialty physician practices, rehabilitation facilities, urgent care centers, public and charter schools, correctional facilities, government facilities, retailers, and many other healthcare providers. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, no customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue.
Our Industry

We compete in the U.S. temporary healthcare staffing and workforce solutions markets. Staffing Industry Analysts September 2020 report estimates the healthcare staffing markets had an aggregate market size of $17.3 billion in 2020, of which $6.7 billion was travel nursing, $3.5 billion was per diem nursing, $3.7 billion was allied health, and $3.4 billion was locum tenens and advanced practitioners. The demand for our services is impacted by many factors, of which we believe the most significant are the following:
Industry Demand Drivers
Economic Backdrop. In December 2020, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the total national unemployment rate was 6.7%, well above the pre-COVID-19 rate of 3.6% from December 2019. Temporary help employment was down 7.6% from the prior year. However, temporary help services did gain 67,600 jobs for the month of December 2020. According to the Staffing Industry Analysts “US Staffing Industry Pulse Survey Report” (December 2020), the U.S. is beginning to experience a continued upward trend throughout staffing. In November 2020, travel nurse staffing reported median year-over-year growth of 32%, life sciences reported growth of 21%, and per diem nursing was up 10%. It is anticipated that the U.S. staffing industry will continue to recover along with the economy in 2021, and grow 12% to $141.5 billion, according to Staffing Industry Analysts “US Staffing Industry Forecast: September 2020 Update” (September 10, 2020). This outlook relies on three key assumptions: 1) the spread of COVID-19 will continue a downward trend, 2) U.S. GDP growth will continue a gradual but steady recovery, and 3) a COVID-19 vaccine will be widely available in the first half of 2021.
Increased Need for Healthcare and Special Education Services in Schools. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), enacted in 1975, mandates that children and youth ages 3-21 with disabilities be provided a free and appropriate public school education. According to the U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistic Report titled “The Condition of Education" (May 19, 2020), in 2018-19, the number of students ages 3-21 who received special education services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) was 7.1 million, or 14% of all public school students. The IDEA requires that these children and young adults receive care from speech language pathologists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, nurses and other healthcare professionals while at school. According to the US Government of Education report dated September 28, 2020, no matter what primary instructional delivery approach is chosen (remote/distance, in-person, hybrid) in response to COVID-19, each child with disabilities must be provided a free appropriate public education. Based on the foregoing, we believe the demand for consulting and healthcare staffing services for public schools and charter schools will continue to be strong for agencies that can provide consulting services, healthcare personnel, technical assistance on policies, implementation, and training related to children and youth with special needs in or out of school settings.
Healthcare Sector Endured Job Losses in 2020 Owing to COVID-19. The healthcare sector lost 527,000 jobs between February 2020 and November 2020, and the pace of improvement in the labor market has moderated in recent months, according to HealthleadersMedia.com, “Healthcare Added 46k Jobs in November” (December 4, 2020). According to the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics 10-year projections, overall, employment is expected to grow 3.7%, far outpaced by employment in the healthcare and social assistance industry (14.6%). Five out of the 20 fastest growing occupations are healthcare related. 
Hospitals Seeking Efficiencies Through Various Workforce Solutions. As hospitals look to contingent labor to help support their staffing needs in the highly volatile COVID-19 environment, they have an increased focus on cost containment. As a result, certain COVID-19 related hospital orders reflect a shorter length of assignment than the typical pre-COVID-19 length of approximately thirteen weeks. We believe that the COVID-19 economic impact will continue to put pressure on hospitals to find innovative solutions in order to better manage their workforce, which accounts for a large portion of their expenses. As a result, we believe healthcare facilities and providers will continue to utilize workforce solutions, such as MSP, RPO, IRP, and other talent management tools to help them solve these problems and maintain their quality of care.
Macro Drivers of Demand. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) increased the number of insured patients over the past several years, especially in states that expanded Medicaid. In addition, two other long-term macro drivers of our business, a growing and aging U.S. population, should continue to drive demand for our services. According to the U.S. 
Census Bureau, the number of persons aged 65 and over is expected to increase from 56 million in 2020 to 95 million in 2060, which is important because the utilization of healthcare services is generally higher among older people.
Healthcare Trends Resulting from COVID-19. Virtual care, which gained popularity in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, will continue to see growth in the next year, according to HealthleadersMedia.com “Business Group on Health: 5 Healthcare Trends to Follow in 2021” (January 12, 2021). They unveiled key healthcare trends to watch in 2021. Virtual options will improve and include new features such as weight management and care management for chronic conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The pandemic also affected the way healthcare delivery is operated, including moving lower acuity out of the hospital to free up beds for patients with COVID-19 and other serious conditions. This trend will continue, and efforts to change healthcare delivery will increase in 2021 to drive improvements in quality and value. Research from Arizton Advisory & Intelligence projects that the U.S. telehealth market will reach $25 billion by 2025, growing at an annual rate of 29%, according to HealthleadersMedia.com, “Analysis Predicts Telehealth in 2021 Will Mitigate Rising COVID-19-Related Costs” (December 10, 2020).
Supply of Nurses. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Employment Projections 2019-2029, Registered Nursing (RN) is listed among the top occupations in terms of job growth through 2029. The RN workforce is expected to grow from 3.0 million in 2019 to 3.3 million in 2029, an increase of 221,900 or 7%. The Bureau also projects the need for an additional 175,900 new RNs each year through 2029, factoring in nurse retirements and workforce exits. According to the American Nurses Association “Amid a raging pandemic, the US faces a nursing shortage. Can we close the gap?” (November 20, 2020), it is projected that 1.1 million nurses will be required to replace nurses who are retiring and to meet needs by 2022. It is projected that a million nurses are expected to retire between 2020 and 2035. As a result of the stress caused by COVID-19, many nurses have considered quitting their jobs or leaving the profession altogether. Also, approximately 73 million baby boomers are aging, many with chronic illnesses that require intensive levels of care. Another factor influencing demand is the shortage of instructors. According to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing, more than 80,000 qualified applicants to bachelor and graduate nursing programs were turned away last year due to factors such as insufficient faculty, clinical sites, or classroom space, and clinical preceptors, as well as budget constraints. We believe these shortages should have a positive effect on demand for our services as temporary nurse staffing orders typically increase when nurse vacancy rates rise.
Physician Shortage. According to the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) “The Complexities of Physician Supply and Demand: Projections From 2018 to 2033” (June 2020), the United States is expected to face a shortage of physicians. The projections show a shortage ranging between 54,100 and 139,000 by 2033 as demand for physicians continues to outpace supply, according to AAMC, including shortfalls in both primary and specialty care. In addition, more than 40% of physicians in the U.S. will be age 65 or over within the next decade. And as the health care system continues to treat patients during COVID-19, there are growing concerns about physician burnout that suggests physicians will be more likely to accelerate than delay retirement.
Industry Competition
As one of the largest providers of workforce solutions and healthcare staffing in the U.S., we operate on a national, regional, and local basis in a highly competitive industry for both healthcare customers and healthcare professionals. In general, we compete against other national companies, as well as numerous smaller, regional, and local companies.
The principal competitive factors in attracting, retaining, and expanding business with healthcare customers nationally include: (i) understanding the customer’s work environment; (ii) offering a comprehensive suite of services to assist the customer in assessing its personnel needs and partnering with customers to design various customizable alternative solutions; (iii) the timely filling of customers' needs; (iv) price; (v) customer service; (vi) quality assurance and screening capabilities; (vii) risk management policies; (viii) insurance coverage; and (ix) general industry reputation.
Through our breadth and expertise of value-added workforce solutions that we offer, we have the ability to meet a national shift towards a more integrated delivery of healthcare which allows us to assist hospitals and health systems turning to lower-cost, more accessible alternatives, such as outpatient or ambulatory care centers. By offering travel, per diem, and permanent placement of a variety of healthcare professionals, we are able to present many different types of personnel to hospitals and health systems at their main campuses and their ambulatory and outpatient facilities.
The principal competitive factors in attracting qualified healthcare professionals for temporary employment include: (i) a large national pool of desirable assignments; (ii) pay and benefits; (iii) speed of placements; (iv) customer service; (v) quality of 
accommodations; and (vi) overall industry reputation. We focus on retaining healthcare professionals by providing high-quality customer service, long-term benefits (to employees), and medical malpractice insurance.
From a candidate attraction standpoint, we have an extensive customer base with hospitals and healthcare facilities, and other healthcare providers, throughout the U.S. As a result, we have a diverse portfolio of assignments for our healthcare professionals to choose from. Healthcare professionals apply with us through our differentiated nursing, locum tenens, and allied healthcare recruitment brands. We believe our access to such a large and diverse group of healthcare professionals makes us more attractive to healthcare institutions and facilities seeking healthcare staffing and workforce solutions in the current dynamic marketplace. The implementation of our new applicant tracking system for our travel nurse and allied business creates further operational efficiencies, enhanced productivity, and provides a world-class candidate experience.
Staffing Industry Analysts recognized us as the fifth-largest healthcare staffing firm in the U.S., with 4% market share in 2019. We rank as the fourth-largest travel nurse staffing firm, the second-largest per diem nurse staffing firm, the fifth-largest allied healthcare staffing firm, and the ninth-largest locum tenens firm. Some of our traditional competitors in the workforce solutions, healthcare staffing, and search businesses include: AMN Healthcare Services, Inc., CHG Healthcare Services, Jackson Healthcare, Aya Healthcare, HealthTrust Workforce Solutions, Medical Solutions, and Witt Kiefer. In recent years, several technology-enabled companies have entered the market, though at present we believe the current scale is limited.
Seasonality
The number of healthcare professionals on assignment with us is subject to seasonal fluctuations which may impact our quarterly revenue and earnings. Hospital patient census and staffing needs of our hospital and healthcare facilities fluctuate, which impact our number of orders for a particular period. Many of our hospital and healthcare facility clients are located in areas that experience seasonal fluctuations in population during the winter and summer months. These facilities adjust their staffing levels to accommodate the change in this seasonal demand and many of these facilities utilize temporary healthcare professionals to satisfy these seasonal staffing needs. Likewise, the number of nurse and allied professionals on assignment may fluctuate due to the seasonal preferences for destinations of our temporary nurse and allied professionals. In addition, we expect our Physician Staffing business to experience higher demand in the summer months as physicians take vacations. We also expect our education and school business to experience lower demand in the summer months when public and charter schools are closed. This historical seasonality of revenue and earnings may vary due to a variety of factors and the results of any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year. In addition, typically, our first quarter results are negatively impacted by the reset of payroll taxes.
Certifications
The staffing businesses of our brands are certified by The Joint Commission under its Health Care Staffing Services Certification Program. In addition, Credent Verification and Licensing Services, a subsidiary of MDA, is certified by the NCQA.
Regulations
Our business is subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate throughout the U.S. Complex federal and state laws and regulations govern, among other things, the licensure of professionals, the payment of our employees (e.g., wage and hour laws, employment taxes, and income tax withholdings, etc.), and the general operations of our business, which may be amended from time to time. Future federal and state legislation or interpretations thereof may require us to change our business practices. Compliance with all of these applicable rules and regulations require a significant amount of resources. We endeavor to be in compliance with all such rules and regulations.

Our ability to be successful in our marketplace directly depends on attracting and retaining talented and skilled employees, and keeping those individuals fully engaged in our business.

This 
policy sets forth our intolerance of discrimination and harassment, our employees’ freedom of association, and the importance we place on the safety and health of our employees.

Our wellness activity calendar features monthly events and educational sessions to help employees reach and maintain their health and wellness goals.

We also mark one or more health observances every month, such as heart health, high blood pressure awareness, men’s health, children’s dental health, and more, which provide additional resources for employees to educate themselves and their families.
Talent Development. Our mission regarding talent management and development is to support organizational results and success by employing strategies to attract, engage, develop, and retain employees, and to partner with our leaders to nurture and grow leadership talent. These investments include providing clear insight into employee performance, creating career paths, promoting from within whenever possible, maintaining open communication, and offering professional development opportunities. During 2019, we introduced three new series of career development and over 1,000 employees participated in these training programs: Leadership Education and Development, Leadership Essentials to Accelerate Performance, and New Leader Assimilation. We have also embraced the Nursing Now pledge by reinforcing investment in the workforce, continuing to promote nurses to management roles, and providing guidance and support on best nursing practices through our dedicated clinical team. Nurse Now is a global campaign aimed at improving health by raising the status and profile of nursing.
Community and Social Impact. We participate in numerous events with a variety of non-profit organizations. Our mission to deliver quality patient care extends to our community and we are committed to action that fosters positive impact in our community and around the U.S. Our human resources department develops and implements programs to help our employees realize their potential through volunteering and supporting our communities. Employees are able to donate to a charity of their choice directly from their paychecks, either as a one-time donation or ongoing. We have also launched an employee-led council which encourages employees from a wide variety of backgrounds and of diversity to come together, connect, build relationships, and have their voices heard.
We have a long-standing commitment to our employees to create a business working environment that fosters engagement through personal innovation, achievement, wellness, advancement and training/development opportunities, promoting health and safety, and investments in their communities. These efforts culminate in creating a business culture of achievement and loyalty that enables us to minimize turnover in our workforce and succeed in competitive and challenging marketplaces.
