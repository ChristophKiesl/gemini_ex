ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview


Wally World Media, Inc. does not have significant operations. It intends to effect a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, or similar business combination with one or more businesses. The company was founded in 2012 and is headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada.
 
Based on our proposed business activities, we are a “blank check” company. The SEC defines those companies as “any development stage company that is issuing a penny stock, within the meaning of Section 3(a)(51) of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the “Exchange Act”) and that has no specific business plan or purpose or has indicated that its business plan is to merge with an unidentified company or companies.” Under SEC Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), we also qualify as a “shell company,” because we have no or nominal assets (other than cash) and no or nominal operations. Many states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of “blank check” companies in their respective jurisdictions. We intend to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for so long as we are subject to those requirements.
 
Corporate Background
 
Wally World Media, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 17, 2012. Initially, we were a start-up business engaged primarily in social media software and mobile app development.


The Company developed a social media website that we referred to as “YouPop.” Our “YouPop” platform launched for public use in April 2013. On March 19, 2014, we launched reShoot™, a free mobile video camera app for Apple’s iPhone and iPad. reShoot features patent-pending “on the fly” video editing technology to rewind and re-shoot unwanted portions of video.
 
In March of 2014, the Company formed Vape Shop Holdings, Inc. (“Vape Shop”), as a wholly-owned subsidiary. On April 20, 2014, Vape Shop signed a Joint Venture Agreement with Vapir, Inc., a California company (“Vapir”). In June 2014, this joint venture was terminated by mutual consent. We did not issue any shares of common stock or warrants to Vapir, Inc. and do not owe Vapir, Inc. any further consideration under the terms of the joint venture or its termination.
 
On July 31, 2014, the Company launched the Emoji Cam Photo & Video Camera app for Apple’s iPhone and iPad.


None of our applications or business ventures were met with any notable commercial success. The Company has been dormant since December 2015.

Between December 2015 and June 30, 2021, the Company was abandoned by its officers and directors, as they failed to file the required annual list of officers and pay the annual fees owed to the Nevada Secretary of State. As a result, the Company’s corporate charter was revoked.
 
Custodianship & Corporate Rehabilitation
 
On May 17, 2021, Shareholders First LLC filed a petition in the Eighth Judicial District Court of Clark County, Nevada, Case Number: A-21-834721-P, for the appointment of a custodian over the affairs of the Company pursuant to NRS 78.347(1)(b).


On June 29, 2021, the Eighth Judicial District Court of Nevada appointed Shareholders First LLC as custodian for Wally World Media, Inc., proper notice having been given to the officers and directors of Wally World Media, Inc. There was no opposition.
 
On June 30, 2021, the Company filed a certificate of revival with the Nevada Secretary of State, appointing Grant Casey as: President, Secretary, Treasurer, and Director. On the same date, Grant Casey, in his role as our sole director, appointed Geoffrey Chan as our second Director.
 
Business Objectives of the Company
 
Since the custodianship proceedings, the Company has had no business operations. Management has determined to direct its efforts and limited resources to pursue potential new business opportunities. The Company does not intend to limit itself to a particular industry and has not established any particular criteria upon which it shall consider a business opportunity.
 
Our common stock is quoted on the OTC Pink Sheets under the symbol WLYW. There is currently only a limited trading market in our shares of common stock. Management does not believe that any active trading market has existed for approximately the last five years. There can be no assurance that there will be an active trading market for our securities. In the event that an active trading market commences, there can be no assurance as to the market price of our shares of common stock, whether any trading market will provide liquidity to investors, or whether any trading market will be sustained.
 
Management of the Company will have substantial flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective new business opportunity. The Company is dependent on the judgment of its management in connection with this process. In evaluating a prospective business opportunity, we would consider, among other factors, the following:
 

● | costs associated with pursuing a new business opportunity; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | growth potential of the new business opportunity; 
● | experiences, skills and availability of additional personnel necessary to pursue a potential new business opportunity; 
● | necessary capital requirements; 
● | the competitive position of the new business opportunity; 
● | stage of business development; 
● | the market acceptance of the potential products and services; 
● | proprietary features and degree of intellectual property; and 
● | the regulatory environment that may be applicable to any prospective business opportunity. 

 
The foregoing criteria are not intended to be exhaustive and there may be other criteria that management may deem relevant. In connection with an evaluation of a prospective or potential business opportunity, management may be expected to conduct a due diligence review.
 
The time and costs required to pursue new business opportunities, which includes negotiating and documenting relevant agreements and preparing requisite documents for filing pursuant to applicable securities laws, cannot be ascertained with any degree of certainty.
 
Management intends to devote such time as it deems necessary to carry out the Company’s affairs. The exact length of time required for the pursuit of any new potential business opportunities is uncertain. No assurance can be made that we will be successful in our efforts. We cannot project the amount of time that our management will actually devote to the Company’s plan of operation.

Effecting a business combination
 
Prospective investors in our common stock will not have an opportunity to evaluate the specific merits or risks of any of the one or more business combinations that we may undertake. A business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which needs to raise substantial additional capital by means of being a publicly trading company, while avoiding what it may deem to be adverse consequences of undertaking a public offering itself. These include time delays, significant expense, loss of voting control and compliance with various Federal and State securities laws. A business combination may involve a company which may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth.
 
The Company has not identified a target business or target industry
 
Our effort in identifying a prospective target business will not be limited to a particular industry and we may ultimately acquire a business in any industry management deems appropriate. To date, the Company has not selected any target business on which to concentrate our search for a business combination. While the Company intends to focus on target businesses in the United States, it is not limited to U.S. entities and may consummate a business combination with a target business outside of the United States. Accordingly, there is no basis for investors in the Company’s common stock to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the target business or the particular industry in which we may ultimately operate. To the extent we effect a business combination with a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stage of development or growth, including entities without established records of sales or earnings, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies. In addition, to the extent that we effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk, we may be affected by the currently unascertainable risks of that industry. An extremely high level of risk frequently characterizes many industries which experience rapid growth. In addition, although the Company’s management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular industry or target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
 
Sources of target businesses
 
Our management anticipates that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including securities broker-dealers, investment bankers, venture capitalists, bankers and other members of the financial community, who may present solicited or unsolicited proposals. Our management may also bring to our attention target business candidates. While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, we may engage these firms in the future, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee or other compensation in connection with a business combination. In no event, however, will we pay management any finder’s fee or other compensation for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the consummation of a business combination.
 
Selection of a target business and structuring of a business combination
 
Management owns approximately 88% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company, and will have broad flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective target business. In evaluating a prospective target business, our management will consider, among other factors, the following:
 

● | Financial condition and results of operation of the target company; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Growth potential; 
● | Experience and skill of management and availability of additional personnel; 
● | Capital requirements; 
● | Competitive position; 
● | Stage of development of the products, processes or services; 
● | Degree of current or potential market acceptance of the products, processes or services; 
● | Proprietary features and degree of intellectual property or other protection of the products, processes or services; 
● | Regulatory environment of the industry; and 
● | Costs associated with effecting the business combination.

These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular business combination will be based, to the extent relevant, on the above factors as well as other considerations deemed relevant by our management in effecting a business combination consistent with our business objective. In evaluating a prospective target business, we will conduct a due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and inspection of facilities, as well as review of financial and other information which will be made available to us.
 
We will endeavor to structure a business combination so as to achieve the most favorable tax treatment to us, the target business and both companies’ stockholders. However, there can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service or applicable state tax authorities will necessarily agree with the tax treatment of any business combination we consummate.
 
The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete the business combination cannot presently be ascertained with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us.
 
Probable lack of business diversification
 
While we may seek to effect business combinations with more than one target business, it is more probable that we will only have the ability to effect a single business combination, if at all. Accordingly, the prospects for our success may be entirely dependent upon the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations with entities operating in multiple industries or multiple areas of a single industry, it is probable that we will lack the resources to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses. By consummating a business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:
 

● | Subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to a business combination, and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Result in our dependency upon the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services. 

 
Very limited liquidity of our common stock
 
Our common stock occasionally trades on the OTC Pink Sheet Market, as there is no active market maker in our common stock. As a result, there is only limited liquidity in our common stock.
 
Limited ability to evaluate the target business’ management
 
We cannot assure you that our assessment of the target business’ management will prove to be correct. In addition, we cannot assure you that the future management will have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company intending to embark on a program of business development. Furthermore, the future role of our director, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty.
 
While it is possible that our director will remain associated in some capacity with us following a business combination, it is unlikely that he will devote his full efforts to our affairs subsequent to a business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that our director will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.
 
Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.
 
Our auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern
 
Our audited financial statements for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, were prepared using the assumption that we will continue our operations as a going concern. Our independent accountants in their audit report have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our operations are dependent on our ability to raise sufficient capital or complete business combination as a result of which we become profitable. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. There is not enough cash on hand to fund our administrative expenses and operating expenses for the next twelve months. Therefore, we may be unable to continue operations in the future as a going concern. If we cannot continue as a viable entity, our stockholders may lose some or all of their investment in the Company’s shares of common stock.

Competition and Market Condition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we expect to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations, either directly or through affiliates. Many if not virtually most of these competitors possess far greater financial, human and other resources compared to our resources. While we believe that there are numerous potential target businesses that we may identify, our ability to compete in acquiring certain of the more desirable target businesses will be limited by our limited financial and human resources. Our inherent competitive limitations are expected by management to give others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business that we may identify and seek to pursue. Further, any of these limitations may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. Our management believes, however, that our status as a reporting public entity with potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over certain privately-held entities having a similar business objective in acquiring a desirable target business with growth potential on favorable terms.
 
If we succeed in effecting a business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from existing competitors of the business we acquire. In particular, certain industries which experience rapid growth frequently attract an increasingly larger number of competitors, including those with far greater financial, marketing, technical and other resources than the initial competitors in the industry in which we seek to operate. The degree of competition characterizing the industry of any prospective target business cannot presently be ascertained. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the resources to compete effectively, especially to the extent that the target business is in a high-growth industry.
 
Employees
 
Grant Casey, our President and Chief Executive Officer, is our sole executive officer. Mr. Casey is not obligated to devote any specific number of hours per week and, in fact, intends to devote only as much time as he deems reasonably necessary to administer the Company’s affairs until such time as a business combination is consummated. The amount of time he will devote in any time period will vary based on the availability of suitable target businesses to investigate. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the consummation of a business combination.
Conflicts of Interest
 
The Company’s management is not required to commit its full time to the Company’s affairs. As a result, pursuing new business opportunities may require a longer period of time than if management would devote full time to the Company’s affairs. Management is not precluded from serving as an officer or director of any other entity that is engaged in business activities similar to those of the Company. Management has not identified and is not currently negotiating a new business opportunity for us. In the future, management may become associated or affiliated with entities engaged in business activities similar to those we intend to conduct. In such event, management may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented. In the event that the Company’s management has multiple business affiliations, our management may have legal obligations to present certain business opportunities to multiple entities. In the event that a conflict of interest shall arise, management will consider factors such as reporting status, availability of audited financial statements, current capitalization and the laws of jurisdictions. If several business opportunities or operating entities approach management with respect to a business combination, management will consider the foregoing factors as well as the preferences of the management of the operating company. However, management will act in what it believes will be in the best interests of the shareholders of the Company.
Regulation
 
As of the date of this Report, we are required to file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) by Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”).
 
Depending on the direction management decides to take and a business or businesses we may acquire in the future, we may become subject to other laws or regulations that require us to make material expenditures on compliance including the increasing state-level regulation of privacy. Any such requirements could require us to divert significant human and capital resources on compliance, which could have an adverse effect on our future operating results.

Smaller Reporting Company Status
 
We qualify as a “smaller reporting company” under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, which is defined as a company with a public equity float of less than $250 million or it has less than $100 million in annual revenues and no public float or public float of less than $700 million. To the extent that we remain a smaller reporting company, we will have reduced disclosure requirements for our public filings, including: (1) less extensive narrative disclosure than required of other reporting companies, particularly in the description of executive compensation and (2) the requirement to provide only two years of audited financial statements, instead of three years. In addition, until such time as the public float of our common stock exceeds $75 million, we will be a non-accelerated filer and will not be required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes Oxley Act.
Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
 
As a company with less than $1.0 billion in revenue during our most recently completed fiscal year, we qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, which we refer to as the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable, in general, to public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These provisions include:

● | Reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | No non-binding shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements; 
● | Exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting; and 
● | Reduced disclosure of financial information in this prospectus, limited to two years of audited financial information and two years of selected financial information. 

 
As a smaller reporting company, each of the foregoing exemptions is currently available to us. We may take advantage of these exemptions for up to five years or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. We would cease to be an emerging growth company if we have more than $1.0 billion in annual revenues as of the end of a fiscal year, if we are deemed to be a large-accelerated filer under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or if we issue more than $1.0 billion of non- convertible debt over a three-year-period.
 
The JOBS Act permits an emerging growth company to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. We have elected the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards pursuant to Section 107(b) of the Act until the earlier of the date we (i) are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates.
 
Available Information
 
Our periodic reports filed with the SEC, which include Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, Form 8-K and amendments thereto, may be accessed by the public free of charge from the SEC and through OTC Markets. Electronic copies of these reports can be accessed at the SEC’s website (http://www.sec.gov) and indirectly through the Company’s website (http://www.WallyWorldMedia.com).
