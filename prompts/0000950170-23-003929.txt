ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company driven to create and deliver transformative medicines for people living with psychiatric and neurological conditions. Our pipeline is primarily built on the broad therapeutic potential of our proprietary lead product candidate, KarXT (xanomeline-trospium), an oral modulator of muscarinic receptors that are located both in the central nervous system, or CNS, and various peripheral tissues. KarXT combines xanomeline, a novel muscarinic agonist, with trospium, an approved muscarinic antagonist, to preferentially stimulate muscarinic receptors in the CNS. We are initially developing KarXT for the treatment of acute psychosis in adults with schizophrenia, as well as for the treatment of psychosis in Alzheimer's disease, or AD.
Schizophrenia is a chronic disabling disorder that is characterized by recurring episodes of psychosis requiring long-term treatment with antipsychotic drugs in most patients. Psychotic symptoms, also known as positive symptoms, include hallucinations and delusions. As a result of the disease, patients with schizophrenia also experience negative symptoms, such as apathy, reduced social drive, loss of motivation and lack of social interest, as well as cognitive impairment. It is estimated that more than 21 million people are living with schizophrenia worldwide, with approximately 2.7 million in the United States, or approximately 0.5% to 1.0% of the United States population.
AD, an irreversible, progressive neurodegenerative brain disorder that slowly destroys memory and cognition, is the most common form of dementia, accounting for an estimated 60% to 80% of the approximately 8.4 million people living with dementia in the United States. Up to 50% of AD patients exhibit psychiatric symptoms, which often leads to institutional care in a hospital or nursing home. Although the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, has not to date approved any drug to treat the psychotic or behavioral symptoms of AD, physicians often resort to off-label use of antipsychotic medications to treat these patients as symptoms progress and become more severe.
 Despite the large number of antipsychotic drugs developed over the last 20 years, current medicines have undergone only modest innovation relative to first generation drugs developed in the 1950s. In many patients, current antipsychotics are hampered by modest efficacy, significant side effects and safety concerns. At least half of patients fail to adequately respond to antipsychotic drugs. Additionally, in many patients, these treatments are associated with severe side effects including sedation, extrapyramidal side effects, such as motor rigidity, tremors and slurred speech, and significant weight gain resulting in the complications of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension and cardiovascular disease.


We are initially developing KarXT for the treatment of acute psychosis in adults with schizophrenia, as well as for the treatment of psychosis in AD. KarXT combines xanomeline, a muscarinic receptor agonist that preferentially stimulates M1 and M4 muscarinic receptors, and trospium, an approved muscarinic receptor antagonist that does not measurably cross the blood-brain barrier, confining its effects to peripheral tissues. M1 and M4 muscarinic receptors are the receptor subtypes believed to mediate the antipsychotic and procognitive effects of xanomeline and other muscarinic agonists. Results from preclinical studies and clinical trials conducted by third parties support the hypothesis that xanomeline can reduce psychosis and improve cognition. To our knowledge, xanomeline is the only muscarinic orthosteric agonist that has demonstrated therapeutic benefit in clinical trials in both schizophrenia and AD. Like all muscarinic orthosteric agonists studied to date, however, xanomeline’s tolerability has been limited by side effects arising from muscarinic receptor stimulation in peripheral tissues, leading to nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and increased salivation and sweating, collectively referred to as cholinergic adverse events. Trospium is a muscarinic receptor antagonist approved in the United States and Europe for the treatment of overactive bladder that inhibits all five muscarinic receptor subtypes in peripheral tissues. We believe that the combination of xanomeline and trospium in KarXT has the potential to preferentially stimulate M1 and M4 muscarinic receptors in the brain without stimulating muscarinic receptors in peripheral tissues in order to achieve meaningful therapeutic benefit in patients with psychotic and cognitive disorders.
The EMERGENT program is our clinical program evaluating KarXT for the treatment of schizophrenia as a monotherapy, and includes our completed positive Phase 2 EMERGENT-1 and Phase 3 EMERGENT-2 trials and three additional Phase 3 trials (EMERGENT-3, EMERGENT-4, and EMERGENT-5). In August 2022, we announced positive topline results from our Phase 3 EMERGENT-2 trial evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of KarXT compared to placebo for the treatment of acute psychosis in adults with schizophrenia. KarXT met the primary endpoint, demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful 9.6-point reduction in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, or PANSS, total score compared to placebo at Week 5 (Cohen’s d effect size of 0.61). KarXT also demonstrated an early and sustained statistically significant reduction of symptoms, as assessed by PANSS total score, starting at Week 2 and maintained such reduction through all timepoints in the trial. KarXT also met all secondary endpoints, demonstrating a statistically significant 2.9-point reduction in the PANSS positive symptoms subscale, a 1.8-point reduction in PANSS negative symptoms subscale, a 2.2-point reduction in PANSS negative Marder factor subscale, and a 0.6-point reduction in CGI-S score, compared to placebo at Week 5. Additionally, a statistically significant greater proportion of patients in the KarXT arm had a ≥30% reduction in PANSS total score compared with placebo at Week 5 (p<0.0001). KarXT was generally well-tolerated in the EMERGENT-2 trial and was not associated with common problematic side effects of current treatments, including sedation (somnolence), weight gain, and extrapyramidal symptoms. We plan to share results from exploratory endpoints in the future.
 Following the positive results of EMERGENT-1 in November 2019, we had an End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, in which the FDA indicated that our completed Phase 2 EMERGENT-1 trial, along with one successful Phase 3 efficacy and safety trial, and additional safety data to meet regulatory requirements, would be acceptable to support a New Drug Application, or NDA, submission in schizophrenia. As a result of our completed Phase 3 EMERGENT-2 trial, we plan to submit our NDA for KarXT for the treatment of schizophrenia to the FDA in mid-2023. We define mid-year as the second and third quarters of a calendar year. If approved, we are targeting a potential commercial launch of KarXT for the treatment of schizophrenia in the second half of 2024.
 In addition to our completed Phase 2 EMERGENT-1 and Phase 3 EMERGENT-2 trials, our EMERGENT program includes the following Phase 3 trials:
 •EMERGENT-3: A five-week inpatient trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of KarXT compared to placebo in 256 adults with schizophrenia in the United States and Ukraine. Enrollment for this trial completed in the fourth quarter of 2022 and we anticipate topline data in the first quarter of 2023.
 •EMERGENT-4: A 52-week outpatient, open-label extension trial evaluating the long-term safety and tolerability of KarXT in adults with schizophrenia who completed EMERGENT-2 or EMERGENT-3. Enrollment for this trial completed in the fourth quarter of 2022. 


•EMERGENT-5: A 52-week outpatient, open-label trial conducted in the United States and Puerto Rico evaluating the long-term safety and tolerability of KarXT in adults with schizophrenia who were not enrolled in EMERGENT-2 or EMERGENT-3. Enrollment for this trial began in the second quarter of 2021. 
 Given the unique mechanism of action of KarXT in comparison to existing standard of care therapies, we believe there is the potential for therapeutic benefit as both a monotherapy and as an adjunctive therapy for the treatment of schizophrenia. In November 2021, we initiated our Phase 3 ARISE trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of KarXT compared to placebo as an adjunctive treatment in adults with schizophrenia who have an inadequate response to their current antipsychotic therapy. This six-week, 1:1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 outpatient trial is designed to enroll approximately 400 adults with schizophrenia who have not achieved an adequate response to their current atypical antipsychotic treatment. The primary outcome measure of the trial is change in PANSS total score of KarXT compared to placebo at week 6. Upon completion of the trial at week 6, participants have the opportunity to enroll in our ARISE-2 trial, an ongoing 52-week outpatient, open-label extension trial evaluating the long-term safety and tolerability of KarXT when dosed with atypical antipsychotic treatment. We anticipate topline data from the ARISE trial in the first half of 2024.
 We plan to utilize the data from the EMERGENT and ARISE clinical programs to help inform future potential development plans for KarXT in negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia, for which there are currently no approved treatments.
We are also developing KarXT as a potential treatment for psychosis related to AD. The ADEPT program, which is the clinical program evaluating KarXT as a potential treatment for psychosis related to AD, consists of the following ongoing and planned Phase 3 trials:
•ADEPT-1: A trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of KarXT compared to placebo in up to 400 adults with moderate to severe psychosis related to AD. This trial consists of a 12-week, single-blind treatment period, followed by a 26-week, double-blind, randomized withdrawal period in which subjects who meet the response criteria will be randomized to receive KarXT or placebo. The single-blind treatment period is designed to enroll approximately 400 adults with AD, between 55 and 90 years old, with moderate to severe hallucinations or delusions, who are living at home or at an assisted living facility. The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate relapse prevention as measured by time from randomization to relapse during the 26-week, double-blind period. Enrollment for this trial began in the third quarter of 2022 and topline data is anticipated in 2025.
 •ADEPT-2: A 12-week, flexible-dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of KarXT versus placebo. ADEPT-2 is expected to initiate in the second half of 2023, with topline data anticipated in 2025.
 •ADEPT-3: A 52-week open-label extension trial evaluating the long-term safety and tolerability of KarXT in adults with psychosis related to AD who completed ADEPT-1 or ADEPT-2. Enrollment for this trial is anticipated to commence in 2023.
 In January 2023, we entered into an exclusive global license agreement for Goldfinch Bio, Inc.'s, or Goldfinch Bio's, investigational transient receptor potential canonical 4 and 5 (TRPC4/5) channel candidates, including the lead clinical-stage TRPC4/5 candidate, KAR-2618 (formerly GFB-887), after confirming select properties of KAR-2618 under a material transfer agreement. KAR-2618 has been dosed in over 100 humans across Goldfinch Bio’s clinical trials. We intend to develop KAR-2618 for the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders, and plan to provide details regarding the expected development of KAR-2618 in the second half of 2023.


We have assembled a team whose members have extensive expertise in the research, development and commercialization of numerous CNS agents, as well as deep familiarity with the biology of neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and psychosis related to AD, including the role of muscarinic receptors in the potential treatment of these diseases. We plan to leverage this expertise to develop a pipeline of product candidates targeting a broad range of psychiatric and neurological conditions, and, subject to FDA approval, transition to a fully integrated R&D and commercial organization.
 Pipeline
We are advancing a pipeline of therapeutic programs with KarXT to address psychiatric conditions, such as schizophrenia and psychosis related to AD. We are leveraging our expertise and experience to explore the development of KarXT for additional CNS disorders, as well as advance our other muscarinic-targeted drug candidates and a target-agnostic drug discovery program through our collaboration with PsychoGenics, Inc. In addition, we intend to develop our recently acquired lead investigational TRPC4/5 candidate, KAR-2618, for the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders, and plan to provide details regarding the expected development of KAR-2618 in the second half of 2023.
Muscarinic Receptor Biology in the Nervous System
Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers secreted by neurons, or nerve cells, to facilitate information flow and communication with other cells, such as muscle or similar nerve cells, in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. As a result, stimulating or inhibiting neurotransmission can have a profound effect on the overall function of an organism. There are many identified neurotransmitters with a variety of structures and functions. One of the key neurotransmitters in the brain is acetylcholine, for which there are two different receptor classes: ion channel-gated nicotinic receptors, and G protein-coupled muscarinic receptors. Within the muscarinic receptor family, there are five subtypes, M1 through M5, all of which are expressed in the brain and in peripheral tissues.

Muscarinic receptors serve a number of key physiological roles including in cognitive, behavioral, sensory, motor and autonomic processes. Disruption of muscarinic receptor signaling is believed to contribute to psychosis and cognitive impairment in a wide variety of diseases, including schizophrenia and AD. Conversely, third-party preclinical and clinical data suggest that the enhancement of muscarinic receptor signaling leads to improvement in these same symptoms. M1 and M4 muscarinic receptors in particular have been reported to be under-expressed in the brains of patients with schizophrenia. In animal behavioral models, drug candidates that selectively stimulated M1 and M4 muscarinic receptors have demonstrated improvements in psychosis and cognition. Third-party clinical data suggest that stimulation of M1 and M4 muscarinic receptors may similarly be therapeutically beneficial for the treatment of patients with these symptoms. Conversely, inhibition of these receptors has been observed to disrupt memory and cognition, as well as to exacerbate psychosis in patients with schizophrenia.
The stimulation of muscarinic receptors in peripheral tissues can have significant physiological consequences. In peripheral tissues, such as the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts, and salivary and sweat glands, M2 and M3 muscarinic receptors are prominently expressed and have specialized functions. In the gastrointestinal tract, muscarinic receptors play a significant role in regulating gastrointestinal motility. Dosing with agonists that stimulate these muscarinic receptors can lead to diarrhea and increased motility, while dosing with muscarinic antagonists can lead to constipation and decreased motility. In the bladder, stimulation or inhibition of muscarinic receptors modulates bladder contraction leading to increases or decreases in urinary frequency, respectively. Similarly, stimulation of muscarinic receptors in salivary glands and sweat glands can lead to increased salivation and sweating, respectively.
Background and Rationale for KarXT
We have designed our lead product candidate, KarXT, to preferentially stimulate M1 and M4 receptors in the brain, without stimulating muscarinic receptors in peripheral tissues outside the CNS. We assessed the potential of over 7,000 possible combinations of muscarinic receptor agonists and antagonists to find an optimized combination that could preferentially stimulate muscarinic receptors in the CNS to improve the symptoms of psychosis, while avoiding stimulation of muscarinic receptors in the peripheral tissues and the associated side effects. As a result of our research, we identified xanomeline and trospium as the most promising pairing for development. Trospium is a potent and effective muscarinic receptor antagonist that does not measurably cross the blood-brain barrier, confining its effects to peripheral tissues. We believe that the combination of xanomeline, a centrally-acting muscarinic agonist, and trospium, a peripherally-acting muscarinic antagonist, will have the therapeutic benefits of xanomeline but with markedly reduced side effects. Based on our clinical data with KarXT, either co-administered or co-formulated, and clinical data of xanomeline published by third parties, we believe that KarXT has potential therapeutic benefit in multiple CNS disorders, including the treatment of the positive, negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia, psychosis and agitation associated with dementia, including AD.
Xanomeline Background
Xanomeline as a treatment for psychosis and related neuropsychiatric disorders has been examined in clinicals trials enrolling over 1,000 subjects or patients conducted by us and third parties, with 68 patients being dosed for at least one year and a maximum treatment duration of almost four years. We believe that the results from these clinical trials, as well as results from numerous preclinical studies, support the further development of xanomeline, in the form of KarXT, as an antipsychotic and procognitive therapeutic agent.

Xanomeline for the Treatment of Psychotic Symptoms and Agitation in AD
 Eli Lilly and Company, or Eli Lilly, conducted a 343-patient, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial of xanomeline in patients with mild to moderate AD, administering up to 225 mg of xanomeline daily (75 mg three times a day, or TID), for 24 weeks. In this clinical trial, 87 patients received placebo, while 85, 83 and 87 patients received 75-150-225 mg of xanomeline, respectively. One patient who entered the trial was assigned to a group but never received study drug or placebo. As shown in the figure below, patients on xanomeline were observed to have dose-dependent decreases in multiple psychotic symptoms and related behaviors, including hallucinations, delusions and agitation, as compared to patients on placebo. For instance, one of the 17 patients (6%) in the placebo arm who presented with hallucinations at baseline had a remission of symptoms while receiving treatment, compared to nine of the 17 patients (53%) in the high-dose xanomeline arm (p=0.003). These responses were seen as early as two to three weeks after commencement of dosing with xanomeline. Xanomeline was also observed to reduce the emergence of psychotic symptoms over the course of the six-month trial in patients who did not have psychotic symptoms at the initiation of the trial. For example, 32% of patients in the placebo arm developed delusions during the trial compared to only 7% in the high-dose xanomeline treatment arm (p=0.001). A dose-response analysis across the 75-150-225 mg xanomeline dose levels reported increasing effects of xanomeline for several symptoms (P<0.05), suggesting that exploration of xanomeline doses above 75 mg TID has the potential for additional therapeutic benefits.

In this same trial, cognitive symptoms of patients with AD treated with xanomeline also showed improvements compared to placebo as measured by both the ADAS-Cog and the CIBIC+, suggesting that xanomeline may also improve cognition. The Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale, or ADAS-Cog, is one of the most frequently used tests to measure cognition while the Clinician Interview-Based Impression of Change plus caregiver interview, or CIBIC+, examines disease severity and changes in behavior, cognition and overall function on a scale of 1 to 7, where 1 means markedly improved and 7 means markedly worse. There were high rates of patient discontinuation in the mid-dose (48%) and high-dose (59%) xanomeline cohorts driven in part by side effects, compared to discontinuation rates of 35% and 19% for the placebo and low-dose xanomeline groups, respectively. This high discontinuation rate led to a substantial reduction of statistical power in this trial. Despite this reduction in statistical power, patients in the mid-dose cohort showed a statistically significant benefit on the CIBIC+ as compared to placebo (p=0.02, 4.11 vs. 4.34, respectively). An analysis of patients who completed the trial identified a mean benefit of 2.84 units on the ADAS-Cog for the 225 mg xanomeline arm over placebo (p<0.05), which is similar to the effect seen with donepezil, an approved treatment for the cognitive impairment associated with AD.
Xanomeline for the Treatment of Psychotic Symptoms in Schizophrenia
A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 trial of xanomeline was conducted in 20 patients with schizophrenia with acute psychosis, as a collaboration between Eli Lilly and the Indiana University School of Medicine. This monotherapy trial used the PANSS as a primary endpoint. The PANSS is a set of measurements used for evaluating symptom severity in patients with schizophrenia and the change in PANSS score has been used as the primary endpoint in many registrational trials of antipsychotic medicines. As depicted in the figure below, a clinically meaningful and statistically significant 24-point PANSS score difference was observed between xanomeline and placebo after 18 days of treatment, which was the pre-specified analysis time point. By comparison, meta-analyses of published clinicals trials of currently approved antipsychotic medicines report an average difference of nine to ten points in PANSS score versus placebo. Historically, changes as small as five points have supported the approval of current antipsychotics. While this xanomeline trial was designed primarily to evaluate changes in positive symptoms, a six-point improvement in negative symptoms, as measured by the PANSS-negative subscale, was also observed in patients treated with xanomeline as compared to placebo. Improvements in cognitive symptoms, including list learning (p<0.05), story recall (p<0.01), delayed memory (p<0.05) and digit span tests were also observed in patients treated with xanomeline as compared to placebo.

Effects of Xanomeline on Cognition in Patients with Schizophrenia





Limitations of Xanomeline
Despite xanomeline’s promising therapeutic benefit in treating psychosis and related behavioral symptoms in patients with schizophrenia and AD, its potential has been limited by cholinergic side effects, which are believed to result from the stimulation of muscarinic receptors in peripheral tissues. These side effects led to a 59% dropout rate in the high-dose xanomeline group compared to 35% on placebo in Eli Lilly’s six-month AD trial. Syncope, which is a temporary loss of consciousness, was observed in the AD trial (12.6% on high dose xanomeline versus 4.6% on placebo), but not in the schizophrenia trial, in which patients are generally much younger than patients in the AD trial and therefore less prone to syncope. Xanomeline treatment was also associated with transient increases in heart rate and liver function tests, both of which returned to baseline with continued treatment. Electrocardiograms showed no meaningful changes in cardiac conductivity, including QTc interval.
Our KarXT Programs
 We specifically designed KarXT, a proprietary combination of xanomeline and trospium, to unlock the therapeutic potential of xanomeline by overcoming its limiting side effects resulting from the stimulation of muscarinic receptors in peripheral tissues. We initially selected xanomeline based on the results of the two third-party, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials, as well as the results of a wide variety of preclinical studies conducted by third parties, which supported the further development of xanomeline, in the form of KarXT, as an antipsychotic and procognitive therapeutic agent. We selected trospium to counteract xanomeline’s undesirable peripheral side effects for a number of reasons, but importantly because trospium does not measurably cross the blood-brain barrier and therefore would not be expected to negate the therapeutic benefits of xanomeline in the CNS. Trospium is generically available in the United States and European Union for the treatment of overactive bladder and is well-tolerated with limited side effects, that include dry mouth and constipation. Since xanomeline and trospium compete for the same muscarinic receptors in peripheral tissues, but with opposing effects, we believe their combination has the potential to reduce the cholinergic side effects of xanomeline. We believe that there are no overlaps in the drug metabolism pathways of xanomeline and trospium and therefore we do not anticipate any significant adverse drug-drug interactions with the combination. Our Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trial data suggests that each of xanomeline and trospium do not affect the other’s pharmacokinetics or systemic exposure.






We believe that the novel mechanism of KarXT has the potential to provide meaningfully better outcomes for patients suffering from schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric conditions without the debilitating side effects of current D2 dopamine receptor-based therapies, including sedation, extrapyramidal side effects, such as motor rigidity, tremors and slurred speech, and significant weight gain resulting in the complications of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension and cardiovascular disease. We obtained an exclusive license to xanomeline from Eli Lilly along with a large database of preclinical and clinical data generated by Eli Lilly supporting xanomeline’s development. Our team of employees and advisors includes several former scientists at Eli Lilly who were actively involved in xanomeline’s preclinical and clinical development to help us advance the development of KarXT.
Proof of Concept of KarXT
 Phase 1 Clinical Trials
We observed KarXT’s ability to ameliorate the side effects of xanomeline in our randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 1 clinical trial in 70 healthy volunteers conducted under our investigational NDA. In this trial, we compared the tolerability profile and pharmacokinetics of xanomeline administered with placebo against KarXT co-administered as xanomeline in combination with trospium. Volunteers in this trial first received 40 mg (20 mg twice a day, or BID) of either trospium or placebo for two days, and then received 225 mg of xanomeline (75 mg TID) in addition to their existing regimen of trospium or placebo for seven days. We selected the 225-mg (75 mg TID) dose for evaluation in our trial due to the results of this dose in Eli Lilly’s schizophrenia and AD trials of xanomeline. As depicted in the table below, we observed that the addition of trospium to xanomeline was associated with clinically meaningful reductions in the rate of the most common treatment-emergent cholinergic adverse events, or ChAEs, than reported with xanomeline plus placebo, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and excess sweating and salivation. The overall ChAE rate was 64% on xanomeline plus placebo compared to 34% on KarXT (p=0.016). The rate of ChAEs for volunteers receiving KarXT (34%) was similar to the rate observed in volunteers receiving placebo during the lead-in period (32%), suggesting that the tolerability of KarXT was more similar to the placebo lead-in period than to treatment with xanomeline plus placebo.

ChAE Incidence Rates | Xanomeline+placeboN=33 | KarXTN=35 | % Reduction inIncidence Rates
Any Cholinergic AE (p=0.016) | 64% | 34% | 46% 
Nausea | 24% | 17% | 29% 
Vomiting | 15% | 6% | 62% 
Diarrhea | 21% | 6% | 73% 
Sweating | 49% | 20% | 59% 
Salivation | 36% | 26% | 29% 

 
We observed no clinically meaningful differences between the KarXT and xanomeline plus placebo treatment groups in heart rate, blood pressure or any electrocardiogram parameters. Only one volunteer discontinued treatment due to treatment-emergent adverse events, or TEAEs, in the KarXT arm, and this discontinuation was voluntary, not at the discretion of the investigator. Two episodes of syncope were observed on xanomeline plus placebo while none were observed with KarXT. We did not observe syncope in the KarXT arm of this trial (or in any other subject treated with KarXT in any of our trials to date). Rates of postural dizziness were reduced by approximately 57% in patients treated with KarXT as compared to patients treated with xanomeline plus placebo. Overall, we considered treatment with xanomeline 225 mg combined with trospium 40 mg administered over seven days to be well-tolerated.

Phase 1 Multiple Ascending Dose Clinical Trial
We have also completed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multiple ascending dose Phase 1 clinical trial of KarXT. This trial evaluated twice daily, or BID, dosing of our proprietary KarXT co-formulation containing fixed ratios of xanomeline and trospium, rather than the TID dosing previously used with xanomeline. We designed our Phase 1 clinical trial based on the improved tolerability of KarXT over xanomeline plus placebo observed in our prior Phase 1 clinical trial and the dose-dependent clinical activity observed in the Eli Lilly AD trial of xanomeline. In particular, Eli Lilly observed that the antipsychotic effect of xanomeline improved when the dose was increased from 25 mg to 50 mg to 75 mg, all administered TID, suggesting that the dose response may extend beyond 75 mg TID and that doses of xanomeline higher than 75 mg TID may lead to additional therapeutic benefit. Based on these observations, we set out to (i) test our co-formulation using BID dosing, (ii) explore higher doses of xanomeline and (iii) optimize the ratio of xanomeline and trospium. Healthy volunteers enrolled in this trial received 50 mg of xanomeline plus 20 mg of trospium (50/20 mg) both BID, on days one and two. From days three to seven, volunteers received BID doses of xanomeline and trospium in ratios of either 100/20 mg, 125/40 mg, 150/20 mg or 150/40 mg (xanomeline/trospium) in different dosing cohorts. The trial was designed to randomize up to 24 volunteers in each of the four cohorts, with a 3:1 randomization of KarXT to placebo.
In this trial, administration of KarXT co-formulation provided robust xanomeline and trospium exposures as measured by plasma levels. In particular, KarXT containing xanomeline 100 mg BID provided drug exposures equivalent to, or higher than, 75 mg of xanomeline TID when administered alone. KarXT was also well-tolerated in volunteers at dose levels of 100 mg and 125 mg of xanomeline BID when paired with 20 mg and 40 mg of trospium, respectively.
Eighteen volunteers received KarXT in the 100/20 mg cohort. In this group, 16 volunteers experienced either no ChAEs (n=11; 61%) or mild, transient ChAEs (n=5; 28%). The majority of ChAEs were reported for less than one hour over the seven days of treatment and the longest duration reported was a total of 15 hours over the course of treatment. Two volunteers (11%) experienced transient ChAEs that were rated as moderate, with the longest ChAE lasting a total of approximately 11 hours over the course of treatment. Given the transient and generally mild nature of the ChAEs, we considered the 100/20 mg dose level of KarXT well tolerated. Eighteen volunteers were given the 125/40 mg dose level of KarXT, of which 11 volunteers (61%) reported no ChAEs and seven volunteers (39%) reported mild, transient ChAEs. These mild ChAEs lasted less than three hours over the course of the seven-day treatment period. The increased dose of trospium (40 mg BID) was associated with reports of mild anticholinergic adverse events, including dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision and urinary hesitancy, suggesting a decreased trospium dose level may be more appropriate to pair with 125 mg BID of xanomeline. Xanomeline doses of 150 mg in KarXT led to increased reporting of moderate ChAEs and were therefore less well-tolerated than either the 100 or 125 mg xanomeline doses.
In this Phase 1 clinical trial, we observed that KarXT doses containing either 100 mg or 125 mg of xanomeline administered BID were well-tolerated when paired with trospium. Importantly, the 100 mg BID dose level administered in our co-formulation provided blood exposures equal to or greater than those observed by us and Eli Lilly with 75 mg TID xanomeline, which was observed to have beneficial effects on psychosis and cognition in both schizophrenia and AD. While a minority of patients still experienced ChAEs, these were predominately mild and transient in nature. We believe this tolerability profile has the potential to provide a substantial improvement over current antipsychotic medicines, which are often not tested at therapeutic doses in healthy volunteers due to their poor tolerability. Based on the results of this trial, we identified 100/20 mg and 125/30 mg BID as the doses and ratios of xanomeline to trospium to evaluate in our Phase 2 clinical trial of KarXT for acute psychosis in patients with schizophrenia.
We submitted an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application to the FDA for KarXT for the treatment of schizophrenia which went into effect in August 2016.

KarXT for the Treatment of Psychosis in Patients with Schizophrenia as a Monotherapy
 Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe and disabling brain disorder that is typically diagnosed in the late teenage years or early adulthood and is characterized by recurring episodes of psychosis requiring long-term treatment with antipsychotic drugs in most patients. In 2017, an estimated 2.7 million people living in the United States, or approximately 0.5% to 1.0% of the U.S. population, had schizophrenia. Worldwide, it is estimated that schizophrenia affects over 21 million people. People with schizophrenia have a 10 to 20-year reduction in life expectancy compared to the general population, struggle to maintain employment or live independently and are often unable to maintain meaningful interpersonal relationships.
Psychosis is a prominent and debilitating symptom that occurs in many neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia. Psychotic symptoms, also known as positive symptoms, include hallucinations and delusions. Patients with schizophrenia also experience negative symptoms, such as apathy, reduced social drive, loss of motivation and lack of social interest. Schizophrenia is also often associated with significant cognitive impairment, which further limits a patient’s ability to be gainfully employed and maintain relationships.
 Worldwide sales of antipsychotic drugs exceeded $12 billion in 2020 and are expected to exceed $26 billion by 2030, despite a highly generic market. Several branded market leading antipsychotic medicines have each achieved worldwide annual sales in excess of $5 billion. Despite the large number of antipsychotic drugs developed over the last 20 years, current medicines have undergone only modest innovation relative to first generation drugs developed in the 1950s.
In many patients, current antipsychotics are hampered by modest efficacy, significant side effects and safety concerns. At least half of patients fail to adequately respond to current antipsychotic drugs. Additionally, current treatments are often associated with severe side effects, including sedation, extrapyramidal side effects such as motor rigidity, tremors and slurred speech, and significant weight gain resulting in the complications of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension and cardiovascular disease. The clinical benefit of current antipsychotics is further limited by poor adherence. In a 1,493-patient clinical trial funded by the National Institutes of Health, approximately 75% of patients reported discontinuing their antipsychotic medication within 18 months of starting treatment.
Current antipsychotic treatments work primarily by inhibiting D2 dopamine receptors and are often used by physicians to address a wide range of disorders in addition to schizophrenia, including bipolar disorder and psychotic depression, as well as psychosis and agitation in elderly patients with dementia. These treatments are approved for the treatment of positive symptoms of schizophrenia, such as hallucinations and delusions, but there are no approved therapies for the treatment of negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. We believe there is a substantial need for a new antipsychotic drug that has an improved efficacy and side effect profile, and for a drug that can treat the negative and cognitive symptoms of the disease.
The regulatory requirements, including clinical trial design and primary endpoints, for approval of antipsychotic drugs for this indication are well understood and defined. Similarly, third-party clinical trial operators and contract research organizations have extensive experience conducting drug trials in schizophrenia. Finally, patients with schizophrenia in clinical trials are generally younger than patients suffering psychosis from other CNS disorders such as dementia-related psychosis, or DRP, which reduces the risk of comorbidities, and patients with schizophrenia also tend to have higher drug tolerability due to their prior treatment with antipsychotic drugs. We believe that these factors will help us to efficiently progress KarXT in this indication.


Our Completed EMERGENT-1 Phase 2 Clinical Trial for the Treatment of Acute Psychosis in Adults with Schizophrenia
 In September 2018, we initiated EMERGENT-1, a multi-site, double-blind, placebo-controlled, five-week, inpatient Phase 2 clinical trial of KarXT in adults with schizophrenia with acute psychosis. We enrolled 182 patients in this trial and patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either KarXT or placebo. Patients were washed out of any existing antipsychotic medications before entering the five-week active treatment or placebo phase. After the wash-out period, patients began with either placebo or KarXT containing 50 mg xanomeline and 20 mg trospium (50/20 mg) BID. Patients receiving KarXT then increased their dose to 100/20 mg BID on day three and then physicians had the option to escalate to 125/30 mg BID starting on day eight if the 100/20 mg BID dose was well-tolerated. The primary endpoint in this trial was the change from baseline in PANSS total scores for KarXT versus placebo treated patients at week five. Our trial had the same fundamental design and primary endpoint as the previous xanomeline trial in psychosis in schizophrenia, which is also the design that has been used in pivotal trials for several currently approved antipsychotic medicines. Additional endpoints of our trial included changes in PANSS negative Marder Factor subscale, a cognitive battery and the clinical global impression (CGI-S).
In November 2019, we announced topline results from our EMERGENT-1 trial, in which KarXT met the trial’s primary endpoint with a statistically significant (p<0.0001) and clinically meaningful 11.6 point mean reduction in PANSS total score over placebo (-17.4 KarXT vs. -5.9 placebo) at week 5 (Cohen’s d effect size of 0.75). We also observed a statistically significant 3.2 point mean reduction from baseline in the PANSS-positive subscale (-5.6 KarXT v. -2.4 placebo) and a statistically significant 2.3 point mean reduction from baseline in the PANSS-negative subscale (-3.2 KarXT v. -0.9 placebo) at week five (p<0.0001 and p<0.001, respectively). The PANSS total score, PANSS-positive subscale, and the PANSS-negative subscale had statistically significant separation at every assessment throughout the trial.
We also analyzed additional pre-specified secondary endpoints, including PANSS negative Marder factor subscale, CGI-S frequency counts and percentage of CGI-S responders, defined as a CGI-S rating of either 1 or 2 at week five. We observed a statistically significant 2.5 point mean reduction from baseline in the PANSS negative Marder factor subscale (-3.9 KarXT v. -1.3 placebo) at week five (p<0.001). The PANSS negative Marder factor subscale had statistically significant separation at every assessment point through the trial. We also observed statistically significant different CGI-S frequency counts for KarXT compared to placebo at week five (p<0.001). A 4:1 ratio of CGI-S responders (5.6% KarXT v. 1.4% placebo) was also observed, however this result was not statistically significant (p=0.151).

KarXT was observed to be well tolerated in the Phase 2 EMERGENT-1 trial. The overall discontinuation rate in the KarXT treatment arm was similar to placebo (20% on KarXT vs. 21% on placebo) and the number of discontinuations due to TEAEs was equal in the two arms (n=2 on KarXT and n=2 on placebo). No patients discontinued treatment due to cholinergic adverse events in either arm of the trial. 91% of patients treated with KarXT escalated to the high dose of KarXT as part of the flexible dose design, where the choice to escalate was made by the site physician based on the tolerability of KarXT on an individual patient basis. 97% of placebo patients were dose escalated. There was also the option to de-escalate back to 100/20 mg BID KarXT dose if any tolerability issues emerged, and only 4% of patients were de-escalated in the KarXT arm compared to 1% on placebo. The overall TEAE rate was 54% on KarXT and 43% on placebo. Occurrences of drowsiness, extrapyramidal side effects, such as tremors or slurred speech, or weight gain, which are adverse effects generally associated with current antipsychotic drugs, were similar to placebo. The most common adverse events were constipation, nausea, dry mouth, dyspepsia, and vomiting, all of which were mild or moderate in severity and transient in nature. Placebo-adjusted rates of nausea, vomiting and dry mouth all decreased over time during the trial. There was no syncope, and there was no mean change in blood pressure. One patient in the KarXT group discontinued due to elevated gamma-glutamyl transferase. There was a 5.5 beats per minute peak mean placebo adjusted resting heart rate increase in the KarXT group, with a downward trend after week 2. One serious adverse event was observed in the KarXT treatment group, in which a patient discontinued and sought hospital care for worsening psychosis, meeting the regulatory definition of serious adverse event. The clinical trial administrator was not able to rule out that the serious adverse event was drug related, and as such, the serious adverse event was classified as being “possibly-drug related.” All other TEAEs were mild or moderate.
Our Completed Phase 3 EMERGENT-2 Clinical Trial for the Treatment of Acute Psychosis in Adults with Schizophrenia
 In December 2020, we initiated EMERGENT-2, a multi-site, double-blind, five-week, inpatient Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of KarXT compared to placebo for the treatment of acute psychosis in adults with schizophrenia. We enrolled 246 patients in this trial and patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either KarXT or placebo. Patients were washed out of any existing antipsychotic medications before entering the five-week active treatment or placebo phase. After the wash-out period, patients began with either placebo or KarXT containing 50 mg xanomeline and 20 mg trospium (50/20 mg) BID. Patients receiving KarXT then increased their dose to 100/20 mg BID on day three and then physicians had the option to escalate to 125/30 mg BID starting on day eight if the 100/20 mg BID dose was well-tolerated. The primary endpoint in this trial was the change from baseline in PANSS total scores for KarXT versus placebo treated patients at week five. Our trial had the same fundamental design and primary and secondary endpoints as our Phase 2 EMERGENT-1 clinical trial.
 In August 2022, we announced positive topline results from EMERGENT-2 trial, in which KarXT met the primary endpoint, demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful 9.6-point reduction in PANSS total score compared to placebo (-21.2 KarXT vs. -11.6 placebo, p<0.0001) at Week 5 (Cohen’s d effect size of 0.61). KarXT also demonstrated an early and sustained statistically significant reduction of symptoms, as assessed by PANSS total score, starting at Week 2 and maintained such reduction through all timepoints in the trial. KarXT also met all secondary endpoints, demonstrating a statistically significant 2.9-point reduction in the PANSS positive symptoms subscale (-6.8 KarXT vs. -3.9 placebo, p<0.0001), a 1.8-point reduction in PANSS negative symptoms subscale (-3.4 KarXT vs. -1.6 placebo, p=0.0055), a 2.2-point reduction in PANSS negative Marder factor subscale (-4.2 KarXT vs. -2.0 placebo, p=0.022), and a 0.6-point reduction in CGI-S score (-1.2 KarXT vs. -0.7 placebo, p<0.0001), compared to placebo at Week 5. Additionally, a statistically significant greater proportion of patients in the KarXT arm had a ≥30% reduction in PANSS total score compared to placebo at Week 5 (p<0.0001). We plan to share results from exploratory endpoints in the future.

KarXT was generally well tolerated in this trial. Overall discontinuation rates were similar between KarXT and placebo groups (25% vs. 21%). The overall rate of TEAEs for KarXT and placebo was 75% and 58%, respectively. Discontinuation rates related to TEAEs were similar between KarXT (7%) and placebo (6%). Equal rates of serious TEAEs were observed between KarXT and placebo (2% in each group) and included suicidal ideation, worsening of schizophrenia symptoms, and appendicitis. None of the serious TEAEs were determined to be drug related. The most common TEAEs (≥5%) in the KarXT arm were all mild to moderate in severity and included constipation, dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, headache, hypertension, dizziness, gastroesophageal reflux disease (acid reflux), abdominal discomfort, and diarrhea. Mean blood pressure measures were similar between KarXT and placebo throughout the trial, and no syncopal events were observed. In the subset of patients with a TEAE of hypertension, mean blood pressure at endpoint was similar to baseline and did not lead to trial discontinuation. Similar to prior trials, an increase in heart rate was associated with KarXT treatment and decreased in magnitude by the end of the trial. Consistent with EMERGENT-1, KarXT was not associated with common problematic side effects of current treatments, including sedation (somnolence), weight gain, and extrapyramidal symptoms. In the trial, 81% of patients on KarXT compared to 90% on placebo titrated to the highest dose level.
Our Additional EMERGENT Clinical Trials and NDA Plans
Following the positive results of EMERGENT-1, we had an End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in which the FDA indicated that our completed EMERGENT-1 trial, along with one successful Phase 3 efficacy and safety trial, and additional safety data to meet regulatory requirements, would be acceptable to support an NDA submission in schizophrenia. As a result of the recently completed EMERGENT-2 trial, we plan to submit our NDA to the FDA in mid-2023. If approved, we are targeting a potential commercial launch of KarXT for the treatment of schizophrenia in the second half of 2024.
 In addition to our completed Phase 2 EMERGENT-1 and Phase 3 EMERGENT-2 trials, our EMERGENT program that is evaluating KarXT for the treatment of schizophrenia as a monotherapy includes the following Phase 3 trials:
 •EMERGENT-3: A five-week inpatient trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of KarXT compared to placebo in 256 adults with schizophrenia, conducted in the United States and Ukraine. We completed enrollment of EMERGENT-3 in the fourth quarter of 2022 and we anticipate topline data in the first quarter of 2023. 
 •EMERGENT-4: A 52-week outpatient, open-label extension trial evaluating the long-term safety and tolerability of KarXT in adults with schizophrenia who completed EMERGENT-2 or EMERGENT-3. Enrollment for this trial completed in the fourth quarter of 2022. 
 •EMERGENT-5: A 52-week outpatient, open-label trial conducted in the United States and Puerto Rico evaluating the long-term safety and tolerability of KarXT in adults with schizophrenia who were not enrolled in EMERGENT-2 or EMERGENT-3. Enrollment for this trial began in the second quarter of 2021. 
 In addition to the EMERGENT program, we began enrolling patients in November 2022 in the PENNANT trial, a three-year, open-label, outpatient Phase 3b trial evaluating the long-term safety, tolerability and efficacy of KarXT in up to 380 adults with schizophrenia in the United States. For business prioritization purposes, we subsequently discontinued patient enrollment and will not be recruiting further patients into this trial. The decision to discontinue enrollment was not due to study conduct or any result or finding from the trial, or otherwise related to KarXT.
 We also plan to initiate a Phase 1B open-label clinical trial to evaluate the effect of KarXT on 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure in adults with schizophrenia early in the second quarter of 2023.
 Our Ongoing ARISE Program for KarXT as Adjunctive Therapy in Adults with Schizophrenia
 Given the unique mechanism of action of KarXT in comparison to existing standard of care therapies, we believe there is the potential for therapeutic benefit as both a monotherapy and as an adjunctive therapy for the treatment of schizophrenia. In November 2021, we initiated our Phase 3 ARISE trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of KarXT compared to placebo as an adjunctive treatment in adults with schizophrenia who have an inadequate response to their current antipsychotic therapy. This six-week, 1:1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 outpatient trial is designed to enroll approximately 400 adults with schizophrenia who have not achieved an adequate response to their current atypical antipsychotic treatment, and is being conducted in the United States and Europe. Participants in this trial will continue their currently prescribed atypical antipsychotic therapy at the same dose or regimen schedule as prior to entry in the study, and will receive a flexible dose of KarXT or placebo based on tolerability and clinical response as determined by a clinician. The primary outcome measure of the trial is change in PANSS total score of KarXT compared to placebo at week 6. Upon completion of the trial at week 6, participants have the opportunity to enroll in ARISE-2, an ongoing 52-week outpatient, open-label extension trial evaluating the long-term safety and tolerability of KarXT when dosed with atypical antipsychotic treatment. We anticipate topline data from the ARISE trial in the first half of 2024.


Our Development Plans for KarXT for the Negative and Cognitive Symptoms of Schizophrenia
We are collecting data on the potential benefit of KarXT on negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia as part of the ongoing EMERGENT and ARISE programs, which will help inform future potential development plans specifically directed towards the negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia, for which there are currently no approved treatments.
In September 2020 we presented the results of an exploratory endpoint analysis evaluating the impact of KarXT on cognition in the Phase 2 EMERGENT-1 trial at the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology Annual Meeting. The analysis demonstrated trends towards improvements in cognition for patients receiving KarXT relative to placebo, with larger benefits seen in patients with greater cognitive impairment at baseline.

KarXT for the Treatment of Psychosis in Alzheimer's Disease
Approximately 8.4 million people in the United States are living with dementia. The prevalence of psychosis in diagnosed dementia patients varies by dementia subtypes between 10% and 75% and in total an estimated 1.2 million dementia patients exhibit psychiatric symptoms. Patients with DRP share many characteristics and often exhibit similar psychiatric symptoms irrespective of their underlying neurodegenerative disease. Based on third-party clinical trials with xanomeline and xanomeline’s mechanisms of action, we believe KarXT has therapeutic potential to treat DRP. To date, the FDA has not approved any drug to treat the psychotic or behavioral symptoms of DRP. As symptoms progress and become more severe, physicians often resort to off-label use of antipsychotic medications to treat these patients. Current antipsychotic drugs are associated with a number of side effects including potentially irreversible movement disorders, weight gain, metabolic dysfunction and sedation, which can be more problematic in elderly patients with DRP. In addition, antipsychotic drugs all have a “boxed warning” for increased mortality in the elderly and may exacerbate the cognitive impairment associated with DRP. Accordingly, there remains a large unmet medical need in psychosis and the associated behavioral symptoms of patients with DRP.


AD is the most common form of dementia and represents between 60% and 80% of dementia patients. AD is an irreversible, progressive neurodegenerative brain disorder that slowly destroys memory and cognition and, eventually, the ability to carry out even the simplest of tasks. In the large and growing AD population, up to 50% of patients will experience psychosis and related behavioral symptoms at some point during the course of their disease, which often leads to institutional care in a hospital or nursing home. We are studying KarXT in the AD psychosis population as the first indication in our DRP program.
Our Completed Phase 1b Healthy Elderly Volunteer Clinical Trial
Based on Eli Lilly’s Phase 2 clinical trial of xanomeline in patients with AD, and the improved tolerability profile of KarXT as compared to xanomeline, in December 2019, we initiated a Phase 1b dose-ranging clinical trial to assess the safety and tolerability of KarXT in healthy elderly volunteers. We utilized a flexible dosing protocol titrated over approximately two to three weeks in order to select the doses and titration protocol for future trials of KarXT in elderly patients with DRP.
 The placebo-controlled, inpatient Phase 1b dose-ranging trial consisted of three cohorts, each enrolling 16 healthy elderly volunteers, randomized 3:1 to receive KarXT or placebo. As part of the flexible dosing protocol, a volunteer’s dose was increased if they were tolerating KarXT well at the time of the potential dose increase, as determined by a clinician. In the trial, the majority of healthy elderly volunteers were titrated to xanomeline doses of 150 to 200 mg when dosed with KarXT three times per day. Pharmacokinetic data demonstrated that healthy elderly volunteers achieved mean xanomeline blood levels comparable to the mean xanomeline blood levels reported in the Phase 2 EMERGENT-1 trial evaluating KarXT in adults with schizophrenia. Previous trials of KarXT have demonstrated that the current formulation of KarXT results in xanomeline exposures, or blood levels, that are approximately 10% greater than blood levels seen in earlier trials of xanomeline alone.
 The treatment-related adverse events, or AEs, were similar to those observed in prior trials of KarXT, and a majority (>80%) were rated mild in severity. One serious AE of urinary retention was reported in Cohort 1. We believe the report of urinary retention was related to a higher dose of trospium used in Cohort 1 compared to doses used in Cohorts 2 and 3, where urinary retention was not observed. No serious or severe AEs were observed in Cohorts 2 and 3. Consistent with prior trials of KarXT, blood pressure in healthy elderly volunteers receiving KarXT was similar to placebo, and no syncopal events were observed. Heart rate increases observed in the trial were also consistent with prior trials of KarXT.
 Data from the Phase 1b trial suggest that a lower dose ratio of trospium to xanomeline, compared to the ratios used in Phase 1 trials in healthy adult volunteers and in the Phase 2 EMERGENT-1 and Phase 3 EMERGENT-2 trials evaluating KarXT in adults with schizophrenia, was better tolerated by healthy elderly volunteers.
 Our Ongoing ADEPT program for the Treatment of Psychosis Related to Alzheimer’s Disease
 The ADEPT program, which is the clinical program evaluating KarXT as a potential treatment for psychosis related to AD, consists of the following ongoing and planned Phase 3 trials:
•ADEPT-1: A trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of KarXT compared to placebo in up to 400 adults with moderate to severe psychosis related to AD. This trial consists of a 12-week, single-blind treatment period, followed by a 26-week, double-blind, randomized withdrawal period in which subjects who meet the response criteria will be randomized to receive KarXT or placebo. The single-blind treatment period is designed to enroll approximately 400 adults with AD, between 55 and 90 years old, with moderate to severe hallucinations or delusions, who are living at home or at an assisted living facility. The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate relapse prevention as measured by time from randomization to relapse during the 26-week, double-blind period. This trial is being conducted in the United States and Europe. Enrollment for this trial began in the third quarter of 2022 and topline data is anticipated in 2025.


•ADEPT-2: A 12-week, flexible-dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of KarXT versus placebo. ADEPT-2 is expected to initiate in the second half of 2023, with topline data anticipated in 2025.
 •ADEPT-3: A 52-week open-label extension trial evaluating the long-term safety and tolerability of KarXT in adults with psychosis related to AD who completed ADEPT-1 or ADEPT-2. Enrollment for this trial is anticipated to commence in 2023.
 Planned Additional Formulations of KarXT
We believe that additional formulations of KarXT have the potential to further improve the therapeutic window of KarXT and offer patient compliance advantages through decreased dosing frequency. Our ongoing research efforts include the development of advanced oral and long-acting injectable formulations. In November 2021, we initiated a Phase 1 study of an advanced oral formulation of KarXT, and continue to evaluate the optimal xanomeline to trospium dose ratios, as well as dosing regimens, for advanced oral formulations.
Other Research and Development Programs
We continue to build our early stage pipeline. We currently have a novel series of compounds focused on muscarinic receptor targets. In particular, we have synthesized lead compounds for further development as potential therapeutic agents in several CNS disorders, including schizophrenia and psychosis in AD. We have completed in vitro screening for several compounds and advanced these lead compounds for further preclinical development. In vivo evaluation of these compounds in rodents is ongoing for these indications, and we expect to initiate IND-enabling studies in 2023. We believe we can optimize these compounds and advance their development through preclinical studies and into clinical development, given our expertise in this space.
In February 2020, we announced a drug discovery partnership with Charles River Laboratories to accommodate continued growth in our muscarinic receptor drug discovery efforts. We continue to evaluate other opportunities focused on muscarinic and non-muscarinic targets for CNS disorders.
In January 2023, we entered into an exclusive global license agreement for Goldfinch Bio's TRPC4/5 product candidates, including the lead clinical-stage TRPC4/5 candidate, KAR-2618. KAR-2618 has been dosed in over 100 humans across Goldfinch Bio's clinical trials with a well-tolerated safety profile to date. KAR-2618 has shown promising benefits in preclinical models of mood and anxiety disorders with observed anxiolytic and antidepressant properties. We believe that the TRPC4/5 mechanism could represent a novel approach to treating mood and anxiety disorders and complements our existing pipeline of differentiated potential medicines. We intend to provide details on the planned development of KAR-2618 for the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders in the second half of 2023.
Manufacturing and Supply
We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently source all of our nonclinical, clinical, and potential commercial launch compound supply through third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs. We have established a robust supply chain to enable sufficient supply of the raw materials needed to conduct our ongoing and planned clinical trials, including our EMERGENT, ARISE, ADEPT programs, as well as support our NDA application and potential commercial launch. We continue to expand our manufacturing network to ensure redundant supply of critical input materials.

For clinical supply, we use CMOs who act in accordance with the FDA’s good laboratory practices, or GLP, and current good manufacturing practices, cGMP, for the manufacture of drug substance and product. Currently, we contract with Neuland Laboratories Limited and Esteve Quimica, S.A., for the manufacture of xanomeline and source trospium from Procos, S.p.A. and Midas Pharmaceuticals, Inc. We expect to rely on third parties for our manufacturing processes and the production of all clinical supply drug substance and drug product. We use additional contract manufacturers to fill, label, package, store and distribute investigational drug products. It is our intent to identify and qualify additional manufacturers to provide active pharmaceutical ingredient and fill-and-finish services prior to submission of a new drug application to the FDA for any product candidates that complete clinical development.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We face potential competition from many different sources, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies as well as public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize, including KarXT, may compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
Our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources, established presence in the market, expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical and clinical testing, obtaining regulatory approvals and reimbursement and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, sales, marketing and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
The key competitive factors affecting the success of KarXT, and any other product candidates that we develop to address CNS disorders, if approved, are likely to be efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
Psychosis in Patients with Schizophrenia
The current standards of care for the psychotic symptoms of patients with schizophrenia are antipsychotic treatments that work primarily by inhibiting D2 dopamine and 5HT2-A serotonin receptors as their primary mechanism of action. These drugs include: Abilify and Abilify Maintena, marketed by Otsuka Holdings, Rexulti marketed by Lundbeck, Risperdal Consta, Invega, Invega Trinza and Invega Sustenna, marketed by Johnson & Johnson, Zyprexa, marketed by Eli Lilly, Vraylar, marketed by Abbvie, Clozaril, marketed by HLS Therapeutics, Latuda, marketed by Sumitomo Pharma, Caplyta, marketed by Intra-Cellular Therapies, and Lybalvi, marketed by Alkermes. Many of these drugs are prescribed for a variety of neuropsychiatric conditions, including bipolar disorder, depression and Tourette syndrome. Additionally, we are aware of several product candidates in clinical development that are intended to provide an antipsychotic benefit, including product candidates being developed by Acadia Pharmaceuticals, or Acadia, Sunovion Pharmaceuticals, Roche, Neurocrine Biosciences, SyneuRx, Newron Pharmaceuticals, MapLight Therapeutics, Reviva Pharmaceuticals, Boehringer Ingelheim, Teva Pharmaceuticals, Anavax Life Sciences, Intra-Cellular Therapies, Otsuka Holdings, Alkermes and Cerevel Therapeutics.
There are currently no FDA-approved drugs for the negative or cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. However, we are aware of companies with product candidates in clinical development for the treatment of the negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia, including Boehringer Ingelheim and Neurocrine Biosciences for cognitive symptoms, and Acadia, Otsuka Holdings, Minerva Neurosciences and Roche for negative symptoms.

Psychosis in Patients with Alzheimer’s Disease
There are currently no approved treatments for psychosis related to AD. Patients with AD are commonly treated with antipsychotic medications that are indicated and approved for schizophrenia. In 2020, Acadia submitted an sNDA application for marketing authorization of its drug (currently approved for a different indication) for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with DRP, and the FDA issued a complete response letter in April 2021. Acadia resubmitted this sNDA, for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with dementia focused on AD psychosis, in the first quarter of 2022 and the FDA issued a complete response letter in August 2022. In June 2022, Otsuka Holdings and Lundbeck announced positive Phase 3 results of brexpiprazole (Rexulti) in the treatment of agitation in patients with Alzheimer's dementia, and in January 2023, the FDA accepted the submitted sNDA application. Additionally, we are aware of several product candidates in clinical development that are intended to provide an antipsychotic benefit to patients with AD-related psychosis, including product candidates being developed by Sunovion Pharmaceuticals, BioXcel Therapeutics, Intra-Cellular Therapies, Otsuka Holdings and Lundbeck, Acadia, Axsome Therapeutics, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Suven Life Sciences, Merck and Cerevel Therapeutics. Available treatments for AD patients are only indicated for enhancing cognition in AD patients, and include acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine and memantine. These medications are available generically although specific dosage forms and combinations are proprietary and marketed by large pharmaceutical companies, such as Allergan, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Novartis and Pfizer.
 Intellectual Property
We strive to protect the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business, including pursuing and maintaining patent protection intended to cover our product candidate and their methods of use, as well as other inventions that are important to our business. In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that we do not consider appropriate for patent protection.
Our commercial success depends in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technologies, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our intellectual property rights, particularly our patent rights, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing valid and enforceable intellectual property rights of others.
The patent positions for biotechnology companies like us are generally uncertain and can involve complex legal, scientific and factual issues. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before a patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted and even challenged after issuance. As a result, we cannot guarantee that any of our platform technologies and product candidates will be protectable or remain protected by enforceable patents. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties.
Product Candidates

The royalty rate is subject to reduction on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis under certain circumstances. In the event that we sublicense to a third party any of the rights to the licensed intellectual property granted under the GFB License Agreement, we will be obligated to pay GFB royalties within the range of 25% to 35% on any consideration we receive from the sublicensee, excluding royalties and certain other payments.
Unless earlier terminated, the GFB Agreement will expire on the expiration of the last to expire royalty term. Unless the GFB Agreement is earlier terminated, on expiration of each applicable royalty term, we will have a fully paid-up, irrevocable and perpetual license to develop, manufacture and commercialize each applicable licensed product in the applicable country. Either party may terminate the GFB Agreement for the other party’s material breach, following a customary notice and cure period, or insolvency. We may terminate the GFB Agreement for any reason upon 90 days written notice to GFB.
 Government Regulation
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.

Review and Approval of Drugs in the United States
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice or other governmental entities. In addition, an applicant may need to recall a product.
An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug product in the United States must typically undertake the following:
•completion of nonclinical, or preclinical, laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations; 
 •submission to the FDA of an IND which must take effect before human clinical trials may begin; 
 •approval by an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated at that site; 
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCPs, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication; 
 •preparation and submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA, and payment of user fees; 
 •review of the product by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable; 
 •satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
 •satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data; 
 •FDA review and approval of the NDA; and 
 •compliance with any post-approval requirements, including Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, and post-approval studies required by the FDA. 
 Preclinical Studies
Before an applicant begins testing a compound in humans, the drug candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the purity and stability of the manufactured drug substance or active pharmaceutical ingredient and the formulated drug or drug product, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the safety and activity of the drug for initial testing in humans and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.

The IND and IRB Processes
An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved drug to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer such investigational drug to humans. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration of the investigational drug. In an IND, applicants must submit a protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments. In addition, the results of the preclinical tests, manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. The FDA requires a 30-day waiting period after the filing of each IND before clinical trials may begin. At any time during this 30-day period, the FDA may raise concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND and impose a clinical hold. In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin.
Following commencement of a clinical trial under an IND, the FDA may also place a clinical hold or partial clinical hold on that trial. A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND. No more than 30 days after imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, the FDA will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the basis for the hold. Following issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, an investigation may only resume after the FDA has notified the sponsor that the investigation may proceed. The FDA will base that determination on information provided by the sponsor correcting the deficiencies previously cited or otherwise satisfying the FDA that the investigation can proceed.
A sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived. When the foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study is conducted in accordance with GCP, including review and approval by an independent ethics committee, or IEC, and obtaining informed consent from subjects. The GCP requirements are intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical studies, as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data. FDA must also be able to validate the data from the study through an on-site inspection if necessary.
In addition to the foregoing IND requirements, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review of the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. An IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access that only the group maintains to available data from the study. Suspension or termination of development during any phase of clinical trials can occur if it is determined that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Other reasons for suspension or termination may be made by us based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate.
Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website.

Human Clinical Trials in Support of an NDA
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects, or their legal representative, provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
•Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or, in certain indications such as cancer, patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness and to determine optimal dosage. 
 •Phase 2. The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. 
 •Phase 3. The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. 
 
Post-approval, or Phase 4, studies may be conducted after initial regulatory approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA. In addition, within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug; and any clinically important increase in the case of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies often complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, the applicant must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

Combination Rule
The FDA’s Combination Rule governing fixed combination drug products provides that two or more drugs may be combined in a single dosage form when each component contributes to the claimed effects and the dosage of each component (amount, frequency, duration) is such that the combination is safe and effective for a significant patient population requiring such concurrent therapy as defined in the labeling for the drug. This rule is meant to ensure that any fixed-dose combination drug provides an advantage to the patient over and above that obtained when one of the individual ingredients is used in the usual safe and effective dose.
Review of an NDA by the FDA
Assuming successful completion of required clinical testing and other requirements, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a significant application user fee as well as annual prescription drug product program fees. These fees are typically increased annually. Certain exceptions and waivers are available for some of these fees.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of an NDA within 60 days of its receipt, before accepting the NDA for filing, to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of NDAs. Applications for drugs containing new molecular entities are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date of filing, and applications for “priority review” products containing new molecular entities are meant to be reviewed within six months of filing. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission.
During its review of an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured. These pre-approval inspections may cover all facilities associated with an NDA, including drug component manufacturing (such as active pharmaceutical ingredients), finished drug product manufacturing, and control testing laboratories. The FDA will not approve an NDA unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications.
In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a REMS. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the product is a new molecular entity. REMS can include medication guides, physician communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU may include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The FDA may require a REMS before approval or post-approval if it becomes aware of a serious risk associated with use of the product.
The FDA is required to refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.

Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, and Priority Review
The FDA has a number of programs intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. Three of these programs are referred to as fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, and priority review designation.
Specifically, the FDA may designate a product for Fast Track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For Fast Track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track product’s application before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a Fast Track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a Fast Track application does not begin until the last section of the application is submitted. In addition, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
Second, a product may be designated as a Breakthrough Therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to Breakthrough Therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner.
Third, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a product that treats a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case-by-case basis, whether the proposed product represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months.
Accelerated Approval Pathway
The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Products granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval.

For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign, or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a product, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a product.
The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a product, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly.
The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. As a result, a product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Under the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022, or FDORA, the FDA is permitted to require, as appropriate, that a post-approval confirmatory study or studies be underway prior to approval or within a specified time period after the date of approval for a product granted accelerated approval. Sponsors are also required to send updates to the FDA every 180 days on the status of such studies, including progress toward enrollment targets, and the FDA must promptly post this information publicly. Under FDORA, the FDA is empowered to take action, such as issuing fines, against companies that fail to conduct with due diligence any post-approval confirmatory study or submit timely reports to the agency on their progress. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, could result in the FDA’s withdrawal of the approval and require the withdrawal of the product from the market on an expedited basis. In addition, the FDA generally requires, unless otherwise informed by the agency, pre-approval of promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated approval, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
The FDA’s Decision on an NDA
On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities and select clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may resubmit the NDA to address all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, withdraw the application, or request a hearing. If the applicant resubmits the NDA, the FDA will only issue an approval letter when the deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
If the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess the drug’s safety or effectiveness after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs.

Post-Approval Requirements
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, tracking and tracing requirements, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, many changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are annual prescription drug product program fee requirements for certain marketed products.
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the NDA holder and any third-party manufacturers that the NDA holder may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or voluntary product recalls; 
 •fines, warning or untitled letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; 
 •refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals; 
 •product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or 
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 
 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.

Hatch-Waxman Amendments
Section 505 of the FDCA describes three types of marketing applications that may be submitted to the FDA to request marketing authorization for a new drug. A Section 505(b)(1) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy. A 505(b)(2) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. This regulatory pathway enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s prior findings of safety and efficacy for an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application. Section 505(j) establishes an abbreviated approval process for a generic version of approved drug products through the submission of an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a generic drug product that has the same active ingredients, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, performance characteristics and intended use, among other things, to a previously approved product, known as a reference listed drug, or RLD. ANDAs are termed “abbreviated” because they are generally not required to include preclinical (animal) and clinical (human) data to establish safety and efficacy. Instead, generic applicants must scientifically demonstrate that their product is bioequivalent to, or performs in the same manner as, the innovator drug through in vitro, in vivo, or other testing. The generic version must deliver the same amount of active ingredients into a subject’s bloodstream in the same amount of time as the innovator drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the reference listed drug.
Non-Patent Exclusivity
Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve (or in some cases accept) an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity, or NCE. For the purposes of this provision, an NCE is a drug that contains no active moiety that has previously been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An active moiety is the molecule or ion responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance. In cases where such NCE exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, which states the proposed generic drug will not infringe one or more of the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval.
The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity for non-NCE drugs if the NDA or a supplement to the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application or supplement. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication, but it generally would not protect the original, unmodified product from generic competition. Unlike five-year NCE exclusivity, an award of three-year exclusivity does not block the FDA from accepting ANDAs seeking approval for generic versions of the drug as of the date of approval of the original drug product; it only prevents FDA from approving such ANDAs.

Hatch-Waxman Patent Certification and the 30-Month Stay
In seeking approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or an approved method of using the product. Upon approval, each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Upon submission of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA, an applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the RLD in the Orange Book that:
•no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; 
 •such patent has expired; 
 •the date on which such patent expires; or 
 •such patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use, or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. 
 Generally, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA cannot be approved until all listed patents have expired, except where the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant challenges a listed patent through the last type of certification, also known as a paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA application will not be approved until all of the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a paragraph IV certification the applicant must send notice of the paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the paragraph IV certification. If the paragraph IV certification is challenged by an NDA holder or the patent owner(s) asserts a patent challenge to the paragraph IV certification, the FDA may not approve that application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the notice of the paragraph IV certification, the expiration of the patent, when the infringement case concerning each such patent was favorably decided in the applicant’s favor or settled, or such shorter or longer period as may be ordered by a court. This prohibition is generally referred to as the 30-month stay. In instances where an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant files a paragraph IV certification, the NDA holder or patent owner(s) regularly take action to trigger the 30-month stay, recognizing that the related patent litigation may take many months or years to resolve. Thus, approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA could be delayed for a significant period of time depending on the patent certification the applicant makes and the reference drug sponsor’s decision to initiate patent litigation. If the drug has NCE exclusivity and the ANDA is submitted four years after approval, the 30-month stay is extended so that it expires seven and a half years after approval of the innovator drug, unless the patent expires or there is a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant before then.
Patent Term Restoration and Extension
A patent claiming a new drug product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, which permits a patent term restoration of up to five and a half years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted is typically one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the ultimate approval date, provided the sponsor acted with diligence. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question and within 60 days of drug approval. A patent that covers multiple drugs for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA.

Review and Approval of Medicinal Products in the European Union
In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, an applicant will need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. Specifically, the process governing approval of medicinal products in the European Union generally follows the same lines as in the United States. It entails satisfactory completion of preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each proposed indication. It also requires the submission to the relevant competent authorities of a marketing authorization application, or MAA, and granting of a marketing authorization by these authorities before the product can be marketed and sold in the European Union.
Clinical Trial Approval
In April 2014, the European Union adopted the new Clinical Trials Regulation, (EU) No 536/2014 (Clinical Trials Regulation), which replaced the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC on 31 January 2022. The Clinical Trials Regulation is directly applicable in all the EU Member States, meaning national implementing legislation in each EU Member State is not required. The transitory provisions of the new Clinical Trials Regulation provide that, by January 31, 2025, all ongoing clinical trials must have transitioned to the new Clinical Trials Regulation.
 The new Clinical Trials Regulation aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. The main characteristics of the regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point through the Clinical Trials Information System, or CTIS; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts (Part I contains scientific and medicinal product documentation and Part II contains the national and patient-level documentation). Part I is assessed by the competent authorities of all EU Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Member States concerned) of a draft report prepared by a Reference Member State. Part II is assessed separately by each Member State concerned. Strict deadlines have been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications. The role of the relevant ethics committees in the assessment procedure will continue to be governed by the national law of the concerned EU Member State. However, overall related timelines will be defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation.
 The United Kingdom has implemented Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC into national law through the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations. Whether the United Kingdom will amend its legislation to align more closely with the new EU Regulation once that comes into effect is as yet unknown, however the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, the UK medicines regulator, has opened a consultation on a set of proposals designed to improve and strengthen the UK clinical trials legislation. Such consultation ran from January 17, 2022 to March 14, 2022, and the MHRA is currently analyzing feedback.
Marketing Authorization
To obtain a marketing authorization for a product in the European Union, an applicant must submit an MAA either under a centralized procedure administered by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, or one of the procedures administered by competent authorities in the EU Member States (decentralized procedure or mutual recognition procedure). A marketing authorization may be granted only to an applicant established in the European Union. Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 provides that prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the European Union, applicants have to demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA-approved Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted (1) a product-specific waiver, (2) a class waiver or (3) a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP.

The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid for all EU Member States, and in the additional Member States of the European Economic Area (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy medicinal products (gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines), and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, including products for the treatment of HIV or AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation and whose authorization would be in the interest of public health at EU level, the centralized procedure is optional.
Under the centralized procedure, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP, established at the EMA is responsible for conducting the initial assessment of a product. The CHMP is also responsible for several post-authorization and maintenance activities, such as the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing marketing authorization. Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Clock stops may extend the timeframe of evaluation of an MAA considerably beyond 210 days. Where the CHMP gives a positive opinion, it provides the opinion together with supporting documentation to the European Commission, who makes the final decision to grant a marketing authorization, which is issued within 67 days of receipt of the EMA’s recommendation. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. If the CHMP accepts such request, the time limit of 210 days will be reduced to 150 days, excluding clock stops, but it is possible that the CHMP can revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it considers that it is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment.
Unlike the centralized procedure, the decentralized procedure requires a separate application to, and leads to separate approval by, the competent authorities of each EU Member State in which the product is to be marketed. This application is identical to the application that would be submitted to the EMA for authorization through the centralized procedure. The reference EU Member State prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. The resulting assessment report is submitted to the concerned EU Member States who, within 90 days of receipt, must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a concerned EU Member State cannot approve the assessment report and related materials due to concerns relating to a potential serious risk to public health, disputed elements may be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all EU Member States.
The mutual recognition procedure similarly is based on the acceptance by the competent authorities of the EU Member States of the marketing authorization of a medicinal product by the competent authorities of other EU Member States. The holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the competent authority of an EU Member State requesting that this authority recognize the marketing authorization delivered by the competent authority of another EU Member State.
Under the above described procedures, before granting the marketing authorizations, the EMA or the competent authorities of the EU Member States of the make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety, and efficacy.


Now that the United Kingdom has left the European Union, Great Britain is no longer covered by centralized marketing authorizations (under the Northern Ireland Protocol, centralized EU authorizations continue to be recognized in Northern Ireland). All medicinal products with a current centralized authorization were automatically converted to Great Britain’s marketing authorizations on January 1, 2021. For a period of three years from January 1, 2021, the MHRA may rely on a decision taken by the European Commission on the approval of a new marketing authorization in the centralized procedure, in order to more quickly grant a new Great Britain marketing authorization. A separate application will, however, still be required. On January 24, 2023, the MHRA announced that a new international recognition framework will be put in place from January 1, 2024, which will have regard to decisions on the approval of marketing authorizations made by the EMA and certain other regulators. The MHRA also has the power to have regard to marketing authorizations approved in EU Member States through the decentralized or mutual recognition procedures a view to more quickly granting a marketing authorization in the United Kingdom or Great Britain.
Data and Market Exclusivity in the European Union
In the European Union, innovative medicinal products approved on the basis of a complete and independent data package qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity pursuant to Directive 2001/83/EC. Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 repeats this entitlement for medicinal products authorized in accordance with the centralized authorization procedure. Data exclusivity prevents applicants for authorization of generics of these innovative products from referencing the innovator’s pre-clinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic marketing authorization in the European Union, during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the European Union. During an additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization application can be submitted and authorized, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic medicinal product can be placed on the EU market until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. There is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EMA to be an innovative medicinal product, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity. Even if a product is considered to be an innovative medicinal product so that the innovator gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the product if such company obtained marketing authorization based on an MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials.
Periods of Authorization and Renewals
A marketing authorization has an initial validity for five years in principle. The marketing authorization may be renewed after five years on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the EU Member State for a nationally authorized product. Once subsequently definitively renewed, the marketing authorization shall be valid for an unlimited period, unless the European Commission or the national competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal period. Any authorization which is not followed by the actual placing of the medicinal product on the EU market (in the case of the centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing EU Member State (for a nationally authorized product) within three years after authorization ceases to be valid (the so-called sunset clause).
Regulatory Requirements after a Marketing Authorization has been Obtained
If an authorization for a medicinal product in the European Union is obtained, the holder of the marketing authorization is required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products. These include:
•Compliance with the European Union’s stringent pharmacovigilance or safety reporting rules must be ensured. These rules can impose post-authorization studies and additional monitoring obligations. 


•The manufacturing of authorized medicinal products, for which a separate manufacturer’s license is mandatory, must also be conducted in strict compliance with the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidance, including Directive 2001/83/EC, Directive 2003/94/EC, Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and the European Commission Guidelines for Good Manufacturing Practice. These requirements include compliance with EU cGMP standards when manufacturing medicinal products and active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients outside of the European Union with the intention to import the active pharmaceutical ingredients into the European Union. 
 •The marketing and promotion of authorized drugs, including industry-sponsored continuing medical education and advertising directed toward the prescribers of drugs and/or the general public, are strictly regulated in the European Union. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is prohibited across the European Union. 
 The aforementioned European Union rules are generally applicable in the European Economic Area, or EEA, which consists of the EU Member States, plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.
 European General Data Protection Regulation
 In the event we decide to conduct clinical trials in the European Union, we may be subject to additional privacy restrictions. The collection and use of personal data including health information in the European Union is governed by the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, as well as national data protection laws. The GDPR imposes a broad range of strict requirements on companies subject to the GDPR, such as including requirements relating to having legal bases for processing personal data relating to identifiable individuals and transferring such information outside the EEA, including to the United States (see below), providing details to those individuals regarding the processing of their personal data, implementing safeguards to keep personal data secure, having data processing agreements with third parties who process personal data, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, responding to individuals’ requests to exercise their rights in respect of their personal data, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, reporting security and privacy breaches involving personal data to the competent national data protection authority and affected individuals, appointing data protection officers, conducting data protection impact assessments, and record-keeping. The GDPR allows for penalties to which we could be subject in the event of any non-compliance, including fines of up to €20,000,000 or 4% of total annual global revenue, whichever is greater. The GDPR imposes additional responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules. This may be onerous and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
In addition, the United Kingdom incorporated the GDPR (as it existed on December 31, 2020 but subject to certain UK specific amendments) into UK law, or UK GDPR, following its exit from the EU in 2020. The UK GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 set out the UK’s data protection regime, which is independent from but aligned to the EU’s data protection regime. The UK Government has announced plans to reform the data protection legal framework in its Data Reform Bill but those have been put on hold. Non-compliance with the UK GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to £17.5 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher. Although the United Kingdom is regarded as a third country under the EU’s GDPR, the European Commission has now issued a decision recognizing the UK as providing adequate protection under the EU GDPR and, therefore, transfers of personal data originating in the European Union to the United Kingdom remain unrestricted. Like the EU GDPR, the UK GDPR restricts personal data transfers outside the UK to countries not regarded by the United Kingdom as providing adequate protection. The UK government has confirmed that personal data transfers from the United Kingdom to the EEA remain free flowing.


Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
The United Kingdom formally left the European Union on January 31, 2020, and the European Union and the United Kingdom have concluded a trade and cooperation agreement, or the TCA, which was provisionally applicable since January 1, 2021 and has been formally applicable since May 1, 2021. The TCA includes specific provisions concerning pharmaceuticals, which include the mutual recognition of GMP, inspections of manufacturing facilities for medicinal products and GMP documents issued, but does not foresee wholesale mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical regulations. At present, Great Britain has implemented EU legislation on the marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products through the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (as amended) (under the Northern Ireland Protocol, the EU regulatory framework continues to apply in Northern Ireland). The regulatory regime in Great Britain therefore aligns in many ways with current EU regulations, however it is possible that these regimes will diverge significantly in the future now that Great Britain’s regulatory system is independent from the European Union and the TCA does not provide for mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical legislation.
 Healthcare and Privacy Laws and Regulation
 Healthcare providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted regulatory approval. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims laws, reporting of payments to physicians and teaching hospitals and patient privacy laws and regulations and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain our business and/or financial arrangements. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare and privacy laws and regulations, include the following:
•Anti-Kickback Statute—The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation or arranging of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand, and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers, among others, on the other. A person or entity can be found guilty of violating the federal Anti-Kickback Statute without actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the government may assert that a claim, including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act or federal civil money penalties statute. Effective January 19, 2021, the Office of Inspector General, or OIG, added safe harbor protections under the Anti-Kickback Statute for certain coordinated care and value-based arrangements among clinicians, providers, and others;
 •Federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including False Claims Laws—The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, and federal civil monetary penalties laws which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false, fictitious or fraudulent; knowingly making or causing a false statement or record material to a false or fraudulent claim or obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government; or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay money to the federal government A claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim under the federal civil False Claims Act. Manufacturers can be held liable under the False Claims Act even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. The False Claims Act also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring qui tam actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the False Claims Act and to share in any monetary recovery;


•HIPAA—The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity can be found guilty of violating HIPAA without actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, impose requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their respective business associates that perform services for them that involve the use, or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions;
 •Transparency Requirements—The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA, and its implementing regulations, require manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, to report annually to the HHS under the Open Payments Program, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians, certain other healthcare professionals, and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians, certain other healthcare professional and their immediate family members. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations were extended to include transfers of value made to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners; 
 •Price Reporting Laws— Federal government price reporting laws, which require us to calculate and report complex pricing metrics in an accurate and timely manner to government programs;
 •Analogous State and Foreign Laws—Analogous state and foreign fraud and abuse laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may be broader in scope and apply regardless of payor. These laws are enforced by various state agencies and through private actions. Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant federal government compliance guidance, require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers, and restrict marketing practices or require disclosure of marketing expenditures or drug pricing. Some state and local laws require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances. These data privacy and security laws may differ from each other in significant ways and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA, which may complicate compliance efforts;


•California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA)  – The CPRA established a privacy framework for covered businesses by creating an expanded definition of personal information, establishing new data privacy rights for consumers in the State of California, imposing special rules on the collection of consumer data from minors, and creating a new and potentially severe statutory damages framework for violations of the CCPA and for businesses that fail to implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. While clinical trial data and information governed by HIPAA are exempt from the CPRA, other personal information may be applicable. In addition to the CPRA, new privacy and data security laws have been proposed in more than half of the states in the United States and in the U.S. Congress, reflecting a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States. The effects of the CPRA, and other similar state or federal laws, are potentially significant and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and potential liability in an effort to comply with such legislation; and 
 •Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other healthcare providers, marketing expenditures, and drug pricing information. Certain state and local laws require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. State and foreign laws, including for example GDPR, also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 Pharmaceutical Insurance Coverage and Healthcare Reform
In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Thus, even if a product candidate is approved, sales of the product will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, the product. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication.
In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Additionally, companies may also need to provide discounts to purchasers, private health plans or government healthcare programs. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician utilization once the product is approved and have a material adverse effect on sales, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor.

The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of products have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party payor reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
There have been a number of federal and state proposals in recent years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for drugs and other medical products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system in the United States. For example, in March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the Affordable Care Act, or the ACA, which, among other things, includes contains to the coverage and payment for products under government health care programs. The ACA includes provisions of importance to our potential product candidates, including among other things, that:
•created an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic products, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs; 
 •expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability; 
 •expanded manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum rebate for both branded and generic drugs and revising the definition of “average manufacturer price,” or AMP, for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices; 
 •addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; 
 •expanded the types of entities eligible for the 340B drug discount program; 
 •established the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program by requiring manufacturers to provide a 50% point-of-sale-discount, which was increased to 70% by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (as of January 1, 2019), off the negotiated price of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and 
 •created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. 


Since its enactment, there have been numerous judicial, administrative, executive, and legislative efforts to expand, repeal, replace or modify the ACA, some of which have been successful, in part, in modifying the law, as well as court challenges to the constitutionality of the law. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is unclear how other healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration or other efforts, if any, to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA will impact our business.
In addition, other legislative and regulatory changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted:
 •On August 2, 2011, the U.S. Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year. These reductions went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the temporary suspension, a 1% payment reduction began April 1, 2022, lasting through June 30, 2022. The 2% payment reduction resumed on July 1, 2022.
 •On January 2, 2013, the U.S. American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers.
 •On April 13, 2017, CMS published a final rule that gives states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces.
 •On May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.
 •On May 23, 2019, CMS published a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020.
 •On December 20, 2019, former President Trump signed into law the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1865), which repealed the Cadillac tax, the health insurance provider tax, and the medical device excise tax. It is impossible to determine whether similar taxes could be instated in the future.


Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to drug pricing practices. Specifically, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, and review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs. At a federal level, President Biden signed an Executive Order on July 9, 2021 affirming the administration’s policy to (i) support legislative reforms that would lower the prices of prescription drug and biologics, including by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, by imposing inflation caps, and, by supporting the development and market entry of lower-cost generic drugs and biosimilars; and (ii) support the enactment of a public health insurance option. Among other things, the Executive Order also directs HHS to provide a report on actions to combat excessive pricing of prescription drugs, enhance the domestic drug supply chain, reduce the price that the Federal government pays for drugs, and address price gouging in the industry; and directs the FDA to work with states and Indian Tribes that propose to develop section 804 Importation Programs in accordance with the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, and the FDA’s implementing regulations. FDA released such implementing regulations on September 24, 2020, which went into effect on November 30, 2020, providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. On September 25, 2020, CMS stated drugs imported by states under this rule will not be eligible for federal rebates under Section 1927 of the Social Security Act and manufacturers would not report these drugs for “best price” or Average Manufacturer Price purposes. Since these drugs are not considered covered outpatient drugs, CMS further stated it will not publish a National Average Drug Acquisition Cost for these drugs. If implemented, importation of drugs from Canada may materially and adversely affect the price we receive for any of our product candidates. Further, on November 20, 2020 CMS issued an Interim Final Rule implementing the Most Favored Nation, or MFN, Model under which Medicare Part B reimbursement rates would have been calculated for certain drugs and biologicals based on the lowest price drug manufacturers receive in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries with a similar gross domestic product per capita. However, on December 29, 2021 CMS rescinded the Most Favored Nations rule.
Additionally, on November 30, 2020, HHS published a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. Pursuant to court order, the removal and addition of the aforementioned safe harbors were delayed and recent legislation imposed a moratorium on implementation of the rule until January 1, 2026. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or the IRA, furtherdelayed implementation of this rule to January 1, 2032. Although a number of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, and the Biden administration may reverse or otherwise change these measures, both the Biden administration and Congress have indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative measures to control drug costs.
In August 2022, the IRA was signed into law. The IRA includes several provisions that will impact our business to varying degrees, including provisions that create a $2,000 out-of-pocket cap for Medicare Part D beneficiaries, impose new manufacturer financial liability on all drugs in Medicare Part D, allow the U.S. government to negotiate Medicare Part B and Part D pricing for certain high-cost drugs and biologics without generic or biosimilar competition, require companies to pay rebates to Medicare for drug prices that increase faster than inflation, and delay the rebate rule that would require pass through of pharmacy benefit manager rebates to beneficiaries. The effect of IRA on our business and the healthcare industry in general is not yet known.


Outside the United States, ensuring coverage and adequate payment for a product also involves challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with government authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory approval for a product and may require a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of a product to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in commercialization.
In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies or so-called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for its Member States to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. EU Member States may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other Member States allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the European Union have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the European Union. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various EU Member States, and parallel trade, i.e., arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced Member States, can further reduce prices. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any products, if approved in those countries.
