Item 1. | Description of Business.
--------+-------------------------

Overview
 
We are an emerging technology company in China engaged in the development and distribution of electronic and web-based security solutions through which we plan to offer marketing and data analytic services to Chinese businesses.
 
While we have in the past sold and may in the future sell our security solutions as a stand-alone aspect of our business, our current primary business plan anticipates generating most of our revenues from online and offline marketing services, targeted at users of our security solutions in China. For example, users of our “Safe Campus” security system will receive advertisements through our mobile application installed on their smart phones. Advertisements may also be displayed on the hardware of our “Safe Campus” security system, including on the lanyards of our smart student ID cards. Utilizing our security systems and the data collected from users of our security systems and our online platform, we will seek to provide targeted, one stop marketing solutions to businesses.
 
We have obtained, among others, the Zhongguancun High Tech Enterprises Certificate from in recognition of our high technology products. We have generated very limited revenues to date, and as such we shifted our business focus over the past 12 months from cybersecurity to our “Safe Campus” and “Smart Elevator” security and related marketing solutions as described further below.
 
In order to provide efficient and targeted marketing services, we have independently developed “Xin Platform,” an online platform that can identify potential customers and market products and services to targeted groups based on the data we collect through our security systems. The Xin Platform also serves as our office to office, or O2O, management platform, which can provide marketing services to traditional merchants such as supermarkets, hotels, shopping malls and restaurants. It also provides support for various other security programs that we develop and/or provide, including our “Safe Campus” security system and “Smart Elevator” security system.
 
Based on the Xin Platform, our “Safe Campus” system provides teachers, students and families with comprehensive campus information management, student safety management and integrated online education solutions through our smart student ID cards (which have the look and feel of a smartphone). The development and marketing of the “Safe Campus” security system has been the focus of our company since 2016. Currently, the “Safe Campus” system is in trial period. We have partnered on a trial basis with approximately 30 elementary and middle schools in 10 Chinese provinces covering approximately 3,000 students and their families to use our “Safe Campus” system. We expect to enter into formal agreements with these schools in the near future, under which the schools will utilize our Safe Campus platform, and we plan to continue expanding this program to more schools during the remainder of 2017 and during 2018.
 
In the elevator security space, our “Smart Elevator” system offers status monitoring, emergency response, maintenance and management, accident investigation and comprehensive data collection of the elevators to building management and maintenance crews without any significant structure change to the elevators or the buildings. We plan to launch our “Smart Elevator” system once we complete our testing, which we expect to occur in 2018.
 
We plan to provide our “Safe Campus” and “Smart Elevator” systems to eligible users for free. Eligibility will be determined by us based on estimates of marketing values. We believe that with the increase in user base of our security solutions, we will generate revenues from advertising placements on our platforms and hardware as well as revenue sharing with other product and service providers utilizing our platforms.
 
Additionally, we hope to become a national provider of “big data” processing services in the PRC. To this end, we are developing systems to analyze industry trends, market and customer data, supply chain, financial information, risk detection and management. Such processing services could potentially be used by businesses in a wide range of industries. In order to have the technical capacity to provide such service, our research and development process has two phases: data collection and data analysis. Currently, we are in the data collection phase utilizing our “Safe Campus” system. Once we launch the “Smart Elevator” system, we expect to collect data from end users of the system as well. With this data in hand, we will further develop our data analysis services, which we will initially use to enhance our targeted marketing solutions for our own customers.

History 
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on September 26, 2014 under the name Rose Rock, Inc. On May 26, 2015, we amended our articles of incorporation to change our name to Datasea Inc. Up until October 2015, our primary business activities have been providing consulting services to various U.S. companies seeking to do business in China as well as Chinese companies looking to enter the U.S. markets. Nonetheless, we were considered a shell company as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Act, as we had no or nominal business operations, employees and/or assets. 
 
On May 26, 2015, pursuant to the terms of a stock purchase agreement, Ms. Zhixin Liu purchased 20,000,000 shares, or 57.14%, of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock from Mr. Xingzhong Sun, who was our sole officer, director and majority shareholder at the time of the transaction. As part of the transaction, Zhixin Liu was elected as the Chairperson of our Board of Directors (the “Board”). 
 
On October 29, 2015, we entered into a share exchange agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with Zhixin Liu and Mr. Fu Liu, the members (“Members”) of Shuhai Information Skill (HK) Limited (“Shuhai Skill (HK)”), a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the PRC, whereby the Shuhai Shareholders transferred all of their membership interests of Shuhai Skill (HK) to us in exchange for the issuance of an aggregate of 20,000,000 shares of our common stock (the transaction, hereinafter referred to as the “Share Exchange”). Upon consummation of the Share Exchange, Shuhai Skill (HK) and its consolidated subsidiaries, Tianjin Information Sea Information Technology Co., Ltd., a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of the PRC (“Tianjin Information”), became our wholly-owned subsidiary, and Shuahi Information Technology Co., Ltd., also a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of the PRC (“Shuhai Beijing”), through its existing contractual relationship with Tianjin Information, became our variable interest entity (“VIE”).  In addition, Xinzhong Sun resigned from the positions of our director, President, Secretary and Treasurer. Ms. Liu was appointed as our Chief Executive Officer, President, Interim Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary and Mr. Liu was appointed as a director. 
 
As a result of the Share Exchange, we, through our consolidated subsidiaries, are engaged in the business of providing Internet security products, new media advertising, micro-marketing, data analysis services in the PRC. All business operations are conducted through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Tianjin Information, and through Shuhai Beijing, our VIE. Shuhai Beijing is considered to be a VIE because we do not have any direct ownership interest in it, but, as a result of a series of contractual agreements (the “VIE Contractual Agreements”) between Tianjin Information, its wholly-owned subsidiary, Shuhai Beijing and its shareholders, we are able to exert effective control over Shuhai Beijing and receive 100% of the net profits or net losses derived from the business operations of Shuhai Beijing. The VIE Contractual Agreements are more fully described below.


VIE Agreements
 
Operation and Intellectual Property Service Agreement – This agreement allows Tianjin Information to manage and operate Shuhai Beijing and collect 100% of the net profits of Shuhai Beijing. Under the terms of the Management and Intellectual Property Service Agreement, Shuhai Beijing entrusts Tianjin Information to manage its operations and provide intellectual property service to Shuhai Beijing. Tianjin Information owns all intellectual property rights arising from its performance under the Management and Intellectual Property Service Agreement.

“Safe Campus” Security System
    Overview
 
We are currently focusing our efforts on the promotion of our “Safe Campus” security system, which provides a comprehensive campus information platform which is accessible online or via a smartphone application for teachers, students and their family to enhance the communications between them. Our “Safe Campus” users to date have included mostly elementary and middle schools, which are our target markets.
 
The Safe Campus system consists of student ID card terminals, radio-frequency identification (“RFID”) readers, campus information management platform, partner management platform and cellphone application terminals, utilizing technologies such as RFID, global positioning system (“GPS”), location based services (“LBS”), and cloud based calculation. Through our smart student ID cards, schools can manage the profiles of all teachers and students and send campus-wide notifications. They are also be able to grant and manage authority of teachers on the school platform. Through our platform, teachers are able to communicate with students via messages and calls; communicate with parents regarding their children; review daily and weekly class schedules; send out assignments and homework to students; notify parents of any class activities; receive notifications from school and any other school activities; and publish online education videos. Through our platform, parents are able to communicate with teachers, locate and track the movement of their children; review class schedules and check-in record of their children; notify teachers/schools of any absence of their children; and review school news and online education videos. Parents can also block unauthorized numbers from reaching their children on their ID cards and set access limits for their children using our smart student ID cards. Our student ID cards automatically alarm parents in the event that their children enter any limited areas or take off their student ID cards. Through the parent terminals, parents can also purchase stationary, toys and food for their children in our online student shopping mall. Students are able to check in and out of school using their ID cards as well as send alarms in case of emergency.


Campus Security Background and Potential Market
 
On-campus security and the safety of children in general is of great importance and has been increasingly gaining attention in PRC in the recent years. In March 2015, the PRC Office of the Ministry of Public Security and the Office of the Ministry of Education jointly issued Order No. 168, which provides that schools are obligated to ensure the security on campus and in certain circumstances, school administrators can be held responsible for major accidents and subject to administrative penalties or criminal penalties. At the PRC State Conference held on April 12, 2017, the Prime Minister of China emphasized that the measures should be taken to further ensure the security and risk control system on campus, including installation of on campus security systems.
 
According to the 2016-2022 Security Industry Market Prediction and Investment Strategy Analysis Report published by Prospective Industrial Research Institute, a comprehensive security system for a kindergarten is estimated to cost RMB 50,000 to RMB 200,000 (US$7,500 to US$30,000). Elementary, middle and high schools will cost approximately RMB 500,000 to RMB 1.5 million per school (US$75,000 to US$225,000). Average colleges and universities can cost between RMB 3 million to RMB 5 million (US$450,000 to US$755,000), with certain schools reach over RMB 10 million (US$1,506,000). Based on the number of schools in PRC published by the Ministry of Education in 2016, we believe the potential on-campus security market in China can reach between RMB 35 billion to RMB 230 billion (US$5 to 35 billion).
 
Our “Safe Campus” security system targets elementary and middle schools, which accounts for 85% of the entire campus security market in China and where students are more vulnerable. Our current distribution model prioritizes elementary schools and schools in the urban areas.

To date, the “Safe Campus” security system is still in trial period and has not generated any revenues. We expect our “Safe Campus” security system to generate revenues through advertisements placed on the terminals as well as advertisements displayed on the online platform. We also expect to generate revenues through the O2O shopping mall, other O2O business (including student meal and online education program providers), where we will receive 5% of the revenues for business generated through our platform. We are currently in negotiation with several O2O product and service providers for our platform.
 
“Smart Elevator” Security and Management System
 
With our “Smart Elevator” security and management system, we are aiming to provide a solution to lower the operation cost of elevators and promote the safety of passengers. The system will include an emergency and rescue terminal and a data collection system. Once installed, our terminals will collect data of the elevator operation, regular maintenance services, annual inspections and any malfunctions which enables faster and more efficient error detection and repairs. If any irregular data is detected on a particular elevator by the black box in our terminal, the distant surveillance system will automatically alarm the building and other responsible parties as a means of preventing major accidents. In case of sudden power loss, our system will immediately start the backup power and alarm the maintenance team. Our system can also enable passengers to alarm the building management in case of any emergency and facilitate their communication throughout the entire rescue process.


Through our Xin Platform, our “Smart Elevator” system also has the ability to locate the nearest maintenance crew and notify him/her of the emergency through text messages.
 
We plan to launch our “Smart Elevator” system once we complete our testing, which we expect to occur in 2018. Once launched, we expect to generate revenue through advertisements displayed on our system on the elevators as well as targeted marketing of elevator maintenance services once any potential safety concern is detected.


“Big Data” Processing Services
 
We also aim to become a national provider of big data processing services in China. Currently, we are in the process of developing systems to analyze industry trends, market and customer data, supply chain, financial information, risk detection and management. We believe such processing services will be of use to businesses in a wide range of industries. In order to have the technical capacity to provide such service, our research and development process has two phases: data collection and data analysis. As of the date of this report, we are in the data collection phase. With this data in hand, we will further develop our data analysis services, which we will initially use to enhance our targeted marketing solutions for our customers.
Cybersecurity System and Equipment
 
We offer cybersecurity solution based on our Xin Platform to provide cybersecurity and online surveillance services by recording activities of the terminal users, including application/software usages and access to certain individualized websites and software. It can also limit access to software and websites of the terminal users. Our cybersecurity system meets the technical standards prescribed by the Ministry of Public Security of PRC but also aims to satisfy market demands for commercial cybersecurity products. We have developed three types of indoor equipment designed for facilities of different sizes and one type of outdoor equipment primarily for use by local branches of the Ministry of Public Security. In January 2016, we secured a government procurement contract with the Bureau of Public Security of Daqing City in Heilongjiang Province, pursuant to which we installed wireless internet terminal collection equipment and 3G wireless network cards, as well as provided training services related to the use of the equipment. The project was completed and accepted by the customer in the quarter ended December 31, 2016, generating $140,774 of revenue during year ended June 30, 2017. Because of the relatively low profit margin of our cybersecurity program, our business focus has shifted over the past 12 months from cybersecurity systems to our “Safe Campus “and “Smart Elevator” and related marketing programs.  Our management has decided not to actively promote or internally advance our cybersecurity project for the time being. However, we are still maintaining our developed market and our products and may resume marketing activities for our cybersecurity system if market conditions are favorable.

Internet Service Provider Connecting Service
 
We have the technical capacity to provide ISP connecting service and also obtained the Value-Added Telecommunication Business Operating License in August 2015 from the PRC government to provide ISP connecting service. The major target consumers of ISP connecting services are merchants and public institutions that are users of Internet security equipment.
Competitive Strengths
            We believe that our quality control and marketing teams have core management experience in technology programs such as IDC and ISP. Unlike most of the security systems provided by our competitors, our “Safe Campus” security system offers comprehensive logins and user friendly interfaces and allow communication between schools, teachers, parents and students. Our “Smart Elevator” security and management system is in line with the Guidelines on Elevator Emergency Response Platform Development promulgated by the PRC General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine in April 2014.
Growth Strategy 
 
We plan to vigorously market our “Safe Campus” system and “Smart Elevator” systems through different channels such as charities, industry conferences and forums, online platforms and social media such as Weibo and free trials. Our plan anticipates that with the increase in user base of our security solutions, we will generate revenues from advertising placements on our platforms and hardware as well as revenue sharing with other product and service providers utilizing our platforms.
 
Additionally, we hope to become a national provider of big data processing services in the PRC. To this end, we are developing systems to analyze industry trends, market and customer data, supply chain, financial information, risk detection and management. Such processing services can be used by businesses in a wide range of industries. In order to have the technical capacity to provide such service, our research and development process has two phases: data collection and data analysis. As the user base of our security solutions increase, we will have access to more data to support the development of our big data processing service.
