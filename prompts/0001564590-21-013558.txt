ITEM 1.     BUSINESS.
OVERVIEW
 PREIT, a Pennsylvania business trust founded in 1960 and one of the first equity real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) in the United States, has a primary investment focus on retail shopping malls located in the eastern half of the United States, primarily in the Mid-Atlantic region. 
 We currently own interests in 26 retail properties, of which 25 are operating properties and one is a development property. The 25 operating properties include 20 shopping malls and five other retail properties, have a total of 19.8 million square feet and are located in nine states. We and partnerships in which we hold an interest own 15.4 million square feet at these properties (excluding space owned by anchors or third parties). There are 18 operating retail properties in our portfolio that we consolidate for financial reporting purposes. These consolidated properties have a total of 14.9 million square feet, of which we own 11.8 million square feet. The seven operating retail properties that are owned by unconsolidated partnerships with third parties have a total of 4.9 million square feet, of which 3.6 million square feet are owned by such partnerships. When we refer to “Same Store” properties, we are referring to properties that have been owned for the full periods presented and excluding properties acquired, disposed of, under redevelopment or designated as a non-core property during the periods presented. Core properties include all operating retail properties except for Exton Square Mall and Fashion District Philadelphia. Valley View Mall was previously designated as a non-core property. As discussed further in Notes 2 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements, a foreclosure sale judgment was ordered by the court after the property operations were assumed by a receiver on behalf of the lender under the mortgage loan secured by Valley View Mall and we no longer operate the property. “Core Malls” also excludes these properties as well as power centers and Gloucester Premium Outlets.
 We have one property in our portfolio that is classified as under development; however, we do not currently have any activity occurring at this property.
 Fashion District Philadelphia opened on September 19, 2019. Fashion District Philadelphia is an aggregation of properties spanning three blocks in downtown Philadelphia that were formerly known as Gallery I, Gallery II and 907 Market Street. Joining Century 21 (which has since closed in 2020) and Burlington in 2019 were multiple dining and entertainment venues including Market Eats, a multi-offering food court, City Winery, AMC Theatres, and Round 1 Bowling & Amusement. In addition, Nike Factory Store, Ulta, and H & M have opened Philadelphia flagship stores at the property since its opening in September 2019. Fashion District Philadelphia is owned by our joint venture entity with our joint venture partner, the Macerich Company (“Macerich”). As of January 1, 2021, Macerich is responsible for the operations of Fashion District Philadelphia.
 We are a fully integrated, self-managed and self-administered REIT that has elected to be treated as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. In general, we are required each year to distribute to our shareholders at least 90% of our net taxable income and to meet certain other requirements in order to maintain the favorable tax treatment associated with qualifying as a REIT.
 PREIT’S BUSINESS
 We are primarily engaged in the ownership, management, leasing, acquisition, redevelopment, and disposition of shopping malls. In general, our malls include tenants that are national or regional department stores, large format retailers or other anchors and a diverse mix of national, regional and local in-line stores offering apparel (women’s, family, teen, children’s, men’s), shoes, eyewear, cards and gifts, jewelry, sporting goods, home furnishings and personal care items, among other things. In recent years, we have increased the portion of our mall properties that is leased to non-traditional mall tenants. Approximately 27% of our mall space is committed to non-traditional tenants offering services such as dining and entertainment, health and wellness, off-price retail and fast fashion.
 To enhance the experience for shoppers, most of our malls have restaurants and/or food courts, and some of the malls have multi-screen movie theaters and other entertainment options, either as part of the mall or on outparcels around the perimeter of the mall property. In addition, many of our malls have outparcels containing restaurants, banks or other stores. Our malls frequently serve as a central place for community, promotional and charitable events in their geographic trade areas.
 
The largest core mall in our retail portfolio is 1.4 million square feet and contains 170 stores, and the smallest core mall is 0.5 million square feet and contains 79 stores. The other properties in our retail portfolio range from 370,000 to 780,000 square feet.
 We derive the substantial majority of our revenue from rent received under leases with tenants for space at retail properties in our real estate portfolio. In general, our leases require tenants to pay minimum rent, which is a fixed amount specified in the lease, and which is often subject to scheduled increases during the term of the lease for longer term leases. In 2020, 81% of the new leases that we signed contained scheduled rent increases, and these increases, which are typically scheduled to occur between two and four times during the term, ranged from 2.0% to 10.0%, with approximately 92% ranging from 2.0% to 4.0%. In addition or in the alternative, certain tenants are required to pay percentage rent, which can be either a percentage of their sales revenue that exceeds certain levels specified in their lease agreements, or a percentage of their total sales revenue.
 The majority of our leases also provide that the tenant will reimburse us for certain expenses relating to the property for common area maintenance (“CAM”), real estate taxes, utilities, insurance and other operating expenses incurred in the operation of the property subject, in some cases, to certain limitations. The proportion of the expenses for which tenants are responsible was historically related to the tenant’s pro rata share of space at the property. We have continued to shift the CAM provision in our leases to be a fixed amount, which gives greater predictability to tenants, and a majority of such revenue is derived from leases specifying fixed CAM reimbursements.

Retail real estate industry participants sometimes classify malls based on the average sales per square foot of non-anchor mall tenants occupying spaces under 10,000 square feet in size, the population and average household income of the trade area and the geographic market, the growth rates of the population and average household income in the trade area and geographic market, and numerous other factors. Based on these factors, in general, malls that have high average sales per square foot and are in trade areas with large populations and high household incomes and/or growth rates are considered Class A malls, malls with average sales per square foot that are in the middle range of population or household income and/or growth rates are considered Class B malls, and malls with lower average sales and smaller populations and lower household incomes and/or growth rates are considered Class C malls. Although these classifications are defined differently by different market participants, in general, most of our malls would be classified as Class A or Class B properties. The classification of a mall can change, and one of the goals of our current property strategic plans and remerchandising programs is to increase the average sales per square foot of certain of our properties and correspondingly increase their rental income and cash flows, and thus potentially their class, in order to maximize the value of the property. The malls that we have sold pursuant to the strategic property disposition program we commenced in 2012 generally have been Class C properties.
 BUSINESS STRATEGY
 Our primary objective is to maximize the long-term value of the Company for our shareholders. To that end, our business goals are to obtain the highest possible rental income, tenant sales and occupancy at our properties in order to maximize our cash flows, net operating income, funds from operations, funds available for distribution to shareholders and other operating measures and results, and ultimately to maximize the values of our properties.
 To achieve this primary goal, we have developed a business strategy focused on increasing the values of our properties, and ultimately of the Company, which includes:
 

 
• | Raising capital by monetizing embedded value in the portfolio to enhance our liquidity position and reducing debt and leverage to improve the balance sheet;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Selling off non-core properties and underperforming assets;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | Raising the overall level of quality of our portfolio and of individual properties in our portfolio;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Improving the operating results of our properties; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | Taking steps to position the Company for future growth opportunities.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------

Improving Our Balance Sheet by Reducing Debt and Leverage; Maintaining Liquidity
 Leverage. We continue to seek ways to reduce our leverage by improving our operating performance and through a variety of other means available to us. These means might include selling properties or interests in properties with values in excess of their mortgage loans and applying any excess proceeds to debt reduction; entering into joint ventures or other partnerships or arrangements involving our contribution of assets; or through other actions.
 Mortgage Loan Refinancings and Repayments. We might pursue opportunities to make favorable changes to individual mortgage loans on our properties. When we refinance such loans, we might seek a new term, better rates and excess proceeds. An aspect of our approach to debt financing is that we strive to lengthen and stagger the maturities of our debt obligations in order to better manage our future capital requirements. We might seek to repay certain mortgage loans in full in order to unencumber the associated properties, which enables us to increase our pool of unencumbered assets, have greater financial flexibility and obtain additional financing.
 Liquidity. As of December 31, 2020, our consolidated balance sheet reflected $43.3 million in cash and cash equivalents. We believe that this amount and future net cash provided by operations, together with the available credit under the First Lien Revolving Facility (as defined below and assuming continued compliance with the financial covenants thereunder) and other sources of capital, provide sufficient liquidity to meet our liquidity requirements in the short term, including for one year from the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Capital Recycling. We regularly conduct portfolio property reviews and, if appropriate, we seek to dispose of malls, other retail properties or outparcels that we do not believe meet the financial and strategic criteria we apply, given economic, market and other circumstances. Disposing of these properties can enable us to redeploy or recycle our capital to other uses, such as to repay debt, to reinvest in other real estate assets and development and redevelopment projects, and for other corporate purposes. Along these lines, in 2020 we completed the sale of ten outparcels for total consideration of $23.1 million. Since we began our disposition program in 2012, we have sold 17 malls, four power centers, two street retail properties, three office properties and multiple land parcels and other real estate assets for a total of $909.7 million. The proceeds generated from these sales were reinvested in our existing redevelopment program or used to repay debt. In September 2019, we conveyed Wyoming Valley Mall to the lender of the mortgage loan secured by the property. In August 2020, we derecognized the assets of Valley View Mall as a result of a court order assigning a receiver, however, we continue to recognize the mortgage until the property foreclosure sales process is complete. We are currently under contract to sell five additional land outparcels and expect to close the transactions in 2022 or 2023. We have executed an agreement of sale for a hotel site at one of our malls that we expect to close in 2021 and are actively marketing two other sites.
 We expect to continue to look for opportunities to sell non-core assets, including land parcels, to residential, hotel and office developers at some of our mall properties.

Raising the Overall Level of Quality of Our Portfolio and of Individual Properties in Our Portfolio
 Portfolio Actions. We continue to refine our collection of properties to enhance the overall quality of the portfolio. We seek to have a portfolio that derives most of its Net Operating Income, or “NOI” (a non-GAAP measure; as defined below) from higher productivity properties and from properties located in major metropolitan markets. We hold ownership interests in 10 properties in the Philadelphia metro area, four properties in the Washington, D.C. metro area and one property in the Boston-Providence metro area. One method we have used and continue to use for raising the level of quality of our portfolio is disposing of assets that had certain economic features, such as sales productivity or occupancy levels below the average for our portfolio and significantly lower expected income due to anchor closures. We currently have one non-core mall (“Non-Core Malls”), Exton Square Mall, which we designated as a Non-Core Mall in 2018 because we have completed the first phase of a redevelopment with the opening of Whole Foods and the sale of a land parcel to a multifamily developer as part of our densification effort (as discussed below), and are continuing to consider the possible inclusion of other non-retail uses on the site. A second Non-Core Mall, Valley View Mall, was derecognized in the third quarter as a result of a receiver being assigned to manage the property. A third Non-Core Mall, Wyoming Valley Mall, was conveyed to the lender of the mortgage loan secured by that property in 2019.
 Redevelopment. We might also seek to improve particular properties, to increase the potential value of properties in our portfolio, and to maintain or enhance their competitive positions by redeveloping them. We do so in order to make the properties more attractive to customers and retailers, which we expect to lead to increases in shopper traffic, sales, occupancy and rental rates. Redevelopments are generally more involved than strategic property plans or remerchandising programs and require the investment of capital. We give redevelopment priority to properties in our portfolio that are of a higher quality and where we anticipate the redevelopment can be economically transformative. Our property redevelopments focus primarily on anchor replacement and remerchandising. We believe these activities will position us to optimize our financial returns.
 Densification. We seek to maximize the value of our retail properties by adding other uses where appropriate. We believe that by incorporating residential, hotel or office uses into some of our retail properties, we will increase the value of those properties. The addition of other property types to our sites may provide synergies to both the retail and non-retail uses. The presence of residents, hotel guests or office workers in close proximity to the retail center may result in additional visits to the retail property We have executed an agreement of sale for a hotel site at one of our malls that we expect to close in 2021. In 2020, we entered into agreements of sale for the sale of parcels for anticipated multifamily development at five sites on, or adjacent to, our mall properties.
 Since 2014, we, along with our 50/50 joint venture partner, Macerich, have been engaged in a redevelopment of Fashion District Philadelphia (formerly The Gallery). In connection therewith, we contributed and sold real estate assets to the venture and Macerich acquired its interest in the venture and real estate from us for $106.8 million in cash. We and Macerich are jointly and severally responsible for a minimum investment in the project of $300.0 million. Fashion District Philadelphia is in a key location in central Philadelphia, strategically positioned above regional mass transit, adjacent to the convention center and tourism sites, and amidst numerous offices and residential sites. See below under ‘Financing Activity’ for a description of our loan secured by the Fashion District Philadelphia properties, which was amended in 2020. Since January 1, 2021, Macerich is responsible for the operations of Fashion District Philadelphia.
 An important aspect of any redevelopment project is its effect on the property and on the tenants and customers during the time that a redevelopment is taking place. While we might undertake a redevelopment to maximize the long term performance of the property, in the short term, the operations and performance of the property, as measured by sales, occupancy and NOI, will often be negatively affected. Tenants might be relocated or closed as space for the redevelopment is aggregated, which affects overall tenant sales and rental rates. As Fashion District Philadelphia was being redeveloped, occupancy, sales and NOI decreased from their levels prior to the commencement of the redevelopment. We expect those trends to reverse as the newly constructed space is completed, leased and occupied. On September 19, 2019, Fashion District Philadelphia, an aggregation of properties spanning three blocks in downtown Philadelphia that were formerly known as Gallery I, Gallery II and 907 Market Street, opened. Joining Century 21 (which subsequently closed in 2020) and Burlington in 2019 were multiple dining and entertainment venues including Market Eats, a multi-offering food court, City Winery, AMC Theatres, and Round 1 Bowling & Amusement. In addition, Nike Factory Store, Ulta, and H & M opened Philadelphia flagship stores at the property. Fashion District is expected to have additional tenant openings throughout 2021.
 Mall-Specific Plans. We seek to unlock value in our portfolio through a variety of targeted efforts at our properties. We believe that certain of our properties, including those in trade areas around major cities or those which are leading properties in secondary markets, can benefit from strategic remerchandising strategies, including, for example, selective re-tenanting of certain spaces in certain properties with higher quality, better-matched tenants. Based on the demographics of the trade area or the relevant competition, we believe that this subset of properties provides opportunities for meaningful value creation at the property level. We believe that we can successfully implement particular strategies at these assets by incorporating in-demand uses such as dining, entertainment and fitness, by adding discount, specialty, fast fashion and native internet retailer tenants, and by closing, relocating and right-sizing certain existing mall tenants. Some examples of in-demand tenants include Apple, Urban Outfitters and The Cheesecake Factory. We also continuously work to optimize the match between the demographics of the trade area, such as the household income level, and the nature and mix of tenants at such properties. We strive to work closely with tenants to enhance their merchandising opportunities at our properties. We believe that these approaches can attract more national and other tenants to the property and can lead to higher occupancy and NOI.
 Shopper Experiences. In addition to such property-wide remerchandising efforts, we also seek to offer unique shopper experiences at our properties by having tenants that provide products, services or interactions that are unlike other offerings in the trade area. We seek to add first-to-market tenants, dining and entertainment options, beauty and fashion purveyors, off-price retail, traditionally online retailers and health and fitness destinations such as Legoland Discovery Center, Peloton, Ulta, HomeSense, Dave & Buster's, Balsam Hill and the 1776 retail incubator, among others, as well as to provide amenities like children’s play areas and mall shopping smartphone apps.

Vacant Anchor Replacements. In recent years, through property dispositions, proactive store recaptures, lease terminations and other activities, we have made efforts to reduce our risks associated with certain department store concentrations. Since 2012, we have reduced the number of Sears locations from 27 to 4, the number of Macy’s locations from 25 to 14, and the number of J.C. Penney locations from 29 to 11.
 From the beginning of 2018 through December 31, 2020, nine department stores within our core portfolio were recaptured or closed. To date, all or a significant portion of these former department stores have tenants that either opened, are currently under construction, or have leases that are executed or near execution.
 During 2019, we re-opened or introduced additional tenants to former anchor positions at Woodland Mall in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Valley Mall in Hagerstown, Maryland and Plymouth Meeting Mall, in Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania. Dick’s Sporting Goods at Valley Mall opened in the first quarter of 2020. At Plymouth Meeting Mall, we opened Michael’s in the first quarter of 2020. In 2017, we purchased the Macy’s location at Moorestown Mall in Moorestown, New Jersey and opened HomeSense, Sierra Trading and Michael’s between 2018 and the first quarter of 2020.
 Construction was completed in the first quarter of 2020 giving way to the opening of Burlington in place of a former Sears at Dartmouth Mall in Dartmouth, Massachusetts. We expect to continue to move forward with several outparcels at Dartmouth Mall resulting from the Sears recapture and to work with large format prospects for space adjacent to Burlington, but have experienced delays due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 In response to anchor store closings and other trends in the retail space, we have been changing the mix of tenants at our properties. We have been reducing the percentage of traditional mall tenants and increasing the share of space dedicated to dining, entertainment, fast fashion, off price, and large format box tenants. This initiative has slowed down due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of these changes may result in the redevelopment of all or a portion of our properties. See “— Capital Improvements, Redevelopment and Development Projects.”
 To fund the capital necessary to replace anchors and to maintain a reasonable level of leverage, we expect to use a variety of means available to us, subject to and in accordance with the terms of our credit agreements. These steps might include (i) making additional borrowings under our credit agreements (assuming availability and continued compliance with the financial covenants thereunder), (ii) obtaining construction loans on specific projects, (iii) selling properties or interests in properties with values in excess of their mortgage loans (if applicable) and applying the excess proceeds to fund capital expenditures or for debt reduction, or (iv) obtaining capital from joint ventures or other partnerships or arrangements involving our contribution of assets with institutional investors, private equity investors or other REITs.
 Improving the Operating Results of Our Properties
 We aim to improve the overall operational performance of our portfolio of properties with a multi-pronged approach.
 Occupancy. We continue to work to increase non-anchor and total occupancy in our properties, both of which have been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and tenant bankruptcies. From 2019 to 2020, total occupancy for our retail portfolio including consolidated and unconsolidated properties (and including all tenants irrespective of the term of their agreement) decreased 450 basis points to 88.1%, and total occupancy at our malls other than the Non-Core Malls (such other malls, the “Core Malls”) decreased 520 basis points to 90.3%.
 In connection with the remerchandising plans at several of our properties, we are seeking or have obtained tenants for new spaces of different types, such as pads or kiosks. We are also seeking tenants that have not previously been prevalent at our mall properties.
 Key Tenants; Mall Leasing. We continue to recruit, and expand our relationships with, certain high profile retailers, and to initiate and expand our relationships with other quality and first-to-market retailers or concepts. We coordinate closely with tenants on new store locations in an effort to position our properties for our tenants’ latest concept or store prototype, in order to drive traffic to our malls and stimulate customer spending. We believe that increasing our occupancy in ways that are tailored to particular properties will be helpful to our leasing efforts and will help increase rental rates and tenant sales. We have also diversified the mix of tenants within our portfolio, with approximately 27% of our mall space committed to non traditional tenants offering services such as dining and entertainment, health and wellness, off price retail and fast fashion.
 Rental Rates and Releasing Spreads. Although we have been taking steps to seek positive rent spreads as we renew leases and enter into new leases, during the challenging 2020 operating environment, total renewal spreads decreased 4.2% on all non-anchor leases. As discussed above, since 2012, we have sold 17 low-productivity or underperforming malls. In 2020, we derecognized the assets of Valley View Mall as the property was assigned to a receiver. We continue to recognize the mortgage until the property is sold through the foreclosure process. In 2019, we conveyed Wyoming Valley Mall to the lender of the mortgage secured by the property. We believe that the disposition of these less productive assets will help improve our negotiating position with retailers with multiple stores in our portfolio (including stores at these properties), and potentially enable us to obtain higher rental rates from them at our remaining properties.
 Specialty Leasing and Partnership Marketing. Some space at our properties might be available for a shorter period of time, pending a lease with a permanent tenant or in connection with a redevelopment. We strive to manage the use of this space through our specialty leasing function, which manages the short term leasing of stores and the licensing of income-generating carts and kiosks, with the goal of maximizing the rent we receive during the period when a space is not subject to a longer term lease.
 We also seek to generate ancillary revenue (such as sponsorship marketing revenue and promotional income) from the properties in our portfolio. We believe that increased efforts in this area can enable us to increase the proportion of net operating income derived from ancillary revenue.
 8

Operating Expenses and CAM Reimbursements. Our strategy for improving operating results also includes efforts to control or reduce the costs of operating our properties. With respect to operating expenses, we have taken steps to manage a significant proportion of them through contracts with third party vendors for housekeeping and maintenance, security services, landscaping and trash removal. These contracts provide reasonable control, certainty and predictability. We also seek to contain certain expenses through our active programs for managing utility expense and real estate taxes. We have taken advantage of opportunities to buy electricity economically in states that have opened their energy markets to competition, and we expect to continue with this approach. We have instituted a solar energy program at five of our properties, which we expect will lower our utility expenses and reduce our carbon footprint. We also review the annual tax assessments of our properties and, when appropriate, pursue appeals.
 With respect to CAM reimbursements, we have converted most of our leases to fixed CAM reimbursement, in contrast to the traditional pro-rata CAM reimbursement. Fixed CAM reimbursement, while shifting some risk to us as landlord, offers tenants increased predictability of their costs, a decrease in the number of items to be negotiated in a lease thus speeding lease execution, and reduced need for detailed CAM billings, reconciliations and collections.
 Taking Steps to Position the Company for Future Growth Opportunities
 We are taking steps designed to position the Company to generate future growth. In connection therewith, we have implemented processes designed to ensure strong internal discipline in the use, harvesting and recycling of our capital, and these processes will be applied in connection with proposals to redevelop properties or to reposition properties with a mix of uses, or possibly, in the future, to acquire additional properties.
 External Opportunities. Although it is not currently a primary focus, we may continue to seek to acquire, in an opportunistic, selective and disciplined manner, properties that are well-located, that are in trade areas with growing or stable demographics, that have operating metrics that are better than or equal to our existing portfolio averages, and that we believe have strong potential for increased cash flows and appreciation in value if we call upon our relationships with retailers and apply our skills in asset management and redevelopment. We also seek to acquire additional parcels or properties that are included within, or adjacent to, the properties already in our portfolio, in order to gain greater control over the merchandising and tenant mix of a property. Taking advantage of any acquisition opportunities would likely involve some use of debt or equity capital.
 We pursue development of retail and mixed use projects that we expect can meet the financial and strategic criteria we apply, given economic, market and other circumstances. We seek to leverage our skill sets in site selection, entitlement and planning, design, cost estimation and project management to develop new retail and mixed use properties. We seek properties in trade areas that we believe have sufficient demand, once developed, to generate cash flows that meet the financial thresholds we establish in the given environment. We manage all aspects of these undertakings, including market and trade area research, acquisition, preliminary development work, construction and leasing.
 Depending on the nature of the acquisition or development opportunity, we might involve a partner or sell land to a qualified third party, including in connection with projects involving a use other than retail.
 In light of the redevelopment and densification opportunities in our existing portfolio, the capital required to complete these investments, and the limitations under our credit facilities, together with a limited availability of properties that meet our investment criteria, we are not currently emphasizing external opportunities as part of our growth strategy.
 Organic Opportunities. We look for ways to maximize the value of our assets by adding a mix of uses, such as office or multi-family residential housing, initiated either by ourselves or with a partner, that are designed to attract a greater number of people to the property. Multiple constituencies, from local governments to city planners to citizen groups, have indicated a preference for in-place development, development near transportation hubs, the addition of uses to existing properties, and sustainable development, as opposed to locating, acquiring and developing new green field sites. Also, if appropriate, we will seek to attract certain nontraditional tenants to these properties, including tenants using the space for purposes such as entertainment, education, health care, government and childcare, which can bring larger numbers of people to the property, as well as regional, local or nontraditional retailers. We are increasingly focused on bringing such nontraditional tenants to our properties, and we believe that such uses will increase traffic and enable us to generate additional revenue and grow the value of the property.
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
 Financial Restructuring
 Voluntary Prepackaged Chapter 11 Cases and Emergence from Bankruptcy
 On November 1, 2020, we and certain of our wholly owned direct and indirect subsidiaries (collectively, the “Debtors”) filed voluntary petitions under chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the “Bankruptcy Court”). Our chapter 11 cases were jointly administered for procedural convenience under the caption In re Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust, et al., Case No. 20-12737 (KBO) (collectively, the “Chapter 11 Cases”). On November 30, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order, confirming the Joint Prepackaged Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization of Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust and Certain of Its Direct and Indirect Subsidiaries (with Additional Technical Modifications As of November 20, 2020) (the “Plan”). The Plan became effective and we emerged from bankruptcy on December 10, 2020 (the “Effective Date”). 
 9

Prior to commencing the Chapter 11 Cases, on October 7, 2020, the Debtors entered into a Restructuring Support Agreement (as subsequently amended, the “RSA”) with certain lenders party to our then-existing credit agreements. The RSA set forth, subject to certain conditions, the commitment to and obligations of, on the one hand, the Debtors, and on the other hand, certain lenders, in connection with our financial restructuring. The RSA automatically terminated pursuant to its terms on the Effective Date.
 Although the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases constituted an event of default under the terms of our then-existing credit agreements, resulting in the automatic and immediate acceleration of our obligations thereunder, any efforts to enforce our payment obligations under those agreements were automatically stayed in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, and our lenders’ rights of enforcement in respect of the agreements were subject to the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. To the extent the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases constituted a cross-default under certain property-level debt facilities, ground leases, operating leases and other contractual and non-contractual obligations of our non-Debtor affiliates, enforcement efforts as against such non-Debtors were not stayed by virtue of the Chapter 11 Cases commenced by the Debtors and only enforcement as against the Debtor on account of guaranties, if any, or other similar arrangements, if applicable, were stayed. 
 During the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases, we conducted normal business activities without interruption. As contemplated by the Plan, we are continuing our day-to-day operations substantially as conducted prior to the Chapter 11 Cases, and all of our commercial and operational contracts and leases in effect prior to the Effective Date remain in effect after the Effective Date in accordance with their terms. The Plan did not restructure our equity, and all of the outstanding equity interests in PREIT remained outstanding and unmodified following the Effective Date. Each Debtor continues to exist after the Effective Date in the same form as prior to the Effective Date. The Board of Trustees also remains unchanged.
 Implementation of the Plan
 On the Effective Date, we entered into (a) an Amended and Restated First Lien Credit Agreement (the “First Lien Credit Agreement”) for secured loan facilities consisting of: (i) a secured first lien revolving credit facility allowing for borrowings up to $130.0 million, including a sub-facility for letters of credit to be issued thereunder in an aggregate stated amount of up to $10.0 million (collectively, the “First Lien Revolving Facility”), and (ii) a $384.5 million secured first lien term loan facility (the “First Lien Term Loan Facility”), as well as (b) a Second Lien Credit Agreement (the “Second Lien Credit Agreement” and together with the First Lien Credit Agreement, the “Credit Agreements”) for a $535.2 million secured second lien term loan facility (the “Second Lien Term Loan Facility”). The Credit Agreements replaced our previously existing secured term loan under the Credit Agreement dated as of August 11, 2020 (as amended, the “Bridge Credit Agreement”), our Seven-Year Term Loan Agreement entered into on January 8, 2014 (as amended, the “7-Year Term Loan”), and our 2018 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement entered into on May 24, 2018 (together with the 7-Year Term Loan, the “Prepetition Unsecured Credit Agreements”). 
 The Credit Agreements each provide for a two-year maturity, subject to a one-year extension at the borrowers’ option, subject to (i) minimum liquidity of $35.0 million, (ii) a minimum corporate debt yield of 8.0%, (iii) a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 105% for the total first lien and second lien loans and letters of credit and the Borrowing Base Properties (defined in the Credit Agreements) as determined by an appraisal and (iv) no default or event of default existing and our representations and warranties being true in all material respects. The loans under the Credit Agreements are repayable in full at maturity, subject to mandatory prepayment provisions in the event of certain events including asset sales, incurrence of indebtedness, issuances of equity and receipt of casualty insurance proceeds. Subject to certain limited exceptions, the terms of our Credit Agreements place restrictions on, among other things, our ability to make certain restricted payments (including payments of dividends), make certain types of investments and acquisitions, issue redeemable securities, incur additional indebtedness, incur liens on our assets, enter into agreements with a negative pledge, make certain intercompany transfers, merge, consolidate, or sell our assets or the equity interests of our subsidiaries, amend our organizational documents or material contracts, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, or enter into derivatives contracts. Additionally, if we receive net cash proceeds from certain capital events (including equity issuances), we are required to prepay loans under our Credit Agreements. In addition, the Credit Agreements contain, and any future debt agreements may contain, cross-default provisions that trigger an event of default if we fail to make certain payments or otherwise fail to comply with our obligations with respect to certain of our other indebtedness. For a detailed description of the terms of the Credit Agreements, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Credit Agreements” and note 4 to our consolidated financial statements.
 Our obligations under the Credit Agreements are guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries. Our obligations under the Credit Agreements and the guaranties are secured by mortgages and deeds of trust on a portfolio of 12 of our subsidiaries’ properties, including nine malls and three additional parcels. The obligations are further secured by a lien on substantially all of our personal property pursuant to collateral agreements and a pledge of substantially all of the equity interests held by us and the guarantors pursuant to pledge agreements, in each case subject to limited exceptions.
 As of the Effective Date, our capital structure consists of (i) the First Lien Revolving Facility; (ii) the First Lien Term Loan Facility; (iii) the Second Lien Term Loan Facility; (iv) reinstated secured property-level debt; (v) assumed (or reinstated, as the case may be) general unsecured debt payable in the ordinary course of business of the reorganized Company; (vi) reinstated specified derivatives, each being amended by an amendment to the applicable ISDA master agreement, with most obligations thereunder secured pari passu with the facilities under the First Lien Credit Agreement; and (vii) the existing, unmodified equity in the Company. 
 Below is a summary of the treatment that the holders of allowed prepetition unsecured claims against the Debtors received under the Plan (except to the extent a different treatment was agreed to by the Debtors and the applicable holder of an allowed claim) in exchange for full and final satisfaction, settlement, release and discharge of their claims:
  
• | Each swap agreement, as amended, was reinstated and assumed with our obligations under the assumed swap agreements secured pari passu with the facilities under the First Lien Credit Agreement (except for one derivative provider that elected to remain unsecured); although a derivative provider that was not a party to the RSA could terminate its swap agreement, thus being entitled to receive the incremental loans under the Second Lien Term Loan Facility equal to the termination value of the specified derivatives, none of the derivative providers terminated their swap agreements.

• | Each holder of an allowed claim under the Prepetition Unsecured Credit Agreements received: (A) a payment in cash of such holder’s pro rata share (calculated based on such holder’s loan commitment under the First Lien Revolving Facility) of the exit commitment fee; plus (B) first, on a dollar-for-dollar basis on account of such holder’s allowed claim under the Prepetition Unsecured Credit Agreements, its pro rata share (calculated based on such holder’s commitment of loans under the First Lien Revolving Facility) of the principal amount of loans under the First Lien Term Loan Facility; and (C) second, on a dollar-for-dollar basis on account of such holder’s remaining allowed claim under the Prepetition Unsecured Credit Agreements (if any), the principal amount of loans under the Second Lien Term Loan Facility in a principal amount equal to such remaining allowed claim.

• | Subject to the terms of the Plan, each prepetition lender under the Prepetition Unsecured Credit Agreements committed itself for all of its full pro rata share (based on its holdings of loans under the Prepetition Unsecured Credit Agreements) of the First Lien Revolving Facility. Subject to the terms and conditions of the First Lien Credit Agreement, (A) on the Effective Date, the amounts borrowed under the Bridge Credit Agreement were rolled into the First Lien Revolving Facility; and (B) after the Effective Date, the available proceeds of the First Lien Revolving Facility have been and will continue to be used for working capital, general corporate purposes and other permitted uses, consistent with an approved annual business plan.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | On the Effective Date, (A) the First Lien Term Loan Facility and the Second Lien Term Loan Facility were used to refinance the allowed claims in respect of the indebtedness under the Prepetition Unsecured Credit Agreements as set forth in the Plan and pursuant to the terms and conditions of the First Lien Credit Agreement and the Second Lien Credit Agreement, respectively; (B) the Prepetition Unsecured Credit Agreements and any documents ancillary thereto were cancelled; and (C) each holder of an allowed claim in respect of the indebtedness under the Prepetition Unsecured Credit Agreements became bound by the terms and conditions of the First Lien Credit Agreement and/or the Second Lien Credit Agreement (as applicable).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | All other allowed general unsecured claims against the Debtors, with all associated rights and defenses, were reinstated, riding through the bankruptcy unaffected as if the bankruptcy cases were never commenced.

Operating Performance
 Our net loss increased by $253.7 million to a net loss of $266.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from a net loss of $13.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The change in our 2020 results of operations was primarily due to (a) a loss on remeasurement of FDP's assets and an other than temporary impairment on our investment in FDP totaling $148.5 million; (b) a decrease in real estate revenue of $74.0 million due to the COVID-19 related closure of our properties for the majority of the second quarter, as well as rent concession requests from tenants for rent abatements; (c) a decrease in equity partnership income of $13.8 million due to COVID-19 related closures and rent concessions at our equity investees’ properties; (d) an increase in interest expense of $20.4 million driven by higher interest rates on our Credit Agreements and higher overall debt balances; and (e) a non-recurring gain on debt extinguishment recognized for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $24.9 million, which had a favorable impact on the prior year period; partially offset by: (a) a decrease in property operating expenses of $9.7 million related to ongoing impacts of COVID-19 since the second quarter of 2020; (b) a non-recurring gain on derecognition of property, which provided a benefit of $8.1 million in the current year period; and (c) a non-recurring gain on sales of real estate, which provided a benefit of $11.4 million in the current year period. 
 Funds From Operations (“FFO”), a non-GAAP measure, decreased 101.6% from the prior year, and FFO as adjusted, also a non-GAAP measure, decreased 101.2% from the prior year. Adjustments to FFO included a gain on derecognition of Valley View Mall, reorganization expenses, loss on hedge ineffectiveness and a loss on debt extinguishment recognized in the fourth quarter 2020 as a result of our financial restructuring. FFO as adjusted per diluted share decreased 101.2% from 2019.
 Same Store net operating income (“Same Store NOI”), a non-GAAP measure, decreased 27.7% over the prior year. Same Store NOI, excluding lease termination revenue, decreased 28.2% compared to 2019.
 Renewal spreads at our properties decreased 3.6% on non-anchor leases under 10,000 square feet and decreased 11.3% for non-anchor leases of at least 10,000 square feet.
 Retail portfolio occupancy at December 31, 2020 was 88.1%, a decrease of 450 basis points compared to 2019. Non-anchor occupancy was 87.8%, a decrease of 390 basis points compared to 2019. Core Mall occupancy decreased by 520 basis points to 90.3%. Core Mall non-anchor occupancy was 89.4%, a decrease of 350 basis points.
 Descriptions of each non-GAAP measure mentioned above, NOI, Same Store NOI, FFO, FFO, as adjusted, and FFO as adjusted per diluted share, as well as the related reconciliation to the comparable GAAP measures, are located in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations—NON-GAAP SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL MEASURES”.
 Financing Activity
 As described above, in connection with our financial restructuring and emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases, we entered into two secured credit agreements: (a) the First Lien Credit Agreement, which includes (i) the First Lien Revolving Facility and (ii) the First Lien Term Loan Facility, and (b) the Second Lien Credit Agreement, which includes the Second Lien Term Loan Facility. The First Lien Term Loan Facility and the Second Lien Term Loan Facility are collectively referred to as the “Term Loans.” As described further above and in note 4 to our consolidated financial statements, the Credit Agreements refinanced the credit agreements that were outstanding prior to the Effective Date, pursuant to the terms of the Plan, and those credit agreements previously in effect were cancelled as of the Effective Date. As of December 31, 2020, aggregate borrowings under the Credit Agreements were as follows: (a) $54.8 million under the First Lien Revolving Facility, (b) $384.1 million under the First Lien Term Loan Facility, and (c) $538.0 million under the Second Lien Term Loan Facility. For a detailed description of the terms of our Credit Agreements, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Credit Agreements” and note 4 to our consolidated financial statements.

PM Gallery LP, a Delaware limited partnership and joint venture entity owned indirectly by us and Macerich, previously entered into a $250.0 million term loan in January 2018 (as amended in July 2019 to increase the total maximum potential borrowings to $350.0 million) to fund the ongoing redevelopment of Fashion District Philadelphia and to repay capital contributions to the venture previously made by the partners. On December 10, 2020, PM Gallery LP, together with certain other subsidiaries owned indirectly by us and Macerich (including the fee and leasehold owners of the properties that are part of the Fashion District Philadelphia project), entered into an Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement (the “FDP Loan Agreement”). In connection with the execution of the FDP Loan Agreement, a $100.0 million principal payment was made (and funded indirectly by Macerich, the “Partnership Loan”) to pay down the existing loan, reducing the outstanding principal under the FDP Loan Agreement from $301.0 million to $201.0 million. The joint venture must repay the Partnership Loan plus 15% accrued interest to the Macerich lender prior to the resumption of 50/50 cash distributions to us and Macerich. In connection with the execution of the FDP Loan Agreement, the governing structure of PM Gallery LP was modified such that, effective as of January 1, 2021, Macerich is responsible for the entity’s operations and, subject to limited exceptions, controls major decisions. For a description of the terms of the FDP Loan Agreement, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Credit Agreements—FDP Loan Agreement” and note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. 
 
Mortgage Loan Activity. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we executed forbearance and loan modification agreements for our consolidated properties Cherry Hill Mall, Cumberland Mall, Dartmouth Mall, Francis Scott Key Mall, Viewmont Mall, and Woodland Mall and for our unconsolidated partnership properties Metroplex and Springfield Mall. These arrangements allowed us to defer principal payments, and in some cases interest as well, between May and August 2020 depending on the terms of each agreement. At the end of the deferral period, the duration of repayment obligations for deferred amounts spans from four to six months. The repayment periods range from August 2020 through February 2021 pursuant to the terms of the specific agreements. Certain of these forbearance and loan modification agreements also impose certain additional informational reporting requirements during the applicable modification periods.
 
In the second quarter of 2020, we received a notice of transfer of servicing for the mortgage loan secured by Valley View Mall, which had a $27.3 million balance as of June 30, 2020. Subsequently, we failed to make the June 2020 monthly payment and our subsidiary that is the borrower under the mortgage also received a notice of default on the mortgage from the lender. Additionally, we have not paid the balloon payment of $27.3 million due at maturity on July 1, 2020. A foreclosure notice has been filed and operations of the property were assigned to a receiver in August 2020. 
 
CAPITAL STRATEGY
 In support of the business strategies described above, our long-term corporate finance objective is to maximize the availability and minimize the cost of the capital we employ to fund our operations. In pursuit of this objective and for other business reasons, we seek the broadest range of funding sources (including commercial banks, institutional lenders, equity and debt investors and joint venture partners) and funding vehicles (including mortgage loans, commercial loans, sales of properties or interests in properties, and debt and equity securities) available to us on the most favorable terms. We pursue this goal by maintaining relationships with various capital sources and utilizing a variety of financing instruments, all in an effort to enhance our flexibility to execute our business strategy in different economic environments or at different points in the business cycle.
 We have two wholly-owned property mortgage loans maturing in 2021. While mortgage interest rates remain relatively low, we intend to continue to seek to extend the maturity dates of our mortgage loans to the maximum extent possible, or to replace them with longer term mortgage loans. In February 2021, we amended our Woodland Mall mortgage loan to provide for an extension option, which will extend the maturity date to December 10, 2022. We intend to exercise this extension option. 
 As part of our capital strategy, in the past, we have taken steps to restructure our debt and credit facilities to align with our needs and goals at such time (including by implementing the Plan upon our emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases) and we intend to continue to evaluate our debt and credit facilities going forward. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Credit Agreements” for a detailed description of the terms of our Credit Agreements.
 In general, in determining the amount and type of debt capital to employ in our business, we consider several factors, including: general economic conditions, the capital market environment, prevailing and forecasted interest rates for various debt instruments, the cost of equity capital, property values, capitalization rates for mall properties, our financing needs for acquisition, redevelopment and development opportunities, the debt ratios of other mall REITs and publicly-traded real estate companies, and the federal tax law requirement that REITs distribute at least 90% of net taxable income, among other factors. 
 In the normal course of business, we are exposed to financial market risks, including interest rate risk on our interest-bearing liabilities. We attempt to limit these risks by following established risk management policies, procedures and strategies, including the use of various types of financial instruments. To manage interest rate risk and limit overall interest cost, we may employ interest rate swaps, options, forwards, caps and floors or a combination thereof depending on our underlying exposure, and subject to our ability to satisfy collateral requirements and the terms of our Credit Agreements.
 12

Capital Availability
 To maintain our status as a REIT, we are required, under federal tax laws, to distribute to shareholders 90% of our net taxable income, which generally leaves insufficient funds to finance major initiatives internally. Because of these requirements, we ordinarily fund most of our significant capital requirements through secured and unsecured indebtedness, sales of properties or interests in properties and, when appropriate, the issuance of additional debt, equity or equity-related securities. As described above, the terms of our Credit Agreements and the existing cumulative unpaid dividends on our preferred shares create significant limitations on our ability to raise capital, including in the capital markets.
 Aggregate borrowings under our $130.0 million First Lien Revolving Facility may be limited by the debt yield covenants included in our Credit Agreements. The maximum amount that was available to be borrowed by us under our First Lien Revolving Facility as of December 31, 2020 was $75.2 million. As of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, $54.8 million was outstanding under the First Lien Revolving Facility. 
 In addition, our ability to finance our growth using these sources depends, in part, on our creditworthiness, the availability of credit to us, the market for our securities at the time or times we need capital and prevailing conditions in the capital and credit markets, among other things. We believe that we will have adequate access to capital to fund the remaining cost of our redevelopment program, which we currently estimate to be $16.9 million. Our continued ability to borrow under the Credit Agreements and any other indebtedness that we have or may obtain will be subject to compliance with the covenants in the Credit Agreements or in the debt agreement governing such other indebtedness. These covenants impose restrictions that limit our ability to raise capital, including by requiring us to use cash proceeds from certain capital events to prepay our debt in certain circumstances. Furthermore, as a result of the existing cumulative unpaid dividends on our preferred shares and our bankruptcy filing, we are no longer able to register the offer and sale of securities on Form S-3. This creates additional limitations on our ability to raise capital in the capital markets, potentially increasing our costs of raising capital in the future.
 OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE
 We hold our interests in our portfolio of properties through our operating partnership, PREIT Associates, L.P. We are the sole general partner of PREIT Associates and, as of December 31, 2020, held a 97.5% controlling interest in PREIT Associates. We consolidate PREIT Associates for financial reporting purposes. We own our interests in our properties through various ownership structures, including partnerships and tenancy in common arrangements (collectively, “partnerships”). PREIT Associates’ direct or indirect economic interest in the properties ranges from 25% or 50% (for eight partnership properties) up to 100%. See “Item 2. Properties—Retail Properties.”
 We provide management, leasing and real estate development services through two of our subsidiaries: PREIT Services, LLC (“PREIT Services”), which generally develops and manages properties that we consolidate for financial reporting purposes, and PREIT-RUBIN, Inc. (“PRI”), which generally develops and manages properties that we do not consolidate for financial reporting purposes, including properties owned by partnerships in which we own an interest, and properties that are owned by third parties in which we do not have an interest. PREIT Services and PRI are consolidated. PRI is a taxable REIT subsidiary, as defined by federal tax laws, which means that it is able to offer additional services to tenants without jeopardizing our continuing qualification as a REIT under federal tax law.
 COMPETITION
 Competition in the retail real estate market is intense. We compete with other public and private retail real estate companies, including companies that own or manage malls, power centers, strip centers, lifestyle centers, factory outlet centers, theme/festival centers and community centers, as well as other commercial real estate developers and real estate owners, particularly those with properties near our properties, on the basis of several factors, including location and rent charged. We compete with these companies to attract customers to our properties, as well as to attract anchor and in-line stores and other tenants. Our malls and our other retail properties face competition from similar retail centers, including more recently developed or renovated centers that are near our retail properties. We also face competition from an increasing variety of different retail formats, including internet retailers, discount or value retailers, home shopping networks, mail order operators, catalogs, and telemarketers. Our tenants face competition from companies at the same and other properties and from other retail channels or formats as well, including internet retailers. This competition could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease space and on the amount of rent and expense reimbursements that we receive.
 The existence or development of competing retail properties and the related increased competition for tenants might, subject to the terms and conditions of our Credit Agreements, lead us to make capital improvements to properties that we would have deferred or would not have otherwise planned to make and might affect occupancy and net operating income of such properties. Any such capital improvements, undertaken individually or collectively, would involve costs and expenses that could adversely affect our results of operations.
 When we seek to make acquisitions, competitors (such as institutional investors, other REITs and other owner-operators of retail properties) might drive up the price we must pay for properties, parcels, other assets or other companies, or might themselves succeed in acquiring those properties, parcels, assets or companies. In addition, our potential acquisition targets might find our competitors to be more attractive suitors if they have greater resources, are willing to pay more, or have a more compatible operating philosophy. We might not succeed in acquiring retail properties or development sites that we seek, or, if we pay a higher price for a property or site, or generate lower cash flow from an acquired property or site than we expect, our investment returns will be reduced, which will adversely affect the value of our securities.
 GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS
 Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances, regulations and case law, an owner, former owner or operator of real estate might be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances present at, on, under, in or released from its property, regardless of whether the owner, operator or other responsible party knew of or was at fault for the release or presence of hazardous or toxic substances. Contamination might adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell or lease real estate or borrow with real estate as collateral. In connection with our ownership, operation, management, development and redevelopment of properties, or any other properties we acquire in the future, we might be liable under these laws and might incur costs in responding to these liabilities.
 13

Each of our retail properties has been subjected to a Phase I or similar environmental audit (which involves a visual property inspection and a review of records, but not soil sampling or ground water analysis) by environmental consultants. These audits have not revealed, and we are not aware of, any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. It is possible, however, that there are material environmental liabilities of which we are unaware.
 We are aware of certain past environmental matters at some of our properties. We have, in the past, investigated and, where we consider appropriate, performed remediation of such environmental matters, but we might be required in the future to perform testing relating to these matters or to satisfy requirements for further remediation, or we might incur liability as a result of such environmental matters. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Our Properties—We might incur costs to comply with environmental laws, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.”
 SUSTAINABILITY
 We strive to be socially and environmentally conscious. We now have the capacity to produce more than 8 million kilowatt hours of electricity per year from solar arrays at five of our properties. The annual environmental benefit accrued through the production of renewable energy at these five properties is equivalent to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from more than 1,200 passenger vehicles. During 2020, we completed an LED retrofit at Dartmouth Mall which is expected to reduce our kilowatt hour usage by approximately 467,000 hours. We also currently offer electric vehicle charging stations at five of our properties.
HUMAN CAPITAL
 As of December 31, 2020, we had 175 employees at our properties and in our corporate office. 
 Our key human capital management objectives are to attract, retain and develop the highest quality talent to enhance our mission of enriching communities through the built environment. To support these objectives, our human resources programs are designed to: reward and support employees through competitive pay, benefits, and perquisite programs; enhance the Company’s culture through efforts aimed at making the workplace more engaging and inclusive; acquire and develop talent and facilitate internal talent mobility; and evolve and invest in technology, tools, and other resources for our employees. 
 We embrace diversity as valuable to a well-functioning company and provide equal opportunities without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, age, sexual orientation, gender/gender identity, disability, status as a protected veteran, or any other characteristic protected by applicable federal, state and local laws. We also endeavor to maintain workplaces that are free from discrimination or harassment on the basis of any such status or characteristic. In 2020, we hosted a black-owned business showcase at Woodland Mall and endeavor to host several similar showcases throughout our portfolio in the future due to the positive response.
 Our compensation program is designed to attract and retain talent. We continually assess and strive to enhance employee satisfaction and engagement, including by conducting an annual culture survey to engage employees and identify opportunities for improvement. Our employees, many of whom have a long tenure with the Company, frequently express satisfaction with management. Our employees are offered regular opportunities to participate in professional development programs, including tuition reimbursement, continuing education reimbursement, and leadership training. During December 2019, we relocated our corporate headquarters to an office that is designed to create a better sense of place and pride and to cultivate a more collaborative work environment.
 The health and safety of our employees is a high priority, in particular during the COVID-19 pandemic. In protecting our employees’ safety, we have invested in creating safe work environments for our employees by taking additional measures such as additional work from home flexibility, increased cleaning protocols, mask wearing in our corporate office and at our properties and enhanced communication and engagement regarding Company responses to the pandemic. We also offer wellness initiatives for our employees, such as Wholebeing programs on demand.
 Additionally, we are committed to sustainability and giving back to the communities in which we operate. In 2020, our properties supported several charitable organizations, hosting blood and food drives, among other community-facing initiatives, in response to the pandemic. Our corporate giving program raised funds and awareness for various charitable and non-profit organizations. 
 As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic disruption, together with the preexisting economic challenges facing the retail industry, the Company implemented reductions-in-force and unpaid furloughs in 2020. In order to attempt to ease the effects of such actions, the Company extended health insurance to furloughed employees for certain periods and encouraged use of the Company’s existing wellness and mental health services through its employee assistance program. The Company has since brought furloughed employees back to full pay.
 None of our employees are unionized or covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we consider our current employee relations to be good. 
 INSURANCE
 We have comprehensive liability, fire, flood, cyber liability, terrorism, extended coverage and rental loss insurance that we believe is adequate and consistent with the level of coverage that is standard in our industry. We cannot be assured, however, that our insurance coverage will be adequate to protect against a loss of our invested capital or anticipated profits, or that we will be able to obtain adequate coverage at a reasonable cost in the future.
 14

STATUS AS A REIT
 We conduct our operations in a manner intended to maintain our qualification as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Generally, as a REIT, we will not be subject to federal or state income taxes on our net taxable income that we currently distribute to our shareholders. Our qualification and taxation as a REIT depend on our ability to meet various qualification tests (including dividend distribution, asset ownership and income tests) and certain share ownership requirements prescribed in the Internal Revenue Code.
CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS
 Our principal executive offices are currently located at One Commerce Square, 2005 Market Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19103. In December 2018, we entered into a lease for this office space with Brandywine Realty Trust. Our lead independent trustee is also a trustee of Brandywine Realty Trust. The lease commenced in late December 2019 and our corporate office opened on January 2, 2020 at the One Commerce Square location. Our principal executive offices during 2019 were located at The Bellevue, 200 South Broad Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19102. We had leased our principal executive offices from Bellevue Associates, an entity that is owned by Ronald Rubin, one of our former trustees, collectively with members of his immediate family and affiliated entities.
SEASONALITY
 There is seasonality in the retail real estate industry. Retail property leases often provide for the payment of all or a portion of rent based on a percentage of a tenant’s sales revenue, or sales revenue over certain levels. Income from such rent is recorded only after the minimum sales levels have been met. The sales levels are often met in the fourth quarter, during the November and December holiday season. Also, many new and temporary leases are entered into later in the year in anticipation of the holiday season and a higher number of tenants vacate their space early in the year. As a result, our occupancy and cash flows are generally higher in the fourth quarter and lower in the first and second quarters. Our concentration in the retail sector increases our exposure to seasonality and has resulted, and is expected to continue to result, in a greater percentage of our cash flows being received in the fourth quarter.
