(a) | General Development of Business
----+--------------------------------

Spin-Off of Liberty Broadband from Liberty Media Corporation
 During May 2014, the board of directors of Liberty Media Corporation and its subsidiaries (“Liberty”) authorized management to pursue a plan to spin-off to its stockholders common stock of a wholly-owned subsidiary, Liberty Broadband Corporation (“Liberty Broadband”), and to distribute subscription rights to acquire shares of Liberty Broadband’s common stock (the “Broadband Spin-Off”). At the time of the Broadband Spin-Off, Liberty Broadband was comprised of, (i) Liberty’s former interest in Charter Communications, Inc. (“Legacy Charter”), (ii) Liberty’s former wholly-owned subsidiary TruePosition, Inc. (“TruePosition”), (iii) Liberty’s former minority equity investment in Time Warner Cable, Inc. (“Time Warner Cable”, “TWC”, “Legacy Time Warner” or “Legacy TWC”), (iv) certain deferred tax liabilities, as well as liabilities related to the Time Warner Cable written call options and (v) initial indebtedness, pursuant to margin loans entered into prior to the completion of the Broadband Spin-Off. The Broadband Spin-Off was accounted for at historical cost due to the pro rata nature of the distribution to holders of Liberty common stock. 
 In the Broadband Spin-Off, record holders of Liberty’s Series A, Series B and Series C common stock received one-fourth of a share of the corresponding series of Liberty Broadband common stock for each share of Liberty common stock held by them, with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares. In addition, following the completion of the Broadband Spin-Off, on December 10, 2014, stockholders received a subscription right to acquire one share of Liberty Broadband Series C common stock for every five shares of Liberty Broadband common stock they held at a per share subscription price of $40.36, which was a 20% discount to the 20-trading day volume weighted average trading price of the Liberty Broadband Series C common stock following the completion of the Broadband Spin-Off. The rights offering was fully subscribed on January 9, 2015, with 17,277,224 shares of Series C common stock issued to those rightsholders exercising basic and, as applicable, oversubscription privileges. The subscription rights were issued to raise capital for general corporate purposes of Liberty Broadband. The Broadband Spin-Off and rights offering were intended to be tax-free to stockholders of Liberty and Liberty Broadband, respectively. During September 2015, Liberty entered into a closing agreement with the IRS which provided that the Broadband Spin-Off qualified for tax-free treatment. 
 Following the Broadband Spin-Off, Liberty and Liberty Broadband operate as separate, publicly traded companies, and neither has any stock ownership, beneficial or otherwise, in the other. In connection with the Broadband Spin-Off, Liberty and Liberty Broadband entered into certain agreements in order to govern certain of the ongoing relationships between the two companies after the Broadband Spin-Off and to provide for an orderly transition. These agreements include a reorganization agreement, a services agreement, a facilities sharing agreement and a tax sharing agreement.
 The reorganization agreement provides for, among other things, the principal corporate transactions (including the internal restructuring) required to effect the Broadband Spin-Off, certain conditions to the Broadband Spin-Off and provisions governing the relationship between Liberty Broadband and Liberty with respect to and resulting from the Broadband Spin-Off. The tax sharing agreement provides for the allocation and indemnification of tax liabilities and benefits between Liberty and Liberty Broadband and other agreements related to tax matters. Pursuant to the tax sharing agreement, Liberty Broadband has agreed to indemnify Liberty, subject to certain limited exceptions, for losses and taxes resulting from the Broadband Spin-Off to the extent such losses or taxes result primarily from, individually or in the aggregate, the breach of certain restrictive covenants made by Liberty Broadband (applicable to actions or failures to act by Liberty Broadband and its subsidiaries following the completion of the Broadband Spin-Off). Pursuant to the services agreement, Liberty provides Liberty Broadband with general and administrative services including legal, tax, accounting, treasury and investor relations support. Under the facilities sharing agreement, Liberty Broadband shares office space with Liberty and related amenities at Liberty’s corporate headquarters. Liberty Broadband will reimburse Liberty for direct, out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Liberty in providing these services and for costs that will be negotiated semi-annually.
 Charter’s Time Warner Cable Merger and Bright House Transaction 
 On May 18, 2016, Time Warner Cable merged with Legacy Charter (the “Time Warner Cable Merger”). In connection with the Time Warner Cable Merger, Legacy Charter underwent a corporate reorganization, resulting in CCH I, LLC, a former subsidiary of Legacy Charter (“Charter”), becoming the new publicly traded parent company. Also on May 18, 2016, the previously announced acquisition of Bright House Networks, LLC (“Bright House” or “Legacy Bright House”) from 

 
  I-2

 
Advance/Newhouse Partnership (“A/N”) by Charter (the “Bright House Transaction”) was completed. In connection with the Time Warner Cable Merger and Bright House Transaction, Liberty Broadband entered into certain agreements with Legacy Charter, Charter, Liberty Interactive Corporation (“Liberty Interactive”) and Time Warner Cable. In connection with the Time Warner Cable Merger and Bright House Transaction (collectively, the “Transactions”), Liberty Broadband exchanged its shares of Time Warner Cable for shares of Charter and purchased additional shares of Charter. As a result, and pursuant to proxy agreements entered into with Liberty Interactive and A/N, Liberty Broadband controls 25.01% of the aggregate voting power of Charter.

(b)Financial Information About Operating Segments
 Through our ownership of interests in subsidiaries and other companies, we are primarily engaged in the cable, broadband, and mobile location technology industries.  Each of these businesses is separately managed.
 We identify our reportable segments as (A) those consolidated subsidiaries that represent 10% or more of our annual consolidated revenue, Adjusted OIBDA or total assets and (B) those equity method affiliates whose share of earnings represent 10% or more of our annual pre-tax earnings.  Financial information related to our operating segments can be found in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements found in Part II of this report.

(c)Narrative Description of Business 

Charter Communications, Inc.

Introduction 
 Charter is the second largest cable operator in the United States and a leading broadband communications services company providing video, Internet and voice services to approximately 26.2 million residential and business customers at December 31, 2016. In addition, Charter sells video and online advertising inventory to local, regional and national advertising customers; and fiber-delivered communications and managed information technology (“IT”) solutions to larger enterprise customers. 
     Charter also owns and operates regional sports networks and local sports, news and lifestyle channels and sells security and home management services to the residential marketplace. Charter’s core strategy is to deliver high quality products at competitive prices, combined with outstanding service. This strategy, combined with simple, easy to understand pricing and packaging, is central to Charter’s goal of growing its customer base while also selling more individual services to each customer. Charter expects to execute this strategy by managing its operations in a consumer friendly, efficient and cost effective manner. Charter's operating strategy includes insourcing much of its customer care and field operations workforce which results in higher quality service transactions. While an insourced operating model can increase field operations and customer care costs associated with each service transaction, the higher quality nature of each service transaction significantly reduces the volume of service transactions per customer, more than offsetting the higher investment made in each service transaction. As Charter reduces the number of service transactions and recurring costs per customer relationship, Charter effectively passes those savings on to customers in the form of products and prices, that the company believes, are more cost effective than what its competitors offer. The combination of offering competitively priced products and high quality service, allows Charter to increase the number of customer relationships over a fixed network and products sold per relationship, while at the same time reducing the number of service transactions per relationship, improving customer satisfaction and reducing churn, which results in lower costs to acquire and serve customers. Ultimately, this operating strategy enables Charter to offer high quality, competitively priced services profitably, while continuing to invest in new products and services.
     Time Warner Cable Merger
     On May 18, 2016, the previously announced Time Warner Cable Merger was completed, which resulted in Legacy Charter and TWC becoming wholly owned subsidiaries of Charter, which was a wholly owned subsidiary of Legacy Charter at the time. As a result of the Time Warner Cable Merger, Charter became the new public parent company that holds the operations of the combined companies and was renamed Charter Communications, Inc. Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, upon consummation of the Time Warner Cable Merger, 285 million outstanding shares of TWC common stock were converted into 143 million shares of Charter Class A common stock valued at approximately $32 billion as of the date of acquisition. In addition, TWC shareholders (excluding Liberty Broadband and Liberty Interactive) received approximately $28 billion in cash. As of May 18, 2016, the total value of the Time Warner Cable Merger was approximately $85 billion, including cash, equity and TWC assumed debt. The purchase price also includes an estimated pre-combination vesting period fair value of $514 million for equity awards converted into Charter awards upon closing of the Time Warner Cable Merger and $69 million of cash paid to former TWC employees and non-employee directors who held equity awards, whether vested or not vested.

 Bright House Transaction
 Also, on May 18, 2016, Charter and A/N completed the previously announced Bright House Transaction, pursuant to a definitive Contribution Agreement. Pursuant to the Bright House Transaction, Charter became the owner of the membership interests in Bright House and the other assets primarily related to Bright House (other than certain excluded assets and liabilities and non-operating cash). As of the date of acquisition, the purchase price totaled approximately $12.2 billion consisting of (a) $2 billion in cash, (b) 25 million convertible preferred units of Charter Communications Holdings, LLC (“Charter Holdings”) with a face amount of $2.5 billion that pay a 6% annual preferential dividend, (c) approximately 31.0 million common units of Charter Holdings that are exchangeable into Charter Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis and (d) one share of Charter Class B common stock. Liberty Broadband Transactions 
 In connection with the Time Warner Cable Merger, Charter and Liberty Broadband completed their previously announced transactions pursuant to their investment agreement, in which Liberty Broadband purchased for cash approximately 22.0 million shares of Charter Class A common stock valued at $4.3 billion at the closing of the Time Warner Cable Merger to partially finance the cash portion of the Time Warner Cable Merger consideration. In connection with the Bright House Transaction, Liberty Broadband purchased approximately 3.7 million shares of Charter Class A common stock valued at $700 million at the closing of the Bright House Transaction. See note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information on the Transactions. Products and Services
 Charter offers its customers subscription-based video services, including video on demand (“VOD”), high definition (“HD”) television, and digital video recorder (“DVR”) service, Internet services and voice services. As of December 31, 2016, 70% of Charter’s footprint was all-digital, enabling Charter to offer more HD channels, faster Internet speeds and better video picture quality and the company intends to transition the remaining portions of its Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House footprints. Charter’s video, Internet, and voice services are offered to residential and commercial customers on a subscription basis, with prices and related charges based on the types of service selected, whether the services are sold as a “bundle” or on an individual basis, and the equipment necessary to receive Charter’s services. Bundled services are available to approximately 99% of Charter’s passings, and approximately 61% of Charter’s customers subscribe to a bundle of services.

     Residential Services

Video Services

Charter’s video customers receive a package of basic programming which, in their all-digital markets, includes a digital set-top box that provides an interactive electronic programming guide with parental controls, access to pay-per-view services, including VOD (available to nearly all of their passings), digital music channels and the option to view certain video services on third party devices. Customers have the option to purchase additional tiers of services including premium channels which provide original programming, commercial-free movies, sports, and other special event entertainment programming. Substantially all of Charter’s video programming is available in HD.
     In most areas, Charter offers VOD service which allows customers to select from approximately 30,000 titles at any time. VOD includes standard definition, HD and three dimensional content. VOD programming options may be accessed for free if the content is associated with a customer’s linear subscription, or for a fee on a transactional basis. VOD services are also offered on a subscription basis included in a digital tier premium channel subscription or for a monthly fee. Pay-per-view channels allow customers to pay on a per-event basis to view a single showing of a one-time special sporting event, music concert, or similar event on a commercial-free basis.
     Charter’s goal is to provide its video customers with the programming they want, when they want it, on any device. DVR service enables customers to digitally record programming and to pause and rewind live programming. Customers can also use the Charter TV applications available on portable devices, streaming devices and on Charter’s websites to watch up to 300 channels of cable TV, view VOD programming, remotely control digital set-top boxes while in the home and to program DVRs remotely. Charter intends to consolidate the various legacy entity TV applications into a single Spectrum TV Application in 2017. Customers also have access to programmer authenticated applications and websites such as HBO Go®, Fox Now®, Discovery Go® and WatchESPN®.
     In certain markets, Charter has launched Spectrum Guide®, a network or “cloud-based” user interface that runs on traditional set-top boxes, with a look and feel that is similar to that of the Spectrum TV App. Spectrum Guide® is designed to enable Charter’s customers to enjoy a state-of-the-art video experience on set-top boxes, regardless of the age of the set-top box. The guide enables customers to find video content more easily across cable TV channels and VOD options. Charter plans to continue to deploy across its footprint and enhance this technology in 2017 and beyond.
 Internet Services

Approximately 99% of Charter’s estimated passings are enabled for DOCSIS 3.0 wideband technology, allowing Charter to offer residential customers multiple tiers of Internet services with currently marketed download speeds of up to 300 megabits per second (“Mbps”). In nearly every market where Charter has launched Spectrum pricing and packaging (“SPP”), its entry level Internet download speed offering is 60 or 100 Mbps which, among other things, allows several people within a single household to stream HD video content online while simultaneously using Internet service for non-video purposes. As Charter rolls out SPP in Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House markets, it will bring base speed offerings to a standard minimum of 60 or 100 Mbps at uniform pricing without any usage-based pricing data caps, modem fees or early termination fees. Finally, Charter offers a security suite with their Internet services which, upon installation by customers, provides protection against computer viruses and spyware and includes parental control features.

Charter offers an in-home Wi-Fi product that permits customers to lease high performance wireless routers to maximize their in-home wireless Internet experience. Additionally, they offer an out-of-home Wi-Fi service in most of their footprint to Internet customers at designated “hot spots.” In 2017, Charter expects to expand Wi-Fi accessibility to its customers both inside and outside of its legacy entity footprints.

Voice Services

Charter provides voice communications services using voice over Internet protocol (“VoIP”) technology to transmit digital voice signals over its network. Charter’s voice services include unlimited local and long distance calling to the United 

 
  I-8

 
States, Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico, voicemail, call waiting, caller ID, call forwarding and other features and offers international calling either by the minute, or through packages of minutes per month. For customers that subscribe to both voice and video offerings, caller ID on TV is also available in most areas.

Other Residential Services

Charter is continually engaging in product research and development and other opportunities to expand its services including the activation of its Mobile Virtual Network Operator (“MVNO”) agreement with Verizon which would enable Charter to offer mobile services. The activation of Charter’s MVNO with Verizon does not, however, represent an obligation for Charter to offer mobile services.Commercial Services

Charter offers scalable broadband communications solutions for businesses and carrier organizations of all sizes, selling Internet access, data networking, fiber connectivity to cellular towers and office buildings, video entertainment services and business telephone services.Small and Medium Business

As Spectrum Business, Charter offers video, Internet and voice services to small and medium businesses over its coaxial network that are similar to those that Charter provides to its residential customers. Spectrum Business includes a full range of video programming and music services and Internet speeds of up to 100 Mbps downstream, 300 Mbps in certain markets, and up to 20 Mbps upstream in its DOCSIS 3.0 markets. Spectrum Business also includes a set of business services including web hosting, e-mail and security, and multi-line telephone services with more than 30 business features including web-based service management. Enterprise Solutions  

As Spectrum Enterprise, Charter offers fiber-delivered communications and managed IT solutions to larger businesses, as well as high-capacity last-mile data connectivity services to wireless and wireline carriers, Internet Service Providers and other competitive carriers on a wholesale basis. More specifically, Spectrum Enterprise’s portfolio includes fiber Internet access with symmetrical speeds up to 10 gigabits per second (“Gbps”), voice trunking services such as Primary Rate Interface (“PRI”) and Session Initiation Protocol (“SIP”) Trunks, Ethernet services that privately and securely connect geographically dispersed client locations with speeds up to 10 Gbps, and video solutions designed to meet the needs of the hospitality, education, and health care clients. Charter’s managed IT portfolio includes Cloud Infrastructure as a Service and Cloud Desktop as a Service, and managed hosting, application, and messaging solutions, along with other related IT and professional services. The Transactions have provided Charter with a larger footprint which allows Charter to more effectively serve business customers with multiple sites across given geographic regions. These customers can benefit from obtaining these advanced services from a single provider simplifying procurement and potentially reducing their costs.Advertising Services
 Charter’s advertising sales division, Spectrum Reach®, offers local, regional and national businesses with the opportunity to advertise in individual and multiple markets on cable television networks. Charter receives revenues from the sale of local advertising on digital advertising networks and satellite-delivered networks such as MTV®, CNN® and ESPN®. In any particular market, Charter typically inserts local advertising on over 50 channels. Since completion of the Transactions, Charter’s larger footprint has increased opportunities for advertising customers to address broader regional audiences from a single provider and thus reach more customers with a single transaction. Charter’s increased size provides scale to invest in new technology to create more targeted and interactive advertising capabilities.
     Available advertising time is generally sold by Charter’s advertising sales force. In some markets, Charter has formed advertising interconnects or entered into representation agreements with other video distributors, including, among others, Verizon Communications Inc.’s (“Verizon”) fiber optic service (“FiOS”) and AT&T Inc.’s (“AT&T”) U-verse, under which Charter sells advertising on behalf of those operators. In some markets, Charter enters into representation agreements under which 

 
  I-9

 
another operator in the area will sell advertising on its behalf. These arrangements enable Charter and its partners to deliver linear commercials across wider geographic areas, replicating the reach of local broadcast television stations to the extent possible. In addition, Charter, together with Comcast Corporation (“Comcast”) and Cox Communications, Inc., owns National Cable Communications LLC, which, on behalf of a number of video operators, sells advertising time to national and regional advertisers.
     Charter also sells the advertising inventory of its owned and operated local sports, news and lifestyle channels, and advertising inventory on its regional sports networks that carry Los Angeles Lakers’ basketball games and other sports programming and on SportsNet LA, a regional sports network that carries Los Angeles Dodgers’ baseball games and other sports programing. Charter has deployed advanced advertising products such as interactivity, household addressability, dynamic ad insertion into VOD and data infused advertising campaigns within various parts of its footprint. These new products will be distributed across more of Charter’s footprint in 2017.
     Other Services
     Regional Sports and News Networks
     Charter has an agreement with the Los Angeles Lakers for rights to distribute all locally available pre-season, regular season and post-season Los Angeles Lakers’ games through 2033. Charter broadcasts those games on its regional sports network, Spectrum SportsNet. As of December 31, 2016, Spectrum SportsNet was distributed to approximately 4.7 million multichannel video customers via the majority of major multichannel video distributors in Charter’s Southern California, Las Vegas, Nevada and Hawaii regions.
     Charter also manages 36 local news channels, including Spectrum News NY1, a 24-hour news channel focused on New York City, 20 local sports channels and three local lifestyle community channels, and it owns 26.8% of Sterling Entertainment Enterprises, LLC (doing business as SportsNet New York), a New York City-based regional sports network that carries New York Mets’ baseball games as well as other regional sports programming.
     American Media Productions, LLC ("American Media Productions"), an unaffiliated third party, owns SportsNet LA, a regional sports network carrying the Los Angeles Dodgers’ baseball games and other sports programming. In accordance with agreements with American Media Productions, Charter acts as the network’s exclusive affiliate and advertising sales representative and has certain branding and programming rights with respect to the network. In addition, Charter provides certain production and technical services to American Media Productions. The affiliate, advertising, production and programming agreements continue through 2038. Charter continues to seek distribution agreements for the carriage of SportsNet LA by other major distributors.
     Security and Home Management
     Charter also provides security and home management services to its residential customers in certain markets. Charter’s broadband cable system connects the customer’s in-home system to Charter’s emergency response center. In addition to providing traditional security, fire and medical emergency monitoring and dispatch, the service allows customers to remotely arm or disarm their security system, monitor their home via indoor and outdoor cameras, and remotely operate key home functions, including setting and controlling lights, thermostats and door locks. Pricing of Charter’s Products and Services
 Charter’s revenues are principally derived from the monthly fees customers pay for the services Charter provides. Charter typically charges a one-time installation fee which is sometimes waived or discounted in certain sales channels during certain promotional periods.

 Charter’s SPP offers a standardized price for each tier of service, bundle of services, and add-on service, regardless of market and emphasizes triple play bundles of video, Internet and voice services. Charter’s most popular and competitive services are combined in core packages at what it believes are attractive prices. Charter began launching SPP in the Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House footprints in the third quarter of 2016, and expects to offer SPP in all markets by the middle of 2017. Charter believes its approach:

  Charter’s Network Technology and Customer Premise Equipment
 Charter’s network includes three key components: a national backbone, regional/metro networks and the “last-mile” network. Both its national backbone and regional/metro network components utilize a redundant IP ring/mesh architecture. The national backbone component provides connectivity from the regional demarcation points to nationally centralized content, connectivity and services. The regional/metro network components provide connectivity between the regional demarcation points and headends within a specific geographic area and enable the delivery of content and services between these network components.
     Charter’s last-mile network utilizes a hybrid fiber coaxial cable (“HFC”) architecture, which combines the use of fiber optic cable with coaxial cable. In most systems, Charter delivers its signals via fiber optic cable from the headend to a group of nodes, and uses coaxial cable to deliver the signal from individual nodes to the homes served by that node. For Charter’s fiber Internet, Ethernet, carrier wholesale, SIP and PRI Spectrum Enterprise customers, fiber optic cable is extended from the individual nodes to the customer’s site. For certain new build and MDU sites, Charter increasingly brings fiber all the way to the customer site. Charter’s design standard is six strands of fiber to each node, with two strands activated and four strands reserved for spares and future services. This design standard allows these strands to be utilized for additional residential traffic capacity, and enterprise customer needs as they arise.
     Charter believes that this hybrid network design provides high capacity and signal quality. The design also provides two-way signal capabilities for the support of interactive services.
     HFC architecture benefits include:
    
· | bandwidth capacity to enable traditional and two-way video and broadband services;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | dedicated bandwidth for two-way services; and
--+----------------------------------------------


· | signal quality and high service reliability.
--+---------------------------------------------

      Approximately 98% of estimated passings are served by systems that have bandwidth of 750 megahertz or greater as of December 31, 2016. This bandwidth capacity enables Charter to offer HD television, DOCSIS-based Internet services and voice services.
     An all-digital platform enables Charter to offer a larger selection of HD channels, faster Internet speeds and better picture quality while providing greater plant security and enabling lower installation and disconnect service truck rolls. Charter is currently all-digital in 70% of its footprint and intends to transition the remaining portions of its Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House footprints.
     Charter has been introducing its new set-top box, WorldBox, to consumers in certain markets. The WorldBox design has opened the set-top box market to new vendors and reduced Charter’s set-top box costs. The WorldBox also includes more advanced features and functionality than older set-top boxes, including faster processing times, IP capabilities with increased speeds, additional simultaneous recordings, increased DVR storage capacity, and a greater degree of flexibility for consumers to take Charter-provisioned set-top boxes with them, if and when, they move residences. Charter has also been introducing its new cloud-based user interface, Spectrum Guide®, to its video customers in certain markets. Spectrum Guide® improves video 

 
  I-11

 
content search and discovery, and fully enables Charter’s on-demand offering. In addition, Spectrum Guide® can function on nearly all of Legacy Charter’s deployed set-tops, reducing costs and customer disruption to swap equipment for new functionality.

Management, Customer Care and Marketing

Charter’s operations are centralized, with senior executives located at several key corporate offices, responsible for coordinating and overseeing operations including establishing company-wide strategies, policies and procedures. Sales and marketing, network operations, field operations, customer operations, engineering, advertising sales, human resources, legal, government relations, information technology and finance are all directed at the corporate level. Regional and local field operations are responsible for on-site service transactions with customers and maintaining and constructing that portion of Charter’s network which is located outdoors. In 2017, Charter’s field operations group will focus on standardizing practices, processes, procedures and metrics, including those used to assure the quality of work performed when servicing customers. 
     Charter continues to focus on improving the customer experience through enhanced product offerings, reliability of services, and delivery of quality customer service. As part of Charter’s operating strategy, Charter is committed to investments and hiring plans that will insource most of its customer service workload over the next few years. Charter intends to bring the Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House customer operations workload, much of which are outsourced offshore, back to the United States. Most of these repatriated jobs will be fully insourced and will increase Charter’s full time labor force. Charter is currently constructing a new call center in McAllen, Texas which will solely serve customers who prefer to engage with us in Spanish, resulting in the creation of new jobs. This new facility will be operational and taking calls in 2017. 
     Legacy Charter’s in-house domestic call centers currently handle approximately 90% of calls centrally to ensure a consistent, high quality customer experience. On a consolidated basis, in-house domestic call centers handle just over 60% of Charter’s customer service calls. Over a multi-year period, however, Charter plans to migrate Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House customer service centers to Legacy Charter’s model of using segmented, virtualized, U.S.-based in-house call centers. Segmented, virtualized call centers allow calls to be routed to agents across Charter’s footprint based on call type, enabling agents to be experts in addressing specific customer needs, thus creating a better customer experience. Legacy Charter’s inbound sales, billing, service and retention call centers are also virtualized and segmented by call-type. A new call center agent desktop interface tool already used at Legacy Charter is being developed for the acquired systems. This new desktop interface tool and will enable virtualization of all call centers, regardless of the legacy billing platform, to better serve its customers.
     Charter also provides customers with the opportunity to interact with the company through a variety of forums in addition to telephonic communications, including through its customer website, mobile device applications, online chat, and via social media. Charter’s customer websites and mobile applications enable customers to pay their bills, manage their accounts, order new services and utilize self-service help and support.
     Charter sells its residential and commercial services using a national brand platform known as Spectrum®, Spectrum Business® and Spectrum Enterprise®. These brands reflect Charter’s comprehensive approach to industry-leading products, driven by speed, performance and innovation. Charter’s marketing strategy emphasizes the sale of its bundled services through targeted direct response marketing programs to existing and potential customers and increases awareness and the value of the Spectrum brand. Charter’s marketing organization creates and executes marketing programs intended to grow customer relationships, increase services per relationship, retain existing customers and cross-sell additional products to current customers. Charter monitors the effectiveness of its marketing efforts, customer perception, competition, pricing, and service preferences, among other factors, in order to increase its responsiveness to customers and to improve sales and customer retention. Charter’s marketing organization also manages and directs several sales channels including direct sales, on-line, outbound telemarketing and stores.
 Programming
 Charter believes that offering a wide variety of video programming choices influences a customer’s decision to subscribe and retain its cable video services. Charter obtains basic and premium programming, usually pursuant to written contracts, from a number of suppliers although media consolidation has resulted in fewer suppliers and additional selling power on the part of programmer suppliers. Charter’s programming contracts generally continue for a fixed period of time, usually for multiple years, and are subject to negotiated renewal.
    
 
  I-12

 

 Programming is usually made available to Charter for a license fee, which is generally paid based on the number of customers to whom they make that programming available. Programming license fees may include “volume” discounts and financial incentives to support the launch of a channel and/or ongoing marketing support, as well as discounts for channel placement or service penetration. For home shopping channels, Charter typically receives a percentage of the revenue attributable to its customers’ purchases. Charter also offers VOD and pay per view channels of movies and events that are subject to a revenue split with the content provider.
     Charter’s programming costs have increased in excess of customary inflationary and cost-of-living type increases. Charter expects programming costs to continue to increase due to a variety of factors including, annual increases pursuant to Charter’s programming contracts, contract renewals with programmers and the carriage of incremental programming, including new services and VOD programming. Increases in the cost of sports programming and the amounts paid for broadcast station retransmission consent have been the largest contributors to the growth in Charter’s programming costs over the last few years. Additionally, the demands of large media companies who link carriage of their most popular networks to carriage and cost increases of their less popular networks, has limited Charter’s flexibility in creating more tailored and cost-sensitive programming packages for consumers. Finally, programmers have experienced declines in demand for advertising as advertisers shift more of their marketing spend online. Charter believes that this is resulting in programmers demanding higher programming fees, as they seek to recover revenue they are losing to online advertising.
     Federal law allows commercial television broadcast stations to make an election between “must-carry” rights and an alternative “retransmission-consent” regime. When a station opts for the retransmission-consent regime, Charter is not allowed to carry the station’s signal without that station’s permission. Continuing demands by owners of broadcast stations for cash payments at substantial increases over amounts paid in prior years in exchange for retransmission consent will increase Charter’s programming costs or require Charter to cease carriage of popular programming, potentially leading to a loss of customers in affected markets.
     Over the past several years, increases in Charter’s video service rates have not fully offset increasing programming costs, and with the impact of increasing competition and other marketplace factors, Charter does not expect them to do so in the foreseeable future. Although Charter passes along a portion of amounts paid for retransmission consent to the majority of its customers, Charter’s inability to fully pass programming cost increases on to its video customers has had, and is expected in the future to have, an adverse impact on Charter’s cash flow and operating margins associated with its video product. In order to mitigate reductions of Charter’s operating margins due to rapidly increasing programming costs, Charter continues to review its pricing and programming packaging strategies.
     Charter has programming contracts that have expired and others that will expire at or before the end of 2017. Charter will seek to renegotiate the terms of these agreements. There can be no assurance that these agreements will be renewed on favorable or comparable terms. To the extent that Charter is unable to reach agreements with certain programmers on terms that Charter believes are reasonable, Charter has been, and may in the future be, forced to remove such programming channels from its line-up, which may result in a loss of customers.
     Markets
     Charter operates in geographically diverse areas which are organized in regional clusters. These markets are managed centrally on a consolidated level. Charter’s 11 regions and the customer relationships within each region as of December 31, 2016 are as follows (in thousands):
 | Total 
 | Customer 
Regions | Relationships
Carolinas | 2,609 
Central | 2,800

Ownership Interests
 We own an approximate 20% ownership interest in Charter, based on shares of Charter’s Class A common stock issued and outstanding as of December 28, 2016, and, pursuant to proxy agreements entered into with Liberty Interactive and A/N, control 25.01% of the aggregate voting power of Charter. Upon the closing of the Time Warner Cable Merger, the Second Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement, dated as of May 23, 2015, by and among Legacy Charter, Charter, Liberty Broadband and A/N, as amended (the “Stockholders Agreement”), became fully effective.  Under the Stockholders Agreement, we have the right to designate three directors to the Charter board of directors, subject to certain exclusions and requirements. Charter has agreed to cause the appointment of at least one of our designees to serve on the nominating and corporate governance, finance, audit and compensation and benefits committees of the board, provided they meet the independence and other qualifications for membership on those committees.Skyhook
 Skyhook Holding, Inc. (formerly known as TruePosition, Inc.) was originally incorporated on November 24, 1992 to provide technology for locating wireless phones and other mobile devices. Skyhook Holding, Inc.’s location offering was a passive network overlay system using its patented U-TDOA technology (“U-TDOA service”) and was used primarily to provide E-9-1-1 services domestically and to enhance services in support of commercial applications, national security and law enforcement worldwide. In February 2014, Skyhook Holding, Inc. acquired Skyhook Wireless, Inc., which operates a global location network containing billions of geolocated Wi-Fi access points (“Wi-Fi location software solution”) and cell towers that serve as the reference infrastructure for providing location services.  Skyhook Wireless, Inc.’s Wi-Fi location software solution determines the location of a wireless device by matching received Wi-Fi or cellular signals to the known locations of access points and cell towers contained in a proprietary database maintained by Skyhook Wireless, Inc. These Wi-Fi location software solutions are used primarily by mobile device makers, wireless carriers, and asset tracking platforms to understand the precise geographic location and movement of a mobile device.  In addition to Wi-Fi location software solutions, Skyhook (as defined below) also provides location-based context services that provide not just the precise latitude and longitude of a given mobile device, but also the real world context of that location. For example, Skyhook can provide customers with an understanding of the type of location (e.g., a fast-food restaurant or an airport), the ability to provide notifications and triggers upon the entry or exit of a device from a pre-defined location, and insights based on historical device locations. These location-based context solutions provide a way for application developers, enterprises, and advertisers to understand consumers’ mobile behavior and to improve their user experience, while also providing companies with the ability to reach and measure their audiences in new and relevant ways.
 In 2015, one of Skyhook Holding, Inc.’s customers, a wireless carrier utilizing the legacy U-TDOA service which accounted for approximately 80% - 90% of consolidated revenue at the time, gave notice that it planned to discontinue use of the U-TDOA service and did not intend to renew its contract, which expired on December 31, 2015. The loss of this customer had a material adverse effect on Skyhook Holding, Inc.’s business. As a result of the loss of this wireless carrier customer, further changes in the regulatory environment and a shift in the overall market for the legacy U-TDOA service, Skyhook Holding, Inc. ceased making further investment in its U-TDOA products. In 2016, Skyhook Holding, Inc. and Skyhook Wireless, Inc. combined operations in order to focus on the development and sale of the suite of location and context products, and are referred to collectively herein as “Skyhook.”  
 For both its location and context solutions, Skyhook earns revenue from device makers, application providers, enterprises and advertising companies through the integration of Skyhook’s software and technology, the provision of location services and via the sale of data. Skyhook also earns revenue through entering into licensing agreements with companies to utilize its intellectual property. Although the revenue generated from license agreements has thus far been one-time in nature, Skyhook anticipates a recurring revenue stream from its licensing activities in future periods.

 Regulatory Matters
 Charter 
 The following summary addresses the key regulatory and legislative developments affecting the cable industry and Charter’s three primary services for both residential and commercial customers: video, Internet, and voice services. Cable system operations are extensively regulated by the federal government (primarily the FCC), certain state governments, and many local governments. A failure to comply with these regulations could subject Charter to substantial penalties. Charter’s business can be dramatically impacted by changes to the existing regulatory framework, whether triggered by legislative, administrative, or judicial rulings. Congress and the FCC have frequently revisited the subject of communications regulation and they are likely to do so again in the future. Charter could be materially disadvantaged in the future if it is subject to new regulations or regulatory actions that do not equally impact its key competitors. Charter cannot provide assurance that the already extensive regulation of its business will not be expanded in the future. In addition, Charter is already subject to Charter-specific conditions regarding certain business practices as a result of the FCC’s approval of the Transactions.Video Service
 Must Carry/Retransmission Consent

There are two alternative legal methods for carriage of local broadcast television stations on cable systems. Federal “must carry” regulations require cable systems to carry local broadcast television stations upon the request of the local broadcaster. Alternatively, federal law includes “retransmission consent” regulations, by which popular commercial television stations can prohibit cable carriage unless the cable operator first negotiates for “retransmission consent,” which may be conditioned on significant payments or other concessions. Popular stations invoking “retransmission consent” have been demanding substantial compensation increases in their recent negotiations with cable operators, thereby significantly increasing Charter’s operating costs. Cable Equipment

In 1996, Congress enacted a statute requiring the FCC to adopt regulations designed to assure the development of an independent retail market for “navigation devices,” such as cable set-top boxes. As a result, the FCC required cable operators to make a separate offering of security modules (i.e., a “CableCARD”) that can be used with retail navigation devices. Some of the FCC’s rules requiring support for CableCARDs were vacated by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (“D.C. Circuit”) in 2013, and another of these rules was repealed by Congress in 2014, but the basic obligation to provide separable security for retail devices remains in place. In 2016, the FCC proposed to replace its CableCARD regime with new rules that would have required Charter to make disaggregated “information flows” available to set-top boxes and apps supplied by third parties. That proposal has not been adopted, but various parties may continue to advocate alternative regulatory approaches to reduce consumer dependency on traditional operator-provided set-top boxes. It remains uncertain whether the FCC or Congress will change the legal requirements related to Charter’s set-top boxes and what the impact of any such changes might be. Privacy and Information Security Regulation

The Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the “Communications Act”) limits Charter’s ability to collect, use, and disclose subscribers’ personally identifiable information for its video, voice, and Internet services, and imposes requirements to safeguard such information. Charter is subject to additional federal, state, and local laws and regulations that impose additional restrictions on the collection, use and disclosure of consumer, subscriber and employee information. Further, the FCC, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), and many states regulate and restrict the marketing practices of communications service providers, including telemarketing and online marketing efforts. On October 27, 2016, the FCC adopted privacy rules that contain new restrictions affecting the use of broadband and voice customer data, and various other federal agencies, including the FTC, continue to provide updated guidance on the use and protection of consumer data.
     Charter’s operations are also subject to federal and state laws governing information security, including new data security requirements set forth in the FCC’s recently adopted privacy rules, which will become effective on March 2, 2017. In 

 
  I-15

 
the event of an information security breach, such rules may require consumer and government agency notification and may result in regulatory enforcement actions with the potential of monetary forfeitures. The FCC has used the existing authority under its privacy and security requirements for telecommunications services to bring enforcement actions against several companies for failing to protect customer data from unauthorized access by, and disclosure to, third parties, resulting in substantial monetary settlements. Similarly, the FTC and state attorneys general regularly bring enforcement actions against companies related to information security breaches and privacy violations. Several state legislatures are considering the adoption of new data security and cybersecurity legislation that could result in additional network and information security requirements for Charter’s business.
 Various security standards provide guidance to telecommunications companies in order to help identify and mitigate cybersecurity risk. One such standard is the voluntary framework released by the National Institute for Standards and Technologies (“NIST”) in February 2014, in cooperation with other federal agencies and owners and operators of U.S. critical infrastructure. The NIST cybersecurity framework provides a prioritized and flexible model for organizations to identify and manage cyber risks inherent to their business. It was designed to supplement, not supersede, existing cybersecurity regulations and requirements. Several government agencies have encouraged compliance with the NIST cybersecurity framework, including the FCC, which is also considering expansion of its cybersecurity guidelines or the adoption of cybersecurity requirements. On January 10, 2017, NIST released a draft update to the cybersecurity framework. Charter cannot predict what proposals may be adopted or new legislation and regulations, if any, would affect its business.
 MDUs / Inside Wiring

The FCC has adopted a series of regulations designed to spur competition to established cable operators in MDU complexes. These regulations allow Charter’s competitors to access certain existing cable wiring inside MDUs. The FCC also adopted regulations limiting the ability of established cable operators, like Charter, to enter into exclusive service contracts for MDU complexes. In their current form, the FCC regulations in this area favor Charter’s competitors. Pole Attachments

The Communications Act requires most utilities owning utility poles to provide cable systems with access to poles and conduits and simultaneously subjects the rates charged for this access to either federal or state regulation. In 2011 and again in 2015, the FCC amended its existing pole attachment rules to promote broadband deployment. The 2011 order allows for new penalties in certain cases involving unauthorized attachments, but generally strengthens the cable industry’s ability to access investor-owned utility poles on reasonable rates, terms, and conditions. Additionally, the 2011 order reduces the federal rate formula previously applicable to “telecommunications” attachments to closely approximate the rate formula applicable to “cable” attachments. The 2015 order continues the reconciliation of rates, effectively closing the remaining “loophole” that potentially allowed for significantly higher rates for telecommunications than for “cable” attachments in certain scenarios. Neither the 2011 order nor the 2015 order directly affects the rate in states that self-regulate (rather than allow the FCC to regulate pole rates), but many of those states have substantially the same rate for cable and telecommunications attachments.
     Although the 2011 and 2015 orders do not impact the status quo treatment of cable-provided VoIP service as an unclassified service eligible for the favorable cable rate, the issue has not been fully resolved by the FCC, and a potential change in classification in a pending proceeding could adversely impact Charter’s pole attachment rates in states or for periods of time in which the cable rate is or was lower than the telecommunications rate. Additionally, although the FCC’s 2015 reclassification of broadband Internet access as a telecommunications service also set forth the FCC’s intention that pole rates not increase as a result, that reclassification ruling could adversely impact Charter’s pole attachment rates in states or for periods of time in which the cable rate is or was lower than the telecommunications rate.
 Cable Rate Regulation

Federal law strictly limits the potential scope of cable rate regulation.  Pursuant to federal law, all video offerings are universally exempt from rate regulation, except for a cable system’s minimum level of video programming service, referred to as “basic service,” and associated equipment.  Rate regulation of basic service and associated equipment operates pursuant to a federal formula, with local governments, commonly referred to as local franchising authorities, primarily responsible for administering this regulation.  The majority of Charter’s local franchising authorities have never certified to regulate basic service cable rates.  In 2015, the FCC adopted an order reversing its historic approach to rate regulation certifications and requiring a local franchise authority interested in regulating cable rates to first make an affirmative showing that there is no “effective 

 
  I-16

 
competition” (as defined under federal law)  in the community.  Very few local franchise authorities have filed the necessary rate regulation certification, and the FCC’s 2015 order should make it more difficult for such entities to assert rate regulation in the future.

There have been calls to impose expanded rate regulation on the cable industry. Confronted with rapidly increasing cable programming costs, it is possible that Congress may adopt new constraints on the retail pricing or packaging of cable programming. Any such constraints could adversely affect Charter’s operations.

Access Channels

Local franchise agreements often require cable operators to set aside certain channels for public, educational, and governmental access programming. Federal law also requires cable systems to designate up to 15% of their channel capacity for commercial leased access by unaffiliated third parties, who may offer programming that Charter’s customers do not particularly desire. The FCC adopted revised rules in 2007 mandating a significant reduction in the rates that operators can charge commercial leased access users and imposing additional administrative requirements that would be burdensome on the cable industry. The effect of the FCC’s revised rules was stayed by a federal court, pending a cable industry appeal and an adverse finding by the Office of Management and Budget. Although commercial leased access activity historically has been relatively limited, increased activity in this area could further burden the channel capacity of Charter’s cable systems. Other FCC Regulatory Matters

FCC regulations cover a variety of additional areas, including, among other things: (1) equal employment opportunity obligations; (2) customer service standards; (3) technical service standards; (4) mandatory blackouts of certain network and syndicated programming; (5) restrictions on political advertising; (6) restrictions on advertising in children's programming; (7) licensing of systems and facilities; (8) maintenance of public files; (9) emergency alert systems; and (10) disability access, including requirements governing video-description and closed-captioning.  Each of these regulations restricts Charter’s business practices to varying degrees and may impose additional costs on Charter’s operations.
 It is possible that Congress or the FCC will expand or modify its regulation of cable systems in the future, and Charter cannot predict at this time how that might impact its business.
 Copyright

Cable systems are subject to a federal copyright compulsory license covering carriage of television and radio broadcast signals. The possible modification or elimination of this compulsory copyright license is the subject of continuing legislative proposals and administrative review and could adversely affect Charter’s ability to obtain desired broadcast programming. 

Copyright clearances for non-broadcast programming services are arranged through private negotiations. Cable operators also must obtain music rights for locally originated programming and advertising from the major music performing rights organizations. These licensing fees have been the source of litigation in the past, and Charter cannot predict with certainty whether license fee disputes may arise in the future.
 Franchise Matters

Charter’s cable systems generally are operated pursuant to nonexclusive franchises, permits, and similar authorizations granted by a municipality or other state or local government entity in order to utilize and cross public rights-of-way. Cable franchises generally are granted for fixed terms and in many cases include monetary penalties for noncompliance and may be terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material provisions. The specific terms and conditions of cable franchises vary significantly between jurisdictions. Cable franchises generally contain provisions governing cable operations, franchise fees, system construction, maintenance, technical performance, customer service standards, supporting and carrying public access channels, and changes in the ownership of the franchisee. A number of states subject cable systems to the jurisdiction of centralized state government agencies, such as public utility commissions. Although local franchising authorities have 

 
  I-17

 
considerable discretion in establishing franchise terms, certain federal protections benefit cable operators. For example, federal law caps local franchise fees.
     The traditional cable franchising regime has undergone significant change as a result of various federal and state actions. The FCC has adopted rules that streamline entry for new competitors (particularly those affiliated with telephone companies) and reduce certain franchising burdens for these new entrants. The FCC adopted more modest relief for existing cable operators.
     At the same time, a substantial number of states have adopted new franchising laws. Again, these laws were principally designed to streamline entry for new competitors, and they often provide advantages for these new entrants that are not immediately available to existing cable operators. In many instances, these franchising regimes do not apply to established cable operators until the existing franchise expires or a competitor directly enters the franchise territory. The exact nature of these state franchising laws, and their varying application to new and existing video providers, will impact Charter’s franchising obligations and competitive position. 

Internet Service
 FCC regulations adopted in 2015 subject broadband Internet access services to certain regulations intended to ensure that end users can send and receive lawful Internet content without discrimination by Internet service providers such as Charter. Under these rules, providers of broadband Internet access service are not permitted to block access to, or restrict data rates for downloading, lawful content or ban the attachment of non-harmful devices to Charter’s services except to the extent required by reasonable network management practices. Internet service providers are also not permitted to give special priority to the transmission of content from their affiliates or accept payment from third parties to give special priority to their content. Furthermore, Internet service providers are subject to a general obligation not to take actions that unreasonably interfere with the ability of end users (such as Charter’s subscribers) and edge providers (such as web sites) to exchange data with each other. The FCC has also stated that it will investigate problems that may arise regarding interconnection of the networks of retail broadband Internet access providers with “upstream” providers of Internet connectivity. In addition, the FCC rules require that Charter meet certain “transparency” obligations, i.e., that Charter disclose material technical and other terms and conditions applicable to its Internet service. These FCC regulations were upheld by the D.C. Circuit in June 2016, but remain subject to additional appeals. Congress or the FCC may modify or repeal the existing regulations.
     In addition to the regulatory obligations noted above, providers of broadband Internet access service are obligated by the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (“CALEA”) to configure their networks in a manner that facilitates the ability of law enforcement, with proper legal authorization, to obtain information about their customers, including the content of their Internet communications. The FCC and Congress also are considering subjecting Internet access services to the Universal Service funding requirements. These funding requirements could impose significant new costs on Charter’s Internet service. Also, the FCC and some state regulatory commissions direct certain subsidies to telephone companies deploying broadband to areas deemed to be “unserved” or “underserved.” Charter has opposed such subsidies when directed to areas that Charter serves. State and local governmental organizations have also adopted Internet-related regulations. These various governmental jurisdictions are also considering additional regulations in these and other areas, such as privacy, pricing, service and product quality, and taxation. 
     Aside from the FCC’s generally applicable regulations, Charter has made certain commitments to comply with the FCC’s order in connection with the FCC’s approval of the Transactions (discussed above) (“FCC Order”), as well as a consent decree with the Department of Justice (“DOJ Consent Decree”) and approvals from state utility commissions and local franchise authorities. Among other things, (i) Charter is not permitted to charge usage-based prices or impose data caps and is prohibited from charging interconnection fees for qualifying parties; (ii) Charter is prohibited from entering into or enforcing any agreement with a programmer that forbids, limits or creates incentives to limit the programmer’s provision of content to online video distributors ("OVDs") and cannot retaliate against programmers for licensing to OVDs; (iii) Charter cannot avail itself of other distributors’ most favored nation provisions if they are inconsistent with this prohibition; (iv) Charter must undertake a number of actions designed to promote diversity; (v) Charter must appoint an independent compliance monitor and comply with a broad array of reporting requirements; and (vi) Charter must satisfy various other conditions relating to its high-speed Internet services, including building out an additional two million locations with access to a high-speed connection of at least 60 megabits per second with at least one million of those connections in competition with another high-speed broadband provider in the market served, and implementing a reduced price high-speed internet program for low income families. These and other conditions and commitments relating to the Transactions are of varying duration, ranging from three to seven years.

 
  I-18

 

 The FCC is considering whether online video distributors (“OVDs”) that offer programming to customers with a broadband Internet connection should be classified as multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”), and thereby subject to the program access protections available to MVPDs, as well as some of the regulatory requirements applicable to MVPDs. The outcome of this proceeding, which could impact how OVDs compete in the future with traditional cable service is uncertain.

Voice Service

The Telecommunications Act of 1996 created a more favorable regulatory environment for Charter to provide telecommunications and/or competitive voice services than had previously existed. In particular, it established requirements ensuring that competitive telephone companies could interconnect their networks with those providers of traditional telecommunications services to open the market to competition. The FCC has subsequently ruled that competitive telephone companies that support VoIP services, such as those Charter offers its customers, are entitled to interconnection with incumbent providers of traditional telecommunications services, which ensures that Charter’s VoIP services can compete in the market. Since that time, the FCC has initiated a proceeding to determine whether such interconnection rights should extend to traditional and competitive networks utilizing IP technology, and how to encourage the transition to IP networks throughout the industry. New rules or obligations arising from these proceedings may affect Charter’s ability to compete in the provision of voice services.
     The FCC has collected extensive data from providers of point to point transport (“special access”) services, such as Charter, and the FCC may use that data to evaluate whether the market for such services is competitive, or whether the market should be subject to further regulation, which may increase Charter’s costs or constrain Charter’s ability to compete in this market. On April 28, 2016, the FCC released a further notice of proposed rulemaking regarding special access services. 
     Further regulatory changes are being considered that could impact Charter’s voice business and that of its primary telecommunications competitors. The FCC and state regulatory authorities are considering, for example, whether certain common carrier regulations traditionally applied to incumbent local exchange carriers should be modified or reduced, and the extent to which common carrier requirements should be extended to VoIP providers. The FCC has already determined that certain providers of voice services using Internet Protocol technology must comply with requirements relating to 9-1-1 emergency services (“E-9-1-1”), the CALEA (the statute governing law enforcement access to and surveillance of communications), Universal Service Fund contributions, customer privacy and Customer Proprietary Network Information issues, number portability, network outage reporting, rural call completion, disability access, regulatory fees, and discontinuance of service. In 2014, the FCC adopted an order imposing limited back-up power obligations on providers of facilities-based fixed, residential voice services that are not otherwise line-powered, including Charter’s VoIP services. This order became effective in February 2016 and requires Charter to disclose certain information to customers and to make back-up power available at the point of sale. In 2007, a federal appeals court affirmed the FCC’s decision concerning federal regulation of certain VoIP services, but declined to specifically find that VoIP service provided by cable companies, such as Charter provides, should be regulated only at the federal level. As a result, some states have begun proceedings to subject cable VoIP services to state level regulation, and at least one state has asserted jurisdiction over Charter’s VoIP services. Charter has filed a legal challenge to that state’s assertion of jurisdiction, which is now pending before a federal district court in Minnesota. Although Charter has registered with, or obtained certificates or authorizations from the FCC and the state regulatory authorities in those states in which Charter offers competitive voice services in order to ensure the continuity of its services and to maintain needed network interconnection arrangements, it is unclear whether and how these and other ongoing regulatory matters ultimately will be resolved.
     Transaction-Related Commitments
     In connection with approval of the Transactions, federal and state regulators imposed a number of post-merger conditions on Charter including but not limited to the following.

Skyhook

Skyhook’s Wi-Fi location solution can be used to help carriers and emergency personnel offer E-9-1-1 services domestically. The FCC’s wireless E-9-1-1 rules apply to all wireless licensees, broadband personal communications services licensees, and certain specialized mobile radio licensees. Such carriers must provide a 9-1-1 call center, called a local public safety answering point (“PSAP”) under FCC rules, with the telephone number of the originator of a wireless 9-1-1 call and the location of the cell site or base station transmitting the call. In addition, upon a valid request by a PSAP, such carriers must provide more precise information to the PSAP, such as the latitude and longitude of the caller.

The E-9-1-1 location accuracy requirements originally adopted by the FCC in 1996 applied only to 9-1-1 calls originating outdoors.  Recognizing the increased use of wireless phones indoors, in 2015, the FCC adopted indoor location accuracy rules in its Fourth Report and Order in its E-9-1-1 location accuracy proceeding to assist first responders.  Under the new rules, all wireless providers generally must provide horizontal location information with 50 meter accuracy for 40 percent of all wireless 9-1-1 calls within two years of the effective date of the Fourth Report and Order (April 30, 2015), and for 80 percent of all wireless calls, within six years of the effective date.  Wireless providers also must meet specific requirements for the provision of vertical location information for wireless 9-1-1 calls within three-to-eight years of the effective date.  Smaller wireless providers may have additional time to comply with certain of the horizontal and vertical benchmarks.

 
  I-20

 


Various U.S. and foreign regulatory requirements apply, or may apply in the future, to the global positioning technologies and services offered by Skyhook. Skyhook’s use of personal information must comply with all applicable consumer and data protection laws in the United States, Europe and other jurisdictions in which the company operates. Legislatures and regulatory agencies in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere continue to implement additional consumer and data protection requirements.
 Competition

Charter 
 Charter faces intense competition for residential customers, both from existing competitors, and, as a result of the rapid development of new technologies, services and products, from new entrants.

Video competition

Charter’s residential video service faces competition from direct broadcast satellite (“DBS”) services, which have a national footprint and compete in all of Charter’s operating areas. DBS providers offer satellite-delivered pre-packaged programming services that can be received by relatively small and inexpensive receiving dishes. They offer aggressive promotional pricing, exclusive programming (e.g., NFL Sunday Ticket) and video services that are comparable in many respects to Charter’s residential video service. Charter’s residential video service also faces competition from phone companies with fiber-based networks, primarily AT&T U-verse, Frontier Communications Corporation (“Frontier”) FiOs and Verizon FiOs, which offer wireline video services in approximately 23%, 8% and 4%, respectively, of Charter’s operating areas. In July 2015, AT&T acquired DIRECTV Group Inc. (“DIRECTV”), the nation’s largest DBS provider, with the combined company able to offer bundles of video, Internet, wireline phone service and wireless service.

As a condition to the FCC approval of the transaction, AT&T is required to deploy fiber to the home (“FTTH”) to 12.5 million locations within four years from the close of its transaction. AT&T also announced the acquisition of Time Warner Inc. in October 2016 which is subject to regulatory approval. If approved, it is not yet clear how AT&T will use the various programming and studio assets to benefit its own video on its various platforms or potential program access conditions as part of such regulatory approval.
 Charter’s residential video service also faces growing competition from a number of other sources, including companies that deliver linear network programming, movies and television shows on demand and other video content over broadband Internet connections to televisions, computers, tablets and mobile devices. These newer categories of competitors include virtual multichannel video programming distributors such as AT&T’s “DirecTV NOW,” DISH Network Corporation’s “Sling TV,” and Sony Corporation’s “Playstation Vue,” and direct to consumer products offered by programmers that have not traditionally sold programming directly to consumers, such as HBO’s “HBO Now,” CBS’s “CBS All Access” and Showtime’s “Showtime Anytime.” Other online video business models have also developed, including, (i) subscription video on demand services such as Netflix, Amazon.com Inc.’s (“Amazon”) “Prime,” and “Hulu Plus,” (ii) ad-supported free online video products, including Google Inc.’s (“Google”), “YouTube” and “Hulu,” some of which offer programming for free to consumers that Charter currently purchases for a fee, (iii) pay-per-view products, such as Apple’s “iTunes” and Amazon’s, “Amazon Instant,” and (iv) additional ad-supported free offerings from wireless providers such as Verizon’s “go90” and T-Mobile’s “Binge On” that exempt certain video content traffic from counting towards monthly data caps. Charter has viewed online video services as complementary to its own video offering, and has developed a cloud-based guide that is capable of incorporating video from many online video services currently offered in the marketplace. As the proliferation of online video services grows, however, services such as DirecTV Now and potential forthcoming services such as Hulu Live, and new direct to consumer offerings, could negatively impact the growth of Charter’s video business.
     Internet competition
     Charter’s residential Internet service faces competition from the phone companies’ DSL, FTTH and wireless broadband offerings as well as from a variety of companies that offer other forms of online services, including wireless and satellite-based broadband services. Verizon’s FiOS and Frontier in certain markets acquired from Verizon, are Charter’s primary fiber-to-the-home competitor, although AT&T has also begun fiber-to-the home builds as well, including the required buildout per the FCC condition as a result of AT&T’s acquisition of DIRECTV noted above. Given the FTTH deployments of Charter’s competitors, 

 
  I-21

 
launches of broadband services offering 1 Gbps speed are becoming more common. Several competitors, including AT&T and Google, deliver 1 Gbps broadband speed in at least a portion of their footprints which overlap Charter’s footprint. DSL service is often offered at prices lower than Charter’s Internet services, although typically at speeds lower than the speeds Charter offers. Various wireless phone companies are now offering third and fourth generation (3G and 4G) wireless Internet services with fifth generation (5G) and faster services on the horizon, some of which offer unlimited data packages to customers. In addition, a growing number of commercial areas, such as retail malls, restaurants and airports, offer Wi-Fi Internet service. Numerous local governments are also considering or actively pursuing publicly subsidized Wi-Fi Internet access networks. These options offer alternatives to cable-based Internet access.
     Voice competition
     Charter’s residential voice service competes with wireless and wireline phone providers, as well as other forms of communication, such as text messaging on cellular phones, instant messaging, social networking services, video conferencing and email. Charter also competes with “over-the-top” phone providers, such as Vonage, Skype, magicJack, Google Voice and Ooma, Inc., as well as companies that sell phone cards at a cost per minute for both national and international service. The increase in the number of different technologies capable of carrying voice services and the number of alternative communication options available to customers as well as the replacement of wireline services by wireless have intensified the competitive environment in which Charter operates its residential voice service.
     Regional Competitors
     In some of Charter’s operating areas, other competitors have built networks that offer video, Internet and voice services that compete with our services. For example, in Kansas City and Austin, Texas, Charter’s residential video, Internet and voice services compete with Google Fiber services. In addition to Google Fiber, Cincinnati Bell Inc., Hawaiian Telcom, RCN Telecom Services, LLC and WideOpenWest Finance, LLC, each compete with Charter in parts of its operating area.
     Additional competition
     In addition to multi-channel video providers, cable systems compete with other sources of news, information and entertainment, including over-the-air television broadcast reception, live events, movie theaters and the Internet. Competition is also posed by satellite master antenna television systems, or SMATV systems, serving MDUs, such as condominiums, apartment complexes, and private residential communities.
     Business Services
     Charter faces intense competition as to each of its business services offerings. Charter’s small and medium business video, Internet, networking and voice services face competition from a variety of providers as described above. Charter’s enterprise solutions also face competition from the competitors described above as well as other telecommunications carriers, such as metro and regional fiber-based carriers. Charter also competes with cloud, hosting and related service providers and application-service providers.     Advertising
     Charter faces intense competition for advertising revenue across many different platforms and from a wide range of local and national competitors. Advertising competition has increased and will likely continue to increase as new formats seek to attract the same advertisers. Charter competes for advertising revenue against, among others, local broadcast stations, national cable and broadcast networks, radio stations, print media and online advertising companies and content providers.     Security and Home Management
     Charter’s IntelligentHome service faces competition from traditional security companies, such as The ADT Corporation, service providers such as Verizon and AT&T, as well as new entrants, such as Vivint, Inc., Alarm.com, Inc. and NEST Labs, Inc. (which Google acquired in 2014).
    
 
  I-22

 

 Skyhook 
 Skyhook’s Wi-Fi location software solutions compete against (1) other satellite and terrestrial based location technology offerings, such as GPS; (2) other providers of Wi-Fi and cell-based positioning, such as Google and HERE, a former subsidiary of Nokia; and (3) other commercial enterprises’ in-house developed location solutions. There are also a number of new location technologies in development which may further increase competition to be a location solution for new devices and which may require Skyhook to meet more stringent accuracy standards. In addition, Skyhook’s context services compete against other geofencing and location data offerings from other niche location companies, such as Factual and Foursquare. 
 Skyhook owns significant intellectual property (IP) around the world that relates to its location products and services and provides possible competitive advantages. Skyhook’s IP portfolio includes patents, patent applications, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights. Skyhook believes that it has a defensible and useful IP portfolio and it actively seeks to protect and license its global IP rights as well as to deter unauthorized use of its IP and other assets. For example, in 2015, Skyhook entered into a settlement agreement and license that resolved a lawsuit that Skyhook had brought against Google, in connection with claims that Google had infringed eight Skyhook patents. Additionally, in 2016 Skyhook entered into a license agreement to grant to the licensee a perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide license to patents and patent applications owned by Skyhook. Skyhook has successfully worked with customers to enter into license agreements but cannot provide assurance that current patents will be enforceable or infringed, that they will deter unauthorized use, that Skyhook’s attempts to secure IP licenses will be successful, or that its additional patent applications will ever be allowed or granted.
 Seasonality and Cyclicality 

Charter 

Charter’s business is subject to seasonal and cyclical variations. Its results are impacted by the seasonal nature of customers receiving cable services in college and vacation markets. Charter’s revenue is subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. Its advertising revenue is generally higher in the second and fourth calendar quarters of each year, due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the holiday season. U.S. advertising revenue is also cyclical, benefiting in even-numbered years from advertising related to candidates running for political office and issue oriented advertising. Charter’s capital expenditures and trade working capital are also subject to significant seasonality based on the timing of subscriber growth, network programs, specific projects and construction. Employees
