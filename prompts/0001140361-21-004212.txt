ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------



Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc. develops and distributes a comprehensive line of premium-quality beauty and wellness solutions in approximately 50 markets worldwide. In 2020, our revenue of $2.6 billion was primarily generated by our three primary brands: our beauty and personal care brand, Nu Skin; our nutritional products brand, Pharmanex; and our anti-aging brand, ageLOC. We operate in the direct selling channel, primarily utilizing person-to-person marketing to promote and sell our products.
 
In addition to our core Nu Skin business, we also explore new areas of growth and opportunity through our strategic investment arm known as Rhyz Inc. Rhyz investments include personal care and nutritional product manufacturing companies and indoor-growing technologies, which are sometimes referred to as controlled-environment agriculture. In 2020, the Rhyz companies generated $150.2 million, or 6%, of our 2020 reported revenue (excluding sales to our core Nu Skin business), substantially all of which was from the manufacturing companies.
 
About 84% of our revenue came from outside of the United States in 2020, with approximately 24% of our revenue coming from Mainland China, our largest revenue market. Given the size of our international operations, our results, as reported in U.S. dollars, are often impacted by foreign-currency fluctuations, though in 2020, the impact from foreign-currency fluctuations on our revenue was flat compared to 2019. In addition, our results can be impacted by global economic, political, demographic and business trends and conditions.

Our operations are subject to various laws and regulations globally, particularly with respect to our product categories and our distribution channel. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a more detailed description of the risks associated with our business.

PRODUCTS

We offer a branded, differentiated product portfolio. We believe our innovative approach to product development and distribution provides us with a competitive advantage in personal care and wellness products and direct selling. We believe that our acquired and licensed technologies, manufacturing and innovation facilities, research collaborations and in-house research expertise enable us to introduce innovative, proprietary products. We seek to offer products that are demonstrable and well suited for social sharing. Sustainability is also an important part of our product strategy; we take sustainability into account as we formulate our products, and we have an ongoing initiative to transition to packaging that is recycled, recyclable, reusable, reduced or renewable.

Beginning in the second half of 2020 and continuing into 2021, we are launching ageLOC Boost, which is a beauty device system that promotes visibly brighter, plumper and bouncier skin.
 
Product Categories

We have two primary product categories: personal care products and wellness products. We develop and distribute innovative, premium-quality products in these two categories under our Nu Skin and Pharmanex brands, respectively. We also develop and distribute products under our ageLOC brand, which features innovative, premium-quality anti-aging products in both the personal care and wellness categories and in many cases is co-branded with our Nu Skin and Pharmanex products.
 
Presented below are the U.S. dollar amounts and associated revenue percentages from the sale of personal care and wellness products, as well as our Rhyz companies, for the last three years. This table should be read in conjunction with the information presented in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, which discusses the factors impacting revenue trends and the costs associated with generating the aggregate revenue presented.

Personal Care. Our strategy for our personal care products category is to leverage our distribution channel to strengthen Nu Skin’s position as an innovative leader in the masstige and premium personal care markets. We are committed to continuously improving and evolving our product formulations to develop and incorporate innovative and proven ingredients. We formulate many of the products in our personal care category with ingredients that are scientifically proven to provide visible results. Our personal care products also include our innovative skin care devices. In 2020, our top-selling products by revenue in this category were two of our innovative skin care devices and related consumables: our ageLOC Spa systems and our ageLOC LumiSpa skin treatment and cleansing device. Our ageLOC personal care products accounted for 50% of our personal care category revenue and 29% of our total revenue in 2020. Also included in our personal care category are our Epoch® products, which feature botanical ingredients derived from renewable sources, and a number of other cosmetic and personal care products.
 
Wellness. Our strategy for our wellness category is to continue to introduce innovative, substantiated products based on research and development and quality manufacturing. Direct selling has proven to be an effective method of marketing our high-quality wellness products because our sales force can personally educate consumers on the quality and benefits of our products, differentiating them from our competitors’ offerings. In 2020, our three top-selling products by revenue in this category were our LifePak nutritional supplements, our ageLOC Youth nutritional supplements and our ageLOC TR90 weight management and body shaping system. Our ageLOC nutritional products accounted for 42% of our nutritional supplements product category revenue and 15% of our total revenue in 2020.

Product Development

We are committed to developing and marketing innovative products. We have several products in development, including next-generation skin care products and nutritional supplements. In our research and product development, we leverage the three disciplines of science, technology and sourcing to create innovative products that address consumer needs. In recent years, we have developed several technologies that pertain to skin-treatment and beauty devices including ageLOC LumiSpa and ageLOC Boost. These devices employ novel technologies related to skin health.
 
 Our research and product development activities include:

 
● | Global consumer research to identify needs and insights and refine product concepts;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Internal research, product development and quality testing;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


● | Joint research projects, collaborations and clinical studies;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


● | Identification and assessment of technologies for potential licensing arrangements; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Acquisition of technologies.
--+-----------------------------



We maintain research and product development facilities in the United States and Mainland China. We also contract with third parties for clinical studies and collaborate on basic research projects with researchers from universities and other research institutions in the United States and Asia, whose staffs include scientists with basic research expertise in, among others, natural product chemistry, biochemistry, dermatology, nutrition, pharmacology and clinical studies.

We also work to identify and assess innovative technologies developed by third parties for potential licensing, supply or acquisition arrangements. Because of the nature of our distribution channel, which allows us to provide a high level of product information on a person-to-person basis, we often have third parties who are interested in licensing innovative technologies to us to incorporate into our products and commercialize through our distribution channel. Licensing arrangements allow us to leverage the research activities of third parties that have provided demonstrated technologies, clinical support and/or proprietary innovation, without all of the upfront costs and uncertainty associated with internal development. We have also invested in acquisitions to supplement our research capabilities and to acquire technologies, including our acquisition of Pharmanex in 1998; the license and acquisition of the technology underlying our BioPhotonic Scanner, a non-invasive tool that measures the level of carotenoid anti-oxidants in skin, in the early 2000s; and the acquisition of assets related to the genetic sources of aging from LifeGen Technologies, LLC in 2011. We incur expenses for royalties and amortization for previous technology-related acquisitions.
 
Intellectual Property

Our major trademarks are registered in the United States and in each market where we operate or have plans to operate, and we consider trademark protection to be very important to our business. Our major trademarks include Nu Skin®, our fountain logos, Pharmanex®, ageLOC®, LifePak®, Galvanic Spa®, TR90®, Epoch®, ageLOC Me®, LumiSpa® and ageLOC Boost®. In addition, a number of our products, including our facial spas, ageLOC Body Spa, LumiSpa, ageLOC Boost, TR90 and Pharmanex BioPhotonic Scanner, are based on proprietary technologies, some of which are patented or licensed from third parties. We also rely on patents and trade secret protection to protect our proprietary formulas and other proprietary information for our ageLOC products and other products.
Sourcing and Production
 
For markets other than Mainland China, in 2020, we sourced most of our personal care products and wellness products from trusted third-party suppliers and manufacturers. In Mainland China, we operate manufacturing facilities where we produce the majority of our personal care products and nutritional supplements sold in Mainland China. We also produce some products at these facilities that are exported to other markets.

In 2020, we procured ingredients and products from four suppliers that represented more than 10% of our personal care purchases and three suppliers that represented more than 10% of our nutritional supplement purchases. We maintain good relationships with these suppliers and do not anticipate that any party will terminate these relationships in the near term. In the event we become unable to source any products or ingredients from these suppliers, we believe that we would be able to produce or replace those products or substitute ingredients. We also have ongoing relationships with secondary and tertiary suppliers. We procure our ageLOC Spa systems and other products or ingredients from single vendors that may own or control the product formulations, ingredients, or other intellectual property rights associated with the products or ingredients. We maintain good relationships with these vendors and do not anticipate termination of these relationships in the near term. However, to continue offering these product categories following any termination of our relationship with these vendors, we would need to develop and manufacture alternative products and source them from other vendors. Please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of risks and uncertainties associated with our supplier relationships and with the sourcing of raw materials and ingredients.

In 2018, we acquired three companies that primarily do the following, respectively: develop and manufacture personal care products, develop and manufacture nutritional supplements, and source and procure product packaging. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we acquired an additional company that develops and manufactures nutritional supplements. These businesses are owned by our Rhyz strategic investment arm. We also have acquired additional companies and plan to continue this strategy going forward, as we believe these manufacturers allow us to leverage their expertise to enhance our innovation, sustainability and supply chain capabilities.

We also continue, through our Rhyz entity, to invest in controlled-environment agriculture technologies. We believe these technologies will enhance our ability to source clean, sustainable ingredients. We also have found that some of this technology has broader applications in agriculture feed, and we are pursuing these potential opportunities through an entity called Grōv Technologies, LLC, a subsidiary of Rhyz. Grōv Technologies is also pursuing opportunities involving fresh-produce and lighting technologies.

In addition to the products and services provided to our core Nu Skin business, our Rhyz companies continue to operate outside of our core Nu Skin business, generating $150.2 million in revenue from sales to external customers in 2020.
 
DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL

We operate in the direct selling channel, primarily utilizing person-to-person marketing to promote and sell our products. We believe that direct selling, which has traditionally relied on face-to-face, word-of-mouth marketing, is currently being impacted by the convergence of social commerce, influencer and affiliate marketing, and the growing gig economy. These macroeconomic shifts have also disrupted traditional advertising and retail business practices in favor of socially enabled and direct-to-consumer models. The COVID-19 pandemic has further accelerated disruption across many industries by causing migration to remote work and online shopping. We endeavor to transform and adapt our business to these trends by helping our sales force to become more socially enabled and to grow their businesses online. We support our sales force members’ personal marketing efforts with marketing content, events, websites, apps and other technology solutions. With these tools, along with our demonstrable products, our sales force is able to use social media platforms to find new customers and promote and sell our products. Social sharing also presents certain risks and challenges to our business, as discussed further in Item 1A. Risk Factors.

We believe our direct selling distribution channel is an effective vehicle to distribute our products because:
 
 
● | our sales force has rapid reach to potential customers through their social networks and the social networks of those to whom they are connected;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our sales force can personally educate consumers about our products, which we believe is more effective for differentiating our products than using traditional mass-media advertising;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our distribution channel allows for product demonstrations and trial by potential consumers;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our distribution channel allows our sales force to provide personal testimonials of product efficacy; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | as compared to other distribution methods, our sales force has the opportunity to provide consumers higher levels of service.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 

While our person-to-person marketing philosophy remains consistent globally, various aspects of our business may differ from market to market, including product mix and pricing, compensation structure, access to distribution outlets or product stores, the manner of getting products to consumers, product claims, branding and product formulations. In addition, in Mainland China we have implemented a business model that, unlike the business model we use in our other markets, utilizes retail stores, sales employees, independent direct sellers and independent marketers to market our products.

Given that members of our sales force are independent contractors in most markets, we do not control or direct their promotional efforts. We do, however, require that our sales force abide by policies and procedures that require them to act in an ethical and consumer-protective manner and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. As a member of direct selling associations globally, we promote and abide by the industry’s codes of ethics and consumer-protective standards to support and protect those who sell and purchase our products through the direct selling channel.

In all of our markets besides Mainland China, we refer to members of our independent sales force as “Brand Affiliates” because their primary role is to promote our brand and products through their personal and social networks.
 
Consumer Group and Sales Network

Our distribution channel is composed of two primary groups: our consumer group—individuals who buy our products primarily for personal or family consumption and share products with friends and family; and our sales network—individuals who personally buy, use and resell products, and who also find new consumers, and recruit, train and develop new sellers. We strive to develop both our consumer group and our sales network. Our strategy for growing our consumer group is to offer high-quality, innovative products that provide demonstrable benefits. Our strategy for growing our sales network is to provide a business opportunity for those persons who demonstrate the desire and ability to develop both a consumer group and a team of sellers, including through sales compensation, incentives and recognition.

To monitor the growth trends in our consumer group, we track the number of persons who purchased products directly from the company during the previous three months (“Customers”). We believe a significant majority of Customers purchase our products primarily for personal or family consumption but are not actively pursuing the opportunity we offer to generate supplemental income by marketing and reselling products. Our Customer numbers do not include consumers who purchase products directly from members of our sales force.

To monitor the growth in our sales network, we track the number of Brand Affiliates, and sales employees and independent marketers in Mainland China, who achieve certain qualification requirements (“Sales Leaders”). Our Sales Leaders are also included in our Customer numbers, as they purchase products from the company and are within the definition of our “Customers.” The following chart sets forth information concerning our Customers and Sales Leaders for the last three years.

Global Direct Selling Channel
 
Outside of Mainland China, individuals can elect to participate in our business as follows:

 
● | “Brand Affiliate-Direct Consumers”—Individuals who purchase products directly from a Brand Affiliate at a price established by the Brand Affiliate.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | “Company-Direct Consumers”—Individuals who purchase products directly from the company. These consumers are typically referred by a Brand Affiliate and may purchase at retail price or at a discount. These individuals do not have the right to build a Nu Skin business by reselling product or by recruiting others.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | “Basic Brand Affiliates”—Brand Affiliates who purchase products for personal or family use or for resale to other consumers. These individuals are not eligible to receive compensation on a multi-level basis unless they elect to qualify as a Sales Leader under our global sales compensation plan. We consider these individuals to be part of our consumer group, as we believe a significant majority of these Brand Affiliates are purchasing products for personal use and not actively recruiting others.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | “Sales Leaders and Qualifiers”—Brand Affiliates who have qualified or are trying to qualify as a Sales Leader. These Brand Affiliates have elected to pursue the business opportunity as a Sales Leader and are actively recruiting consumers and Brand Affiliates and building a sales network under our global sales compensation plan and constitute our sales network.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



To become a Brand Affiliate, an individual signs a Brand Affiliate agreement and receives a business portfolio, which is free in most markets and in some cases is delivered in electronic form. In some markets, we charge a small fee for the business portfolio, which is limited to our costs. The business portfolio generally consists of documentation concerning the business, including copies of the sales compensation plan, Brand Affiliate policies and procedures, product catalog and other documentation, but does not include products. There are no requirements to purchase products or other materials to become a Brand Affiliate, and no commissions are paid on any purchase of a business portfolio.

We offer a generous product return policy, which also includes returns of business support materials. In most markets, we offer a return policy that allows our Brand Affiliates to return unopened and unused items for up to 30 days for a full refund, or 12 months subject to a 10% restocking fee. Brand Affiliates are not required to terminate their accounts to return product. Actual returns have historically been less than 5% of annual revenue. We believe our generous return policy minimizes the financial risks associated with being a Brand Affiliate.

In addition to our product return policy, we strive to be as customer protective as possible. We seek to ensure that those who use our products or participate in our business opportunity are treated fairly and are not misled by inappropriate product or earnings claims.

There are two fundamental ways in which our Brand Affiliates can earn money:
 
 
● | through retail markups on resales of products purchased from the company; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | through sales compensation earned on the sale of products under our global sales compensation plan.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



We believe that our global sales compensation plan, which has been implemented in each of our markets except Mainland China, is among the most generous in the direct selling industry and is one of our competitive advantages. Our Sales Leaders can receive sales compensation under our global sales compensation plan for product sales from the company to their own network of consumers as well as for product sales from the company to other Sales Leaders and their consumer groups. This type of sales compensation is often referred to as “multi-level” compensation. Our sales force is not required to recruit or sponsor others, and we do not pay any sales compensation for recruiting or sponsoring. While all of our Brand Affiliates can sponsor others at any time, our Sales Leaders and those in qualification to become Sales Leaders are those who generally are actively sponsoring others. Pursuant to our global sales compensation plan, we pay consolidated sales compensation in a Sales Leader’s home market, in local currency, for product sales in the Sales Leader’s own consumer group and for product sales in the Sales Leader’s team of Sales Leaders across all geographic markets.
 
 

Mainland China Business Model
 
Because of restrictions on direct selling and multi-level commissions in Mainland China, we have implemented a business model for that market that is different from the business model we use in our other markets. We have structured our business model in Mainland China based on several factors: the guidance we have received from government officials, our interpretation of applicable regulations, our understanding of the practices of other international direct selling companies operating in Mainland China, and our understanding as to how regulators are interpreting and enforcing the regulations.

In Mainland China, we utilize sales employees to sell products through our retail stores and website; independent direct sellers, who can sell away from our stores where we have a direct selling license and a service center and can also sell through our website; and independent marketers, who are licensed business owners authorized to sell our products at their own approved premises or through our stores and website. We rely on our sales employees, independent direct sellers and independent marketers to attract new consumers and promote repeat purchases, and to educate our sales force about our products, culture and policies through frequent training meetings.

Our sales employees, independent direct sellers and independent marketers in Mainland China do not participate in our global sales compensation plan but are instead compensated according to a separate compensation model established for Mainland China, which is separate and different from our global compensation plan. Independent direct sellers and sales employees who have not achieved certain qualification requirements receive direct sales bonuses and retail sales bonuses, respectively, based on their monthly product sales. Sales employees who achieve qualification requirements and independent marketers earn (1) monthly retail bonuses on their product sales and other bonuses based on various performance metrics; and (2) a salary (for sales employees, consisting of position pay and performance pay) or service fee (for independent marketers), which is reviewed and adjusted quarterly based on their position and performance relative to other sales leaders, taking into account such factors as the sales productivity of the Sales Leader him/herself and of the sales force that such Sales Leader trains, collaborates with, supports and services. We utilize our global system to track and assess the sales productivity of each Sales Leader him/herself and the sales force that such Sales Leader trains, collaborates with, supports and services. We generally compensate our Mainland China Sales Leaders at a level that is competitive with other direct selling companies in the market and comparable to the compensation of our Sales Leaders globally.

Operating in Mainland China entails certain risks and uncertainties to our business, as discussed further in Item 1. Business—“Regulation” and Item 1A. Risk Factors. We endeavor to mitigate these risks and uncertainties through various measures, including by seeking to understand and obey laws and regulations, training our employees and sales force, engaging in dialogue with government officials to better understand their goals and explain our plans, and cooperating in inquiries and other matters of interest to regulators. However, these efforts do not eliminate the significant risks associated with operating in Mainland China.

Our global sales compensation plan and our Mainland China business model, including our related know-how, processes and systems, play a significant role in helping us to attract and incentivize our sales force. We have strategically developed and refined our global sales compensation plan and our Mainland China business model to distinguish the business opportunity that we offer from those of other companies and to seek to provide us with a competitive advantage.
 
Sales Incentives, Meetings, Recognition and Training

An important part of our distribution channel is motivating our Sales Leaders and recognizing their achievements. We hold regular meetings and events globally to recognize Sales Leaders who have achieved various levels of success in our business. These meetings also allow the company and key Sales Leaders to provide training to other Sales Leaders. Although we conduct these meetings and events either virtually or in-person, we are increasingly conducting them virtually—and in 2020, most of them were virtual. We utilize a variety of sales incentives such as incentive trips to motivate Sales Leaders. In addition to rewarding performance, incentive trips provide Sales Leaders and the company opportunities to share best practices and set goals, generate alignment of Sales Leaders around key initiatives and provide a high level of motivation and team building.
Product Launch Process
 
We use a variety of methods to launch our products, enabling us to tailor the launch process to the specific market and the specific product. Prior to making a key product generally available for purchase, we may do one or more introductory offerings of the product, such as a preview of the product to our Sales Leaders or other product introduction or promotion. In some of these offerings, we may sell the product for a limited time, often in limited quantities, and then remove it from the market for a period of time before making it generally available for purchase. We refer to this entire process, beginning with the introductory offering through general availability of the product, as a product launch or our launch process.

Sales Leader previews and other product introductions and promotions may generate significant activity and a high level of purchasing, which can result in a higher-than-normal increase in revenue during the quarter and can skew year-over-year and sequential comparisons. We believe our product launch process attracts new Customers and Sales Leaders to our business, increases consumer trial and provides us with important marketing and forecasting information about our products. Please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for more information on risks related to our product launch process.

Beginning in the second half of 2020 and continuing into 2021, we are launching our ageLOC Boost beauty device system.
 
GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS

We currently sell and distribute our products in approximately 50 markets. We have divided our markets into seven segments: Mainland China; South Korea; Southeast Asia, which includes Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam; Americas/Pacific, which includes Australia, Canada, Latin America, New Zealand and the United States; Japan; Hong Kong/Taiwan, which also includes Macau; and Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”), which includes markets in Europe as well as Israel, Russia and South Africa. We also generate revenue in our Manufacturing and Grow Tech segments, which consist of the manufacturing and controlled-environment agriculture businesses within our Rhyz strategic investment arm. The following table sets forth the revenue for each of the segments and the Other category for the last three years.

REGULATION

Our business is subject to various laws and regulations globally, particularly with respect to our direct selling business models and our product categories. In addition, as a United States entity operating through subsidiaries in foreign jurisdictions, we are subject to foreign exchange control, transfer pricing and customs laws that regulate the flow of funds between us and our subsidiaries and for product purchases, management services and contractual obligations, such as the payment of sales commissions. As is the case with most companies in our industry, we receive inquiries from time to time from government regulatory authorities regarding the nature of our business and other issues, such as compliance with local direct selling, transfer pricing, customs, taxation, foreign exchange control, securities and other laws.
Direct Selling Regulations
 
Direct selling is regulated by various national, state and local government agencies in the United States and foreign markets. These laws and regulations are generally intended to prevent fraudulent or deceptive schemes, including “pyramid” schemes, which compensate participants primarily for recruiting additional participants without significant emphasis on product sales to consumers. The laws and regulations in our current markets generally:

● | impose requirements related to order cancellations, product returns, inventory buy-backs and cooling-off periods for our sales force and consumers;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | require us, or our sales force, to register with government agencies;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | impose limits on the amount of sales compensation we can pay;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


● | impose reporting requirements; and
--+-----------------------------------


● | require that our sales force is compensated for sales of products and not for recruiting others.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The laws and regulations governing direct selling may be modified or reinterpreted from time to time, which may cause us to modify our sales compensation and business models. In almost all of our markets, regulations are subject to discretionary interpretation by regulators and judicial authorities. There is often ambiguity and uncertainty with respect to the state of direct selling and anti-pyramiding laws and regulations. In the United States, for example, federal law provides law enforcement agencies, such as the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), broad latitude in policing unfair or deceptive trade practices, but does not provide a bright-line test for identifying a pyramid scheme. Several states have passed legislation that more clearly distinguishes between illegal pyramid schemes and legitimate multi-level marketing business models. Recent settlements between the FTC and other direct selling companies and guidance from the FTC have addressed inappropriate earnings and lifestyle claims, problematic compensation structures and the importance of focusing on consumers. In addition, during 2020 the FTC issued letters that warned several direct-selling companies to remove and address claims that they or members of their sales force were making about their products’ ability to treat or prevent COVID-19 and/or about the earnings that people who have recently lost income could make. For more information about these matters and their potential impact on our business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors—“Challenges to the form of our network marketing system could harm our business.”

The regulatory environment in Mainland China is particularly complex and continues to evolve. Mainland China’s direct selling and anti-pyramiding regulations contain various restrictions, including a prohibition on the payment of multi-level compensation. The regulations are subject to discretionary interpretation by state, provincial and local regulators as well as local customs and practices. Regulators continue to act cautiously as they monitor the development of direct selling in Mainland China. To expand our direct selling model into additional provinces in Mainland China, we currently must obtain a series of approvals from the local Department of Commerce in such provinces, the Shanghai Municipal Commission of Commerce (our supervisory authority), as well as the Ministry of Commerce, PRC (“MOFCOM”), which is the national governmental authority overseeing direct selling. In the course of obtaining these approvals, the respective authorities under MOFCOM must also consult and seek opinions on our business operations from the Ministry of Public Security and the Administration for Market Regulation at both provincial and state levels. Government authorities have not been issuing new licenses for direct selling since the beginning of the 100-day action in early 2019.

Our operations in Mainland China are subject to significant government and media scrutiny and investigations. At times, investigations and other regulatory actions have limited our ability to conduct business in Mainland China. For example, the government’s scrutiny of activities within the health products and direct selling industries has been at higher levels since 2019, following negative media coverage about the healthcare-related product claims made by another direct selling company in Mainland China. During this time, we have been receiving and addressing an increased number of government reviews, inspections, and inquiries and consumer complaints in Mainland China; our ability to hold certain business meetings has been limited; and negative media coverage has spread to include additional companies, including ours. Another example occurred in 2014. In response to media and government scrutiny of our Mainland China business in 2014, we voluntarily took a number of actions in Mainland China, including temporarily suspending our business meetings, temporarily suspending acceptance of applications for any new sales representatives, and extending our product refund and return policies. These voluntary measures and the adverse publicity had a significant negative impact on our business. We face a risk that future investigations and other regulatory actions may result in fines, revocation of licenses or other significant sanctions.

 

Several markets, including Mainland China, South Korea, Indonesia and Vietnam, impose limits on the amount of sales compensation we can pay to our sales force. For example, under regulations in Mainland China, direct selling companies may pay independent direct sellers in Mainland China up to a maximum 30% of the revenue they generate through their own sales of products to consumers. Additionally, in South Korea, local regulations limit sales compensation to 35% of our total value of goods or services supplied in South Korea. We have implemented various measures to comply with these limits.

In some markets, regulations applicable to the activities of our Sales Leaders may affect our business because we are, or regulators may assert that we are, responsible for our Sales Leaders’ conduct. In these markets, regulators may request or require that we take steps to ensure that our Sales Leaders comply with local regulations. For example, in Japan, we have taken steps to comply with strict requirements regarding how Brand Affiliates approach prospective customers. From time to time, we receive information from consumer centers in certain prefectures about the number of general inquiries and complaints about us and our Brand Affiliates. Based on this information, we continually evaluate and enhance our Brand Affiliate compliance, education and training efforts in Japan.

Our sales force is required to comply with work authorization and other local legal requirements prior to working in a market. Some markets, including Mainland China and Vietnam, also prohibit or restrict participation of overseas personnel or foreigners in direct selling activities. We have implemented policies that are designed to comply with these regulations and inform our sales force regarding the types of activities that are not permitted. However, we cannot assure that actions of our sales force will not violate local laws or regulations or our policies.

Please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for more information on regulatory and other risks associated with our business.
 
Product Regulations

Our personal care and wellness products and related promotional and marketing activities are subject to extensive government regulation by numerous federal, state and local government agencies and authorities, including the United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), the FTC, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Department of Agriculture, United States and State Attorneys General and other state regulatory agencies in the United States, as well as the State Administration for Market Regulation in Mainland China, the Food and Drug Administration in Taiwan, the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety in South Korea, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan and similar government agencies in all other markets in which we operate. In the United States, the FDA, in particular, regulates the formulation, manufacture and labeling of over-the-counter (“OTC”) drugs, cosmetics, dietary supplements, foods and medical devices such as those distributed by us.
Regulation of Personal Care Products in the United States. Our personal care products are subject to various laws and regulations that regulate cosmetic and personal care products and set forth regulations that, among other things, determine whether a product can be marketed as a “cosmetic” or requires further approval as an OTC drug. In the United States, the regulation of cosmetic content and labeling is under the primary jurisdiction of the FDA. Cosmetics are not subject to pre-market approval by the FDA, but their ingredients and their label and labeling content are regulated by the FDA, and it is the burden of those who sell cosmetics to ensure that they are safe for use as directed and not adulterated or misbranded. The labeling of cosmetic products is subject to the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act and other FDA regulations.

The FDCA defines cosmetics by their intended use, as “articles intended to be rubbed, poured, sprinkled, or sprayed on, introduced into, or otherwise applied to the human body . . . for cleansing, beautifying, promoting attractiveness, or altering the appearance.” Among the products included in this definition are skin moisturizers, perfumes, lipsticks, fingernail polishes, eye and facial makeup preparations, shampoos, permanent waves, hair colors, toothpastes and deodorants, as well as material intended for use as a component of a cosmetic product. A product may be considered a drug if it is intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or is intended to affect the structure or any function of the body (“structure/function claims”). A product’s intended use can be inferred from marketing or product claims, and regulators may consider the marketing claims of our sales force. Structure/function claims are generally prohibited for cosmetic products as are disease prevention and treatment claims. The FDA prohibits certain ingredients from being included in cosmetic products. It is possible that cosmetic product ingredients now commonly in use that are the product of certain scientific advancements or production processes may be restricted or prohibited in the future as more is learned about such ingredients.

 

In recent years, the FDA has issued warning letters to many cosmetic companies alleging improper structure/function claims regarding their cosmetic products, including, for example, product claims regarding gene activity, cellular rejuvenation, and rebuilding collagen. Cosmetic companies confront difficulty in determining whether a claim would be considered by the FDA to be an improper structure/function claim. Given this difficulty, and our research and product development focus on the sources of aging and the influence of certain ingredients on gene expression, there is a risk that we could receive a warning letter, be required to modify our product claims or take other actions to satisfy the FDA if the FDA determines any of our marketing materials contain improper structure/function claims for our cosmetic products. In addition, plaintiffs’ lawyers have filed class action lawsuits against some of our competitors after our competitors received these FDA warning letters. There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to government actions or lawsuits, which could harm our business.

Certain products, such as sunscreens and acne treatments, are classified as OTC drugs (and cosmetics, depending on claims) and have specific ingredient, labeling and manufacturing requirements. OTC drug products may be marketed if they conform to the requirements of an FDA-established OTC drug monograph that is applicable to that drug. Drug products not conforming to monograph requirements require an approved New Drug Application (“NDA”) before marketing may begin. Under these provisions, if the agency were to find that a product or ingredient of one of our OTC drug products is not generally recognized as safe and effective or is not included in a final monograph that is applicable to one of our OTC drug products, we may be required to reformulate or cease marketing that product until it is the subject of an approved NDA or until the time, if ever, that the monograph is amended to include such product. The labeling of these products is subject to the requirements of the FDCA and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act and other FDA regulations.
 
Regulation of Personal Care Products in Other Markets. The other markets in which we operate have similar regulations. In Mainland China, personal care products, other than devices, are placed into one of two categories, “special-purpose cosmetics” and “non-special-purpose cosmetics.” Products in both categories require submission of formulas and other information with the health authorities, and certain products require human clinical studies. The product registration process for some categories of personal care products in Mainland China can be unpredictable and generally takes from 9 to 18 months to complete. However, in some cases, product registration in Mainland China has taken several years. In Japan, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare regulates the sale and distribution of cosmetics and requires us to have an import business license and to register each personal care product imported into Japan. In Taiwan, all “medicated” cosmetic products require registration. In South Korea, all “functional” cosmetics are required to either undergo examination by or be reported to the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety. The sale of cosmetic products is regulated in the European Union (the “EU”) under the EU Cosmetics Directive, which requires a uniform application for foreign companies making personal care product sales. Similar regulations in any of our markets may limit our ability to import products or utilize key ingredients or technologies globally and may delay product launches while the registration and approval process is pending. Changing regulations may require us to stop selling, discontinue or reformulate and re-register products in order to sell those products.
Regulation of Wellness Products in the United States. Our wellness products are also subject to applicable regulations of government agencies in the markets in which we operate. In the United States, we generally market our wellness products as conventional foods or dietary supplements. The FDA has jurisdiction over this regulatory area. The FDA imposes specific requirements for the labels and labeling of food and dietary supplements, including the requirements of the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004, which mandates declaration of the presence of major food allergens. In addition, the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 contains requirements with regard to the sale and importation of food products in the United States.

The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (“FSMA”), which was signed into law in 2011, also increased the FDA’s authority with respect to food safety and made significant changes to the FDCA with respect to strengthening the U.S. food safety system. It enables the FDA to focus more on preventing food safety problems rather than primarily reacting to problems after they occur. The law also provides the FDA with enforcement authorities designed to achieve higher rates of compliance with prevention- and risk-based food safety standards and to better respond to and contain problems when they do occur. The law also gives the FDA important tools to hold imported foods to the same standards as domestic foods and directs the FDA to build an integrated national food safety system in partnership with state and local authorities. The FDA is actively enforcing FSMA requirements, subjecting food and nutritional supplements to increased regulatory scrutiny. Pursuant to FSMA, the FDA is authorized, among other things, to order mandatory recalls, issue “administrative detention” orders, and revoke manufacturing facility registrations (effectively preventing the operation of a food or dietary supplement manufacturing facility), and importers of foods and nutritional supplements are subject to Foreign Supplier Verification Program requirements.

 

The FDA regulates dietary supplements principally under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (“DSHEA”). DSHEA formally defines what may be sold as a dietary supplement, defines statements of nutritional support and the conditions under which they may lawfully be used, and includes provisions that permit the FDA to regulate manufacturing practices and labeling claims applicable to dietary supplements. Because the majority of our wellness products are regulated under DSHEA, we are generally not required to obtain regulatory approval prior to introducing a dietary supplement into the United States market. Prior to marketing a product, we are obligated to notify the FDA of any structure/function claims that we intend to make about the product in any product-related materials.

Generally, under DSHEA, dietary ingredients that were on the market before October 15, 1994 may be used in dietary supplements without notifying the FDA. However, a “new” dietary ingredient (i.e., a dietary ingredient that was not marketed in the United States before October 15, 1994) must be the subject of a new dietary ingredient notification submitted to the FDA unless the ingredient has been “present in the food supply as an article used for food” without having been “chemically altered.” The enforcement of the term “chemically altered” has been and continues to evolve within the FDA. As such, an ingredient that is deemed today not to be “chemically altered” may be viewed otherwise in the future, which could lead to our being required to reformulate or cease marketing the product until such time that we can find a suitable replacement. A new dietary ingredient notification must provide the FDA with evidence of a “history of use or other evidence of safety” which establishes that use of the dietary ingredient “will reasonably be expected to be safe.” A new dietary ingredient notification must be submitted to the FDA at least 75 days before the new dietary ingredient can be marketed. Under DSHEA, the FDA may seek to remove from the market any new dietary ingredient that the FDA determines to be unsafe. In addition, the FDA may also deem a dietary supplement an unapproved drug where the marketing claims made in connection with the sale or promotion of the product effectively place it in the drug category.
 
Regulation of Nutritional Products Globally. In our foreign markets, nutritional supplements are generally regulated by similar government agencies, such as the Mainland China State Administration for Market Regulation, the South Korea Ministry of Food and Drug Safety; the Japan Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare and the Taiwan Department of Health. We typically market our wellness products in international markets as foods, health foods, dietary supplements, food supplements or other similar categorizations under applicable regulatory regimes. With few exceptions, in the event a product or ingredient is classified as a drug or pharmaceutical product in any market, we will generally not be able to distribute that product in that market through our distribution channel because of pre-market approvals and strict regulations applicable to drug and pharmaceutical products. Mainland China also has highly restrictive nutritional supplement product regulations. Products marketed as “health foods” are subject to extensive laboratory and clinical analysis by government authorities, and the product registration process in Mainland China takes a minimum of two years and may be substantially longer. In some cases it has taken us four years or longer to obtain product registrations. A pre-market process has been established for “health foods,” which allows products with only basic nutritional ingredients (some vitamins and minerals) to be notified rather than registered. We market both “health foods” and “general foods” in Mainland China. There is some risk associated with the common practice in Mainland China of marketing a product as a “general food” while seeking “health food” classification. If government officials feel the categorization of our products is inconsistent with product claims, form of delivery, ingredients or function, this could end or limit our ability to market such products in Mainland China in their current form. In addition, we are not permitted to market or sell “general foods” through our direct sales channel in Mainland China and any efforts by our independent direct sellers to do so could result in negative publicity, fines and other government sanctions being imposed against us.

The markets in which we operate all have varied regulations that distinguish foods and nutritional supplements from “pharmaceutical products.” Because of the varied regulations, some products or ingredients that are recognized as a “food” in certain markets may be treated as a “pharmaceutical” in other markets. In Japan, for example, if a specified ingredient is not listed as a “food” by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, we must either modify the product to eliminate or substitute that ingredient, or petition the government to treat such ingredient as a food. We experience similar issues in our other markets. This is particularly a challenge in Europe, where regulations often still differ from member state to member state, despite EU regulations designed to harmonize the laws of EU member states. As a result, we often must modify the ingredients and/or the levels of ingredients in our products for certain markets, or create unique formulations for multiple markets. In some circumstances, the regulations in foreign markets may require us to obtain regulatory approval prior to introduction of a new product or limit our use of certain ingredients altogether.

Because of negative publicity associated with some adulterated or misbranded supplements, including pharmaceutical drugs marketed as dietary supplements, there has been an increased movement in the United States and other markets to expand the regulation of dietary supplements, which could lead to additional restrictions or requirements in the future. In general, the regulatory environment is becoming more complex with increasingly stricter regulations each year.
 
 

Manufacturing Process. In 2008, and as subsequently updated under the regulations implementing the FSMA, the FDA established regulations to require current “good manufacturing practices” for dietary supplements and food products in the United States. The regulations ensure that dietary supplements and food products are produced in a quality manner, do not contain contaminants or impurities above pre-established levels, and are accurately labeled. The regulations include requirements for establishing quality control procedures for us and our vendors and suppliers, designing and constructing manufacturing plants, and testing ingredients and finished products throughout our supply chain. The regulations also include requirements for record keeping and handling consumer product complaints. If dietary supplements or food products contain contaminants or allergens or do not contain the type or quantity of dietary ingredient they are represented to contain, the FDA would consider those products to be adulterated or misbranded. Our business is subject to additional FDA regulations, such as new dietary ingredient regulations and adverse event reporting regulations that require us to document and track adverse events and report serious adverse events that involve hospitalization, permanent impairment or death associated with consumers’ use of certain of our products. Compliance with these regulations has increased, and may further increase, the cost of manufacturing and selling certain of our products as we incur internal costs, oversee and inspect more aspects of third-party manufacturing and work with our vendors to assure they are in compliance and maintain accurate recordkeeping to establish controls. Failure to comply with good manufacturing practices could also result in product recalls.
Advertising and Product Claims. Most of our major markets also regulate advertising and product claims regarding the efficacy and quality of products and require adequate and reliable scientific substantiation of all claims. In most of our foreign markets, we are typically not able to make any “medicinal” claims with respect to our wellness products. In some cases, such regulations may limit our ability to inform consumers of some of the benefits our products offer.

In the United States, the FDA generally prohibits disease diagnosis, prevention and treatment claims when made for a dietary supplement. DSHEA, however, permits substantiated, truthful and non-misleading “statements of nutritional support” to be included in labeling for dietary supplements without FDA pre-approval. Such statements may describe how a particular dietary ingredient affects the structure, function or general well-being of the body, or the mechanism of action by which a dietary ingredient may affect the structure, function or well-being of the body, but such statements may not state that a dietary supplement will reduce the risk or incidence of a disease unless such claim has been reviewed and approved by the FDA. In addition, the FDA permits companies to use FDA-approved full and qualified health claims for products containing specific ingredients that meet stated requirements.

A company that uses a statement of nutritional support in labeling must possess evidence substantiating that the statement is truthful and not misleading. The FDA has issued guidance defining a manufacturer’s obligations to substantiate structure/function claims. Such statements, when used in labeling, must also be submitted to the FDA no later than thirty days after first marketing the product with the statement that they possess the necessary evidence and must be accompanied by an FDA mandated label disclaimer that “This statement has not been evaluated by the FDA. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease.” There can be no assurance, however, that the FDA or FTC will not determine that a particular statement of nutritional support that we want to use is an unacceptable disease claim or an unauthorized nutrient-disease relationship claim otherwise permitted with FDA approval as a “health claim” or that such claims have competent and reliable scientific evidence. Such a determination might prevent the use of such a claim or result in additional FDA enforcement.

We are aware of media reports regarding dietary supplements, which call for the repeal or amendment of DSHEA. Individuals or groups that are opposed to supplements or question their safety or efficacy may attempt to use these media reports to propose legislation intended to amend or repeal DSHEA. Some of the legislative proposals may include variations on premarket approval, enhanced premarket safety or substantiation required and changing the definition of a “dietary ingredient” to remove either botanicals or selected classes of ingredients now treated as dietary ingredients.

Most of the other markets in which we operate have not adopted legislation like DSHEA, and we may be subject to more restrictive limitations on the claims we can make about our products in these markets. For example, in Japan, our nutritional supplements are marketed as food products, which significantly limits our ability to make claims regarding these products. If marketing materials produced or used by us or our sales force globally make claims that exceed the scope of allowed claims for nutritional supplements, the FDA or other regulatory authorities could deem our products to be unapproved drugs. In Mainland China, we also face significant restrictions on our ability to make product claims regarding the efficacy of our products. Violations, alleged violations, or negative media attention related to our compliance with these restrictions could harm consumers’ perception of our business and products and could negatively impact the registration, licensing status and sales of our products.

 

The FTC, which exercises primary jurisdiction over the advertising of all of our products in the United States, has instituted enforcement actions against dietary supplement, food, and cosmetic companies for, among other things, deceptive advertising and lack of adequate scientific substantiation for claims. We also face limitations on our use of the scientific experts who have helped us develop and test some of our products. In the United States, for example, the FTC’s Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising may restrict marketing to those results obtained by a “typical” consumer and require disclosure of any material connections between an endorser and the company or products they are endorsing. In Mainland China, some media outlets have questioned the nature and extent of our connections with our Scientific Advisory Board and others who have helped in developing our scientific approach or testing our products. This negative publicity could harm consumers’ perception of our business and our products, which could negatively impact our revenue. We cannot be sure that the FTC, or comparable foreign agencies, will not question our advertising or other operations in the future.

In recent years, the FTC has initiated numerous investigations of and actions against companies that sell dietary supplements and cosmetic products. The FTC may enforce compliance with the law in a variety of ways, both administratively and judicially, using compulsory process, cease and desist orders, and injunctions. FTC enforcement can result in consent decrees or orders requiring, among other things, injunctive provisions, corrective advertising, consumer redress, and such other relief as the agency deems necessary to protect the public. Violation of these consent decrees or orders could result in substantial financial or other penalties. The FTC also sends warning letters as it monitors companies’ activities. For example, during 2020 the FTC issued letters that warned several direct-selling companies to remove and address claims that they or members of their sales force were making about their products’ ability to treat or prevent COVID-19 and/or about the earnings that people who have recently lost income could make. No assurance can be given that the FTC will not question our advertising or other operations in the United States in the future. Any action in the future by the FTC could materially and adversely affect our ability to successfully market our products in the United States.

In connection with investigations that occurred in the early 1990s of certain alleged unsubstantiated product and earnings claims made by our Brand Affiliates, we entered into a consent decree with the FTC and various agreements with state regulatory agencies. The consent decree requires us to, among other things, supplement our procedures to enforce our policies, not allow our Brand Affiliates to make earnings representations without making certain average earnings disclosures and not allow our Brand Affiliates to make unsubstantiated product claims. The FTC could initiate an enforcement action to the extent the FTC determines that our advertising or promotional practices are deceptive or contrary to the requirements of the consent decree.
 
Regulation of Medical Devices. In 2014, our facial spa was cleared for marketing through the 510(k) process with the FDA as a medical device with cosmetic benefit. Medical devices are highly regulated by the FDA. Manufacturers of medical devices must register and list their products with the FDA annually, whether they are located domestically or overseas. Foreign jurisdictions may take note of the fact that we have registered a medical device in the United States and require us to register in their market as well. The FDA has broad regulatory powers in the areas of clinical testing, manufacturing and labeling of medical devices. Medical devices must be labeled in accordance with the FDA’s general device labeling requirements and whatever particular label requirements the FDA may designate for that type of device.

In addition, medical device manufacturers must adhere to certain “good manufacturing practices” in accordance with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, which regulates the manufacture of medical devices, prescribes record-keeping procedures and provides for the routine inspection of facilities for compliance with such regulations. If in connection with these inspections, the FDA believes the manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulations and/or procedures, it may issue observations that would necessitate prompt corrective action. If the FDA inspection observations are not addressed and/or corrective action taken in a timely manner and to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA may issue a warning letter (which would similarly necessitate prompt corrective action) and/or proceed directly to other forms of enforcement action. Failure to respond timely to FDA inspection observations, a warning letter or other notice of noncompliance and to promptly come into compliance could result in the FDA bringing enforcement action against us, which could include the shutdown of our production facilities, denial of importation rights to the United States for products manufactured in overseas locations and criminal and civil fines.

 

Our Pharmanex BioPhotonic Scanner, ageLOC LumiSpa, ageLOC Boost, ageLOC Spa systems and any future devices may be subject to the regulations of various health, consumer-protection and other government authorities around the world. These regulations vary from market to market and affect whether our products are required to be registered as medical devices, the claims that can be made with respect to these products, who can use them, and where they can be used. We have been required to register our ageLOC Spa systems as medical devices in a few markets, and we intend to register ageLOC Boost as a medical device in the United States and Thailand. We have been subject to regulatory inquiries in the United States, Japan and other markets with respect to the status of the Pharmanex BioPhotonic Scanner as a non-medical device. Any determination that medical device clearance is required for one of our products, in a market where we currently market and sell such product as a cosmetic or non-medical device, could require us to expend significant time and resources in order to meet the additional stringent standards imposed on medical device companies or prevent us from marketing the product.

Under applicable direct selling regulations in Mainland China, our Pharmanex BioPhotonic Scanner, ageLOC LumiSpa and ageLOC Spa systems are registered as “health care equipment” or “household appliances,” which enables us to market and sell them through our direct sales channel in that market. The process for registering products for the direct sales channel in Mainland China is subject to delays. However, this process and registration requirement do not apply to all of our sales channels in Mainland China; although our independent direct sellers are prohibited from earning commissions by selling products that are not so registered, sales by our sales employees or independent marketers are not subject to this requirement. Please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for more information on the regulatory risks associated with our device products.
 
COMPETITION

Direct Selling

We compete with other direct selling organizations, some of which have a longer operating history, and greater visibility, name recognition and financial resources than we do. Leading global direct selling companies include Amway, Avon Products and Herbalife. We also compete with local direct selling companies in the markets in which we operate. We compete with these companies to attract and retain our sales force and consumers based on the strength of our product offerings, sales compensation, multiple business opportunities, management and international operations.
Products

The markets for our products are highly competitive. Our competitors include a broad array of marketers of personal care and nutritional products and pharmaceutical companies, such as L’Oréal, Clinique, Estée Lauder, Nature’s Way, Avon Products and Mary Kay, many of which have longer operating histories and greater name recognition and financial resources than we do. We compete in these markets by emphasizing the innovation, value and premium quality of our products and the reach, convenience and customer servicing of our distribution system.
HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES

As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 5,000 full- and part-time employees worldwide. This does not include approximately 21,000 sales employees in our Mainland China operations. Although we have statutory employee representation obligations in certain markets, our employees are generally not represented by labor unions except where expressly required by law. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good, and we do not foresee a shortage in qualified personnel necessary to operate our business.

All of our full- and part-time employees are responsible for upholding the Nu Skin Code of Conduct and for striving to perpetuate the Nu Skin Way, our global culture aspiration, which includes the following principles:


● A force for good | ● Direct and decisive 
-------------------------------------+-------------------------------
● Accountable and empowered | ● Exceptional 
● Bold innovators | ● Fast speed 
● Customer obsessed | ● One global team 


The Nu Skin Way forms the foundation of our human capital strategy and objectives. The three primary objectives of our human capital strategy are:

 
1. | Support the transformation of our business and culture to align with our business strategies and the Nu Skin Way;
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Leverage global diversity and build inclusion; and
---+---------------------------------------------------


3. | Simplify the employee experience through global alignment and optimization.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

To measure our progress in achieving these objectives, we conduct a quarterly global employee survey, which also gathers employee feedback for purposes of designing our talent programs, rewards and benefits. Averaging an approximately 90% response rate during 2020, this survey generates valuable information for us to analyze and to act upon when appropriate. This survey yielded more than 60,000 data points each quarter, consisting of employee responses to each survey question. We also conducted focus groups with our employees to gather their feedback on the employee experience, including diversity and inclusion matters.

We regularly review our employees’ feedback to better align our human capital initiatives to the needs of our employees. For example, after receiving employee feedback that pointed toward a need to establish a more comprehensive diversity, equity and inclusion strategy, we hired a global head of diversity and inclusion and began conducting a periodic “Listen and Learn” series of employee panels to bring our workforce into a more inclusive experience. These and other diversity-related initiatives have helped us to achieve employee engagement scores in the top quintile of global companies of a similar size.

Our Board’s committees engage with our senior management and head of Human Resources regarding human capital management on a regular basis. Working with management, our Board’s committees oversee and receive reports on matters including culture, compensation, benefits, key talent succession planning, employee engagement, and diversity and inclusion. Each year, our management also reports to the Executive Compensation Committee on management’s annual assessment of risks related to our compensation policies and practices. In addition, our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee conducts annual performance reviews for our key executive officers, and these performance reviews include their performance on human capital management initiatives.

Evidencing the success of our human capital management initiatives, in 2020 we were recognized by the Direct Selling News as one of the best places to work in direct selling, the fifth consecutive year we have received this honor.

In addition to our employees, our human capital resources also include our sales force. For information about our sales force, see Item 1. Business—“Distribution Channel.”
