ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 
Overview 
 
We are a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of novel inhaled therapeutic products intended to prevent and treat respiratory and other diseases with significant unmet medical needs.
 
We design and develop inhaled therapeutic products based on our proprietary dry powder delivery technology, iSPERSE™ (inhaled Small Particles Easily Respirable and Emitted), which enables delivery of small or large molecule drugs to the lungs by inhalation for local or systemic applications. The iSPERSE powders are engineered to be small, dense particles with highly efficient dispersibility and delivery to airways. iSPERSE powders can be used with an array of dry powder inhaler technologies and can be formulated with a broad range of drug substances including small molecules and biologics. We believe the iSPERSE dry powder technology offers enhanced drug loading and delivery efficiency that outperforms traditional lactose-blend inhaled dry powder therapies. We believe the advantages of using the iSPERSE technology include reduced total inhaled powder mass, enhanced dosing efficiency, reduced cost of goods and improved safety and tolerability profiles. We are developing iSPERSE-based therapeutic candidates targeted at the prevention and treatment of a range of diseases, including allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (“ABPA”) in patients with asthma, and in patients with cystic fibrosis (“CF”), lung cancer, and in patients suffering from neurological diseases such as acute migraine.
 
Corporate History 
 
We were incorporated in 2013 as a Delaware corporation. Our resources are focused on the development of novel inhaled therapeutic products intended to prevent and treat respiratory diseases and other diseases where inhaled drug delivery offers a potential therapeutic advantage.
Business Strategy 
 
Our goal is to develop breakthrough therapeutic products that are safe, convenient, and more efficient than the existing therapeutic products for respiratory and other diseases where iSPERSE properties are advantageous.
 
The iSPERSE technology may potentially improve upon the known efficacy and safety profile of currently available therapies. Our current pipeline is aligned to this goal with the Pulmazole program for inhaled antifungal therapy to treat ABPA in patients with asthma, the PUR3100 program for treatment of acute migraine, and the PUR1800 program, which has potential application in both lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (“COPD”). All of these programs leverage improvements provided by iSPERSE. We intend to capitalize on our iSPERSE technology platform and our expertise in inhaled therapeutics to identify new product candidates for the prevention and treatment of diseases with significant unmet medical needs and to build our product pipeline beyond our existing candidates. In order to advance clinical trials for our therapeutic candidates and leverage the iSPERSE platform to enable delivery of partnered compounds, we intend to form strategic alliances with third parties, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies or academic or private research institutes.
 
We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for at least the next several years based on our drug development plans. We expect our expenses and capital requirements will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, as we:

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We will continue to direct resources to advance the research and development of Pulmazole for ABPA in patients with asthma and CF. In 2018, we successfully conducted clinical testing of Pulmazole in normal healthy volunteers and asthma patients. In 2019, we began a Phase 2 study of Pulmazole with patients who have asthma and are suffering from ABPA but stopped the Phase 2 study due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on enrollment. In January 2021, we conducted a Type-C meeting with the U.S Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) to discuss our plans for a Phase 2b study. Utilizing the FDA feedback, we now intend to advance Pulmazole into a Phase 2b efficacy study that will include a sixteen-week dosing regimen, rather than the four weeks dosing regimen in the terminated Phase 2 study.
 

● | Focus on the development of an inhaled kinase inhibitor for lung cancer prevention treatment. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We completed preclinical safety studies for our lead iSPERSE formulation in 2018 and advanced our formulation and process development efforts to support clinical testing in stable moderate-severe COPD patients. In 2019, Pulmatrix entered into a License, Development and Commercialization Agreement for PUR1800, an inhaled kinase inhibitor with Johnson & Johnson Enterprise Innovation, Inc. (“JJEI”). In February 2021, we successfully dosed the first patient with PUR1800, in a Phase 1b study in patients with stable COPD. The Phase 1b study data is anticipated in the fourth quarter 2021. JJEI retains an option for a worldwide license to develop and commercialize PUR1800 and other kinase inhibitors as part of its Lung Cancer Initiative.

We developed PUR3100, an iSPERSE formulation of DHE in 2020 and completed a pharmacokinetic study in dogs in January 2021. We will continue to direct resources to advance the research and development of PUR3100 in treatment of acute migraine including completion of preclinical safety studies in 2021 to enable a Phase 1/Phase 2 study start in Q1 2022.

To add additional inhaled therapeutics to our discovery pipeline and facilitate additional discovery collaborations, we are leveraging our iSPERSE technology and our management’s expertise in inhaled therapeutics and particle engineering to identify potential product candidates. These potential product candidates are potentially safer and more effective than the current standard of care for prevention and treatment of diseases with significant unmet medical needs.
 

● | Invest in protecting and expanding our intellectual property portfolio and file for additional patents to strengthen our intellectual property rights. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The status of our patent portfolio changes frequently in the ordinary course of patent prosecution. As of December 31, 2020, our patent portfolio related to iSPERSE included approximately 112 granted patents, 16 of which are granted US patents, with expiration dates from 2024 to 2034, and approximately 61 additional pending patent applications in the US and other jurisdictions. Our in-licensed portfolio related to kinase inhibitors included approximately 241 granted patents, 31 of which are granted US patents, with expiration dates from 2029 to 2035, and approximately 42 additional pending patent applications in the US and other jurisdictions. On March 3, 2021 we filed a provisional patent application in the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) that discloses and claims certain formulations and methods of use relevant to our PUR3100 program. We plan to file an international patent application under the patent cooperation treaty, or PCT, based on the provisional patent application by the applicable deadline.


iSPERSE Technology 
 
We use simple, safe excipients, including proprietary cationic salt formulations, to create a robust and flexible dry powder platform technology that can accommodate a wide range of drug loads in highly dispersible particles. Our initial delivery platform emerged from development of iCALM™ (inhaled Cationic Airway Lining Modulators), a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory therapy. The high degree of aerosol efficiency and the density profile of our dry powder iCALM formulations provided the foundation for our development of iSPERSE in 2012, which uses other monovalent and divalent salts.
 
iSPERSE particles are engineered with a small, dense and dispersible profile to exceed the performance of traditional dry powder particles as the iSPERSE particles have the dispersibility advantages of porous engineered particles. We believe this results in superior drug delivery compared to traditional oral and injectable forms of treatment for certain respiratory diseases. Unlike lactose-blended carrier formulations or low-density particles which disperse poorly, we believe that the iSPERSE technology platform offers several potential benefits, achieved through the following technological innovations:
 

● | Flexible drug loading for delivery of a single microgram to tens of milligrams per dose. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
iSPERSE particles can be engineered to include significantly less than one percent (1%) to greater than eighty percent (80%) active pharmaceutical ingredients (“APIs”), which allows flexibility for dosing both high potency and high-drug load therapeutics.
 

● | Superior flow rate independent lung delivery without carriers. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The iSPERSE technology enables pulmonary delivery independent of lactose or other carriers, which results in significantly greater lung dose at a matched nominal dose of conventional lactose-based formulations. iSPERSE formulations are dispersible across a range of flow rates with consistent emitted dose and particle size. Performance across flow rates provides reliable dose delivery across patient populations and reduces patient-to-patient variability.
 

● | Delivery of macromolecules and biologics. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
iSPERSE powders can be used with an array of dry powder inhaler technologies and can be formulated with a broad range of therapeutic compounds ranging from small molecules to proteins for both local and systemic drug delivery applications.
 

● | Homogenous combinations of multiple drugs. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
iSPERSE creates homogenous particles including excipients and API, which allow for the consistent delivery of multiple APIs in a product. We have successfully formulated iSPERSE-based products with dual and triple API combinations.
 

● | Strong safety profile. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------

 
Current iSPERSE products and planned clinical stage products to be formulated in iSPERSE are supported by robust preclinical safety profiles. iSPERSE excipients include those with inhalation precedent and those that are generally regarded as safe (“GRAS”) by other routes of administration.

Therapeutic Candidates 
 
Pulmazole 
 
We are developing iSPERSE-based inhaled formulations of anti-fungal drugs for the prevention and treatment of fungal infections and allergic/hypersensitivity reactions to fungus in patients with severe lung disease, including those with asthma and CF. On January 28, 2020, Pulmazole received Fast Track designation from the FDA for the treatment of ABPA. Aspergillus colonization and infections are likely underdiagnosed and occur frequently in patients of all ages. Colonization and infection with Aspergillus spp. can lead to clinical disease with differing severities and complications depending on the immune status of the host. Invasive aspergillosis is a frequently fatal disease that occurs in patients that are typically immune suppressed as a result of treatment for hematologic cancers or immunosuppression prior to solid organ transplantation. In patients with asthma and CF, Aspergillus can cause chronic infections that may be associated with worsening disease and larger declines in lung function than patients without infection. A subset of patients with asthma and CF with Aspergillus colonization and/or infection develop ABPA, which is a complex hypersensitivity reaction to fungal antigens. ABPA is a disease resulting in mucus production, wheezing, pulmonary infiltrates, worsening bronchiectasis, and fibrosis of the lung.
 
In patients with both asthma and CF, ABPA is commonly treated with oral steroids to treat inflammation and with oral antifungals to reduce fungal infection. The inhalation administration of a drug affords direct delivery of the drug to the infected parts of the lung, maximizing the dose to the affected sites and minimizing systemic exposure to the rest of the body where it could cause significant side effects. Therefore, treatment of lung infections by direct administration of anti-infective products to the lung may improve both the safety and efficacy of treatment compared to systemic administration by other routes, as well as improving patient convenience as compared to oral and injectable forms of the treatment. We believe that local lung delivery by inhalation of our iSPERSE formulation could provide convenient, effective and safe management of the debilitating and often life-threatening lung infections that are not currently addressed by inhaled therapies.
 
Pulmazole is our inhaled formulation of itraconazole, an anti-fungal drug commercially available as an oral drug that we are developing to treat and prevent pulmonary fungal infections. Development of Pulmazole is focused on treatment of Aspergillus spp. colonization and infection in patients with asthma and CF. In a Phase 1/1b clinical trial, Pulmazole appeared to be safe and well tolerated in healthy normal volunteers (Parts 1 and 2) and in patients with asthma (Part 3). In Part 3 of the Phase 1/1b study, following a single dose of Pulmazole, the pharmacokinetics (“PK”) analysis of sputum samples demonstrated ~70-fold higher maximum lung concentration of itraconazole following inhalation of Pulmazole compared to oral Sporanox® (Janssen Pharmaceuticals) despite inhaling only one tenth the dose of itraconazole (20 mg) relative to the dose of oral Sporanox (200 mg). Lung exposure, as measured by sputum induction and analysis, was approximately 50-fold higher and plasma exposure was approximately 85-fold lower following inhalation of 20 mg of Pulmazole compared to 200 mg of oral Sporanox. All endpoints from the Phase 1/1b study were successfully met.
 
On April 15, 2019, we entered into a Development and Commercialization Agreement (the “Cipla Agreement”) with Cipla Technologies LLC (“Cipla”) for the co-development and commercialization, on a worldwide exclusive basis, of Pulmazole, our inhaled iSPERSE drug delivery system enabled formulation of the antifungal drug, itraconazole, which is only available as an oral drug, for the treatment of all pulmonary indications, including ABPA in patients with asthma. In July of 2019, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical study for Pulmazole. Due to delays in patient enrollment in the Phase 2 clinical study, exacerbated by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Cipla informed us that it desired to amend the Cipla Agreement. In connection with our renegotiation of the Cipla Agreement, on July 10, 2020, the Pulmatrix/Cipla steering committee recommended the termination of the Phase 2 study due the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
We conducted a Type C meeting with the FDA on January 27, 2021 and leveraging the insights gained from this meeting, now plan to commence the Phase 2b study when the risks of study conduct presented by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic are reduced to an acceptable level. The Phase 2b study design includes a 16-week dosing regimen as well as an exploration of potential efficacy endpoints, whereas the terminated Phase 2 study comprised only a 4-week dosing regimen with safety and tolerability as its primary endpoint. The longer dosing regimen of the planned new Phase 2b study is supported by the 6-month inhalation toxicology study in dogs completed in April 2020.
 
In addition to the planned new Phase 2b study, as part of the contemplated amendments to the Cipla Agreement, we may assign to Cipla the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize Pulmazole in India, South Africa and other regional markets where Cipla has strong clinical development and business capabilities. We have not agreed to any amendments to the Cipla Agreement as of the date of the filing this Annual Report. However, we expect that discussions regarding amendments to the Cipla Agreement will continue. No assurance can be given that we will be able to reach a mutually acceptable arrangement with Cipla for the conduct of the Phase 2b clinical study in the future. Accordingly, if we are unable to agree with Cipla on such matters such as cost sharing for the new study, we may be forced to suspend further development of Pulmazole.

Competition and Market Opportunities 
 
Current treatments of pulmonary fungal infections highlight the limitations of oral or intravenous anti-infective treatments for lung infections. Itraconazole is one of the most commonly prescribed therapies for treating Aspergillus spp. infections in patients with asthma and CF. Itraconazole is available commercially as Sporanox in both a capsule and oral solution form. Itraconazole is metabolized in the liver by CYP3A4 and coadministration with a large number of drugs is contraindicated due to the potential for severe drug-drug interactions.
 
We have demonstrated that Pulmazole achieves higher local lung itraconazole concentrations with significantly lower systemic exposure relative to oral dosing, thus allowing for the potential to improve upon both the efficacy and safety profiles observed with oral itraconazole. Furthermore, administration by inhalation significantly reduces the exposure of the drug in the rest of the body, which may be beneficial in reducing systemic side effects and the risk of potentially toxic drug-drug interactions.
 
There is precedent for both dry powder and nebulized inhaled anti-infective therapy to address specific pulmonary infections in patients which demonstrates potential utility of inhaled drug delivery and market opportunity. Mylan currently markets TOBI Podhaler for treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in the United States and Forest Laboratories U.K. Limited (a subsidiary of Actavis PLC) markets inhaled colistin, Colobreathe, for the same infection in Europe. Insmed currently markets Amikacin Liposome Inhalation Suspension (Arikayce) in the United States for the treatment of lung disease caused by a group of bacteria, Mycobacterium avium complex in a limited population of patients with the disease who do not respond to conventional treatment (refractory disease). Arikayce is the first drug to be approved under the Limited Population Pathway for Antibacterial and Antifungal Drugs, or LPAD pathway, established by Congress under the 21st Century Cures Act to advance development and approval of antibacterial and antifungal drugs to treat serious or life-threatening infections in a limited population of patients with unmet need. As required for drugs approved under the LPAD pathway, labeling for Arikayce includes certain statements to convey that the drug has been shown to be safe and effective only for use in a limited population. Arikayce was also approved under the Accelerated Approval pathway. Under this approach, the FDA may approve drugs for serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions where the drug is shown to have an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit to patients. The approval of Arikayce was based on achieving three consecutive negative monthly sputum cultures by month six of treatment. Insmed was required by the FDA to conduct an additional, post-market study to describe the clinical benefits of Arikayce. There are currently no products specifically approved for treatment of ABPA, however, there are several inhaled anti-fungal agents currently in early stages of development for invasive aspergillosis that could also have efficacy for ABPA.
 
New methods to detect Aspergillus spp. infection in sputum have improved the sensitivity of diagnosis and clinical appreciation for these infections. Pulmonary Aspergillus spp. infections affect approximately 14 million patients worldwide according to the Global Action Fund for Fungal Infections (Improving Outcomes for Patients with Fungal Infections across the World: A Road Map for the Next Decade). The majority of these cases occur in patients with asthma who have allergic disease and also include invasive Aspergillus spp. infections that are associated with a high rate of mortality in immunocompromised patients. We believe that Pulmazole compares favorably to the products discussed above and has the potential to generate significant value based on treating and preventing pulmonary fungal infections in multiple patient populations.
 
Clinical Development 
 
Pulmazole is our lead iSPERSE development program. We successfully completed a Phase 1/1b clinical study in 2018 which enabled us to initiate a Phase 2 study in 2019, entitled: “A Randomized, Double-Blind, Multicenter, Placebo-Controlled, Phase 2 Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of Itraconazole Administered as a Dry Powder for Inhalation (PUR1900) in Adult Asthmatic Patients with ABPA. This study was terminated in July 2020 due to the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patient enrollment and study conduct. The completion of a 6-month inhalation toxicology study in dogs in 2020 enables the conduct of a Phase 2b study that will allow for a 16-week dosing regimen and exploration of potential endpoints. This study can be initiated when conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic are favorable with respect to study conduct and patient enrollment. For more discussion of risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic, please see “Item 1A. RISK FACTORS.—Risks Related to Our Business—Business interruptions could limit our ability to operate our business.
 
PUR1800 
 
On June 9, 2017, we entered into an exclusive, worldwide license agreement (the “RespiVert License Agreement”) with RespiVert Ltd. (“RespiVert”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Janssen Biotech, Inc. (“Janssen”), and an affiliate of JJEI, for access to a portfolio of novel drug candidates in a class called kinase inhibitors. The RespiVert License Agreement terminates upon the expiration of the Company’s obligation to pay royalties for all licensed products, unless earlier terminated. In addition, the RespiVert License Agreement may be terminated (i) by the Company for any reason upon 120 days’ advance notice to RespiVert; (ii) by RespiVert upon receipt of notice from the Company of either voluntary or involuntary insolvency proceedings of the Company; and (iii) by either party for a material breach which remains uncured following the applicable cure period.
 
We successfully reformulated RV1162 into PUR1800. PUR1800 demonstrated the efficiency of the iSPERSE platform in non-clinical toxicology results which showed a significant increased lung dose compared to earlier formulations of RV1162 and improved physical /chemical stability of the product.
 
On December 26, 2019, Pulmatrix entered into a License, Development and Commercialization Agreement with JJEI (the “JJEI License Agreement”). Under the JJEI License Agreement, the Company has granted JJEI an option to acquire (1) the Company’s rights to an intellectual property portfolio of materials and technology related to narrow spectrum kinase inhibitor compounds and (2) an exclusive, worldwide, royalty bearing license to PUR1800.
 
In February 2021, the first patient was dosed in a Phase 1b safety, tolerability and biomarker study that will enroll 15 patients with stable moderate-severe COPD. The Phase 1b study will be randomized and double-blind and will include 14 days of daily dosing with a 28 day follow up period. The COVID-19 pandemic could delay enrollment to the extent patients remain or become subject to government “stay at home” mandates, patients feel like they cannot safely visit trial sites or patients drop out due issues related to COVID-19.
 
Clinical Development 
 
Studies conducted by RespiVert/Janssen for the small molecule formulated in PUR1800 (previously RV1162) demonstrated that the molecule has been well tolerated for up to 14 days of dosing in patients with COPD. Analysis of sputum collected from patients with COPD treated with RV1162 showed reduced levels of p38 phosphorylation in sputum cells and decreases in the number of neutrophils recovered in sputum after 12 days of dosing. These findings suggest that inhalation of RV1162 may confer anti-inflammatory benefits after a short dosing regimen.

The ongoing Phase1b study of an iSPERSE formulation, PUR1800, in patients with stable moderate-severe COPD, is intended to show similar results as the Phase 1/1b clinical study of RV1162 conducted by Janssen (Janssen Study EST001, ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01970618), while demonstrating safety and tolerability of PUR1800 in patients with stable COPD. As we conduct the Phase 1b study of PUR1800, we continue to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our studies and current timeline. An increase of COVID-19 cases where we are conducting the Phase 1b study may delay enrollment of patients and divert healthcare resources from our study. We cannot predict the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our clinical trials. However, it could result in a delay or indefinite suspension of the trials. For more discussion of risks related to coronavirus, please see “Item 1A. RISK FACTORS.—Risks Related to Our Business—Business interruptions could limit our ability to operate our business.
 
PUR5700 
 
We received access to PUR5700 (previously RV7031), a second novel drug candidate through the RespiVert License Agreement. On December 26, 2019, Pulmatrix entered into the JJEI License Agreement, pursuant to which the Company provided an assignment option to JJEI of all the Company’s rights under the RespiVert License Agreement, to develop and commercialize PUR1800, PUR5700 and other kinase inhibitors.
 
PUR3100 
 
In 2020, Pulmatrix developed PUR3100, the iSPERSE formulation of DHE, for the treatment of acute migraine. Over 38 million people suffer from migraine in the United States. Currently DHE is only available for intravenous infusion and therefore is not widely used. If approved for commercialization, PUR3100 should be the first orally inhaled DHE treatment for acute migraine and be an alternative to other acute therapies, such as oral and intravenous triptans that currently represent over 90% of the annual migraine prescriptions in the United States. Given the oral inhaled route of delivery, PUR3100 is anticipated to provide a rapid onset of migraine symptom relief with a favorable tolerability profile.
 
Competition and Market Opportunities 
 
 Current treatments for migraine include oral, intranasal, intravenous (“IV”) or intramuscular (“IM”) formulations of triptans, dihydroergotamine, and CGRP antagonists. Studies show that migraineurs are underdiagnosed, undertreated, and experience substantial decreases in functioning and productivity, which in turn translates into diminished quality of life for individuals, and financial burdens to both health-care systems and employers. All current treatments suffer from limited efficacy and/or tolerability and there exists a significant unmet need for safe and effective alternatives to current treatments.
 
DHE has been shown to be effective in the treatment of migraine and, in particular, hard to treat migraines, such as menstrual migraine, migraine upon awakening, and severe migraine. Utilization of DHE has been limited due to its poor oral bioavailability, requiring IV or intranasal dosing. IV dosing generally requires administration in a healthcare setting and the high exposure levels results in significant nausea and emesis and as such has been limited to use only in patients with severe intractable migraine. Intranasal dosing with Migranal (Bausch Health US LLC) has been poorly adopted due to poor exposure resulting in inconsistent efficacy.
 
There is precedent for an inhaled DHE therapy. MAP Pharmaceuticals, Inc. developed MAP0004, also known as Levadex or Semprana, a liquid suspension formulation of DHE, designed to be dosed via a pMDI inhalation device. Their published data indicate a safe and well tolerated formulation with rapid onset and long-lasting efficacy that compared very favorably to existing treatments. Development of MAP0004 led to a new drug application (“NDA”) but was halted after several complete response letters from the FDA citing Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (“CMC”) issues related to dose uniformity and stability issues. Regardless of the failure of MAP0004, the efficacy and tolerability of the formulation reported by MAP Pharmaceuticals provides proof of concept for an inhaled DHE formulation. PUR3100, the iSPERSE formulation planned by Pulmatrix is anticipated to deliver DHE to the lung with efficacy and tolerability that compares favorably with MAP0004..
 
There are no other inhaled DHE formulations currently in development. There are two intranasal formulations of DHE currently in development. Satsuma Pharmaceuticals have developed a dry powder formulation of DHE for intranasal dosing and recently completed a Phase 3 study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03901482). Despite failure of this study to achieve its primary endpoint, Satsuma have announced that development of this formulation will continue, though no timeline for additional clinical studies has been announced. Impel Neuropharma is developing a formulation of DHE based on the Migranal formulation with an improved POD delivery technology using a propellant to deliver the formulation deep into the sinus cavity. Impel recently announced acceptance of their NDA by the FDA with a target Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) date of September 2021.


Clinical Development 
 
Pulmatrix plans to conduct a 14-day GLP toxicology study in 2021 that will enable an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) filing with FDA in Q1 2022. Following the filing of the IND, Pulmatrix plans to initiate a 2-part Phase 1/Phase 2 study in patients with episodic migraine using the iSPERSE formulation PUR3100. This study will evaluate single dose PK, safety and tolerability, and the effect of dose on a range of relevant clinical endpoints.
Business Development 
 
On April 15, 2019, Pulmatrix entered into a Development and Commercialization Agreement (the “Cipla Agreement”) with Cipla Technologies LLC (“Cipla”) for the co-development and commercialization, on a worldwide exclusive basis, of Pulmazole, our inhaled iSPERSE drug delivery system enabled formulation of the antifungal drug, itraconazole. According to the agreement, Pulmatrix and Cipla share equally product development and commercialization costs and free cash flow from worldwide commercialization from future sales of Pulmazole.
 
On December 26, 2019, Pulmatrix entered into a License, Development and Commercialization Agreement with JJEI (the “JJEI License Agreement”). Under the JJEI License Agreement, the Company has granted JJEI an option to acquire (1) the Company’s rights to an intellectual property portfolio of materials and technology related to narrow spectrum kinase inhibitor compounds and (2) an exclusive, worldwide, royalty bearing license to PUR1800 and PUR5700.
 
On April 9, 2020, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement (the “Sensory Cloud Agreement”) with Sensory Cloud, Inc. (“Sensory Cloud”). Under the terms of the Sensory Cloud Agreement, we have granted Sensory Cloud an exclusive, worldwide, royalty bearing license to PUR003 and PUR006 (the “Sensory Licensed Product”), our proprietary aerosol salt solution for delivery or administration to or through the nasal passages also known as NasoCalm, as well as related patents and know-how, for use in the field. PUR003 and PUR006, were originally developed by the Company as potential anti-infective biodefense medical countermeasure products. However, the Company decided to no longer develop these products and instead prioritized the development of other programs. For purposes of the Sensory Cloud Agreement, the field means the formulation and commercialization of over-the-counter products for the prophylaxis, prevention and treatment of upper and lower respiratory disease that are delivered or administered to or through the nasal passages. The license granted to Sensory Cloud does not cover the development or commercialization of any prescription products.

The status of our patent portfolio changes frequently in the ordinary course of patent prosecution. As of December 31, 2020, our patent portfolio related to iSPERSE included approximately 112 granted patents, 16 of which are granted US patents, with expiration dates from 2024 to 2034, and approximately 61 additional pending patent applications in the US and other jurisdictions. Our in-licensed portfolio related to kinase inhibitors included approximately 241 granted patents, 31 of which are granted US patents, with expiration dates from 2029 to 2035, and approximately 42 additional pending patent applications in the US and other jurisdictions. On March 3, 2021 we filed a provisional patent application in the USPTO that discloses and claims certain formulations and methods of use relevant to our PUR3100 program. We plan to file an international patent application under the patent cooperation treaty based on the provisional patent application by the applicable deadline.
 
There can be no assurance that the patent applications will be granted. The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, the patent term of a patent that covers a FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. In the future, if and when our products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. We plan to seek patent term extensions to extend the patent coverage of any of our products that received regulatory approval in any jurisdiction where these extensions are available. However, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment on whether such extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of such extensions.
 
The patent positions of biotechnology companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted after issuance. Consequently, we may not obtain or maintain adequate patent protection for any of our product candidates. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties.
 
Trade Secrets 
 
We also rely on trade secret protection of our confidential and proprietary information, including the iSPERSE technology. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees, consultants and others, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with Pulmatrix. These confidentiality agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us must be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. Our confidentiality agreements with our employees also provide that all inventions conceived by the employee in the course of employment with us or from the employee’s use of our confidential information are our exclusive property.
Manufacturing 
 
We do not currently own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of our product candidates. We have small-scale production capabilities and generally perform early process development for our product candidates to produce the quantities necessary to conduct preclinical studies of our investigational product candidates. We do not have, and do not currently plan to acquire or develop, the facilities or capabilities to manufacture bulk drug substance or filled drug product for use in human clinical studies. We rely on contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”) and third-party contractors to generate drug-loaded formulations and produce larger, pilot- scale amounts of drug substance and the drug product required for our clinical studies. We expect to continue to rely on CMOs to manufacture drug substances and drug products under the appropriate current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) conditions to perform clinical studies for the foreseeable future. We also contract with CMOs for the labeling, packaging, storage and distribution of investigational drug products. These arrangements allow us to maintain a more flexible infrastructure while focusing our expertise on researching and developing our products.
 
We expect to continue to rely on contract manufacturers to produce sufficient quantities of our product candidates in accordance with the appropriate cGMPs for the pertinent phase of clinical trials. cGMP compliance includes strict adherence to regulations for quality control, quality assurance, and the maintenance of records and documentation. The manufacturing facilities that manufacture our approved drug products, if any are approved in the future, must comply with the FDA’s cGMP regulation requirements and have acquired FDA or other regulatory approval for the manufacturing of our commercial products. Our contract manufacturers may also be subject to inspections of facilities by regulatory authorities to ensure compliance with applicable regulations. Contract manufacturers often encounter difficulties involving production yields, quality control and quality assurance, as well as shortages of qualified personnel. We have little or no direct control over our manufacturers’ compliance with these regulations and standards. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in fines and civil penalties, suspension of production, suspension or delay in product approval, product seizure or recall, or withdrawal of product approval. These actions could have a material impact on the availability of products.

Suppliers 
 
We also rely on third-party contract manufacturers to supply the APIs that are used to formulate our therapeutic candidates. We place purchase orders with one contract manufacturer for the APIs required for Pulmazole and PUR1800, but there are many other potential contract manufacturers that may be capable of manufacturing APIs for Pulmazole and PUR1800 or any of our other drug products in the market. We additionally rely on third-party vendors to supply raw materials for our APIs and drug products.
Research and Development 
 
For fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we spent approximately $15.6 million and $12.8 million, respectively on research and development activities.
 
Government Regulation 
 
Pharmaceutical companies are subject to extensive regulation by national, state and local agencies, such as the FDA, in the United States and the European Medicines Agency in Europe. The manufacture, distribution, marketing, and sale of pharmaceutical products are subject to government regulation in the United States and various foreign countries. Additionally, in the United States, we must follow rules and regulations established by the FDA requiring the presentation of data indicating that our products are safe and efficacious and are manufactured in accordance with cGMP regulations. If we do not comply with applicable requirements, we may be fined, the government may refuse to approve our marketing applications or allow us to manufacture or market its products, and we may be criminally prosecuted. We and our manufacturers and clinical research organizations may also be subject to regulations under other federal, state and local laws, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Air Act and import, export and customs regulations as well as the laws and regulations of other countries. Pharmaceutical companies must ensure their compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and federal healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act, and the U.S. government has increased its enforcement activity regarding illegal marketing practices domestically and internationally.
 
These regulatory requirements impact our operations and differ from one country to another, such that securing the applicable regulatory approvals of one country does not imply the approval of another country. However, securing the approval of a more stringent body, e.g. the FDA, may facilitate receiving the approval by a regulatory authority in a different country where the regulatory requirements are similar or less stringent. The approval procedures involve high costs and are manpower intensive and usually extend over many years and require highly skilled and professional resources.
 
FDA Approval Process 
 
The steps required to be taken before a new drug may be marketed in the United States generally include:
 

● | Completion of preclinical laboratory and animal testing; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must be evaluated and found acceptable by the FDA before human clinical trials may commence; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Submission and approval of a NDA. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Clinical studies are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, what types of patients may enter the study, schedules of tests and procedures, drugs, dosages, and length of study, as well as the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical study and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND application.
 
In all the countries that are signatories of the Helsinki Declaration, the prerequisite for conducting clinical trials (on human subjects) is securing the preliminary approval of the competent authorities of that country to conduct medical experiments on human subjects in compliance with the other principles established by the Helsinki Declaration.

The clinical testing of a product candidate (also commonly referenced as a “drug product candidate” or a “therapeutic product candidate”) generally is conducted in three sequential phases prior to approval, but the phases may overlap or be combined. A fourth, or post approval, phase may include additional clinical studies. The phases are generally as follows:
 
Phase 1. In Phase 1 clinical studies, the product is tested in a small number of patients with the target condition or disease or in healthy volunteers. These studies are designed to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the product candidate in humans, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, in some cases, to gain early evidence on efficacy. The number of participants included in Phase 1 studies is generally in the range of 20 to 80.
 
Phase 2. In Phase 2 studies, in addition to safety, the sponsor evaluates the efficacy of the product candidate on targeted indications to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks. Phase 2 studies typically are larger than Phase 1 but smaller than Phase 3 studies and may involve several hundred participants.
 
Phase 3. Phase 3 studies typically involve an expanded patient population at geographically-dispersed test sites. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the product candidate has been obtained and are designed to further evaluate clinical efficacy and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the product candidate and to provide an adequate basis for a potential product approval. Phase 3 studies usually involve several hundred to several thousand participants.
 
Phase 4. Phase 4 clinical trials are post marketing studies designed to collect additional safety data as well as potentially expand a product indication. Post marketing commitments are required of, or agreed to by, a sponsor after the FDA has approved a product for marketing. These studies are used to gain additional information from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and to verify a clinical benefit in the case of drugs approved under accelerated approval regulations. If the FDA approves a product while a company has ongoing clinical trials that were not necessary for approval, a company may be able to use the data from these clinical trials to meet all or part of any Phase 4 clinical trial requirement. These clinical trials are often referred to as Phase 4 post-approval or post marketing commitments. Failure to promptly conduct Phase 4 clinical trials could result in the inability to deliver the product into interstate commerce, misbranding charges, and civil monetary penalties.
 
Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s good clinical practices (“GCP”), requirements. The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical study at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or that the participants are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. An institutional review board (“IRB”) generally must approve the clinical trial design and patient informed consent at study sites that the IRB oversees and also may halt a study, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions. Additionally, some clinical studies are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group recommends whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study. The clinical study sponsor may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate.
 
As a product candidate moves through the clinical testing phases, manufacturing processes are further defined, refined, controlled and validated. The level of control and validation required by the FDA would generally increase as clinical studies progress. We and the third-party manufacturers on which we rely for the manufacture of our product candidates and their respective components (including the API) are subject to requirements that drugs be manufactured, packaged and labeled in conformity with cGMP. To comply with cGMP requirements, manufacturers must continue to spend time, money and effort to meet requirements relating to personnel, facilities, equipment, production and process, labeling and packaging, quality control, recordkeeping and other requirements.
 
Assuming completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed information on the product candidate is submitted to the FDA in the form of a NDA, requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications, together with payment of a user fee, unless waived. A NDA includes all relevant data available from pertinent nonclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information on the chemistry, manufacture, control and proposed labeling, among other things. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use to the satisfaction of the FDA.
 
If a NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the PDUFA, the FDA’s goal is to complete its initial review and respond to the applicant within twelve months of submission, unless the application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication, in which case the goal may be within eight months of NDA submission. However, PDUFA goal dates are not legal mandates and FDA response often occurs several months beyond the original PDUFA goal date. Further, the review process and the target response date under PDUFA may be extended if the FDA requests or the NDA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the NDA. The NDA review process can, accordingly, be very lengthy. During its review of a NDA, the FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it typically follows such recommendations. Data from clinical studies are not always conclusive and the FDA and/or any advisory committee it appoints may interpret data differently than the applicant.

After the FDA evaluates the NDA and inspects manufacturing facilities where the drug product and/or its API will be produced, it will either approve commercial marketing of the drug product with prescribing information for specific indications or issue a complete response letter indicating that the application is not ready for approval and stating the conditions that must be met in order to secure approval of the NDA. If the complete response letter requires additional data and the applicant subsequently submits that data, the FDA nevertheless may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy its criteria for approval. The FDA could also approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (“REMS”), plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct post-marketing testing. Such post-marketing testing may include Phase 4 clinical studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and efficacy after approval. Regulatory approval of products for serious or life-threatening indications may require that participants in clinical studies be followed for long periods to determine the overall survival benefit of the drug.
 
If the FDA approves one of our therapeutic candidates, we will be required to comply with a number of post-approval regulatory requirements. We will also be required to report, among other things, certain adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for any of its products. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval, and the FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP, which imposes extensive procedural, substantive and record keeping requirements. If we seek to make certain changes to an approved product, such as certain manufacturing changes, we will need FDA review and approval before the change can be implemented. For example, if we change the manufacturer of a product or its API, the FDA may require stability or other data from the new manufacturer, which will take time and is costly to generate, and the delay associated with generating this data may cause interruptions in its ability to meet commercial demand, if any. While physicians may use products for indications that have not been approved by the FDA, we may not label or promote the product for an indication that has not been approved. Securing FDA approval for new indications is similar to the process for approval of the original indication and requires, among other things, submitting data from adequate and well-controlled studies that demonstrate the product’s safety and efficacy in the new indication. Even if such studies are conducted, the FDA may not approve any change in a timely fashion, or at all.
 
We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of clinical and future commercial, quantities of its therapeutic candidates. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at these third-party facilities that may disrupt production or distribution or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing. Newly discovered or developed safety or efficacy data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Many of the foregoing could limit the commercial value of an approved product or require us to commit substantial additional resources in connection with the approval of a product. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of its products under development.
 
Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications 
 
As an alternate path for FDA approval of new indications or new formulations of previously approved products, a company may file a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, instead of a “stand-alone” or “full” NDA. Section 505(b)(2), was enacted as part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, otherwise known as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. Section 505(b)(2) permits the submission of a NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. Some examples of products that may be allowed to follow a 505(b)(2) path to approval are drugs that have a new dosage form, strength, route of administration, formulation or indication.
 
The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit the applicant to rely upon certain published nonclinical or clinical studies conducted for an approved product or the FDA’s conclusions from prior review of such studies. The FDA may require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support any changes from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product for all or some of the labeled indications for which the reference product has been approved, as well as for any new indication supported by the NDA. While references to nonclinical and clinical data not generated by the applicant or for which the applicant does not have a right of reference are allowed, all development, process, stability, qualification and validation data related to the manufacturing and quality of the new product must be included in an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2).

--


To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on the FDA’s conclusions regarding studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book publication. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The Section 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the reference product has expired. Thus, the Section 505(b)(2) applicant may invest a significant amount of time and expense in the development of its products only to be subject to significant delay and patent litigation before its products may be commercialized.
 
Orphan Drug Designation 
 
The Orphan Drug Act of 1983 (the “Orphan Drug Act”) encourages manufacturers to seek approval of products intended to treat “rare diseases and conditions” with a prevalence of fewer than 200,000 patients in the United States or for which there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the development costs for the product. For products that receive Orphan Drug designation by the FDA, the Orphan Drug Act provides tax credits for clinical research, FDA assistance with protocol design, eligibility for FDA grants to fund clinical studies, waiver of the FDA application fee, and a period of seven years of marketing exclusivity for the product following FDA marketing approval. In limited circumstances, the FDA may approve a competing product if the product shows clinical superiority over a product with orphan drug designation exclusivity.
Foreign Regulation 
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of its products. Whether or not Pulmatrix obtains FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
 
Under European Union regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure, which is compulsory for medicines produced by biotechnology or those medicines intended to treat AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders or diabetes and optional for those medicines which are highly innovative, provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. Abridged applications for the authorization of generic versions of drugs authorized by European Medicines Agency can be submitted to the European Medicines Agency through a centralized procedure referencing the innovator’s data and demonstrating bioequivalence to the reference product, among other things. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states. Within 90 days of receiving the applications and assessments report, each member state must decide whether to recognize approval. If a member state does not recognize the marketing authorization, the disputed points are eventually referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states.
 
Reimbursement 
 
In the United States and other countries, sales of any products for which Pulmatrix receives regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payers, including government payers, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Each third-party payer may have its own policy regarding what products it will cover, the conditions under which it will cover such products, and how much it will pay for such products. Third-party payers are increasingly examining the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of medical products and services in addition to safety and efficacy and, accordingly, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutics. Third-party reimbursement adequate to enable us to realize an appropriate return on our investment in research and product development may not be available for our products.
 
The passage of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the “MMA”) sets forth requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries, which may affect the marketing of our products. The MMA also introduced a new reimbursement methodology. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payers often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payers.
 
In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product, or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market.

We expect that there will continue to be a number of federal and state proposals to implement governmental pricing controls. While we cannot predict whether such legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted, the adoption of such proposals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and profitability.
 
Compliance with Environmental Laws 
 
Compliance with applicable environmental requirements during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 has not had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
 
Employees 
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had 2 part-time and 20 full-time employees, 17 of whom were engaged in full-time research and development activities. None of our employees are represented by any collective bargaining unit. We believe that we maintain good relations with our employees.
Properties 
 
Our corporate headquarters is located in Lexington, Massachusetts. We currently lease approximately 22,119 square feet of office and lab space in Lexington, Massachusetts under a lease that originally expired on December 31, 2020. On April 23, 2020, an extension to our lease for office and lab space was signed between us and 99 Hayden LLC. The extension to the original lease executed on May 31, 2007 will now expire on June 30, 2022. We believe that our existing facilities are adequate to meet our current needs, and that suitable additional alternative spaces will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms for our future growth.
Available Information 
 
We make available, free of charge, our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to these reports on our website at www.pulmatrix.com as soon as reasonably practicable after those reports and other information is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.
