In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we refer to the special purpose acquisition company, Pivotal Acquisition Corp. (“Pivotal”), prior to the Closing Date (as defined below) as the “Company.” Following consummation of the Business Combination, the “Company,” and references to “we,” “us,” or similar such references should be understood to be references to the combined company, KLDiscovery Inc. When this Annual Report on Form 10-K references “LD Topco” and describes the business of KLDiscovery, it refers to the business of LD Topco, Inc. and its subsidiaries prior to the consummation of the Business Combination. Following the date of the Business Consummation, references to “KLDiscovery” should be understood to reference KLDiscovery Inc. This Annual Report on Form 10-K also refers to our websites, but information contained on those sites is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Our Company
 
The Company was incorporated under the name “Pivotal Acquisition Corp.” as a blank check company on August 2, 2018 under the laws of the State of Delaware for the purpose of entering into a merger, capital stock exchange, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities. Our efforts to identify a prospective target business were not limited to any particular industry or geographic location but focused on companies in North America in industries ripe for disruption from continuously evolving digital technology and the resulting shift in distribution patterns and consumer purchase behavior.
 
In August 2018, Pivotal Acquisition Holdings LLC (the “Founder”) purchased 5,750,000 shares of Class B common stock (“founder shares”) for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000 in connection with the Company’s organization. The Founder transferred 50,000 founder shares to each of our independent directors in December 2018 and transferred 100,000 founder shares to our chief financial officer in December 2018, in each case at the same per-share purchase price paid by the Founder. These shares were issued pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”).
 
On February 4, 2019, we consummated our initial public offering (“IPO”) of 23,000,000 units, including 3,000,000 units subject to the underwriters’ over-allotment option. Each unit consisted of one share of Class A common stock and one redeemable public warrant (“Public Warrants”), with each Public Warrant entitling the holder to purchase 
 2

one share of Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share commencing 30 days after the consummation of an initial business combination. The units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $230 million. Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. acted as the sole book-running manager and BTIG, LLC acted as lead manager of the offering. The securities sold in the IPO were registered under the Securities Act on a registration statement on Form S-1 (No. 333-229027), which became effective under Section 8(a) of the Securities Act on January 31, 2019.
 
Simultaneous with the consummation of the IPO, we consummated the private placement of an aggregate of 6,350,000 private warrants (“Private Warrants” and, together with the Public Warrants, the “Warrants”) to the Founder at a price of $1.00 per Private Warrant, generating total proceeds of $6.35 million. The issuance was made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The Private Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants included in the units sold in the IPO, except that the Private Warrants are non-redeemable and may be exercised on a cashless basis, in each case so long as they continue to be held by the initial purchaser or its permitted transferees. In connection with the Business Combination, the Founder forfeited 1,764,719 Private Warrants.
 
Following the IPO, a total of $230 million was placed in the trust account and the remaining proceeds, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and other costs and expenses, became available to be used as working capital to provide for business, legal and accounting due diligence on prospective business combinations and continuing general and administrative expenses.
 
On December 19, 2019 (the “Closing Date”), the Company and LD Topco, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“LD Topco”), consummated a business combination pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization, dated as of May 20, 2019, as amended by (i) the Amendment to Agreement and Plan of Reorganization, dated as of October 30, 2019, and (ii) the Amendment No. 2 to Agreement and Plan of Reorganization, dated as of December 16, 2019 (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among the Company, Pivotal Merger Sub Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”), LD Topco, and, solely in its capacity as representative of the stockholders of LD Topco, Carlyle Equity Opportunity GP, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (“Carlyle”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, among other things, Merger Sub was merged with and into LD Topco, with LD Topco surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Business Combination”).
 
In connection with the consummation of the Business Combination:
 
 
• | each outstanding share of common stock of LD Topco was converted into the right to receive a pro rata portion of (i) 34,800,000 shares of Company common stock and (ii) 2,200,000 additional shares of Company common stock if during the five-year period following the Closing Date (x) a change of control occurs or (y) the reported closing sale price of Company common stock equals or exceeds $13.50 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations or other similar actions) for any 20 consecutive trading days;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | each share of the Company’s Class B common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, was converted into one share of our single class of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Common Stock”);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | each outstanding Warrant of the Company entitles the holder to purchase shares of our Common Stock beginning the later of (i) 30 days after the Closing Date and (ii) one year after the date of the Company’s IPO; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Company issued (i) $200,000,000 of 8% convertible debentures due 2024 (the “Debentures”), (ii) 2,097,974 shares of Common Stock and (iii) 1,764,719 warrants (the “Debenture Holder Warrants”) in a private placement to certain “accredited investors” pursuant to an exemption from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse merger in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). Under this method of accounting, the Company will be treated as the “acquired” company for financial reporting purposes. This determination was primarily based on (i) LD Topco shareholders owning the majority interest of the combined company, (ii) LD Topco being represented on the board of directors of the combined company by up to three members, in addition to the chief executive officer of LD Topco, (iii) LD Topco’s senior management comprising the senior management of the combined company and (iv) 
 3

LD Topco’s operations comprising the ongoing operations of the combined company. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the Business Combination was treated as the equivalent of LD Topco issuing stock for the net assets of Pivotal, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of the Company were stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. Operations prior to the Business Combination will be those of LD Topco.
 
Emerging Growth Company
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined under the JOBS Act. As an emerging growth company, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These include, but are not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and the requirement to obtain stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We have elected to take advantage of such extended transition period. 
 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (i) December 31, 2024 (the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the consummation of our IPO), (ii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, (iii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer,” as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and (iv) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt during the prior three-year period.
 
Overview
 
We are one of the leading eDiscovery providers and the leading data recovery services provider to corporations, law firms, government agencies and individual consumers. In 2020, we served over 4,400 legal technology clients, including 98% of the American Lawyer 100 (the “AM Law 100”) and 61% of Fortune 500 companies. We have broad geographical coverage in the eDiscovery and data recovery industries with 32 locations in 18 countries, 9 data centers and 18 data recovery labs around the globe. Our technology and service offerings protect our clients from growing information governance challenges, litigation, compliance breaches and data loss. 
 Our legal technology service offerings provide a wide variety of solutions for information governance and eDiscovery, including forensic collections, data processing, secure hosting, managed review, advanced analytics and document production. eDiscovery refers to a process in which electronic data is sought, located, secured, searched and analyzed with the intent of using it as evidence in a civil, criminal or investigative legal case or regulatory action. Our data recovery service offerings allow clients to recover data in the event of physical or logical loss and provide data management tools and solutions and proprietary data erasure technologies. We differentiate ourselves through our leading integrated suite of proprietary software and services, geographic scale and award-winning corporate culture, which we believe drives our client service success. 
 Our longstanding relationships with our clients are driven primarily by two factors: technological excellence and a culture of client service. We were ranked as a top eDiscovery provider in an aggregation of fourteen “Best Of” customer surveys from a variety of ALM online legal publications. 
 We offer our clients both proprietary and third-party solutions to address their legal technology requirements. Our proprietary end-to-end eDiscovery solution, Nebula, can be deployed on the cloud, on premise or behind a client’s firewall via mobile kits. This technology is a key selling point and these solutions are critical to our success. We believe that our proprietary solutions offer us a unique competitive advantage in the industry, giving us an exclusive product, which allows our clients to execute their job functions quickly and with a high degree of accuracy, thus saving them time and expense. In addition to our proprietary suite of tools, we can integrate third-party applications and tools into our workflow to create what we believe is the best possible solution for our clients. This is useful for 
 4

projects where clients want to take advantage of our technology platform, but may also have a need to leverage technology that specializes in one narrow aspect. We uphold a core set of client service values including teamwork, responsiveness and sole focus on client service. As we have scaled our global operations, this set of shared beliefs has created a unique environment where employees thrive and work together to deliver our white-glove, 24/7/365 service to our clients. In an industry that is driven by long-term, repeat relationship business, we believe our technology solutions, coupled with our dedication to excellent service, have continued to set us apart from the competition. 
 LD Topco’s History 
 We were founded in 2005 as a forensic and eDiscovery company. We recapitalized with an investment from WestView Capital Partners (“WestView”) in September 2011, at which point we began executing a targeted acquisition strategy focused on tuck-in acquisitions of companies that would benefit from our scale and offer us advanced technology solutions and attractive client relationships. Since 2013, we acquired nine U.S. regional eDiscovery companies ranging in size and capabilities, including our 2013 acquisition of AlphaLit and our 2014 acquisition of RenewData. The RenewData acquisition facilitated our entry into the data archiving market, allowing us to increase our geographic reach, diversify our client base, grow our salesforce and further develop our technology platform. 
 In 2015, we recapitalized with The Carlyle Group (“TCG or Carlyle”) and Revolution Growth III L.P. (“RG or Revolution”). This recapitalization provided us with the resources to execute our largest acquisition to date, Kroll Ontrack, which was completed in December 2016. The Kroll Ontrack acquisition expanded our international operations, allowing us to position ourselves as one of a small number of eDiscovery companies with cross-border capabilities. The acquisition also made us a global leader in data recovery services, via the “Ontrack” business, which has been providing data recovery services since 1985. 
 In 2017, we launched Nebula, a proprietary end-to-end eDiscovery solution optimized for the cloud. In 2018, in order to make further investments in sales and technology, we announced growth equity financing from our prior investor, WestView, together with Carlyle and Revolution. Coinciding with the investment, we released our mobile eDiscovery solution, Nebula Private Cloud (“NPC”), which allows our clients to have a small-scale private data center behind their own firewall. Also in 2018, we furthered our geographic expansion through Western Europe and Canada by opening additional data centers and managed review facilities. 
 In 2019, we announced our Nebula Big Data Store offering for information governance management which will include legal hold and notification services, thus expanding our proprietary technology suite into the information archiving market. 
 In 2020, in response to the unprecedented COVID-19 global pandemic and the corresponding travel restrictions, we announced our Remote Collection (“RCMgr”) offering as an alternative to on-site collections. This self-collection software allows end-users and IT professionals to perform defensible collections of hard drives, loose files and email servers. We also successfully transitioned to remote document review, which enabled review attorneys to continue working securely from home in light of the global disruption to in person work caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Industry Overview 
 Legal Technology Industry 
 eDiscovery 
 eDiscovery is an essential component of litigation, government investigations and regulatory and compliance submissions, where parties exchange Electronically Stored Information (“ESI”) with each other. eDiscovery is subject to rules and agreed-upon processes, which often involve reviewing data for privilege and relevance before it is exchanged. eDiscovery software and services facilitate the identification, preservation, collection, review and exchange of ESI. The eDiscovery industry is highly fragmented with over 100 vendors, and in 2020, the top three pure play eDiscovery vendors accounted for approximately 15% of the industry. 
 5


 According to Complex Discovery, the eDiscovery market is expected to grow from $10.9 billion in 2020 to $15.1 billion in 2025, representing a 6.8% compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”). We believe the industry is in the midst of a transformation driven by data proliferation and compounded by increasing complexity in the makeup and composition of the data we must be equipped to handle. These two factors help drive the growth.
 Data Proliferation. According to IDC, electronic data will reach 175 zettabytes by 2025. Data is growing at an exponential rate due to several factors, including the adoption of mobile devices, accessibility of hosted systems and increased reliance on electronic data storage. With ESI expected to continue growing at a significant rate, the organizations that effectively deploy advanced technologies, such as predictive coding and data analytics, and are able to help their clients work through large data sets quickly and accurately will be best positioned to earn increased market share. 
 Market Shift to the Cloud. eDiscovery solutions are typically deployed in one of three fashions: On-premise (hosted at one of our data centers), in the public cloud (Google, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure) or behind a client’s firewall. Although on-premise hosting has largely been the dominant deployment to date, cloud deployment is expected to see significant growth. IDC predicts that by 2025, 49% of data will be stored in public cloud environments. Deployment in the public cloud offers many benefits, including scalability, flexibility, security and compliance, and, as a result, the adoption of cloud technology is expected to continue to increase. In particular, small and medium-sized enterprises are adopting cloud deployment mainly due to its cost-effectiveness and advanced results.
 Information Archiving 
 Data archiving serves a critical role in the management of organizational information resources for all businesses, regardless of size. Information archiving addresses information preservation for long-term access, enhancing access to large volumes of information in order to render it more useable and thus valuable. Information archiving also facilitates data management and disposition based on content of such data and need for preservation and/or disposition. As a result, data archiving serves as a primary source of information in legal discovery for litigious organizations. In the cloud economy, data archiving is increasingly displacing traditional backup strategies for disaster recovery purposes, since archiving provides a defense against malicious or inadvertent data loss by insiders and can be an insurance policy against ransomware. The legal hold software market overlaps with both the data archiving market and the eDiscovery software market and addresses the need for organizations to comply with legal requirements to preserve data in the face of pending litigation. Finally, the regulatory compliance software market is driven by the myriad regulatory regimes around the world that require organizations to preserve certain information, sometimes on immutable storage, for specified minimum periods. Conversely, some regulations require verifiable destruction of information when a specified time period has elapsed or certain events arise, and data archiving facilities easy execution of such requirements. 
 According to The Radicati Group, the information archiving market is expected to grow to $8.5 billion by 2022. Significant trends affecting this market include the shift to cloud computing and storage from traditional on-premises computing and storage, increased demands for storage to do more than simply preserve data and the advent of the “API economy,” in which vendors offer application programming interfaces (“APIs”) that enable other vendors to integrate with, extend and enhance the functionality of their core product, thereby increasing value for an end-client. These trends are driven by the widespread and general adoption of cloud services for many functions, a need for businesses or functions with variable demand to favor operational expenditures over capital expenditures, and a need for systems and data to support multiple functions, thereby driving efficiency and cost containment. 
 Data Recovery Industry 
 When consumers and businesses lose or cannot access data due to system failures, accidental deletion, physical damage, natural disasters, ransomware or user error, and no backup is available, data recovery service companies can help recover data which would have otherwise been lost. Data recovery service vendors can typically recover data from hard disk or solid state drives, flash drives and USB external drives, while some have the capability to recover data from servers, Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks (“RAID”) systems, enterprise storage areas networks and network attached storage systems, backup tapes, optical disks, databases and virtual machines. Data recovery service companies use software tools and physical inspection to diagnose and determine the condition of 
 6

the media and what data may be recovered. They then make an image of the data and perform a logical reconstruction of the data. In the case of physical damage, the device may need to be disassembled in a clean room lab and spare parts used to facilitate the recovery. 
 This fragmented industry is served by thousands of vendors, the majority of which are small electronics repair shops using off-the-shelf data recovery software tools. There are very few global data recovery providers that have clean room labs and physical data recovery capability with multiple labs. Factors affecting the industry include the increasing use of mobile devices, use of the cloud, streaming content, cost of storage and complexities of edge and analytics workloads and advanced data protection systems. 
 Products and Services 
 We have built an integrated suite of eDiscovery tools and services covering information governance, forensic collections, data processing, secure online hosting, managed review, advanced analytics and document production. In addition, we offer data recovery solutions ranging from cleanroom facilities to proprietary data erasure, data recovery and data management tools. 
 


eDiscovery Solutions 
 We are one of the largest globally scaled eDiscovery providers in a highly-fragmented industry of over 100 vendors. With approximately 2.3% of the current eDiscovery market, based on 2020 eDiscovery revenue, we are poised to continue to gain market share via strategic acquisitions. 
 We offer a variety of eDiscovery solutions to our clients, including: 
 Nebula. Nebula is a proprietary end-to-end information governance and eDiscovery platform which helps to facilitate the identification, preservation, collection, processing, review and exchange of ESI. Nebula is powered by our in-house technology that has been developed, tested and trusted to improve the eDiscovery experience. Nebula is unique to us and contains the latest advancements in eDiscovery, while still delivering essential functionality. We offer three hosting options for Nebula: On-Premise at our data centers, in the public cloud (via Microsoft Azure cloud), and at a client’s location via NPC. NPC is particularly noteworthy as it allows for processing, filtering, analysis, review and production of ESI without the need to transfer data outside of the client’s location or across borders. 
 
eDiscovery.com Review (“EDR”). EDR is an all-encompassing, single platform used to search, review and exchange ESI. Over the past decade, our clients have produced to requesting parties over one billion documents and billions of pages using EDR. 
 Relativity. In 2006, we became the first vendor to license Relativity, a widely used document review tool. Shortly thereafter, we hosted the first case to reach one million records on the platform, and we have consistently worked to improve our clients’ experiences by offering a suite of proprietary enhancements exclusive to us, together with our 
 7

white-glove client service. Our differentiated data hosting environment offers our clients optimal performance, reliability and redundancy. We currently host Relativity in six countries worldwide. 
 KLD Analytics. Developed through collaboration among our data scientists, software engineers and legal professionals, KLD Analytics offers a full range of technology-assisted review tools, supported by our team of technologists and consultants. This suite of tools offers features such as: 
  
• | Predictive Coding—Leverages human expertise to automatically classify large populations of documents. Predictive coding supports entirely custom workflows and methodologies and is capable of continuous prioritization of important documents for review.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Workflow—Automates the routing and distribution of documents to streamline document review and maximize accuracy and defensibility. Workflow eliminates the need to maintain static batch sets and manually transition documents to different review teams. Workflow works hand-in-hand with Predictive Coding to make document review as efficient as possible.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Email Threading—Determines the relationship between email messages and identifies the most content-inclusive messages to avoid redundant review.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Near-Duplicate Detection—Identifies and groups similar records and highlights the subtle differences among them for a quicker review.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Language Identification—Automatically identifies the primary language on documents in a dataset.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 KLD Processing. Our proprietary processing platform has been used exclusively by us for over 15 years. KLD Processing is a highly scalable platform which ingests disparate data types and sources, extracts the content of documents, removes duplicative or otherwise innocuous data, such as operating and system files, and exports data for review and production. 
 Managed Review Services. Our managed review services provide the facilities, staffing and expertise necessary to review large and complex data sets with a high degree of accuracy and efficiency. We assemble review teams of experienced legal professionals for any type of case. Each team member is a qualified attorney who has passed a selective screening process and has received training from our review managers. Review managers utilize proven methodologies to target and address quality issues early, allowing us to intelligently prioritize the documents that need to be reviewed more closely. Review managers are able to glean insights into productivity and quality using our proprietary technology to deliver a higher quality production. We have experience handling managed reviews for a variety of types of matters, ranging from litigation, investigations and regulatory reviews, such as second requests, and have conducted reviews in over 30 languages. We have document review facilities in the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union, and regularly recruit over 1000 remote reviewers across the United States.
 Digital Forensics Services. One of our specialties is computer forensics, including collections and analysis. Without a sound forensic collection, critical electronic evidence may be missed, inadvertently altered or otherwise rendered inadmissible. Whether it be for a small matter, such as a collection of data from a single device, or a large corporate investigation involving multiple custodians and data sources, in-person or remote, our collection analysts will determine and execute the most defensible, efficient and cost-effective strategy. Each year, we regularly collect data from many countries around the world. As a result, we possess a deep bench of talent with knowledge of country-specific discovery laws and customs. With offices across the globe, our collection team can be on the ground quickly in most regions. Our proprietary Remote Collection Manager (“RCMgr”) product is a suite of tools used to facilitate document collections remotely and by end-users, allowing defensibility and accuracy to be maintained without the need to deploy personnel onsite. RCMgr hard drives can arrive pre-configured to collect only the data within scope and the RCMgr tool logs the entire collection in granular detail, ensuring that we can track the process from start to finish. Upon completion of the collection, RCMgr verifies and encrypts the collected data for secure shipment back to one of our labs. 
 Our digital forensic services include analysis and investigative services in addition to collection services. Wherever electronic equipment is used, there is a potential source of electronic evidence and digital information, including a “bread crumb” trail to illuminate misuse or wrongdoing. Our computer forensics teams help extract critical evidence, recover any data that culprits may have sought to erase or hide, retrieve key data buried in documents and 
 8

organize data contained in multiple information sources. A forensic investigation may be undertaken on a wide range of media as anything that stores data can potentially be investigated. 
 Information Archiving Services 
 Legal Hold Management. A legal hold plan that recognizes when the duty to preserve data begins, what it entails, how to implement it and when it ends is essential to any information governance or eDiscovery strategy. Our Legal Hold Management solution addresses these issues through comprehensive technology and defensible processes. With a flexible Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) delivery model, clients can choose to manage holds on their own using our technology or leverage our consultants to oversee and manage the process. In addition to leveraging commercially available tools, such as Relativity Legal Hold, we offer Nebula Legal Hold, which simplifies the legal hold process by managing and tracking legal hold communications and key data in a single location. Project initiation and management is efficient and flexible, whether utilizing customized communications or leveraging a full bank of legal hold templates, including initial notices, questionnaires, follow-ups and acknowledgments.

 Data Recovery Services 
 Data Recovery. Business and private users routinely store business-critical data on servers, laptops, mobile devices and phones. As a result, data loss events can be devastating. The cost to an enterprise can amount to millions of dollars if they are unable to access important data for business operations. 
 9

To address those data loss events when they occur, we provide data recovery services worldwide. Data recovery refers to the recovery of specific information that is inaccessible due to accidental deletion, ransomware, hard drive accidental formatting, Windows reinstallation, partition loss, virtual machine deletion, system booting failure or physical damage of a storage device. The data recovery process involves a secure chain of custody and begins with a diagnosis of the media (hard disk drive, solid state drive, flash drive, RAID, database, tape or optical disk) by our data recovery engineers. The next step is to image the media, a bit by bit copy of the storage areas of the media, along with the system and hidden areas. The engineers then use proprietary tools and methods to reconstruct the data structures from the media image, which includes hidden and system areas. Physical damage may require additional clean room lab procedures, disassembly and use of new parts to access and reconstruct as much of the data as possible. 
 Ontrack Data Recovery performed over 42,000 data recoveries in more than 70 countries in 2020. Most of our clients believed that their data was secure, safe and backed-up although, for various reasons, it was not. When other data protection efforts fail, Ontrack can often recover our clients’ data, documents and critical systems. We believe that Ontrack is a global leader in the in-lab data recovery services industry and we have a 30-year history of developing our own recovery tools and making significant investments in automation. More than 20% of our data recovery jobs worldwide come from IT service companies or other data recovery companies who re-sell our data recovery services to their clients. 
 Email Extraction. We offer professional email recovery services for consumers and businesses alike. From individual files to entire databases, we maintain the expertise and technology to support practically any use case. The success of email recovery is dependent on where the email is stored. Email software, such as Microsoft Outlook, commonly stores email on hardware like a laptop, desktop, mobile phone, tablet or server. We can easily recover email from both functioning and non-functioning hardware. Additionally, our recovery engineers are experienced in recovering enterprise email no matter how it is stored on a client’s server, whether it is inside a database, a Microsoft Exchange Information Store or individual messages in separate files, such as .pst containers. 
 Tape Services. We provide a range of tape services to solve the problems associated with legacy backup tapes and regularly support our clients to solve the following challenges: 

• | backup infrastructure migration and consolidation;
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | legacy tape and data remediation;
--+----------------------------------


• | recovery from physically-damaged tapes; and
--+--------------------------------------------


• | recovery from quickly-erased or partially-overwritten tapes.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

 Data Destruction Services. Permanently deleting data isn’t as straightforward as pressing a delete button – it takes time and proper resources. Data that is not completely expunged before the media is disposed of is vulnerable to exposure. To increase the security of data, a secure, verified data destruction process is required. Based on their knowledge, our data experts seek to select and execute the most appropriate data destruction method for the client’s media. Once the data has been destroyed, we provide a certificate of destruction and disposal. 
 We support our clients throughout the whole data destruction process by offering data destruction services in our labs or onsite using Blancco Erasing Software or our Ontrack Degausser. For clients who want to handle the data destruction process themselves, we sell these products to the client and advise them how to best use them. 
 Mobile Phone Repair. We can repair broken screens and replace damaged batteries in many commonly used Apple and Samsung devices at our labs around the world.
 Data Recovery Software 
 Ontrack EasyRecovery. Developed through our partnership with one of the world’s leading data recovery software manufacturers, Ontrack EasyRecovery is able to handle nearly every type of logical data loss (not physical damage) situation. Ontrack EasyRecovery allows clients to perform precise file recovery of data lost through deletion, reformatting and a number of other data loss scenarios. The product recovers data from solid-state drives (“SSD”) and conventional hard drives, memory cards, USB hard drives, flash drives and optical media. The product functions on both Windows and Mac operating systems and comes in several different versions, ranging from a free version 
 10

ideal for small one-time recoveries to a Toolkit version which would give a professional the ability to handle complex projects. There is a “free” version that is capable of recovering up to 1 GB of data, a “Home” version for straightforward recoveries, a “Professional” version suitable for small to medium businesses and a “Technician” version that includes the tools needed to successfully perform data recoveries on all types of computer storage devices and rebuild broken RAID volumes. 
 Ontrack PowerControls. We believe Ontrack PowerControls is the market leading granular restore software product, developed from Ontrack’s expertise in data recovery. This product enables email and backup administrators and database administrators to restore individual mailboxes and messages, without having to restore the entire database. Ontrack PowerControls is used to find and export email, SharePoint items and structured query language (“SQL”) tables for eDiscovery, litigation, investigations, compliance, selective migration, develop and test and general restore use cases for IT. We believe Ontrack PowerControls provides a more powerful and faster search tool than native tools, and, most importantly for legal and compliance use cases, it does not alter the metadata, making it forensically sound. Most enterprise backup platforms do not have granular restore capabilities, so they partner with Ontrack and integrate Ontrack PowerControls with their products. 
 Payment and Billing Terms 
 Our eDiscovery solutions and information archiving services are billed on a monthly basis in arrears with amounts typically due within 30 to 45 days. Our data recovery services are billed as the services are provided, with payments due within 30 days of billing. The majority of our data recovery software is billed monthly in advance with amounts typically due within 30 to 45 days; however, depending on the client contract, billing can occur annually, quarterly or monthly. 
Competitive Strengths 
 Market Leader Across the eDiscovery Space. We are the third largest pure play electronic services discovery provider in the $10.9 billion eDiscovery industry, according to third-party data. We have established our market-leading position by leveraging our expansive sales force, national sales and service network, longstanding client relationships and operational expertise. Based on this prior experience, we believe that we will be able to further develop our market share. 
 Comprehensive Product Offering. We have a broad product offering of premium proprietary technology, such as eDiscovery processing, managed review, data hosting, data analytics, forensic collection, data recovery, archiving, managed services, email management and information governance. We believe that our diverse and comprehensive products and offerings make us the provider of choice for our clients. 
 Nebula Product Offering. Nebula provides us with several distinct advantages. First, the breadth of Nebula allows us to capture clients as early as the identification phase, via Nebula Big Data Store and Nebula Legal Hold, and keep them in the platform all the way through production. Second, our scale allows the platform to be deployed in many key geographic regions around the world, allowing us to penetrate underserved markets. Third, the flexibility to deploy Nebula in the cloud or at a client’s location, via NPC, removes significant geographical barriers to sales. Lastly, the platform is supported by our team of over 215 project managers and hosting support analysts globally. 
 Expansive Geographic Footprint. Our geographic presence spans the globe, with 32 offices in 18 countries. Our broad reach provides us with a first responder-type advantage when clients have urgent work requiring immediate attention. In addition, our familiarity with local laws and regulations allows us effectively assist clients in navigating complex, cross-border situations. 
 Established Client Relationships and Industry Expertise. We have longstanding relationships with a large and diverse group of clients, which include 98% of the AM Law 100 and 61% of Fortune 500 companies. We provide our clients with 24/7/365, follow-the-sun service.
 Proven and Experienced Management. We have a strong and highly experienced management team. Our chief executive officer Chris Weiler has more than 25 years of experience in the eDiscovery industry, and is one of the longest tenured CEO’s in the eDiscovery industry globally. During his tenure, Mr. Weiler and his team have identified, acquired and integrated 17 acquisitions and he has a proven track record and playbook for accretive 
 11

acquisitions with the ability to target companies that meet rigorous criteria focused on people, culture, client base, geography and technology. As a result of these acquisitions, the acquired company’s client bases are efficiently onboarded onto our proprietary platforms allowing a seamless transition for our clients and full access to our global capabilities, resulting in significant cross-selling opportunities and creating increased revenues and incremental profitability. Our chief financial officer Dawn Wilson has over 20 years of experience in finance and accounting, primarily with public companies in the technology and services industry, and has successfully acquired and integrated over 40 acquisitions in her career. 
 Growth Strategies 
 Increased Product Innovation. Adoption of cloud technology is expected to continue increasing. This shift presents market opportunities that we believe we are well positioned to capitalize upon. Our Nebula platform is a mature product, deployed globally in the cloud, in use by over 5,000 users and backed by our global client support and development teams, ensuring around-the-clock, “white glove” service and a rigorous, yet consistent, cadence for upgrades and improvements. The growth potential for this platform is further accentuated by our breadth of reach, powered largely by Nebula Big Data, which pushes our products’ capabilities into the information archiving market. We will also continue to advance our technology platform, both in and around Nebula, to give clients useful functionality and increased value. 
 Growth and Strengthening of Sales Force. We have been and will remain focused on attracting and retaining top sales professionals. We believe that certain key initiatives we are currently undertaking will ensure that accounts have proper coverage and penetration and will allow us to maximize wallet share. 
 Selectively Pursue Strategic Acquisitions. Due to the fragmentation in the legal technology and data recovery industries, there is substantial opportunity to continue completing strategic acquisitions of scale, as well as smaller, accretive tuck-in acquisitions. We have successfully sourced, executed and integrated ten strategic acquisitions since 2013. Acquisitions allow us to grow the company both inorganically and organically in that we can significantly increase revenue organically due to the breadth of service offerings and proprietary technology that we can provide to newly acquired customer relationships that were not available for the acquired sales people to sell before joining our company. For example, we acquired AlphaLit in 2013, and AlphaLit did not offer Managed Review services or Forensic Collection services. After the acquisition, the AlphaLit salespeople could sell these service offerings to existing AlphaLit customers, thereby increasing revenues. We will primarily focus on small to mid-size opportunities in order to leverage our scalable platform. We are experienced in quickly integrating acquired companies into our broader business, which has allowed us to significantly increase revenue and meaningfully increase EBITDA by focusing on preserving client facing personnel, client retention, seamless transition of clients of the target business and the ability for our new salespeople to sell across a broader platform. Our past acquisitions demonstrate our management’s ability to effectively source, execute and integrate acquisitions into their existing and growing platform. While we will continue to identify merger and acquisition opportunities to explore, we are temporarily halting such activity as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Clients 
 Our legal technology clients include both law firms and corporations serving many industry sectors including finance and banking, pharmaceutical and biotechnology, technology, insurance, real estate and government. Our data recovery clients include individuals and corporations requiring recovery and accessing of data. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we served over 4,400 legal technology clients, including 98% of the AM Law 100 and 61% of Fortune 500 companies. We have longstanding relationships with our clients, and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, no single client accounted for more than 5% of our revenues. 
Competition 
 The eDiscovery market is highly fragmented, competitive and evolving. Our competitors in the eDiscovery market include Consilio, EPIQ, FTI Consulting, Inc, United Lex, EY, Deloitte, KPMG, Navigant, Conduent, Lighthouse, Everlaw, Disco, Logikcull and Transperfect. We believe the principal competitive factors in this industry include: 

• | client service and support;
--+----------------------------


• | breadth of geographic coverage;
--+--------------------------------


• | quality and depth of services offered;
--+---------------------------------------

 12

 
• | pricing of service offerings;
--+------------------------------


• | security; and
--+--------------


• | client relationships and brand loyalty.
--+----------------------------------------

 There are hundreds of small regional eDiscovery providers which may have a few captive relationships but lack the resources or scale to compete for meaningful work. Likewise, of the global and national providers, most lack an end-to-end proprietary platform to complement their global scale and resources. We believe we are uniquely positioned with an ideal complement of global reach, scale of resources and proprietary technology to address almost any client need. 
 The data recovery market is highly fragmented and generally competitive. Clients choose vendors based on brand awareness and reputation, speed, price and security. Our competitors in the data recovery market include Drivesavers, Gillware Data Recovery, Disk Doctors, Digital Data Recovery DDC and Myung Information Technologies. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Sales 
 We operate with a global sales team to address the specialized needs of our client base and cultivate strategic partnerships with key clients in our industry. Our Legal Technology sales organization comprises over 40 professionals and is led by our sales executives and regional managers. Our business development managers have developed “first-call” relationships with several of our largest clients while providing significant expertise in the technical nature of the services. 
 Our global sales structure is tailored to deliver quick responses to sales executives on pricing, account ownership requests and general assistance with client requests and training. This structure is built on our foundational values of teamwork and responsiveness. Our global sales force pursues opportunities in a wide range of geographies and is not confined by the traditional territorial structure that competitors offer. This allows us to maximize relationships and revenue. 
 Sales leadership encourages representatives around the world to collaborate. A global sales strategy initiative has been implemented to facilitate communication between teams on shared major accounts, which includes the coordination of regular calls and information sharing on key accounts. Most law firms have multiple buyers and this model maximizes our ability to increase wallet share. 
 Sales executives are encouraged to act as their own entrepreneurs, backed by the support of seasoned sales leadership and a global sales operations team. The sales operations team assists the sales team with all client requests including conflict checks, SalesForce data entry, estimate creation and generation of client agreements and work orders. This global support team allows the sales representatives to focus on what they do best – generating new business and maintaining existing client relationships. Our global sales structure and sales operations teams deliver quick responses to representatives and clients, flexible pricing models and simplified matter initiation, giving us a competitive advantage in a fast-paced industry. 
 Marketing 
 We focus on connecting with our clients through our marketing team. Our marketing campaigns are home-grown and highlight the “KLD Difference. One KLD.” and are focused on our powerful, proprietary technology, marketed as “Proprietary Powerhouse.”
 We advertise in a wide variety of trade publications and at sports and entertainment events. We also sponsor a variety of events, seminars and conferences around the world. We operate approximately 35 global websites which highlight our leadership, products, services, technology, industry experience, press clippings and our community contributions. Holding true to our values, we are heavily focused on charitable donations and community work, 
 13

which are highlighted on our “KLD Community” website page. We also have a number of video advertising campaigns which are shared via YouTube, Twitter and LinkedIn. 
 Locations 
 We are headquartered in McLean, VA where we house key functions including accounting, finance, human resources, legal, eDiscovery operations, eDiscovery project management, managed review and data recovery. We maintain a diverse geographic footprint globally, with 32 locations in 18 countries. In addition, we have 9 data centers and 18 data recovery labs worldwide. We have document review facilities in the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union, and regularly recruit over 1000 remote reviewers across the United States. 
 In addition to on-premise data centers, we deliver our proprietary Nebula platform via the cloud and Nebula Private Cloud, which means that a Nebula environment can be established in any Microsoft Azure location worldwide. The Nebula Private Cloud devices are custom-built hardware running the Nebula platform and, thus, can be deployed virtually anywhere. 
 
Intellectual Property 
 We own a range of registered intellectual property rights across the world, primarily trademark registrations and patents. 
 We own 125 trademark registrations globally and currently have 26 trademark applications at various stages in the application process. Our material trademarks are either registered or are pending applications for registrations in the U.S. Patent and Trademark office and various non-U.S. jurisdictions (but with a focus on the European Union, the United Kingdom, Norway, Switzerland, Japan, Australia, China, Singapore and Hong Kong). We use “KLDiscovery,” “Ontrack” and “Ibas” as our primary corporate trademarks. The trademark “KLDiscovery” has proceeded to registration in Australia, China, the European Union, Hong Kong, India, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Additionally, we have applied to register “Nebula,” the brand name for our proprietary e-discovery platform, in our key markets and, to date, applications have proceeded to registration in the United States, the European Union, United Kingdom, Switzerland and Brazil. 
 “Ontrack” and “Ontrack Data Recovery” are used in Canada by us subject to a perpetual license from Kroll, LLC who own the “Kroll Ontrack” trademark in that jurisdiction. This license was granted as part of the Kroll Ontrack acquisition in December 2016. 
 We are the registered proprietor of over 500 domain names including our key domains used to promote our activities, being kldiscovery.com, ontrack.com and ibas.com together with many local variants of these main domain names. 
 We own the copyright of many of our business software and tools as they have been created by employees in the course of their employment. These include the Nebula and EDR platforms (two proprietary eDiscovery platforms for access and review of data), the PMDB Database (internal job tracking tool), Service Cloud (data recovery portal), PowerControls (data recovery software for email) and several Relativity applications to enhance the license of standard Relativity platform services. 
 We have a total of 23 patents, either registered in their respective jurisdiction or at application stage, including recent applications for our Nebula offering. 
 
Human Capital Management - Attracting, Developing and Retaining Highly Qualified Talent
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had 2,323 employees. This total included 1,125 temporary contingent employees who are employed temporarily to work on active managed review matters. Our employees are not represented by a labor union and we have not experienced any work stoppages. We believe that our employee relations are excellent.
 
14

Successful execution of our corporate strategy is dependent on attracting, developing and retaining key employees and members of our management team. The skills, experience and industry knowledge of our employees significantly benefit our operations and performance. We continuously evaluate, modify and enhance our internal processes and technologies to increase employee engagement, productivity and efficiency.
 As of December 31, 2020, not including the 1,125 employees who are employed temporarily to work on active managed review matters, our employees, including those employed by region, were approximately:
 

 
Region | Employee Count | 
--------------------------------+----------------+------
North America | | 756 
Europe, Middle East, and Africa | | 390 
Asia Pacific | | 52 
Total | | 1,198

 
In order to comply with local employee-related laws, we do not require our employees to disclose their race and ethnicity. As of December 31, 2020, based on self-reported information of 61.8% of our employees, our global gender and ethnicity demographics were as follows:
 
 
Gender | Employee Percentage
--------------------------------------------------+--------------------

 Item 1
A. Risk Factors. 
 An investment in our securities carries a significant degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risks, as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our historical financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before you decide to purchase our securities. Any one of these risks and uncertainties has the potential to cause material adverse effects on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results which could cause actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements expressed by us and a significant decrease in the value of our Common Stock and Warrants. Refer to “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” 
 We may not be successful in preventing the material adverse effects that any of the following risks and uncertainties may cause. These potential risks and uncertainties may not be a complete list of the risks and uncertainties facing us. There may be additional risks and uncertainties that we are presently unaware of, or presently consider immaterial, that may become material in the future and have a material adverse effect on us. You could lose all or a significant portion of your investment due to any of these risks and uncertainties. 
 Risks Related to Our Business 
 We process, store and use personal and other special datasets on behalf of some of our clients, which subjects us to governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy and information security, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business and reputation.
 
We collect, store, transmit, use, disclose and process data that was collected from persons or their devices (“personally identifiable information” or “PII”) and other sensitive client data. In addition to terms in our contractual arrangements with clients, there are numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations and directives regarding privacy and the collection, storage, transmission, use, processing, disclosure and protection of such PII and other personal or client data, the scope of which is continually evolving and subject to differing interpretations. We and our clients must comply with such laws, regulations and directives and we and our clients may be subject to significant consequences, including penalties and fines, for our failure to comply.
 For example, on May 25, 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation 679/2016 (“GDPR”) replaced the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC with respect to the processing of PII in the European Union. The GDPR imposes several stringent requirements for controllers and processors of PII (including non-E.U. processors who process personal data on behalf of E.U. controllers), including, for example, more robust internal accountability controls, a strengthened individual data rights regime, shortened timelines for mandatory data breach notifications, limitations on retention and secondary use of information and additional obligations when we contract with third parties in connection with the processing of PII. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the applicable 
 16

national data protection laws of the E.U. member states may result in fines of up to €20 million or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, and other administrative penalties. Complying with the GDPR has required us to implement additional internal processes to ensure that we collect and process PII in a compliant way and re-draft all our standard contracts to meet specific articles within the GDPR. As we continue to operate under the GDPR, compliance may become onerous and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
 In addition, recent legal developments in Europe have created complexity and compliance uncertainty regarding certain transfers of information from the EEA to the United States. For example, on July 16, 2020, the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, which allows for the transfer of personal data from the US to the EU, was invalidated by the European Court of Justice (“CJEU”) and this was followed on September 8, 2020 by the invalidation of the equivalent Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework. Three of our group companies are accredited under the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework to legitimize the transfer of personal data from the EEA to the US. Although the CJEU upheld the adequacy of the standard contractual clauses (a standard form of contract approved by the European Commission as an adequate PII transfer mechanism) upon which we rely for intra group transfers of PII (and is the most widely used transfer mechanism by our clients), it made clear that use of the standard contractual clauses must now be assessed on a case-by-case basis taking into account the legal regime applicable in the destination country, in particular applicable surveillance laws and rights of individuals. Additionally, the European Data Protection Board (assigned by the European Commission to oversee data privacy in the EU) has issued guidance concerning data transfers following these CJEU decision which places a higher burden on compliance for data transfers. Given these legal developments, the long-term future of the standard contractual clauses remains uncertain and may be invalidated in future by European courts or supervisory authorities and we could be impacted by changes in law as a result of any future review of these transfer mechanisms. If further legal bases for transferring PII from Europe to the United States are invalidated, or if we are unable to transfer PII between and among countries and regions in which we operate, it could affect the manner in which we provide our services or could adversely affect our financial results.
 The introduction of the California Consumer Protection Act (“CCPA”), which became effective on January 1, 2020, introduces the most stringent data privacy laws in the United States. While its effect is targeted at the collection and use of consumer personal data, its introduction has required us to assess certain processes and workflows when using data that could be covered by the CCPA. For example, where data relevant to CCPA is introduced into our systems, we are required to track the location of such data, hold it safely and securely, authenticate and answer requests from data subjects, and purge such data upon expiration of the contractual function for which it is held. These requirements are not only costly in implementation of new processes and functionalities but also, where any violation is found, the CCPA allows for private lawsuits from consumers and liquidated damages between $100 and $750 per consumer for incidences of data breach, in addition to the possible imposition of civil penalties by the Attorney General of California (ranging from no more than $2,500 for each violation and up to $7,500 for any intentional violation found to occur). If further states introduce new privacy laws, it could affect how our services are provided and impact our financial results.
 Furthermore, any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with or make effective modifications to our policies, or to comply with any federal, state or international privacy, data-retention or data-protection-related laws, regulations, orders or industry self-regulatory principles could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others (including clients), a loss of client confidence, damage to our brand and reputation or a loss of clients, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, various federal, state and foreign legislative or regulatory bodies may enact new or additional laws and regulations concerning privacy, data-retention and data-protection issues, including laws or regulations mandating disclosure to domestic or international law enforcement bodies, which could adversely impact our business, our brand or our reputation with clients. For example, some countries have adopted laws mandating that PII regarding clients in their country be maintained solely in their country. Having to maintain local data centers and redesign product, service and business operations to limit PII processing to within individual countries could increase our operating costs significantly.
 Additionally, in connection with some of our product initiatives, we expect that our clients may increasingly use our cloud services to store and process PII and other regulated data. While we include minimum privacy or information security commitments in our contracts, E.U. requirements may make it so that we will be unable to do business without such commitments. Any failure by us to timely amend client contracts to conform to changing data 
 17

protection laws, or to comply with our posted privacy policies, other federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations, or the privacy or information security commitments contained in our contracts could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others, including individual rights of action, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the increased attention focused upon any liability we may have as a result of lawsuits or regulatory actions could also harm our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business. Furthermore, although we market and sell products to our clients to help them comply with federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations and directives, including the GDPR, our clients are responsible for ensuring they are in compliance with such laws, regulations and directives. Any failure by our clients to comply could result in significant consequences to them, including penalties and fines, and despite the existence of contractual exclusions and marketing disclaimers which make their responsibility for their own compliance clear, our clients may file claims or seek indemnification from us, which may result in reputational harm and require us to expend time, effort and costs to defend such claims or respond to indemnification requests.
 In addition to government regulation, privacy advocacy and industry groups or other third parties may propose new and different self-regulatory standards that either legally or contractually apply to our clients or us. Any significant change to applicable laws, regulations, directives or industry practices regarding the collection, storage, transmission, processing, use or disclosure of our clients’ data, or regarding the manner in which the express or implied consent of clients for the collection, storage, transmission, processing, use and disclosure of such data is obtained, could require us to modify our solutions and features, possibly in a material manner, and may limit our ability to develop new services and features that make use of the data that our clients voluntarily share with us. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies, our privacy-related obligations to clients or other third parties, our privacy-related legal obligations or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized access to, use, release or transfer of PII or other client data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation, negative media attention or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause our clients to lose trust in us, which would have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. Our clients may also accidentally disclose their passwords or store them on a mobile device that may be lost or stolen, resulting in unauthorized access to their data and creating the perception that our systems are not secure against third-party access. Additionally, if employees or third parties that we work with, such as contractors, vendors or developers, violate applicable laws or our policies, such violations may also put our clients’ information at risk and could in turn have an adverse effect on our business.
 We have expanded our involvement in the delivery and provision of cloud computing through business alliances with various providers of cloud computing services and software and expect to continue to do so in the future. The application of U.S. and international data privacy laws to cloud computing vendors is uncertain, and our existing contractual provisions may prove to be inadequate to protect us from claims for data loss or regulatory noncompliance made against us resulting from the failures of cloud computing providers which we may partner with. While we do limit this in our contractual agreements with clients, the failure to comply with data protection laws and regulations by our clients and business partners who provide cloud computing services could have a material adverse effect on our business. Some cloud computing providers have been reluctant to provide us with information which we need in order to comply with E.U. privacy laws, and some providers refuse to offer legally compliant terms or offer terms that are commercially reasonable. We will need to modify our procurement processes in response to changing client and regulatory demands. If we fail to do so correctly, or in a timely manner, we may experience disruptions in client relationships, or receive regulatory inquiries or be the subject of government enforcement actions, which may in turn cause a material loss in revenues or damage our brand and reputation.
 
An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as a novel strain of coronavirus, could have an ongoing material adverse impact on the Company’s business, operating results and financial condition.
 
We are vulnerable to the general economic effects of disease outbreaks and similar public health threats. COVID-19 began to spread globally in late 2019 and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and continues to impact worldwide economic activity. A public health pandemic, including COVID-19, poses the risk that we or our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers and other business partners may be prevented from conducting business activities for an indefinite period of time, including due to shutdowns that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities. KLDiscovery was eligible for federal government stimulus incentives, including U.S.

payroll tax deferral and employee retention tax credits. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we have deferred $4.0 million in payroll taxes, which we will repay $2.0 million by December 31, 2021 and $2.0 million by December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2020, we have claimed tax credits of $1.8 million, primarily related to the retention of our employees, which we do not have to repay.

Primarily due to the impact of COVID-19, our revenues decreased by $22.5 million, or 7.2%, to $289.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $312.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as many clients delayed new litigation and court systems closed for a period of time and have been slow to reopen. The extent to which COVID-19 will impact our results, including the ability of our customers to survive and continue to pay in a timely manner, is dependent on uncertain and unpredictable new information about COVID-19 and various new strains now emerging, and the responsive measures taken by the governments of countries we serve, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 We operate in highly competitive markets and our inability to effectively compete may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
 
The markets for our products and services are highly competitive and are subject to rapid technological changes and evolving client demands and needs. We compete on the basis of various factors, including product functionality, product integration, platform coverage, quality of service interoperability with third-party technologies, ability to scale and price products and services, worldwide sales infrastructure, global technical support, name recognition and reputation.
 Our competitors vary in size, scope and breadth of the products and services they offer and include software vendors that offer software products that directly compete with our product offerings. In our Data & Storage Technology (“DST”) business, we face growing competition from network equipment, computer hardware manufacturers, large operating system providers and other technology companies that increasingly develop and incorporate into their products storage, server management software and backup that compete at some levels with our product offerings. Our competitive position could be materially adversely affected if our clients perceive the functionality incorporated into these products as a replacement for our products. Many of our principal competitors are established companies that have substantial financial resources, recognized brands, technological expertise and market experience, and sometimes have more established positions in certain product lines and geographies than we do. We also compete with smaller and sometimes newer companies, some of which are specialized with a narrower focus than our company, and face competition from other eDiscovery and data management services providers. Our competitors invest significantly in research and development as well as sales and marketing. We also face competition from the backup services solutions offered by cloud IT providers. 
 
Our competitors may be able to more quickly adopt new or emerging technologies or address client requirements and new and emerging technologies may allow startup companies to more quickly enter the market than in the past. We may also face increased competition from companies that provide more in-depth offerings, adapting their products and services to meet the demands of their clients or combining with one of their competitors to enhance their products and services. A number of our principal competitors may continue to make acquisitions to improve the competitiveness of their offerings. Increased competition could cause, among other things, price reductions of our products, reduced profitability and loss of market share. To competitively serve the needs of our existing clients and to attract new clients, we must continue to:

We may need to change our pricing models in order to compete successfully.
 General economic and business conditions together with intense competition in the sales of our products and services place pressure on us to reduce prices for our software and services, and we frequently encounter aggressive price competition. If our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services or develop products that the marketplace considers more valuable than ours, we may need to lower our prices or offer other incentives in order to compete successfully. Any such changes may reduce margins and could adversely affect operating results. Additionally, the increasing prevalence of cloud and SaaS delivery models offered by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact pricing of both our on-site software business and our cloud business, as well as overall demand for our on-site software product and service offerings, which could reduce our revenues and profitability. 
 Industry pricing models are evolving, and we anticipate that clients may increasingly request alternative pricing models. These pricing models may exacerbate existing pricing pressures, require investments in different product solutions or place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors. Moreover, the use of evolving technology by our clients to develop more complex pricing models may lead to additional pricing pressures. If we are unable to adapt our operations to these evolving pricing models, our results of operations may be adversely affected or we may not be able to offer pricing that is attractive relative to our competitors. 
 
Any broad-based change to our prices and pricing policies could cause our revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force implements, and our clients adjust to, such new pricing policies. Some of our competitors may bundle products for promotional purposes or as a long-term pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations. These practices could, over time, significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for certain of our products. If we do not adapt our pricing models to reflect changes in client use of our products or changes in client demand, our revenues could decrease. An increase in open source software distribution may also cause us to change our pricing models. 
 
Our inability to successfully recover from a disaster or other business continuity event could impair our ability to deliver our products and services and harm our business. 
 We are heavily reliant on our technology and infrastructure to provide our products and services to our clients. For example, we provide services through computer hardware that is located in our 9 global data centers around the world as well as in cloud-based data centers offered through the Microsoft Azure Cloud. Our physical data centers are vulnerable to damage, interruption or performance problems from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures and similar events. They are also subject to break-ins, computer viruses, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct. The occurrence of any of these events, a decision to close a data center, or other unanticipated problems could result in interruptions in the delivery of certain of our products and services. 
 Any errors, defects, disruptions or other performance problems with our systems, products and services could reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause clients to terminate their agreements with us, commence or threaten litigation against us, harm our reputation and damage our clients’ businesses. For example, we may experience disruptions, outages and other performance problems due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, capacity constraints due to an overwhelming number of users accessing our website simultaneously, fraud or security attacks. In some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time. Interruptions in our products and services could impact our revenues or cause clients to cease doing business with us. In addition, our business would be harmed if any events of this nature caused our clients and potential clients to believe our services are unreliable. Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations. 
 Our products, SaaS offerings, website and networks may be subject to intentional or accidental disruption that could materially adversely affect our reputation, business and future sales. 
 Despite our precautions and significant ongoing investments to protect against security risks such as data breaches, cyber-attacks and other intentional or accidental disruptions of our products, offerings and networks, we expect to be an ongoing target of attacks specifically designed to breach or interrupt our networks and systems, which could 
 20

harm our reputation and result in litigation, fines and penalties. Sophisticated actors may attempt to penetrate our network security or the security of our website and misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions to our services. Our products may come under focused threats and attacks and we or our clients may suffer data loss as a consequence of such attacks on our products. Such cyber-attacks threaten to misappropriate our proprietary information and cause interruptions of our information technology (“IT”) services. Because the techniques used by unauthorized persons to access or sabotage networks change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate or detect these techniques. Further, if unauthorized access or sabotage remains undetected for an extended period of time, the effects of such breach could be exacerbated. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including “bugs” and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of our systems and networks. We have experienced and defended against threats to our systems and security including malware, phishing attacks and Distributed Denial of Service attacks, with none having had a material adverse effect on our business to date. However, we may experience more serious incidents in the future. Our exposure to cybersecurity threats and negative consequences of cybersecurity breaches will likely increase as we store increasing amounts of our clients’ data in cloud-based environments. 
 We outsource a number of our internal business functions to third-party contractors, and some of our client facing business operations depend, in part, on the success of our contractors’ own cybersecurity measures. We also partner with cloud service providers for some client service offerings. Similarly, particularly for the DST business, we rely upon distributors, resellers, system vendors and systems integrators to sell our products and our sales operations depend, in part, on the reliability of their cybersecurity measures. Additionally, we depend upon our employees to appropriately handle confidential information and deploy our IT resources in a safe and secure fashion and in accordance with our policies so as not to expose our network systems to security breaches and the loss of data. Accordingly, if our cybersecurity systems, policies and procedures, and those of our contractors, partners and vendors fail to protect against unauthorized access, cyber-attacks or the mishandling of information by our employees, contractors, partners or vendors, our ability to conduct our business effectively could be damaged in a number of ways, including: 
 
 
• | sensitive data regarding our business, including intellectual property and other proprietary data, could be stolen or mishandled;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our sensitive or proprietary data or the sensitive and proprietary data of our could be rendered unavailable through a ransomware attack, resulting in potentially significant service disruptions, negative publicity, and loss of business
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our electronic communications systems, including email and other methods, could be disrupted, and our ability to conduct our business operations could be seriously damaged until such systems can be restored and secured;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our ability to process client orders and electronically deliver products and services could be lost or degraded, and our distribution channels could be disrupted, resulting in delays in revenue recognition;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | defects and security vulnerabilities could be exploited or introduced into our products or our cloud offerings, thereby damaging the reputation and perceived reliability and security of our products and services and potentially making the data systems of our clients vulnerable to further data loss and cyber incidents; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | PII, protected health information (“PHI”) or other confidential data of our clients, employees and business partners could be stolen or lost.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Should any of the above events occur, we could be subject to significant claims for liability from our clients and regulatory actions from governmental agencies, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights could be compromised and our reputation and competitive position could be significantly harmed. The regulatory and contractual actions, litigations, investigations, fines, penalties and liabilities relating to data breaches that result in losses of PII, PHI or credit card information of users of our services can be significant in terms of fines and reputational impact, and necessitate changes to our business operations that may be disruptive to us. Additionally, we could incur significant costs in order to upgrade our cybersecurity systems and remediate damages. Consequently, our financial performance and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.
 21

If we do not continue to attract, motivate and retain members of our senior management team and key employees, we may be unable to expand our products and services offering or effectively manage or grow our business. 
 Our future success depends upon the continued service and performance of our senior management team and key technical and sales personnel. If we lose any of our senior management term or key technical and sales personnel, we may be unable to effectively manage our current and future operations. 
 Our success depends upon our ability to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified technical, managerial, and sales and marketing employees in order to implement our corporate development strategy and operations. The pool of qualified candidates is limited and we face intense competition. If we are unable to continue to successfully recruit and retain the most skilled and capable senior managers and key technical and sales employees, our ability to implement our business plan and develop and maintain our software could be adversely affected and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
 Our ability to expand our operations and maintain or increase our revenue is dependent on the quality of our client service and support services, and our failure to provide high level service could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 Our clients depend upon our client service and support staff to meet their eDiscovery needs and they demand high-quality support services. Failure to meet that demand could negatively affect our reputation in the marketplace and could adversely affect sales of our services and solutions, potentially having a material and adverse affect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Defects, disruptions, performance problems or risks related to the provision of our product offerings could impair our ability to deliver our services and could expose us to liability, damage our brand and reputation or otherwise negatively impact our business.
 Certain of our products and services utilize software solutions developed by us or third parties for our clients’ needs, and new releases of software products are issued to our clients periodically. Complex software products, such as those we offer, may contain undetected errors or defects, especially when they are first introduced or new versions are released. Despite testing, these undetected errors may be discovered only after a product has been installed and used either in our internal processing system or by our clients, and could result in unanticipated service interruptions or other performance problems and cause damage to our clients’ businesses. If that occurs, clients could elect not to renew with us, to delay or withhold payment to us, or to make warranty or other claims against us, and we could be obligated to provide service credits based on our failure to meet service level commitments, which could result in additional expense and risk of litigation. 
 We believe that our reputation and name recognition are critical factors in our ability to compete and generate additional sales. Promotion and enhancement of our name will depend largely on our success in continuing to provide effective products and services. The occurrence of errors in our products or services, the discovery of security vulnerabilities or the detection of bugs by our clients may damage our reputation in the market and our relationships with our existing clients, and as a result, we may be unable to attract or retain clients. 
 
In addition, because our products and services are used to manage data that is often critical to our clients, they may have a greater sensitivity to defects in our products than to defects in other, less critical, applications. As a result, the licensing and support of our products and services involve the risk of product liability claims. Our license agreements with our clients typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims. However, the limitation of liability provisions contained in our license agreements vary and may not be effective as a result of existing or future national, federal, state or local laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions. Although we have not experienced any material product liability claims to date, the sale and support of our products entail the risk of such claims, which could be substantial in light of the use of our products in enterprise-wide environments. In addition, our insurance against product liability may not be adequate to cover all potential claims. 
 22

If we are unable to develop new and enhanced products and services that achieve widespread market acceptance, or if we are unable to continually improve the performance, features and reliability of our existing products and services or adapt our business model to keep pace with industry trends, our business and operating results could be materially adversely affected. 
 The markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product introductions, evolving industry standards and changing client needs. We believe that key competitive factors in the markets we serve include the breadth and quality of professional services, system and software solution offerings, product integration, platform coverage, the stability of our information systems, the features and capabilities of our product and service offerings, the pricing of our products and services, and the potential for future product and service enhancements. Our future success depends on our ability to keep pace with technological changes and to respond to the rapidly changing needs of our clients by developing or introducing new products, product upgrades and services on a timely and cost-effective basis. We have in the past incurred, and will continue to incur, significant research and development expenses as we strive to remain competitive. Clients may require features and capabilities that our current products and services do not have, such as remote collections from mobile phones. We need to successfully respond to significant market challenges to our existing product portfolio as well as invest in new growth areas based on our core technical capabilities. Our failure to develop products and services that satisfy client preferences in a timely and cost-effective manner may harm our ability to maintain relationships with existing clients, as well as our ability to create or increase demand for our products and services, and may materially adversely affect our operating results. As competition in the IT industry increases, it may become increasingly difficult for us to maintain a technological advantage and to leverage that advantage toward increased revenues and profits. New product development and introduction involve a significant commitment of time and resources and are subject to a number of risks and challenges including: 
 
 
• | managing the length of the development cycle for new products and product enhancements, which can fluctuate as new features are developed;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | designing and marketing products and professional services solutions that will be adopted by our client base as well as attract new clients for our technology;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | managing clients’ transitions to new products and services;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | adapting to emerging and evolving industry standards and to technological developments by our competitors and clients;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | extending the operation of our products and services to new and evolving platforms, operating systems, operating environments and models, including support of new workloads and data management technologies, and hardware products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | clients’ ability to upgrade to the most current versions of software to take advantage of new functionalities;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | reacting to trends and predicting which technologies will be successful and develop into industry standards;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | tailoring our business and pricing models appropriately as we enter new markets and respond to competitive pressures and technological changes;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | extending or creating technology alliances with other key technology players in our industry;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | managing new product and service strategies for the markets in which we operate;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | addressing trade compliance issues affecting our ability to ship our products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | developing or expanding efficient sales channels; and
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | obtaining sufficient licenses to technology and technical access from proprietary software providers, open source software providers and operating system software vendors on reasonable terms to enable the development and deployment of interoperable products, including source code licenses for certain products with deep technical integration into operating systems.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 23

If we are not successful in managing these risks and challenges, if our new products, product upgrades and services are not technologically competitive or do not achieve market acceptance, or if our efforts are more costly or resource-intensive than anticipated or fail to achieve the expected outcomes, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
 We develop products and services that interoperate with certain software, operating systems and hardware developed by others, and if the developers of such software, operating systems and hardware do not cooperate with us, if we are unable to obtain access to their new products or if we are unable to devote the necessary resources so that our applications interoperate with those third-party systems, our development efforts may be delayed or foreclosed and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. 
 Our products and services operate primarily on the Windows, UNIX and Linux operating systems, are used in conjunction with the Microsoft SQL and Microsoft Azure platforms, and operate on hardware devices of numerous manufacturers. When new or updated versions of these operating systems, software applications and hardware devices are introduced, it is often necessary for us to develop updated versions of our software applications so that they interoperate properly with these systems and devices. We may not accomplish these development efforts quickly or cost-effectively, or at all, and it is not clear what the relative growth rates of these operating systems and hardware will be. These development efforts require the cooperation of the developers of the operating systems, software applications, and hardware, as well as substantial capital investment and the devotion of substantial employee and/or financial resources. For some operating systems, we must obtain some proprietary application program interfaces from the owner in order to develop software applications that interoperate with the operating system. Operating system and software owners have no obligation to assist in these development efforts, provide us with early access to their technology and products or share with or sell to us any application program interfaces, formats or protocols we may need. If they do not provide us with the necessary access, assistance or proprietary technology on a timely basis, or at all, we may experience product development delays or be unable to expand our software applications into other areas. 
 A large number of our proprietary software and applications are built on commonly used “open source” licenses. We maintain a record of all “open source” licenses used for such software and applications. Despite this, a failure to materially comply with the terms of such “open source” licenses could negatively affect our business and subject us to possible litigation. 
 
The unavailability of third-party technology could adversely impact our revenue and results of operations. 
 We license certain eDiscovery-related software from third parties and incorporate or integrate such components into and with our services and products. For instance, we integrate third-party solutions licensed from certain providers such as Relativity, a key supplier of one of our eDiscovery platforms, with the delivery of our eDiscovery services and products. While we have developed our own proprietary platforms, certain third-party software, such as that licensed from Relativity, has become central to the operation and delivery of our eDiscovery services and products. 
 Certain of our third-party software license contracts expire within the next one to three years and may be renewed only by mutual consent. For instance, our license contract with Relativity expires on June 30, 2024. There is no assurance that we will be able to renew these contracts as they expire or that such renewals will be on the same or substantially similar terms or on conditions that are commercially reasonable to us. If we fail to renew these contracts as they expire, we may be unable to offer certain eDiscovery-related services and products to our clients. In addition, our third-party software licenses are non-exclusive. For example, all of our primary competitors in the eDiscovery business use Relativity in connection with their eDiscovery platforms (in addition to any proprietary platforms that they may own themselves). 
 If certain of our third-party licensors were to change their product offerings, cease actively supporting their existing technologies, fail to update and enhance their technologies to keep pace with changing industry standards, encounter technical difficulties in the continued development of their technologies, significantly increase prices, terminate our licenses, suffer significant capacity or supply chain constraints or suffer other disruptions, we would need to identify alternative suppliers and incur additional internal and/or external development costs to ensure continued performance of our eDiscovery-related services and products. Such alternatives may not be available on attractive 
 24

terms, or at all, or may not be as widely accepted or as effective as the software provided by our existing suppliers. If the cost of licensing or maintaining this third-party technology significantly increases, our revenues could significantly decrease. In addition, interruptions in the functionality of our services and products resulting from changes in or with our third party licensors could adversely affect our commitments to clients, future sales of our services and products solutions, and negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We utilize various web service providers, such as Microsoft Azure, for the delivery of our cloud-based products. These services are operated by third parties that we do not control and that could require significant time to replace. We expect this dependence on third parties to continue. These systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption and have experienced interruptions in the past. A prolonged web service disruption affecting our cloud-based offerings for any of the foregoing reasons would negatively impact our ability to serve our clients and could damage our reputation with current and potential clients, expose us to liability, cause us to lose clients or otherwise harm our business. We may also incur significant costs for using alternative equipment or taking other actions in preparation for, or in reaction to, events that damage the web services we use. Interruptions in these third party-services on which we rely could affect the security or availability of our products and cloud infrastructure and could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, these web services providers may generally terminate our agreements for convenience upon providing some nominal period of notice and may terminate our agreements for cause if a breach by us has not been cured within a short time period. In the event that our service agreements are terminated, or there is a lapse of service, elimination of web services or features that we utilize, interruption of internet service provider connectivity or damage to such facilities, we could experience interruptions in access to our platforms as well as significant delays and additional expense in arranging or creating new facilities and services and/or re-architecting our solutions for deployment on a different cloud infrastructure service provider, which may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
 If we we encounter difficulties as we implement our new consolidated business systems, our business may be adversely affected. 
 We are in the process of implementing new consolidated business systems across our global operations. We rely on our IT to help us effectively manage our client relationships, sales information, order processing and support and marketing services, and we anticipate that the implementation of new consolidated business systems will improve our processes. However, there is a risk that implementation of these new systems will not achieve these expected benefits as quickly as anticipated or at all. In addition, there can be no assurance that there will not be errors, delays or other related issues resulting from the transition to our new business systems and adjustments to associated business processes, or that we will be able to fix any error or issue. Such errors, delays or issues may result in unanticipated costs or expenditures and divert the attention of key senior management away from other aspects of our business, which may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. 
 Our failure to comply with the export controls and trade and economic sanctions laws and regulations of the United States and various international jurisdictions could result in legal liability and materially adversely affect our reputation and results of operations.
 Our business activities are subject to various export controls and trade and economic sanctions laws and regulations, including, without limitation, the U.S. Commerce Department’s Export Administration Regulations, the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control’s (“OFAC”) trade and economic sanctions programs, the United Nations Security Council, and other laws and regulations of a similar nature administered and enforced by relevant government authorities (collectively, “Trade Controls”). Such Trade Controls may prohibit or restrict our ability to, directly or indirectly, conduct activities or dealings in or with certain countries, as well as with individuals or entities that are the subject of Trade Controls-related prohibitions and restrictions. For example, our ability to procure items necessary for our business activities could be adversely impacted by the imposition of export or sanctions-related prohibitions or restrictions on our contractual counterparties. Similarly, our sales of certain commodities, software and technology, and our provision of services to persons located outside the United States may be subject to certain regulatory prohibitions, restrictions or other requirements, including certain licensing or reporting requirements. Similarly, our ability to procure such items necessary for our business activities could be adversely impacted by the imposition of export or sanctions-related prohibitions or restrictions on our contractual counterparties. Our failure to successfully comply with applicable Trade Controls may expose us to negative legal and business consequences, including civil or criminal penalties, government investigations, disgorgement of 
 25

profits, injunctions and suspension or debarment from government contracts, other remedial measures, and reputational harm. Investigations of alleged violations can be expensive and disruptive. 
 Although we have implemented compliance policies and internal procedures reasonably designed to promote compliance with applicable Trade Controls, we cannot assure compliance by our employees or representatives for which we may be held responsible, and any such violation could materially adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Third party claims of infringement could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from selling our products.
 
The software and internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have received in the past, and may receive in the future, communications from third parties alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights, including claims regarding patents, copyrights, trade secrets and trademarks.
 
Because of the constant technological change in the markets in which we compete and the extensive coverage of intellectual property protection for existing technologies, including software patents, it is possible that the number of these claims may grow.
 
Any such intellectual property claim, with or without merit, could result in costly litigation and distract management from day-to-day operations, and the outcomes of such claims are uncertain. If we are not successful in defending such claims, we could be required to stop selling, delay shipments of or redesign our products, stop offering (or temporarily stop offering) our services to others, pay monetary amounts as damages, enter into royalty or licensing arrangements or satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our clients, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. There is no assurance that any royalty or licensing arrangements we may seek in such circumstances will be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, certain client agreements require us to indemnify our clients for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim. We have made and expect to continue making significant expenditures to preempt, investigate, defend and settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights, including trademarks, as part of our strategy to manage this risk.
 Risks Related to our Substantial Indebtedness
 Our substantial levels of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition. 
 As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $506 million of indebtedness, consisting of borrowings under our First Lien Facility (as defined herein) and the Debentures. See “Item 13 - Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions” for additional information. 
 Our indebtedness could have important consequences to us and our investors, including, but not limited to: 
  
• | increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and industry conditions;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures or other general corporate purposes;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | limiting flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the competitive environment; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | limiting our ability to borrow additional funds and increasing the cost of any such borrowing.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, as our indebtedness matures, or if we are unable to service our high level of indebtedness, we may need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, sell material assets or operations or raise additional 
 26

debt or equity capital. We may not be able to effect any of these actions on a timely basis, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and these actions may not be sufficient to meet our capital requirements. Furthermore, we may not be able to invest in our business and as a result, we may not be able to achieve our forecasted results of operation. 
 If we are unable to make required interest and principal payments on our indebtedness, it would result in an event of default under the agreements governing such indebtedness, which may result in the acceleration of some or all of our outstanding indebtedness and foreclosure on the assets that secure such indebtedness. 
 Although our debt agreements contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial, thereby exacerbating the risks associated with our high level of indebtedness. 
 For additional information on our indebtedness, see the Liquidity and Capital Resources discussion in Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation and Note 7 – Subsequent Events in Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
 Risks Related to our Capital Stock and Other Business Risks
 
We may need to recognize impairment charges related to goodwill, identified intangible assets and fixed assets. 
 We have substantial balances of goodwill and identified intangible assets. We are required to test goodwill and any other intangible assets with an indefinite life for possible impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently when circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. We are also required to evaluate amortizable intangible assets and fixed assets for impairment if there are indicators of a possible impairment. 
 
Based on the results of the annual impairment test as of October 1, 2020, the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded the individual reporting unit’s carrying value, and goodwill was not impaired. There is significant judgment required in the analysis of a potential impairment of goodwill, identified intangible assets and fixed assets. If, as a result of a general economic slowdown, deterioration in one or more of the markets in which we operate or impairment in our financial performance and/or future outlook, the estimated fair value of our long-lived assets decreases, we may determine that one or more of our long-lived assets is impaired. An impairment charge would be recorded if the estimated fair value of the assets is lower than the carrying value and any such impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. 
 Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited and could adversely impact ur business, financial condition and operating results. 
 Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income and taxes may be limited. In general, an “ownership change” occurs if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by “5% shareholders” (as defined under U.S. income tax laws) that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules apply under state tax laws. If we experience one or more ownership changes as a result of future transactions in our stock, then we may be limited in our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax assets to reduce taxes owed on the net taxable income that we earn. 
 The insurance coverage that we purchase may prove to be inadequate or unavailable when we need the coverage.
We carry liability, property, directors and officers, business interruption, Cyber and other insurance policies to cover insurable risks to our company. We select the types of insurance, the limits and the deductibles based on our specific risk profile, the cost of the insurance coverage versus its perceived benefit and general industry standards. Our insurance policies contain industry standard exclusions for events such as war. Although we generally attempt to select reputable insurance carriers, any economic disruptions may prevent us from using our insurance if the counterparty does not have the capital necessary to meet the coverage. In addition, our agreements with customers also contain obligations to carry comprehensive general liability, property, workers' compensation, and automobile 
 27

liability insurance. Any of the limits of insurance that we purchase could prove to be inadequate, which could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate or challenges by tax authorities could harm our future results. 
 We are subject to income taxes in the United States and various non-U.S. jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the allocation of our pre-tax earnings and losses among countries with differing statutory tax rates, in certain non-deductible expenses as a result of acquisitions, in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or in federal, state, local or non-U.S. tax laws and accounting principles, including increased tax rates, new tax laws or revised interpretations of existing tax laws and precedents. Increases in our effective tax rate would adversely affect our operating results. 
 In addition, we may be subject to income tax audits by various tax jurisdictions throughout the world.The application of tax laws in such jurisdictions may be subject to diverging and sometimes conflicting interpretations by tax authorities in these jurisdictions. Although we believe our income tax liabilities are reasonably estimated and accounted for in accordance with applicable laws and principles, an adverse resolution of one or more uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period. 
 Taxing authorities may successfully assert that we should have collected or in the future should collect additional sales and use taxes, and we could be subject to liability with respect to past or future sales, which could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 We have not historically filed sales and use tax returns or collected sales and use taxes in all jurisdictions in which we have sales, based on our belief that such taxes are not applicable. Taxing authorities may seek to impose such taxes on us, including for past sales, which could result in penalties and interest. Any such tax assessments may adversely affect the results of our operations. 
 
Taxing authorities could reallocate our taxable income among our subsidiaries, which could increase our consolidated tax liability. 
 We conduct integrated operations internationally through subsidiaries in various tax jurisdictions pursuant to transfer pricing arrangements between our subsidiaries and between our subsidiaries and us. If two or more affiliated companies are located in different countries, the tax laws or regulations of each country generally require that transfer prices be the same as those between unrelated companies dealing at arm’s length and that contemporaneous documentation is maintained to support the transfer prices. While we believe that we operate in compliance with applicable transfer pricing laws and intend to continue to do so, our transfer pricing procedures are not binding on applicable tax authorities. If tax authorities in any of these countries were to successfully challenge our transfer prices as not reflecting arms’ length transactions, they could require us to adjust our transfer prices and thereby reallocate our income to reflect these revised transfer prices, which could result in a higher tax liability to us. Such reallocations may subject us to interest and penalties that would increase our consolidated tax liability and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
We may issue additional shares of Common Stock or other equity securities without your approval, which would dilute your ownership interests and may depress the market price of our Common Stock. 
 As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have Warrants outstanding to purchase up to an aggregate of 29,350,000 shares of Common Stock and may issue an aggregate of 2,200,000 shares of Common Stock to certain of our stockholders if the reported closing sale price of our Common Stock equals or exceeds $13.50 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations or other similar actions) for any 20 consecutive trading days during the five-year period following the closing of the Merger. We also have the ability to initially issue up to 7,500,000 shares under the 2019 Incentive Award Plan (the “2019 Plan”), and as of December 31, 2020, we have issued 6,054,772 options and Restricted Stock Units. Additionally, in the event we voluntarily prepay all or a portion of the Debentures prior to maturity, the holders of such prepaid Debentures will have the right to purchase shares of our Common Stock in amount commensurate in value to the pre-payment at a price of $18 per share, subject to adjustment (the “conversion price”). The holders of the Debentures also have the option to convert the Debentures into shares of our Common Stock at the conversion price at any time. The number of shares that may

be issued in such a circumstance cannot be determined at this time. We may issue additional shares of Common Stock or other equity securities of equal or senior rank in the future in connection with, among other things, future acquisitions or repayment of outstanding indebtedness, without stockholder approval, in a number of circumstances. The issuance of additional shares of Common Stock or other equity securities of equal or senior rank would dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders and could cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline.
 Our charter and Delaware law may hinder or prevent a changein control of our company. 
 Certain provisions of our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation could limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of our company. For example, our directors are authorized to issue additional shares of common and preferred stock, only our directors are authorized to call a special meeting of our stockholders, stockholders are subject to advance notice requirements, minimum shareholding periods and ownership thresholds to propose matters for consideration at stockholder meetings, and we have a staggered board of three classes, with each class subject to retirement and re-election once every three years. 
 Future resales of Common Stock may cause the market price of our securities to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well. 
 The Founder, the former officers and directors of Pivotal, and certain of our stockholders were granted certain rights, pursuant to a registration rights agreement, dated as of the Closing Date, entered into in connection with the consummation of the Business Combination among the Company, the stockholders LD Topco, the holders of the founder shares and certain other securityholders of the Company (the “Registration Rights Agreement”), to require us to register, in certain circumstances, the resale under the Securities Act of Common Stock held by them, subject to certain conditions. The sale or possibility of sale of these shares could have the effect of increasing the volatility in our share price or putting significant downward pressure on the price of our stock.
 An active, liquid and orderly trading market for our Common Stock may not develop or be maintained, and our stock price may be volatile, which could result in securities litigation. 
 Our Common Stock currently trades in over-the-counter markets and is quoted on the OTC Pink Sheet Market under the ticker symbol “KLDI” and an active, liquid and orderly trading market for our Common Stock may not develop or be maintained. The market price of our Common Stock could fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. 
 
The following factors, among others, could affect our stock price: 
 
 
• | our operating and financial performance, including reserve estimates;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | quarterly variations in the rate of growth of our financial indicators, such as net income per share, net income and revenues;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the public reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the SEC;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | strategic actions, including acquisitions, or investments by us or our competitors;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | changes in revenue or earnings estimates,
--+------------------------------------------


• | speculation in the press or investment community;
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | sales of our Common Stock by us, our directors or officers or stockholders or the perception that such sales may occur; •
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | changes in accounting principles, policies, guidance, interpretations or standards;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | changes in key management personnel;
--+-------------------------------------


• | actions by our stockholders;
--+-----------------------------


• | general market conditions, including fluctuations in commodity prices;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 29

 
• | domestic and international economic, legal and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the realization of any risks described under this “Risk Factors” section or described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility often unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our Common Stock. Securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company’s securities. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs, divert our management’s attention and resources and harm our business, operating results, financial condition and reputation. 
 
The trading price of our common stock may decline if our stockholders sell a large number of shares of our common stock or if we issue a large number of new shares of our common stock or shares convertible into our common stock.
 A majority of our outstanding shares of common stock are held by a relatively small number of our stockholders. A sale of a substantial number of our shares in the public market by our significant stockholders or pursuant to new issuances by us could depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. 
 
In addition, the Business Combination resulted in our merging with a special purpose acquisition company (“SPAC”), which can cause additional volatility in the price of our Common Stock. We expect that the price of our Common Stock and of that of SPACs in general may be more volatile compared to the stock price of an operating company.
 Rule 144 of the Securities Act provides a safe harbor under which affiliates of an issuer may resell their securities into the public market. Any further sales by these stockholders or further issuances of common stock could have material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. In addition, new issuances of common stock or shares convertible into common stock by us would dilute the equity interests and voting power of our existing stockholders.
 Concentration of ownership among our large stockholders and their affiliates may limit the influence of smaller stockholders on corporate decisions and the interests of such large stockholders may not align with those of the smaller stockholders.
 
A majority of our outstanding shares are held by a relatively small number of our stockholders. As a result, if some of these stockholders vote in an aligned manner, they could meaningfully influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or sale of our company or its assets. This concentration of ownership could limit the ability of other stockholders to influence corporate matters and may delay or preclude an acquisition or cause the market price of our stock to decline. Some of these persons or entities may have interests that may materially differ from the rest of our stockholders.
