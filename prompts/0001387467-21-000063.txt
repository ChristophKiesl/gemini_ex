Overview    
We are a designer, developer and global supplier of a broad portfolio of power semiconductors. Our portfolio of power semiconductors includes approximately 2,400 products, and has grown significantly with the introduction of over 160 new products in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, and over 160 and 200 new products in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our teams of scientists and engineers have developed extensive intellectual properties and technical knowledge that encompass major aspects of power semiconductors, which we believe enables us to introduce and develop innovative products to address the increasingly complex power requirements of advanced electronics. We have an extensive patent portfolio that consists of 863 patents and 58 patent applications in the United States as of June 30, 2021. We also have a total of 898 foreign patents, which primarily were based on our research and development efforts through June 30, 2021. We differentiate ourselves by integrating our expertise in technology, design, and advanced packaging to optimize product performance and cost. Our portfolio of products targets high-volume applications, including portable computers, graphics cards, flat panel TVs, home appliances, smart phones, battery packs, consumer and industrial motor controls and power supplies for TVs, computers, servers and telecommunications equipment.
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, we continued our diversification strategy by developing new silicon and packaging platforms to expand our serviceable available market, or SAM and offer higher performance products. Our metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors, or MOSFET, portfolio expanded significantly across a full range of voltage applications. We also developed new technologies and products designed to penetrate into markets beyond our MOSFET computing base, including the consumer, communications and industrial markets, Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors, or IGBTs for the home appliance market, as well as power ICs for the next generation computing applications. 
Our business model leverages global resources, including research and development and manufacturing in the United States and Asia. Our sales and technical support teams are localized in several growing markets. We operate an 8-inch wafer fabrication facility located in Hillsboro, Oregon (the "Oregon fab"), which is critical for us to accelerate proprietary technology development, new product introduction and improve our financial performance. To meet the market demand for the more mature high volume products, we also utilize the wafer manufacturing capacity of selected third party foundries. For assembly and test, we primarily rely upon our in-house facilities in China. In addition, we utilize subcontracting partners for industry standard packages. We believe our in-house packaging and testing capability provides us with a competitive advantage in proprietary packaging technology, product quality, costs and sales cycle time.
On March 29, 2016, we entered into a joint venture contract (the “JV Agreement”) with two investment funds affiliated with the municipalities of Chongqing (the “Chongqing Funds”), pursuant to which we and Chongqing Funds formed a joint venture, (the “JV Company”), for the purpose of constructing a power semiconductor assembly and test facility and a 12-inch wafer fabrication facility in the Liangjiang New Area of Chongqing, China (the “JV Transaction”). As of June 30, 2021, we own 51%, and the Chongqing Funds own 49%, of the equity interest in the JV Company. During the fiscal year 2021, the 
additional capacity at the JV Company contributed significantly to meeting the increasing demand for our products. The JV Company has reached its targeted production of assembly and testing and is currently ramping up its Phase I of the 12-inch wafer fabrication. While the JV Company is our consolidated subsidiary for purpose of financial reporting, it operates as an independent and separate legal entity. As a result, the JV Company’s assets and liabilities are generally segregated from our company's assets and liabilities. For example, the JV Company incurs debt through its own financing and bank loan agreements, and we are not parties to these agreements and do not provide any guarantee or security for the JV Company’s debt, nor do we have direct access to any cash proceeds borrowed from such loan agreements. 
We were incorporated in Bermuda on September 27, 2000 as an exempted limited liability company. The address of our registered office is Clarendon House, 2 Church Street, Hamilton HM 11, Bermuda. The address of our U.S. office is Alpha and Omega Semiconductor Incorporated, 475 Oakmead Parkway, Sunnyvale, CA 94085. Telephone number of our U.S. office is (408) 830-9742. We have incorporated various wholly-owned subsidiaries in different jurisdictions, and a subsidiary (the JV Company) in which we have a controlling interest. Please refer to Exhibit 21.1 to this Form 10-K for a complete list of our subsidiaries.
Our industry 
Semiconductors are electronic devices that perform a variety of functions, such as converting or controlling signals, processing data and delivering or managing power. With advances in semiconductor technology, the functionality and performance of semiconductors have generally increased over time, while size and cost have generally decreased. These advances have led to a proliferation of more complex semiconductors being used in a wide variety of consumer, computing, communications and industrial markets and have contributed to the growth of the semiconductor industry.
Analog semiconductors
The semiconductor industry is segmented into analog and digital. Analog semiconductors process light, sound, motion, radio waves and electrical currents and voltages. In contrast, digital semiconductors process binary signals represented by a sequence of ones and zeros.
As a result of these fundamental differences, the analog semiconductor industry is distinct from the digital semiconductor industry in terms of the complexity of design and the length of product cycle. Improper interactions between analog circuit elements can potentially render an electronic system inoperable. Experienced engineers engaged in the design process are necessary because computer-aided design cannot fully model the behavior of analog circuitry. Therefore, experienced analog engineers with requisite knowledge are in great demand but short supply worldwide. In addition, analog semiconductors tend to have a longer product life cycle because original design manufacturers, or ODMs and original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs typically design the analog portions of a system to span multiple generations of their products. Once designed into an application, the analog portion is rarely modified because even a slight change to the analog portion can cause unexpected interactions with other components, resulting in system instability.
Power semiconductors
Power semiconductors are a subset of the analog semiconductor sector with their own set of characteristics unique to system power architecture and function. Power semiconductors transfer, manage and switch electricity to deliver the appropriate amount of voltage or current to a broad range of electronic systems and also protect electronic systems from damage resulting from excessive or inadvertent electrical charges.
Power semiconductors can be either discrete devices, which typically comprise only a few transistors or diodes, or ICs, which incorporate a greater number of transistors.  The function of power discrete devices is power delivery by switching, transferring or converting electricity.  Power transistors comprise the largest portion of the power discrete device market. Power ICs, sometimes referred to as power management ICs, perform power delivery and power management functions, such as controlling and regulating voltage and current and controlling power discrete devices.
The growth of the power semiconductor market in recent years has several key drivers. The proliferation of computer and consumer electronics, such as notebooks, tablets, smart phones, flat panel displays and portable media players created the need for sophisticated power management to improve power efficiency and extend battery life. The evolution of these products is characterized by increased functionality, thinner or smaller form factors and decreasing prices. Our Power IC and low voltage (5V-40V) MOSFET products address this market. In the area of AC-DC power supplies for electronic equipment, data centers and servers, the market is characterized by a continuous demand for energy conservation through higher efficiency, which is driving the need for our medium voltage (40V-400V) and high voltage (500V-1000V) MOSFET products. The increased 
application of power semiconductors to control motors in white goods and industrial applications, is driving demand for Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors, or IGBTs. IGBTs are also being used in renewable energy and automotive applications.
The evolution toward smaller form factors and complex power requirements in the low voltage areas has driven further integration in power semiconductors, resulting in power ICs that incorporate the functionalities of both power management and power delivery in a single device. Power ICs can be implemented by incorporating all necessary power functions either on one piece of silicon or multiple silicon chips encapsulated into a single device. Additionally, the advancement in semiconductor packaging technology enables increased power density and shrinking form factors.
Power semiconductor suppliers develop and manufacture their products using various approaches which tend to fall across a wide spectrum of balancing cost savings with proprietary technology advantages. At one end of the spectrum are integrated design manufacturers, or IDMs, which own and operate the equipment used in the manufacturing process and design and manufacture products at their in-house facilities. IDMs exercise full control over the implementation of process technologies and have maximum flexibility in setting priorities for their production and delivery schedules. At the other end of the spectrum are completely-outsourced fabless semiconductor companies, which rely entirely on off-the-shelf technologies and processes provided by their manufacturing partners. These companies seek to reduce or eliminate fixed costs by outsourcing both product manufacturing and development of process technologies to third parties. Our model seeks to achieve the best balance between technological advancement and cost effectiveness by using a dedicated in-house technology research and development team to drive rapid new product developments, while utilizing both in-house and third-party foundry capacity for our products. This is particularly important in the development of power semiconductor products due to the unique nature of their technology. While digital technologies are highly standardized in leading foundries, power semiconductor technologies tend to be more unique as they seek to accommodate a wider range of voltage applications. Accordingly, third-party foundries, which are primarily designed and established for digital technologies, may have limited capabilities when it comes to the development of new power semiconductor technologies.
Our strategies 
Our strategy is to advance our position as a leading designer, developer and global supplier of a broad portfolio of power semiconductors. To accomplish this, we have adopted a strategy that allows us to accelerate the development of our proprietary technology at our in-house fabrication facilities, bring new products to market faster, and improve our financial performance in the long run. This model also provides quicker response to our customer demands, enhances relationships with strategic customers, and provides flexibility in capacity management and geographic diversification of our wafer supply chain. Our in-house manufacturing capability allows us to retain a higher level of control over the development and application of our proprietary process technology, thereby reducing certain operational risks and costs associated with utilizing third-party foundries. We recently commenced a plan to enhance the manufacturing capability and capacity of our Oregon fab by investing in new equipment and expanding our factory facilities, which we expect will have a positive impact on our future new product development and revenue, particularly during the period of global shortage of capacity.
Although our largest end-market is the personal computing ("PC") market, we have successfully diversified our business by expanding into other markets, including the consumer, communications, power supply and industrial markets. While we have made progress in our diversification and expansion into additional applications, we continue to support and grow our PC business by expanding bill-of-material content, gaining market share, and acquiring new customers.
We plan to further expand the breadth of our product portfolio to increase our total bill-of-materials within an electronic system and to address the power requirements of additional electronic systems. Our product portfolio currently consists of approximately 2,400 products and we have introduced over 160 new products in this past fiscal year. We will continue to leverage our expertise to further increase our product lines, including higher performance power ICs, IGBTs and high, medium and low voltage MOSFETs, in order to broaden our addressable market and improve our margin profile. We are also in the process of developing a digital power controller and smart power stage product lines based on the technology that we licensed from STMicro. We believe that our increased product offerings will allow us to penetrate new end-market applications and provide us with an important competitive advantage. OEMs and ODMs generally prefer to limit their supplier base to a smaller set of vendors capable of providing a comprehensive menu of products across multiple electronic platforms.
Leverage our power semiconductor expertise to drive new technology platforms
We believe that the ever-increasing demand for power efficiency in power semiconductors requires expertise in and a deep understanding of the interrelationship among device physics, process technologies, design and packaging. We also believe that engineers with experience and understanding of these multiple disciplines are in great demand but short supply. Within this context, we believe that we are well positioned to be a leader in providing total power management solutions 
because of our extensive pool of experienced scientists and engineers and our strong IP portfolio. Accordingly, we intend to leverage our expertise to increase the number of power discrete technology platforms and power IC designs, including future digital power controller products that are currently under development, to expand our product offerings and deliver complete power solutions for our targeted applications. In addition, our ability to develop new technology is enhanced by the operation of our own manufacturing facilities in Oregon and Chongqing.
Increase direct relationships and product penetration with OEM and ODM customers
We have developed direct relationships with key OEMs who are responsible for branding, designing and marketing a broad array of electronic products, as well as ODMs who have traditionally been responsible for manufacturing these products. While OEMs typically focus their design efforts on their flagship products, as the industry has evolved, ODMs are increasingly responsible for designing portions, or entire systems, of the products they manufacture for the OEMs. In addition, several ODMs are beginning to design, manufacture and brand their own proprietary products which they sell directly to consumers. We intend to strengthen our existing relationships and form new ones with both OEMs and ODMs by aligning our product development efforts with their product requirements, increasing the number of our products used within their systems, and leveraging our relationships to penetrate their other products. In addition, we are refocusing our research and development efforts to respond more directly to market demand by designing and developing new products based on feedback from our customers, which also allows us to reduce time-to-market and sales cycles.
Leverage global business model for cost-effective growth
We intend to continue to leverage our global resources and regional strengths. We will continue to deploy marketing, sales and technical support teams in close proximity to our end customers. We plan to further expand and align our technical marketing and application support teams along with our sales team to better understand and address the needs of our end customers and their end-market applications, in particular for those with the new technology platforms developed in this past year and in the future. This will assist us in identifying and defining new technology trends and products and to help us gain additional design wins. In addition, we have made significant progress in the past fiscal year towards the completion of the manufacturing facilities and commencement of production at the JV Company. We expect the JV Company will, in the long term, reduce the cost of manufacturing our products and accelerate the development of new products, while allowing us to gain valuable access to new customers in China.
Our products    
To serve the large and diverse analog market for power semiconductors, we have created a broad product portfolio consisting of two major categories: power discretes and power ICs. 
Our power discretes products consist primarily of low, medium and high voltage power MOSFETs. Our low voltage MOSFET series is based on our proprietary silicon and package technologies, with deep application know-how in various markets. We have precisely defined technology platforms to address different requirements from various applications. Our medium voltage MOSFETs provide optimized performance with high efficiency, high robustness and high reliability, and are widely used in applications such as TV backlighting, telecom power supplies, and industrial applications. We expanded our high voltage 600V and 700V MOSFET portfolio based on our aMOS5 technology platform to address robust consumer and industrial applications. Our high-voltage portfolio includes our proprietary insulated-gate bipolar transistor ("IGBT") technology, which we provide highly robust and easy-to-use solutions for industrial motor control and white goods applications. We have also released our first 1200V SiC (Silicon carbide) product based on our new AlphaSiC platform, designed to address high efficiency, high density industrial applications such as solar inverters, UPS, and battery management systems.
Our power ICs deliver power as well as control and regulate the power management variables, such as the flow of current and level of voltage. Our DrMOS family of products continued to grow as we paired our latest high performance MOSFET silicon with our latest Driver IC technologies. We continued to expand our EZBuck power IC family with products that feature lower on-resistance, less power consumption, smaller footprint and thermally enhanced packages. While we derive the majority of our revenue from the sales of power discretes products, sales of power ICs continued to gain traction during the past years. Our Type C smart load switch product line has also expanded as it offers reverse blocking capability, designed to protect applications against high voltage exposure.
The following table lists our product families and the principal end uses of our products:
 
Product Family | Description | Product Categorieswithin Product Type | Typical Application 
Power Discretes | Low on-resistance switch used for routing current and switching voltages in power control circuitsHigh power switches used for power circuits | DC-DC for CPU/GPUDC-AC conversionAC-DC conversionLoad switchingMotor controlBattery protectionPower factor correction | Smart phone chargers, battery packs, notebooks, desktop and servers, data centers, base stations, graphics card, game boxes, TVs, AC adapters, power supplies, motor control, power tools, E-vehicles, white goods and industrial motor drives, UPS systems, solar inverters and industrial welding 
Power ICs | Integrated devices used for power management and power delivery | DC-DC Buck conversionDC-DC Boost conversionSmart load switching DrMOS power stage | Flat panel displays, TVs, Notebooks, graphic cards, servers, DVD/Blu-Ray players, set-top boxes, and networking equipment 
 | Analog power devices used for circuit protection and signal switching | Transient voltage protectionAnalog switchElectromagnetic interference filter | Notebooks, desktop PCs, tablets, flat panel displays, TVs, smart phones, and portable electronic devices 

Power discrete products
Power discretes are used across a wide voltage and current spectrum, requiring them to operate efficiently and reliably under harsh conditions. Due to this wide applicability across diverse end-market applications, we market general purpose MOSFETs that are used in multiple applications as well as MOSFETs targeted for specific applications.
Our current power discrete product line includes industry standard trench MOSFETs, SRFETs, XSFET, electrostatic discharge, protected MOSFETs, high and mid-voltage MOSFETs and IGBTs.
Power IC products
In addition to the traditional monolithic or single chip design, we employ a multi-chip approach for the majority of our power ICs. This multi-chip technique leverages our proprietary MOSFET and advanced packaging technologies to offer integrated solutions to our customers. This allows us to update product portfolios by interchanging only the MOSFETs without changing the power management IC, thereby reducing the time required for new product introduction and providing optimal solutions to our customers. We believe that our power IC products improve our competitive position by enabling us to provide higher power density solutions to our end customers than some of our competitors.
The incorporation of both power delivery and power management functions tends to make power ICs more application specific because these two functions have to be properly matched to a particular end product. We have local technical marketing and applications engineers who closely collaborate with our end customers to help ensure that power IC specifications are properly defined at the beginning of the design stage.
New Product Introduction
We introduced several new products based on our proprietary technology platform and continue to expand our product families. 
During the fourth quarter of fiscal year of 2021, we introduced a series of single-channel Transient Voltage Suppressor (TVS) for high-speed line protection using the best-in-class low capacitance TVS platform. The new products are well suited for Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) protection of Type-C connectors in mobiles, laptops, televisions, and other electronic devices. We also announced a new series of Smart Power Stages (SPS) targeting multiphase VR regulators powering high-performance GPU and CPU in desktop Add-In Graphics Cards (AICs), gaming laptops, servers, data storage, artificial intelligence, and networking equipment.

We introduced a new family of application-specific EZBuck™ regulators. The AOZ2264VQI and AOZ2369VQI are offered in a QFN 4 x 4 and QFN 5 x 5 package, respectively, and offer the industry’s most compact footprint to support VCCIN_AUX rails in Intel Tiger Lake platforms used in notebook and desktop computing systems. Moreover, we announced a new Type-C Power Delivery (PD) high voltage source protection switch capable up to 28V absolute maximum voltage. The AOZ1374 is a smart protection switch in a small thermally enhanced 3mm x 3mm DFN package. AOS’s prowess in high-performance ICs combined with AOS’s state of the art high SOA MOSFETs using advanced co-packaging techniques. AOZ1374 supports a slew of protection features, including true reverse blocking in a small solution footprint with an industry-leading on-resistance of 36mOhm. 
During the second quarter of fiscal year of 2021, we released AOTL66518 and AOB66518L, a 150V MOSFET with low on-resistance and a high Safe Operating Area (SOA) capability designed for demanding applications in Telcom Hot Swap. Also, we announced the release of a Fast Switching 600V αMOS5™ Super Junction MOSFETs in SMD-type TOLL Package. αMOS5 is AOS’s latest generation of high voltage MOSFET, designed to meet the high efficiency and high-density needs for Quick Charger, Adapter, PC Power, Server, Industrial Power, Telecom, and Hyperscale Datacenter applications. 
During the first quarter of fiscal year of 2021, we introduced a series of Transient Voltage Suppressors for high-speed line protection using the best-in-class low capacitance TVS platform. The new products are well suited for Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) protection for laptops, televisions, and other electronic devices. In addition, we announced a new series of DrMOS targeting multiphase VR regulators powering high-performance GPU and memory in desktop Add-In Graphics Cards (AICs) and gaming notebooks. The AOZ531xQI series uses AOS latest generation of Gen Alpha MOSFET technology to provide benchmark performance in a 5mm x 5mm QFN package. The series comprises of three DC current levels for multiphase voltage regulator optimization. Also, we announced the release of, AONS32310, a 30V MOSFET with low on-resistance and a high Safe Operating Area (SOA) capability which is ideally suited for demanding applications such as hot swap and effuse. Moreover, we announced the release of RigidCSP™ for battery management. The new package technology is ideal for applications such as smartphones, tablets, and ultra-thin notebooks. 

Distributors and customers 
We have established direct relationships with key OEMs, including Dell Inc., Hewlett-Packard Company, LG Electronics, Inc. and Samsung Group, most of whom we serve through our distributors and ODMs. In addition, based on our historical design win activities, our power semiconductors are also incorporated into products sold to many other leading OEMs. 
Through our distributors, we provide products to ODMs who traditionally are contract manufacturers for OEMs. As the industry has evolved, ODMs are increasingly responsible for designing portions, or entire systems, of the products they manufacture for the OEMs. In addition, several ODMs are beginning to design, manufacture and brand their own proprietary products, which they sell directly to consumers. Our ODM customers include Compal Electronics, Inc., Foxconn, Quanta Computer Incorporated, Pegatron, Wistron Corporation and AOC International. 
In order to take advantage of the expertise of end-customer fulfillment logistics and shorter payment cycles, we sell most of our products through distributors. In general, under our agreements with distributors, they have limited rights to return unsold merchandise, subject to time and volume limitations. As of June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, our two largest distributors were WPG Holdings Limited, or WPG, and Promate Electronic Co. Ltd., or Promate. Sales to WPG and Promate accounted for 35.4% and 28.7% of our revenue, respectively, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, 35.5% and 29.3% of our revenue, respectively, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, and 36.4% and 28.8% of our revenue, respectively, for fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, respectively.
Sales and marketing    
Our marketing division is responsible for identifying high growth markets and applications where we believe our technology can be effectively deployed. We believe that the technical background of our marketing team, including application engineers, helps us better define new products and identify potential end customers and geographic and product market opportunities. For example, as part of our market diversification strategy, we have deployed and plan to recruit more, field application engineers, or FAEs, for our new product offerings, who provide real-time and local response to our end customers' needs. FAEs work with our end customers to understand their requirements and resolve technical problems. FAEs also strive 
to anticipate future customer needs and facilitate the design-in of our products into the end products of our customers. We believe this strategy increases our share of revenue opportunities within the applications we currently serve, as well as in new end-market applications.
Our sales team consists of sales personnel, field application engineers, customer service representatives and customer quality engineers who are responsible for key accounts. We strategically position our team near our end customers through our offices in Taipei, Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Shanghai, Qingdao, Tokyo, Seoul, Heilbronn, and Sunnyvale, California, complemented by our applications centers in Sunnyvale and Shanghai. In addition, our distributors and sales representatives assist us in our sales and marketing efforts by identifying potential customers, creating additional demand and promoting our products, in which case we may pay a sales commission.
Our sales cycle varies depending on the types of products and can range from six to eighteen months.  In general, our traditional power discrete products in PC and TV applications progress more rapidly through the customer's design and marketing processes, and therefore they generally have a shorter sales cycle.  In contrast, our newer Power IC and IGBT products, used mostly in the power supply, home appliance and industrial applications, require a more extended design and marketing timeline and thus have a longer sales cycle.  Typically, our sales cycle for all products comprises of the following steps:
•identification of a customer design opportunity;
•qualification of the design opportunity by our FAEs through comparison of the power requirements against our product portfolio;
•provision of a product sample to the end customer to be included in the customer's pre-production model with the goal of being included in the final bill of materials; and
•placement by the customer, or through its distributor, of a full production order as the end customer increases to full volume production.
Competition
The power semiconductor industry is characterized by fragmentation with many competitors. We compete with different power semiconductor suppliers, depending on the type of product lines and geographical area. Our key competitors in power discretes and power ICs are primarily headquartered in the United States, Japan, Europe, China and Taiwan. Our major competitors in power discretes include Infineon Technologies AG, MagnaChip Semiconductor Corporation, ON Semiconductor Corp., STMicroelectronics N.V., Toshiba Corporation, Diodes Incorporated and Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. Our major competitors for our power ICs include Global Mixed-mode Technology Inc., Monolithic Power Systems, Inc., ON Semiconductor Corp., Richtek Technology Corp., Semtech Corporation, Texas Instruments Inc. and Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.
Our ability to compete depends on a number of factors, including:
•our success in expanding and diversifying our serviceable markets, and our ability to develop technologies and product solutions for these markets;
•our capability to quickly develop and introduce proprietary technology and best-in-class products;
•the performance and cost-effectiveness of our products relative to that of our competitors;
•our ability and capacity to manufacture, package and deliver products in large volume on a timely basis at a competitive price;
•our success in utilizing new and proprietary technologies to offer products and features previously not available in the marketplace;
•our ability to recruit and retain analog semiconductor designers and application engineers; and
•our ability to protect our intellectual property.
Some of our competitors have longer operating histories, more brand recognition, and significantly greater financial, technical, research and development, sales and marketing, manufacturing and other resources. However, we believe that we can compete effectively through our integrated and innovative technology platform and design capabilities, including our strong 
and extensive patent portfolio, strategic global business model, expanding suites of new products, diversified and broad customer base, and excellent on-the-ground support and quick time to market for our products.
 Seasonality    
As we provide power semiconductors used in consumer electronic products, our business is subject to seasonality. Our sales seasonality is affected by a number of factors, including global and regional economic conditions as well as the PC market conditions, revenue generated from new products, changes in distributor ordering patterns in response to channel inventory adjustments and end customer demand for our products and fluctuations in consumer purchase patterns prior to major holiday seasons. Our normal seasonality has been affected significantly by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in changes in consumer behavior and industry trends. Given the uncertainty of the global economic conditions resulting from the pandemic, it is difficult for us to predict to what extent our sales seasonality may change in the future. 
Backlog        
Our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders from distributors and direct customers. The amount of backlog to be shipped during any period depends on various factors, and all orders are subject to cancellation or modification, usually with no penalty to customers. The quantities actually purchased by customers, as well as shipment schedules, are frequently revised to reflect changes in both the customers' requirements and in manufacturing availability. Therefore, our backlog at any point in time is not a reliable indicator of our future revenue. 
Research and development    
Because we view technology as a competitive advantage, we invest significant time and capital in research and development to address the technology intensive needs of our end customers. Our research and development expenditures for the fiscal years of 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $63.0 million, $51.3 million and $46.4 million, respectively. Our research and development expenditures primarily consist of salaries, bonuses, benefits, share-based compensation expense, expenses associated with new product prototypes, travel expenses, fees for engineering services provided by outside contractors and consultants, amortization of software and design tools, depreciation of equipment and overhead costs. We continue to invest in developing new technologies and products utilizing our own fabrication and packaging facilities as it is critical to our long-term success. We also evaluate appropriate investment levels and stay focused on new product introductions to improve our competitiveness. We have research and development teams in Silicon Valley (Sunnyvale, California), Oregon, Taipei, Taiwan, and China. We believe that these diverse research and development teams enable us to develop leading edge technology platforms and new products. Our areas of research and development focus include:
Packaging technologies: Consumer demand for smaller and more compact electronic devices with higher power density is driving the need for advanced packaging technology. Our group of dedicated packaging engineers focuses on smaller form factors, and higher power output with efficient heat dissipation and cost-effectiveness. We have invested resources to develop and enhance our proprietary packaging technologies, including the establishment of our in-house packaging and testing facilities. We believe that our efforts to develop innovative packaging technologies will continue to provide new and cost-effective solutions with higher power density to our customers. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, we continued our diversification strategies by developing new silicon and packaging platforms to expand our SAM and offer higher performance products.
Process technology and device physics: We focus on specialized process technology in the manufacturing of our products, including vertical DMOS, Shielded Gate Trench, Trench field stop IGBTs, charge-balance high voltage MOSFETs, Schottky Diode and BCDMOS processes. Our process engineers work closely with our design team to deploy and implement our proprietary manufacturing processes at our Oregon fab, and more recently, at the 12 inch fab at the JV Company as well as the third-party foundries that fabricate our wafers. To improve our process technology, we continue to develop and enhance our expertise in device physics in order to better understand the physical characteristics of materials and the interactions among these materials during the manufacturing process.
New products and new technology platforms: We also invest significantly in the development of new technology platforms and introduction of new products. Because power management affects all electronic systems, we believe that developing a wide portfolio of products enables us to target new applications in addition to expanding our share of power management needs served within existing applications. 
 As a technology company, we will continue our significant investment in research and development in our low voltage, medium voltage, and high voltage power discretes, IGBT and power modules and power ICs by developing new technology platforms and new products that allow for better product performance, more efficient packages and higher levels of integration.
Operations    
The manufacture of our products is divided into two major steps: wafer fabrication and packaging and testing. 
Wafer fabrication

Our Oregon fab allows us to accelerate the development of our technology and products, as well as to provide better service to our customers. We allocate our wafer production between our in-house facility and third-party foundries, although in the past three years, we have gradually reduced our reliance on third-party foundries and increased allocation of capacity to our Oregon fab and at our JV Company. Currently our main third-party foundry is Shanghai Hua Hong Grace Electronic Company Limited, ("HHGrace"), or formerly HHNEC, located in Shanghai. HHGrace has been manufacturing wafers for us since 2002. HHGrace manufactured 11.5%, 12.7% and 14.1% of the wafers used in our products for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 
On March 29, 2016, we entered into the JV agreement with two investment funds affiliated with the municipalities of Chongqing for the purpose of constructing a power semiconductor packaging, testing and 12-inch wafer fabrication facility in the Liangjiang New Area of Chongqing. During the fiscal year 2021, the additional capacity at the JV Company contributed significantly to meeting the increasing demand for our products. The JV Company has reached its targeted production of assembly and testing. We believe the JV Company will increase and diversify our customer base, particularly in China, and accelerate the development of proprietary process technology.
Packaging and testing
Completed wafers from the foundries are sent to our in-house packaging and testing facilities or to our subcontractors, where the wafers are cut into individual die, soldered to lead frames, wired to terminals and then encapsulated in protective packaging. After packaging, all devices are tested in accordance with our specifications and substandard or defective devices are rejected. We have established quality assurance procedures that are intended to control quality throughout the manufacturing process, including qualifying new parts for production at each packaging facility, conducting root cause analysis, testing for lots with process defects and implementing containment and preventive actions. The final tested products are then shipped to our distributors or customers.
Our in-house and wholly-owned packaging and testing facilities are located in Shanghai, China which handle most of our packaging and testing requirements for our products. In addition, the JV Company handles a portion of our packaging and testing requirement. We continuously increase the outsourcing portion of our packaging and testing requirements to other contract manufacturers to improve our ability to respond to changes in market demand. Our facilities have the combined capacity to package and test over 600 million parts per month and have available floor space for new package introductions. We believe our ability to package and test our products internally represents a strategic advantage as it protects our proprietary packaging technology, increases the rate of new package introductions, reduces operating expenses and ultimately improves our profit margins.
Quality assurance    
Our quality assurance practices aim to consistently provide our end customers with products that are reliable, durable and free of defects. We strive to do so through design for manufacturing, and continuous improvement in our product design and manufacturing and close collaboration with our manufacturing partners. Our manufacturing operations in China and our manufacturing facility in Oregon are certified to the ISO9001 and IATF16949:2016. These Quality Management System certifications are in recognition of our quality assurance standards. Both ISO9001 and IATF16949:2016 are sets of criteria and procedures established by International Organization of Standardization for developing a fundamental quality management system and focusing on continuous improvement, defect prevention and the reduction of variation and waste. Our products are also in compliance with Restrictions on the use of Hazardous Substances, or RoHS 3.0.
We maintain a supplier management and process engineering team in Shanghai that works with our third-party foundries and packaging and testing subcontractors to monitor the quality of our products, which is designed to ensure that manufacturing of our products is in strict compliance with our process controls, monitoring procedures and product requirements. We also conduct periodic reviews and annual audits to ensure supplier performance. For example, we examine the results of statistical process control systems, implement preventive maintenance, verify the status of quality improvement projects and review delivery time metrics. In addition, we rate and rank each of our suppliers every quarter based on factors such as their quality and performance. Our facility in Oregon integrates manufacturing process controls through our manufacturing execution system, coupled with wafer process controls that include monitoring procedures, preventative maintenance, statistical process control, and testing to ensure that finished wafers delivered will meet and exceed quality and reliability requirements. All materials used to manufacture wafers are controlled through a strict qualification process.
Our manufacturing processes use many raw materials, including silicon wafers, gold, copper, molding compound, petroleum and plastic materials and various chemicals and gases. We obtain our raw materials and supplies from a large number of sources. Although supplies for raw materials used by us are currently adequate, shortages could occur in various essential materials due to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry.
Intellectual property rights 
Intellectual property is a critical component of our business strategy, and we intend to continue to invest in the growth, maintenance and protection of our intellectual property portfolio. We own significant intellectual property in many aspects of power semiconductor technology, including device physics and structure, wafer processes, circuit designs, packaging, modules and subassemblies. We have also entered into intellectual property licensing agreements with other companies, including On Semiconductor Corp. and Giant Semiconductor Corporation, to use selected third-party technology for the development of our products, although we do not believe our business is dependent to any significant degree on any individual third-party license agreement. We have a license agreement with STMicroelectronics International N.V. (“STMicro”), pursuant to which STMicro granted us a world-wide, royalty-free and fully-paid license to use its technologies to develop, market and distribute certain digital multi-phase controller products, which have been offered previously by STMicro. This license agreement allows us to develop a new digital power business that will design and offer a full suite of advance digital power controller products.  
While we focus our patent efforts in the United States, we file corresponding foreign patent applications in other jurisdictions, such as China and Taiwan, when filing is justified by cost and strategic importance. The patents are increasingly important to remain competitive in our industry, and a strong patent portfolio will facilitate the entry of our products into new markets. As of June 30, 2021, we had 863 patents issued in the United States, of which 856 were based on our research and development efforts and 7 were acquired, and these patents are set to expire between 2022 and 2040. We also had a total of 898 foreign patents, including 421 Chinese patents, 438 Taiwanese patents, 21 Korean patents, 4 Hong Kong patents, 4 Philippine patents, 8 Japanese patents, 1 Europe patent and 1 India patent as of June 30, 2021. Substantially all of our foreign patents were based on our research and development efforts. These foreign patents will expire in the years between 2023 and 2039. In addition, as of June 30, 2021, we had a total of 205 patent applications, of which 58 patents were pending in the United States, 82 patents were pending in China, 44 patents were pending in Taiwan and 21 patents were pending in other countries. 
As our technologies are deployed in new applications and as we diversify our product portfolio based on new technology platforms, we may be subject to new potential infringement claims. Patent litigation, if and when instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management's attention and resources. However, we are committed to vigorously defending and protecting our investment in our intellectual property. Therefore, the strength of our intellectual property program, including the breadth and depth of our portfolio, will be critical to our success in the new markets we intend to pursue.
In addition to patent protection, we also rely on a combination of trademark, copyright (including mask work protection), trade secret laws, contractual provisions and similar laws in other jurisdictions. We also enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, suppliers, distributors and customers and seek to control access to, and distribution of, our proprietary information.
Human Capital Resources 
As of June 30, 2021, we had 3,939 employees, of whom 656 were located in the United States, 3,145 were located in China, and 138 were located in other parts of the world. None of our employees is represented by a collective bargaining agreement. Notwithstanding our global footprint and various geographical locations, we have created an integrated workforce where employees worldwide work and collaborate as a team to advance our common business objectives, while retaining local and regional practices and cultures. 
We are committed to provide a working environment in which our employees can realize fully their talents and develop successful careers. As our strength is in our people, we invest significantly in our employees by providing a wide range of training and development opportunities, including mentoring, coaching, attendance at external seminars and professional conferences, and regular in-house training sessions on specific topics. We train our managers to become good stewards for our employees, balancing the need of quality of life and performance results. We believe that these efforts contributed to the growth of our employee, as more than 50% of our managerial positions are promotions of existing employees within our companies. 
We also keep our employees engaged and informed by providing periodic all staff communications, and semi-annual performance reviews to ensure that efforts and results are aligned with our business and strategic corporate objectives. We value feedback from our employees and have an open door policy in our engagement with employees, and we encourage 
employees to have regular conversations with their managers to share feedback and express concerns. We also solicit employee feedback informally through regular employee interactions. In addition, we conduct employee satisfaction surveys at certain locations to help management identify areas that may require improvement. As part of AOS tradition, we also organize social events, including annual appreciation picnics, when possible given Covid-19 conditions, and holiday parties, inviting both employees and their families to join. We believe these efforts enable us to build a strong and solid group of loyal employees who form the core of our human capital resource.
We are committed to provide an environment where employees from all walks of life are treated with respect, care and dignity. To recruit new talent, we reach out to a broad range of sources, including employee referrals, on-line advertising, recruitment agencies, and other social medias to seek out the best qualified candidates regardless of their backgrounds. We are also focused on ensuring a diverse workforce, including our management team. Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee leads the effort in recruiting qualified directors to serve on our Board, and we are in compliance with California’s gender diversity laws, as well as recent laws requiring a minimum number of directors from underrepresented communities. Our employees appreciate and value the strength of our people oriented culture and the benefits the workplace diversity brings.
We offer competitive compensation and benefits packages for our employees that include a combination of base salary, annual bonus, discretionary bonus for outstanding achievements, employee share purchase plan, time-based and performance based long term equity compensation. Our equity related compensation programs are designed to motivate and incentivize our employees and align their rewards to financial and other business performance goals, while increasing our shareholder value. We adhere strictly to the Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and other policies, and ensure that our employment practices respect human rights and comply with national, state and local regulatory requirements at all locations where we conduct business. In addition, we have engaged nationally, recognized outside compensation consulting firms to independently evaluate the appropriateness and effectiveness of compensation for our executives and other officers and to provide benchmarks for executive compensation as compared to peer companies.
The health and safety of our employees are paramount to our companies. At each of our major locations, we have formed site safety committees that conduct regular meetings to assess and improve effectiveness of our safety policies and guidelines, to monitor safety incidents and to oversee the implementation of corrective actions. During the pandemic in 2020 and 2021, our COVID-19 prevention committees at factory sites in China took swift and decisive actions to prevent work-place contagion and to ensure the health and safety of our employees. These actions included providing employees with Personal Protective Equipment ("PPE"), strict visitor controls, frequent sanitization of shuttle buses, temperature checking prior to boarding the shuttles, and temperature checking at the factory entrances, and regular self-audits. As a result of these plans, we had zero COVID-19 cases at our facilities in China. At our U.S. facilities, the COVID-19 prevention committees met regularly to update and enhance prevention measures in accordance to federal, state and county health orders, which allowed us to continue our operations without significant disruptions. In addition, to support remote-working arrangements, we provided office workers with technology resources and in some cases a monthly stipend to set up home offices. To protect our employees and their families against COVID-19 virus, we also implemented and sponsored bi-weekly on-site COVID-19 testing since January 2021 for essential employees who were authorized to work in our Sunnyvale lab facilities.
Environmental matters    
The semiconductor production process, including the semiconductor wafer manufacturing and packaging process, generates air emissions, liquid wastes, waste water and other industrial wastes. We have installed various types of pollution control equipment for the treatment of air emissions and liquid waste and equipment for recycling and treatment of water in our packaging and testing facilities in China and wafer manufacturing facility in Oregon, USA. Waste generated at our manufacturing facilities, including but not limited to acid waste, alkaline waste, flammable waste, toxic waste, oxide waste and self-igniting waste, is collected and sorted for proper disposal. Our operations in China are subject to regulation and periodic monitoring by China's State Environmental Protection Bureau, as well as local environmental protection authorities, including those under the Shanghai Municipal Government, which may in some cases establish stricter standards than those imposed by the State Environmental Protection Bureau. Our operation in Oregon is subject to Oregon Department of Environmental Regulations, Federal Environmental Protection Agency laws and regulations, and local jurisdictional regulations. We believe that we have been in material compliance with applicable environmental regulations and standards and have not had a material or adverse effect on our results of operations from complying with these regulations.
We have implemented an ISO 14001 environmental management system in our manufacturing facilities in China and Oregon. We also require our subcontractors, including foundries and assembly houses, to meet ISO14001 standards. We believe that we have adopted pollution control measures for the effective maintenance of environmental protection standards consistent with the requirements applicable to the semiconductor industry in China and the U.S.
Our products sold in worldwide are subject to RoHS in Electrical and Electronic Equipment, which requires that the products do not contain more than agreed levels of lead, cadmium, mercury, hexavalent chromium, polybrominated biphenyl and polybrominated diphenyl ether flame retardants. Our manufacturing facilities in China also obtained QC080000 certification, which is an IECQ Certificate of Conformity Hazardous Substance Process Management for European Directive 
2002/95/EC requirements and a Certificate of Green Partner for Sony Green Partner Program. We avoid using these restricted materials to the extent possible when we design our products.
We are also subject to SEC rules that require diligence, disclosure and reporting on whether certain minerals and metals, known as conflict minerals, used in our products originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. As of June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we were in compliance with the related conflict minerals rule.
Export Control
We are subject to export and import control laws, trade regulations and other trade requirements that limit which products we sell and where and to whom we sell our products. Because we are committed to complying with all applicable export control laws, regulations, and requirements, we have reviewed and revised our processes and procedures to ensure that our shipments to our customers remain compliant with applicable export laws. As part of the enhanced process, we have also conducted extensive risk assessment on export control compliance and implemented training programs for our employees.
