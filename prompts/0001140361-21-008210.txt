ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview

We develop, manufacture and commercialize point-of-care tests for the detection and diagnosis of infectious diseases, including COVID‑19, sexually transmitted disease, and fever and tropical disease.

Our product portfolio is based upon our proprietary DPP technology, a diagnostic platform that provides high-quality, cost-effective results in 15 to 20 minutes using fingertip blood, nasal swabs and other sample types. The DPP technology platform addresses the rapid diagnostic test market, which includes infectious diseases, cardiac markers, cholesterol and lipids, pregnancy and fertility, and drugs of abuse. Compared with traditional lateral flow technology, the DPP technology platform can provide:

● | Enhanced sensitivity and specificity: This is achieved via our patented approach to separating the sample path from the buffer path, together with other patented and proprietary strategies, than traditional lateral flow tests. It also delivers lower levels of detection.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Advanced multiplexing capabilities: Through advanced multiplexing, the DPP platform can detect and differentiate up to eight distinct test results from a single patient sample, which can deliver greater clinical value than other rapid tests.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Quantitative results: For some diagnostic applications, our easy-to-use, highly portable, battery-operated DPP Micro Reader optical analyzers can report accurate results in approximately 15 seconds, making it well-suited for decentralized testing where real-time results enable patients to be clinically assessed while they are still onsite. Objective results produced by the DPP Micro Reader can reduce the possibility of the types of human error that can be experienced in the visual interpretations required by many rapid tests.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


We target the market for rapid diagnostic test solutions for infectious diseases, which is driven by the high prevalence of infectious diseases globally, an increase in the geriatric population, growing demand for rapid test results, and advancements in multiplexing. We have a broad portfolio of infectious disease products, which prior to 2020 were focused principally on sexually transmitted disease and fever and tropical disease. For example, in June 2020 we received FDA clearance of our 510(k) submission for the DPP Zika IgM System, which consists of an antibody test for Zika IgM and a DPP Micro Reader and which had previously received an FDA Emergency Use Authorization or EUA. In October 2020 the DPP HIV-Syphilis System, an antibody test system for the human immunodeficiency virus or HIV and Treponema pallidum bacteria (the causative agent of syphilis), received FDA approval for a Premarket Approval, or PMA, application.

In February 2020 we began the process of shifting substantially all of our resources to leverage the DPP technology platform to address the acute and escalating need for diagnostic testing for COVID-19.


● | COVID-19 antibody test system: We initially refocused our business strategy on the development and commercialization of the DPP COVID-19 IgM/IgG System, which consisted of a new serological test for COVID-19 and a DPP Micro Reader that could provide separate numerical readings for both IgM and IgG levels of antibodies to the virus. We acquired three regulatory approvals of the DPP COVID-19 IgM/IgG system in our targeted global testing market: an EUA, granted by the FDA in April 2020; an approval for emergency use issued by Brazil’s Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária, or ANVISA, in April 2020, and a CE Marking for the European Union obtained in early May 2020. In June 2020 the FDA revoked the EUA for the DPP COVID-19 IgM/IgG system. In September 2020 we submitted to the FDA an EUA application for the DPP SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG System, a new rapid antibody test system that detected COVID-19 antibodies using a different methodology that was consistent with updated FDA guidance, but in December 2020 the FDA notified us that it was declining to review the new system based on the FDA’s then-effective prioritization guidance, under which review of the system was not a priority because, for example, the FDA determined that authorization of the tests would have relatively limited impact on testing accessibility or testing capacity.

● | COVID-19 antigen test system: In July 2020 we received a $628,071 grant, the First BARDA Grant, from the Department of Health and Human Services; Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response; Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, Division of Research Innovation and Ventures, or BARDA, to assist us in developing, submitting and obtaining an EUA application for a COVID-19 point-of-care antigen system using DPP technology. In October 2020, with BARDA’s support in accordance with its grant, we submitted to the FDA an EUA application for the DPP SARS‑CoV‑2 Antigen System, a test system that consists of a DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen test cartridge, a DPP Micro Reader optical analyzer and a minimally invasive nasal swab. In December 2020 we received a $12.7 million grant from BARDA, in part to support preparation, submission, and approval of FDA 510(k) clearance for the DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen System. In January 2021 the FDA notified us that it was declining to review the DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen System based on its updated prioritization guidance, under which review of the system was not a priority. The FDA has supplementally advised us of the type and nature of information it would need to receive in a subsequent EUA application in order for the DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen System to be prioritized for review, and we are engaged in testing and development in order to submit a new EUA application for a COVID-19 antigen test system.

● | COVID-19 and Influenza respiratory antigen panel test system: BARDA’s $12.7 million grant in December 2020 also supported our development, submission and receipt of an EUA for a rapid, multiplex respiratory antigen panel point-of-care test system using DPP technology. We are currently seeking to develop and conduct clinical trials of the DPP Respiratory Antigen Panel, a test system being designed to provide simultaneous, discrete and differential detection of Influenza A, Influenza B and SARS-CoV-2 antigens from a single patient respiratory specimen, such as a nasal swab, in approximately 20 minutes. The system is intended to enable appropriate clinical management of patients with suspected respiratory infections and to assist in the containment of COVID-19 cases during the flu season. This test system is expected to provide results in approximately 20 minutes and to be run on the DPP Micro Reader.

For additional information about our existing and proposed product offerings, please see “—Products” below.

Our products are sold globally, directly and through distributors, to medical laboratories and hospitals, governmental and public health entities, non-governmental organizations, medical professionals, and retail establishments. We continue to seek to expand our commercial distribution channels.

The extensive economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, exacerbated by the market and regulatory complications we faced in seeking to develop and commercialize a portfolio of COVID-19 test systems, was reflected in our operating results for 2020, as total revenues were $32.5 million, a decrease of 5.8% from 2019, and net product sales were $24.8 million, a decrease of 14.1% from 2019. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Consolidated Results of Operations.”

In 2020 we continued to invest in automating our test manufacturing processes, all of which are now based in the United States. Among other actions, we expanded our manufacturing capabilities by validating and implementing automated lines. Our transition from manual to automated assembly is intended to add capacity, reduce variable costs and improve product margins. In order to address challenging economic conditions and implement our business strategy, we continued to execute a program to reduce operating expenses and better align our costs with revenues, including by eliminating positions that were no longer aligned with our strategy. Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $23.1 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $18.3 million at December 31, 2019.

COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems
 Prior to 2020, our broad portfolio of infectious disease products was focused principally on sexually transmitted disease and fever and tropical disease. In 2020 we shifted substantially all of our resources to leverage the DPP technology platform to address the acute and escalating need for diagnostic testing for COVID-19.
COVID-19 Antibody Test System

Beginning in February 2020 we refocused our business strategy on the development and commercialization of a COVID-19 antibody test system based on DPP technology. We initially developed the DPP COVID-19 IgM/IgG System, which consisted of a new serological test for COVID-19 and a DPP Micro Reader that could provide separate numerical readings for both IgM and IgG levels of antibodies to the CORONA-19 virus. We acquired three regulatory approvals of the DPP COVID-19 IgM/IgG System in our targeted global testing market: an EUA, granted by the FDA in April 2020; an approval for emergency use issued by Brazil’s Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária, or ANVISA, in April 2020, and a CE Marking for the European Union obtained in early May 2020. In June 2020, however, the FDA revoked the EUA for the DPP COVID-19 IgM/IgG System.

In the second quarter of 2020 we began shipping the DPP COVID-19 IgM/IgG System to fulfill a $4 million purchase order from Bio-Manguinhos, a long-standing customer that is a subsidiary of the foundation responsible for the development and production of vaccines, diagnostics and biopharmaceuticals for Brazil’s national public health system.

In September 2020 we submitted to the FDA an EUA application for the DPP SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG System, a new rapid antibody test system that detected COVID-19 antibodies using a different methodology that was consistent with updated FDA guidance. In December 2020 the FDA notified us that it was declining to review the DPP SARS-CoV- 2 IgM/IgG System based on the FDA’s then-effective prioritization guidance. Under this guidance, review of the system was not a priority for the FDA because, for example, the FDA determined that authorization of the tests would have relatively limited impact on testing accessibility or testing capacity. The FDA has supplementally advised us of the type and nature of information it would need to receive in a subsequent EUA application in order for the DPP SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG System to be prioritized for review. We are continuing to evaluate whether to commit further resources to the testing and development that would be required in order to seek to submit a new EUA application for a COVID-19 antibody test system.

In January 2021 we announced the CE mark for the DPP SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG test system, providing regulatory approval to register and market the test systems in the European Union and other geographies that accept the CE mark.

COVID-19 Antigen Test System

In mid-2020 we began to focus on the development of a COVID-19 antigen test system based on DPP technology. In July 2020 we received a $628,071 grant from BARDA to assist us in developing, submitting and obtaining an EUA application for, a COVID-19 point-of-care antigen system. In October 2020, with BARDA’s support in accordance with its grant, we submitted to the FDA an EUA application for the DPP SARS‑CoV‑2 Antigen System, a test system that consists of a DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen test cartridge, a DPP Micro Reader optical analyzer and a minimally invasive nasal swab.

In November 2020 ANVISA approved the DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen test system for use in Brazil.

In December 2020 we received a $12.7 million grant from BARDA, in part to support preparation of a submission in pursuit of FDA 510(k) clearance for the DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen System.

In January 2021 the FDA notified us that it was declining to review the DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen System based on its updated prioritization guidance, under which review of the system was not a priority. The FDA has supplementally advised us of the type and nature of information it would need to receive in a subsequent EUA application in order for the DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen System to be prioritized for review, and we are engaged in testing and development in order to submit a new EUA application for a COVID-19 antigen test system.

In January 2021 we announced the CE mark for the DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen test system, providing regulatory approval to register and market the test systems in the European Union and other geographies that accept the CE mark.

 

COVID-19 and Influenza Respiratory Antigen Panel Test System

In the fourth quarter of 2020 we began developing a rapid, multiplex respiratory antigen panel point-of-care test system using DPP technology. BARDA designated a portion of its $12.7 million grant in December 2020 for use to support our development, submission and receipt of an EUA for this system.

We are currently seeking to develop and conduct clinical trials of the DPP Respiratory Antigen Panel, a test system being designed to provide simultaneous, discrete and differential detection of Influenza A, Influenza B and SARS-CoV-2 antigens from a single patient respiratory specimen, such as a nasal swab, in approximately 20 minutes. The system is intended to enable appropriate clinical management of patients with suspected respiratory infections and to assist in the containment of COVID-19 cases during the flu season. This test system is expected to provide results in approximately 20 minutes and to be run on the DPP Micro Reader.

To enhance our offered product line quickly, we signed an in-licensing agreement to distribute a visual-read, point- of-care, EUA-approved respiratory panel for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigens, Influenza A and Influenza B. This offering is scheduled to launch in March 2021.

--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


We market and sell both stand-alone and multiplex tests for sexually transmitted infectious diseases, such as HIV and syphilis. HIV and syphilis continue to be major global public health issues. According to WHO estimates:


● | HIV has claimed more than 35 million lives, including 770,000 in 2018. Approximately 37.9 million people were living with HIV at the end of 2018, and 1.7 million were newly infected during 2018.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | There were 18.0 million prevalent cases of syphilis as of 2012, and 5.6 million new infections were estimated to occur annually.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Elimination of mother-to-child transmission, or MTCT, of both HIV and syphilis is a global health priority. In 2013, 1.9 million pregnant women were infected with syphilis worldwide. Congenital syphilis contributes significantly to infant mortality, accounting for 305,000 annual perinatal deaths worldwide in 2013. Globally, more than 1.4 million pregnant women were infected with HIV as of 2015, and MTCT of HIV is estimated to have resulted in over 150,000 infant cases in 2015.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

We are seeking to address the global concerns related to HIV and syphilis co-infection through the development of a novel, multiplex test for both HIV and syphilis. We have developed a DPP HIV-Syphilis multiplex test and received regulatory approvals in the United States and a number of international markets, including Brazil, Europe, Malaysia and Mexico. We are pursuing a CLIA waiver for the DPP HIV-Syphilis tests in the United States.

We also market and sell tests for selected fever and tropical diseases such as Chagas, ebola, leishmaniasis and Zika. The market for rapid diagnostic insect-vector diseases includes established markets for disease such as dengue and malaria, which WHO estimates together account for more than 600 million annual infections worldwide. There are also a number of emerging markets for rapid diagnostic tests for infectious diseases such as burkholderia, chikungunya, lassa, leptospirosis, Marburg, rickettsia and Zika.

Since 2015 we have received over $14.2 million of funding from some of the world’s leading health organizations, which has helped us accelerate the expansion of our pipeline of infectious disease tests. Our collaborators have included Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, The Paul G. Allen Family Foundation, The Oswaldo Cruz Foundation or FIOCRUZ, and the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics, or FIND, as well as U.S. government agencies such as Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or BARDA, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or USDA.

Several tests in our infectious disease pipeline are approaching commercialization, and several have received initial regulatory approvals:

Sales Channels

Our products are sold globally, both directly and through distributors, to hospitals and clinics, physician offices, clinical laboratories, public health organizations, government agencies and consumers. Historically we marketed and sold our products only into a handful of countries and regions. During 2020, we expanded our U.S.-based sales, customer service, and marketing team to focus on the COVID-19, HIV-Syphilis, and future DPP platform product opportunities. With sales growth as an underlying objective, we are focused on increasing sales in geographies that support higher average selling prices. From lead generation through technical inquiries, Chembio has the internal resources to support customers through the commercial process including marketing, sales, sales support, order entry and product support.  Our goal is to delight our global customers through all facets of our commercial interactions.

Automation of U.S. Manufacturing

We are automating our U.S. manufacturing processes and expanding our manufacturing capacity. Over the past two years, we have taken delivery of and completed validation of most of our automated manufacturing lines. These use vision-guided, robotic operation to improve inspection and quality control. As we transition from manual to automated assembly, we believe the reduced variable costs will improve product gross margins.

DPP Technology & Development

Our commercially available products employ either our patented DPP technology or traditional lateral flow technology. We believe products developed using our DPP technology can provide superior diagnostic performance compared with products that utilize traditional lateral flow technology.

Chembio’s history of collaborations has proven the strength and capabilities of the DPP platform to address a diverse range of biomarkers. We are now focusing our R&D resources on delivering products to build a portfolio of COVID-19 tests, Chembio’s new and expanded product portfolio will emphasize high value added tests with strong margins, selling in developed markets, established sales channels, and clinically accepted use cases, where the differentiated capabilities of DPP provide a competitive advantage.

 

Competition

Many of our competitors are significantly larger and have greater financial, research, manufacturing, and marketing resources. Important competitive factors include product quality, analytical performance, ease of use, price, customer service and reputation. Industry competition is based on these and the following additional factors:

● | patent protection;
--+-------------------


● | scientific expertise;
--+----------------------


● | ability to develop and market products and processes;
--+------------------------------------------------------


● | ability to obtain required regulatory approvals;
--+-------------------------------------------------


● | ability to manufacture cost-effective products that meet applicable regulatory requirements;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | access to adequate capital; and,
--+---------------------------------


● | ability to attract and retain qualified personnel.
--+---------------------------------------------------


We believe our scientific capabilities and proprietary know-how relating to our patented DPP technology and rapid diagnostic technology are very strong, particularly for the development and manufacture of tests for the detection of  infectious and other diseases.

Although we have no specific knowledge of any other competitors’ products that could render our products obsolete, if we fail to maintain and enhance our competitive position or fail to introduce new products and product features, our customers may decide to use the products developed by our competitors, which could result in a loss of revenues and cash flow.

Employees

As of December 31, 2020, we had 355 full-time equivalent employees, of whom 39 were in administration, 262 were in manufacturing, 32 were in research and development, and 22 were in sales and marketing and customer service. Of these employees, approximately 320 were located in the United States, 0 were located in Malaysia, 19 were located in Germany and 16 were located in Brazil.

We have never had a work stoppage, and none of our employees are represented by a labor organization or subject to any collective bargaining arrangements. We consider our employee relations to be good.

In January 2021, Chembio announced a restructuting plan in the US and reduced its workforce by approximately 9%, as further discussed on Note 16 - Subsequent Events.

Governmental Regulation

Certain of our activities are subject to regulatory oversight by the FDA under provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and regulations thereunder, including regulations governing the development, marketing, labeling, promotion, manufacturing, and export of diagnostic products. Our clinical laboratory customers are subject to oversight by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, pursuant to CLIA, as well as agencies in various states. Failure to comply with applicable requirements can lead to sanctions, including withdrawal of products from the market, recalls, refusal to authorize government contracts, product seizures, civil money penalties, injunctions, and criminal prosecution.

FDA Approval/Clearance Requirements

Unless an exemption applies, each medical device that we market or wish to market in the United States must receive 510(k) clearance or Premarket Approval, or PMA. Medical devices that receive 510(k) clearance are “cleared” by the FDA to market, distribute, and sell in the United States. Medical devices that obtain a PMA by the FDA are “approved” to market, distribute and sell in the United States. We cannot be certain that 510(k) clearance or PMA approval will ever be obtained for any products that have not already obtained 510(k) clearance or PMA approval. Descriptions of the PMA and 510(k) clearance processes are provided below.

The FDA decides whether a device line must undergo either the 510(k) clearance or PMA based on statutory criteria that utilize a risk-based classification system. PMA is the FDA process of scientific and regulatory review to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Class III medical devices and, in many cases, Class II medical devices. Class III devices are those that support or sustain human life, are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury. The FDA uses these criteria to decide whether a PMA or a 510(k) is appropriate, including the level of risk that the agency perceives is associated with the device and a determination by the agency of whether the product is a type of device that is similar to devices that are already legally marketed. Devices deemed to pose relatively less risk are placed in either Class I or II. In many cases, the FDA requires the manufacturer to submit a 510(k) requesting clearance (also referred to as a premarket notification), unless an exemption applies. The 510(k) must demonstrate that the manufacturer’s proposed device is “substantially equivalent” in intended use and in safety and effectiveness to a legally marketed predicate device. A “predicate device” is a pre-existing medical device to which equivalence can be drawn, that is either in Class I or Class II or is a Class III device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, for which the FDA has not yet called for submission of a PMA application.

 

Device classification depends on the device’s intended use and its indications for use. In addition, classification is risk-based, that is, the risk the device poses to the patient and/or the user is a major factor in determining the class to which it is assigned. Class I includes devices with the lowest risk and Class III includes those with the greatest risk.

Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA’s general regulatory controls for medical devices, or the General Controls, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA’s quality system regulations, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Some Class I devices also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) process described below.

Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s General Controls, and any other special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) process. Pursuant to the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002, unless a specific exemption applies, 510(k) submissions are subject to user fees. Certain Class II devices are exempt from this premarket review process.

Class III includes devices with the greatest risk. Devices in this class must meet all of the requirements in Classes I and II. In addition, Class III devices cannot be marketed until they receive Premarket Approval.

The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be assured solely by the General Controls and the other requirements described above. These devices require formal clinical studies to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Under Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002, PMA applications (and supplemental premarket approval applications) are subject to significantly higher user fees than 510(k) applications, and they also require considerably more time and resources.

Rapid HIV tests intended for diagnostic use are regulated as Class III devices. Responsibility for assuring the safety and effectiveness of these tests lies within the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research’s Office of Blood Research and Review, with oversight by the Blood Products Advisory Committee. Approved rapid HIV tests must meet the regulations in the 21 CFR 800 series subparts, under the investigational device exemption, or IDE and PMA pathways.

Premarket Approval Pathway

We manufacture, market and distribute three rapid HIV tests in the United States. Our HIV 1/2 STAT-PAK Assay, SURE CHECK HIV 1/2 Assay, and DPP HIV 1/2 Assay all have received FDA PMA approval. A PMA application must be supported by extensive data including, but not limited to, analytical, preclinical, clinical trials, manufacturing, statutory preapproval inspections, and labeling to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. Before a PMA is submitted, a manufacturer must apply for an IDE. If the device presents a “significant risk,” as defined by the FDA, to human health, the FDA requires the device sponsor to file an IDE application with the FDA and obtain IDE approval prior to initiation of enrollment of human subjects for clinical trials. The IDE provides the manufacturer with a legal pathway to perform clinical trials on human subjects where without the IDE, only approved medical devices may be used on human subjects.

The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as analytical, animal and laboratory testing results, manufacturing information, and an Investigational Review Board, or IRB approved protocol showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. If the clinical trial design is deemed to have “non-significant risk,” the clinical trial may be eligible for “abbreviated” IDE requirements. In some instances, clinical trials for in vitro diagnostic medical devices may be exempt from the more burdensome IDE requirements if certain labeling requirements are met.

A clinical trial may be suspended by either the FDA or the Investigational Review Board at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to the study participants outweigh the benefits of participation in the study. Even if a study is completed, clinical testing results may not demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the device, or they may be equivocal or otherwise insufficient to obtain approval of the product being tested. After the clinical trials have been completed, if at all, and the clinical trial data and results are collected and organized, a manufacturer may complete a PMA application.

After a PMA application is sufficiently complete, the FDA will accept the application and begin an in-depth review of the submitted information. By statute, the FDA has 180 days to review the “accepted application,” although, generally, review of the application can take between one and three years, but it may take significantly longer. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. Also, during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The preapproval inspections conducted by the FDA include an evaluation of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the FDA’s quality systems regulations or QSR, as well as inspections of the clinical trial sites by the Bioresearch Monitoring group to evaluate compliance with good clinical practice and human subject protections. New PMA applications or PMA supplements are required for modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, including, for example, certain types of modifications to the device’s indication for use, manufacturing process, labeling and design. Significant changes to an approved PMA require a 180-day supplement, whereas less substantive changes may utilize a 30-day notice, or a 135-day supplement. Premarket approval supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a premarket approval application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original premarket approval application, and it may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel.

 

Our HIV 1/2 STAT-PAK Assay PMA application number BP050009/0 and our SURE CHECK 1/2 HIV Assay PMA application number BP050010/0 were approved by the FDA in May 2006. Our DPP HIV 1/2 Assay PMA application number BP120032/0 was approved by the FDA in December 2012.  Our DPP HIV Syphilis Assay PMA application number BP180191/0 was approved by the FDA in October 2020.

510(k) Clearance Pathway

We are currently developing products that either will or are likely to require an FDA 510(k) clearance. We anticipate submitting a 510(k) for each such product to demonstrate that such proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of a 510(k).  The FDA’s 510(k) clearance pathway usually takes from three to twelve months but could take longer. In some cases the FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence.

If a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, a PMA. The FDA requires each device manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a new 510(k) or a PMA, but the FDA can review any such decision and, if it disagrees with the manufacturer’s determination, can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA of the modified device is obtained.

Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988

A manufacturer of a test categorized as moderately complex may request that categorization of the test be waived through a CLIA Waiver by Application, or CW, submission to the FDA. When a test is categorized as waived, it may be performed by laboratories with a Certificate of Waiver, such as a physician’s office outreach setting. In a CW submission, the manufacturer provides evidence to the FDA that a test meets the CLIA statutory criteria for waiver CLIA, a walk-in clinic or an emergency room provides CMS authority over all laboratory testing, except research that is performed on humans in the United States. The Division of Laboratory Services, within the Survey and Certification Group under the CMS, has the responsibility for implementing the CLIA program.

The CLIA program is designed to establish quality laboratory testing by ensuring the accuracy, reliability and timeliness of patient test results. Under CLIA, a laboratory is a facility that does laboratory testing on specimens derived from humans and used to provide information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease, or impairment of, or assessment of health. Under the CLIA program, unless waived, laboratories must be certified by the government, satisfy governmental quality and personnel standards, undergo proficiency testing, be subject to inspections and pay fees. We have received a CLIA waiver for all of our rapid diagnostic rapid HIV tests that we market in the United States. Specifically, the CLIA waiver was granted by the FDA for HIV 1/2 STAT-PAK in November 2006,for SURE CHECK HIV 1/2 in October 2007, and for DPP HIV 1/2 in October 2014.

Emergency Use Authorizations (EUA)

A formal request to issue an EUA generally should not be submitted until the Secretary of HHS has issued an EUA declaration under section 564(b)(1). In particular, although section 564 allows FDA to issue an EUA for preparedness purposes, in such cases the HHS Secretary must first declare that circumstances exist justifying such an authorization in advance of an actual emergency based on a formal determination of a significant potential for emergency or a material threat determination. During the effective period of the HHS Secretary’s EUA declaration, FDA may authorize the introduction of a medical product into interstate commerce when the product is intended for use during an actual or potential emergency. EUA candidate products include medical products and uses that are not approved, cleared, or licensed under sections 505, 510(k), and 515 of the FD&C Act or section 351 of the PHS Act.

After the requisite determination and declaration have been issued, and after feasible and appropriate consultations, FDA may issue an EUA only if FDA concludes that the following four statutory criteria for issuance have been met for 1) Serious or Life-Threatening Disease or conditions, 2) evidence of effectiveness, 2) Risk –Benefit Analysis, 4) No Alternatives.  A sponsor seeking an EUA can submit its formal request in the form of an EUA submission, which includes data for clinical studies, non-clinical laboratory studies to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product as well as the discussion of Risks and Benefits of the product.

FDA will specify the effective date of an EUA issued under section 564. In general, an EUA will remain in effect for the duration of the EUA declaration under which it was issued which describes termination of an EUA declaration and its impact on existing EUAs.

Pervasive and Continuing FDA Regulation

A host of regulatory requirements apply to our approved devices, including: the quality system regulation, which requires manufacturers to follow elaborate design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures; the Medical Reporting Regulations, which require manufacturers to report to the FDA specified types of adverse events involving their products; labeling regulations; and the FDA’s general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or “off-label” uses. Some Class II devices are subject to special controls-such as performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient registries, and FDA guidelines-that do not apply to Class I devices.

 

The regulatory requirements that apply to our approved products classified as medical devices include:


● | product listing and establishment registration, which helps facilitate FDA inspections and other regulatory action;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Medford, New York facility is currently registered as an establishment with the FDA. We and any third-party manufacturers are subject to announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA to determine our compliance with QSR and other regulations.

21st Century Cures Act

The 21st Century Cures Act, enacted in December 2016, contains several sections specific to medical device innovations. We believe that implementation of the 21st Century Cures Act may have a positive impact on its businesses by facilitating innovation and/or reducing the regulatory burden imposed on medical device manufacturers.
Government Regulation of Medical Devices for Animal Subjects

We currently offer two veterinary devices in the United States: DPP VetTB Assay for Cervids and DPP VetTB Assay for Elephants. Diagnostic tests for animal health infectious diseases, including our veterinary devices for the prevention and/or treatment of animal disease, are regulated in the U.S. by the Center for Veterinary Biologics within the U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, or APHIS, under the Virus, Serum, and Toxin Act of 1913. As a requirement, our veterinary devices were approved by APHIS before they could be sold in the U.S.

The APHIS regulatory approval process involves the submission of product performance data and manufacturing documentation. Following regulatory approval to market a product, APHIS requires that each lot of product be submitted for review before release to customers. In addition, APHIS requires special approval to market products where test results are used in part for government-mandated disease management programs.

Environmental Laws

We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all foreign, federal, state, and local environmental regulations applicable to our manufacturing facilities. The cost of ongoing compliance with such regulations does not have a material effect on our operations.
Intellectual Property

Intellectual Property Strategy

Our intellectual property strategy is to:  (1) build our own intellectual property portfolio around our DPP technology and optical analyzers; (2) pursue licenses, trade secrets and know-how within the area of rapid point-of-care testing; and, (3) develop and acquire proprietary positions to certain reagents.
DPP Intellectual Property

We have obtained patent coverage on our DPP technology, including numerous patents in the United States, and one or more patents in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Columbia, Eurasia (Russia), European Union (fourteen European countries),Hong Kong, Israel, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Poland, Singapore, South Africa, Thailand, and the United Kingdom .  Additional patent applications on our DPP technology are pending in the United States, as well as in  foreign countries such as Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Singapore and Thailand.

DPP technology provides us with freedom to operate and enables us to develop tests with better performance and capabilities compared with tests built on traditional lateral flow platforms.  These advantages have allowed us to enter into multiple technology collaborations based upon DPP technology, which we believe will provide new manufacturing and marketing opportunities. We have filed additional patent applications that we believe will strengthen the DPP intellectual property and have also filed for patent protection for certain other point-of-care technologies or applications thereof.

We have also obtained patent coverage on our optical-based analyzer technology in the United States as well as in several EU countries.

Trademarks

We have filed and obtained trademarks for our company name CHEMBIO and CHEMBIO DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEMS, INC. as well as for many of our products, including DPP, SURE CHECK, STAT-VIEW, STAT-PAK, and NEXT GENERATION DPP, as well as for the SampleTainer and DPP Micro Reader, which are used with certain DPP products.  Our trademarks have been registered in the United States and certain other countries around the world.

Trade Secrets and Know-How

We have developed a substantial body of trade secrets and know-how relating to the development and manufacture of lateral flow and DPP-based diagnostic tests, including the sourcing and optimization of materials for such tests, and methods to maximize sensitivity, speed-to-result, specificity, stability and reproducibility of our tests.  We possess proprietary know-how to develop tests for multiple conditions using colored particles.  Our formulations enable long shelf lives of our rapid HIV and other tests, providing us with an important competitive advantage.

Rapid Diagnostic Technology and Reagent Licenses

We seek licenses and/or redesigns of products that we believe to be in our best interests.  Because of the costs and other negative consequences of time-consuming patent litigation, we often attempt to obtain a license on reasonable terms.

The peptides used in our rapid HIV tests were licensed to us by one or more third parties. We also have licensed the antigens used in other tests including our Syphilis, Tuberculosis, Leptospirosis, Leishmaniasis and Chagas tests, and we may enter into other license agreements.  In prior years, we concluded license agreements related to intellectual property rights owned by the United States associated with HIV-1 and a sub-license agreement for HIV-2 with Bio-Rad Laboratories N.A., the exclusive licensee of the Pasteur Institute’s HIV-2 intellectual property estate.
