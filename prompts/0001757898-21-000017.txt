ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
INTRODUCTION 
STERIS plc is a leading provider of infection prevention and other procedural products and services. WE HELP OUR CUSTOMERS CREATE A HEALTHIER AND SAFER WORLD by providing innovative healthcare and life science products and services around the globe. We offer our Customers a unique mix of innovative consumable products, such as detergents, gastrointestinal ("GI") endoscopy accessories, barrier product solutions, and other products and services, including: equipment installation and maintenance, microbial reduction of medical devices, instrument and scope repair solutions, laboratory testing services, on-site and off-site reprocessing, and capital equipment products, such as sterilizers and surgical tables, and connectivity solutions such as operating room (“OR”) integration.
On March 28, 2019, STERIS plc, a public limited company organized under the laws of England and Wales (“STERIS UK”), completed a redomiciliation from the United Kingdom to Ireland (the “Redomiciliation”). The Redomiciliation was achieved through the insertion of a new Irish public limited holding company (“STERIS Ireland”) on top of STERIS UK pursuant to a court-approved scheme of arrangement under English law (the “Scheme”). Following the Scheme effectiveness, STERIS UK was re-registered as a private limited company with the name STERIS Limited, and STERIS Emerald IE Limited, a company established in Ireland and a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of STERIS Ireland, was interposed as the direct parent company of STERIS UK. 
STERIS plc's registered office is located in Dublin, Ireland. STERIS plc has approximately 13,000 employees worldwide. Through our field sales and service and a network of dealers and distributors, we serve Customers in more than 100 countries around the world.
We operate and report our financial information in three reportable business segments: Healthcare, Applied Sterilization Technologies and Life Sciences. Non-allocated operating costs that support the entire Company and items not indicative of operating trends are excluded from segment operating income. We disclose a measure of segment income that is consistent with the way management operates and views the business. The accounting policies for reportable segments are the same as those for the consolidated Company.
Prior to April 1, 2020, we operated and reported our financial information in four reportable business segments: Healthcare Products, Healthcare Specialty Services, Life Sciences, and Applied Sterilization Technologies. The Healthcare Products and Healthcare Specialty Services segments were combined and are now reported as one segment, simply called Healthcare, consistent with the way management now operates and views the business. Prior periods have been recast in the financial tables below for comparability. 
The bulk of our revenues are derived from the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries. Much of the growth in these industries is driven by the aging of the population throughout the world, as an increasing number of individuals are entering their prime healthcare consumption years, and is dependent upon advancement in healthcare delivery, acceptance of new technologies, government policies, and general economic conditions. The pharmaceutical industry has been impacted by increased regulatory scrutiny of cleaning and validation processes, mandating that manufacturers improve their processes. Within healthcare, there is increased concern regarding the level of hospital acquired infections around the world; increased demand for medical procedures, including preventive screenings such as endoscopies and colonoscopies; and a desire by our Customers to operate more efficiently, all of which are driving increased demand for many of our products and services. During fiscal 2021, we experienced reduced demand for certain products and services resulting from the reduction of deferrable surgical procedures and increased demand for other products and services from our pharmaceutical Customers focused on vaccines and biologics and increased demand in the Applied Sterilization Technologies segment for personal protective equipment product services, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The COVID-19 pandemic began to impact our business late in fiscal 2020. The pandemic and related public health recommendations and mandated precautions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, including deferral of surgical procedures and treatments and shelter-in-place orders or similar measures, have negatively affected and are expected to continue to negatively affect some of our operations, which may impact our financial position and cash flows. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience unpredictable fluctuations in demand for certain of our products and services, including some products and services that are experiencing increased demand. To date, we do not believe that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a material impact on our operations, as we have been able to continue to operate our manufacturing facilities and meet the demand for essential products and services of our Customers. During fiscal 2021, in response to the to the pandemic, we implemented several measures that we believe helped us protect the health and safety of our employees, preserve liquidity and enhance our financial flexibility.We allowed employees to work remotely when possible and implemented additional safety measures in compliance with applicable regulations to allow personnel to continue to work in our facilities. We suspended all non-essential travel and enacted a temporary hiring freeze on certain positions. To manage liquidity, we suspended our stock repurchase program and deferred certain planned capital expenditures; however, we continued to invest in expansion projects as planned. We do not believe that these actions will negatively impact our long-term ability to generate revenues or meet existing and future financial obligations. 
While we have been impacted and expect this situation to continue to have an impact on our business, the full impact to our results of operations and financial position cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. For additional information and our risk factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic, please refer to Part I Item 1A titled, "Risk Factors".
On January 12, 2021, we announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire Cantel Medical Corp. (NYSE: CMD "Cantel"), through a U.S. subsidiary. Cantel is a global provider of infection prevention products and services primarily to endoscopy and dental Customers. For additional information please refer to Item 7 titled, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations". 
INFORMATION RELATED TO BUSINESS SEGMENTS 
Our chief operating decision maker is our President and Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”). The CEO is responsible for performance assessment and resource allocation. The CEO regularly receives discrete financial information about each reportable segment and uses this information to assess performance and allocate resources. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements titled, “Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” of this Annual Report.

INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO OUR BUSINESS IN GENERAL
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials.  We purchase raw materials, sub-assemblies, components, and other supplies needed in our operations from numerous suppliers in the United States and internationally. The principal raw materials and supplies used in our operations include stainless and carbon steel, organic and inorganic chemicals, fuel, and plastic components. These raw materials and supplies are generally available from several suppliers and in sufficient quantities that we do not currently expect any significant sourcing problems in fiscal 2022. We have long-term supply contracts for certain materials for which there are few suppliers, or those that are single-sourced in certain regions of the world, such as EO and cobalt-60, which are necessary to our AST operations. In addition, we have developed a plan to expand our irradiation processing capacity with accelerator-based technologies, which may reduce the potential supply risk. 
Intellectual Property.  We protect our technology and products by, among other means, obtaining United States and foreign patents. There can be no assurance, however, that any patent will provide adequate protection for the technology, system, product, service, or process it covers. In addition, the process of obtaining and protecting patents can be long and expensive. We also rely upon trade secrets, technical know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position.
As of March 31, 2021, we held approximately 450 United States patents and approximately 1,780 in other jurisdictions and had approximately 140 United States patent applications and 335 patent applications pending in other jurisdictions. Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of filing or grant and legal term of patents in various countries where a patent is obtained. The actual protection a patent provides varies from country to country and depends in part upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, and the availability of legal remedies in each country.
Our products are sold around the world under various brand names and trademarks. We consider our brand names and trademarks to be valuable in the marketing of our products. As of March 31, 2021, we had a total of approximately 1,670 trademark registrations worldwide.
Quality Assurance.  We manufacture, assemble, and package products in several countries. Each of our production facilities are dedicated to particular processes and products. Our success depends upon Customer confidence in the quality of our production process and the integrity of the data that supports our product safety and effectiveness. We have implemented quality assurance procedures to support the quality and integrity of scientific information and production processes. 
Government Regulation.  Our business is subject to various degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which we operate. In the United States, the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (“NRC”), and other governmental authorities regulate the development, manufacture, sale, and distribution of our products and services. Our international operations also are subject to a significant amount of government regulation, including country-specific rules and regulations and U.S. regulations applicable to our international operations. Government regulations include detailed inspection of, and controls over, research and development, clinical investigations, product approvals and manufacturing, marketing and promotion, sampling, distribution, record-keeping, storage, and disposal practices.
Compliance with applicable regulations is a significant expense for us. Past, current or future regulations, their interpretation, or their application could have a material adverse impact on our operations. Also, additional governmental regulation may be passed that could prevent, delay, revoke, or result in the rejection of regulatory clearance of our products. We cannot predict the effect on our operations resulting from current or future governmental regulation or the interpretation or application of these regulations.
If we fail to comply with any applicable regulatory requirements, sanctions could be imposed on us. For more information about the risks we face regarding regulatory requirements, see Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report titled, "Risk Factors". We are subject to extensive regulatory requirements and must receive and maintain regulatory clearance or approval for many products and operations. Failure to receive or maintain, or delays in receiving, clearance or approvals may hurt our revenues, profitability, financial condition, or value.
In the past, we have received warning letters, paid civil penalties, conducted product recalls and field corrections, and been subject to other regulatory sanctions. We believe that we are currently compliant in all material respects with applicable regulatory requirements. However, there can be no assurance that future or current regulatory, governmental, or private action will not have a material adverse affect on us or on our performance, results, or financial condition.
Environmental Matters.  We are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in Ireland, the United States and other countries. We have made, and continue to make, significant investments to comply with these laws and regulations. We cannot predict the future capital expenditures or operating costs required to comply with environmental laws and regulations. We believe that we are currently compliant with applicable environmental, health, and safety requirements in all material respects. However, there can be no assurance that future or current regulatory, governmental, or private action will not have a material adverse affect on our performance, results, or financial condition. Please refer to Note 10 of our consolidated financial statements titled, "Commitments and Contingencies" for further information.
In the future, if a loss contingency related to environmental matters, employee safety, health or conditional asset retirement obligations is significantly greater than the current estimated amount, we would record a liability for the obligation and it may result in a material impact on net income for the annual or interim period during which the liability is recorded. The investigation and remediation of environmental obligations generally occur over an extended period of time, and therefore we do not know if these events would have a material adverse affect on our financial condition, liquidity, or cash flow, nor can there be any assurance that such liabilities would not have a material adverse affect on our performance, results, or financial condition.
Competition.  The markets in which we operate are highly competitive and generally highly regulated. Competition is intense in all of our business segments and includes many large and small competitors. Brand, design, quality, safety, ease of use, serviceability, price, product features, warranty, delivery, service, and technical support are important competitive factors to us. We expect to face continued competition in the future as new infection prevention, sterile processing, contamination control, gastrointestinal and surgical support products and services enter the market. We believe many organizations are working with a variety of technologies and sterilizing agents. Also, a number of companies have developed disposable medical instruments and other devices designed to address the risk of contamination.
We believe that our long-term competitive position depends on our success in discovering, developing, and marketing innovative, cost-effective products and services. We devote significant resources to research and development efforts and we believe STERIS is positioned as a global competitor in the search for technological innovations. In addition to research and development, we invest in quality control, Customer programs, distribution systems, technical services, and other information services.
There can be no assurance that we will develop significant new products or services, or that the new products or services we provide or develop in the future will be more commercially successful than those provided or developed by our competitors. In addition, some of our existing or potential competitors may have greater resources than us. Therefore, a competitor may succeed in developing and commercializing products more rapidly than we do. Competition, as it relates to our business segments and product categories, is discussed in more detail in the section above titled, “Information Related to Business Segments.”
Employees.  As of March 31, 2021, we had approximately 13,000 employees throughout the world including certain locations subject to collective bargaining agreements and works council representation. We believe we generally have good relations with our employees.
Methods of Distribution.  Sales and service activities are supported by a staff of regionally based clinical specialists, system planners, corporate account managers, and in-house Customer service and field support departments. We also contract with distributors and dealers in select markets.
Customer training is important to our business. We provide a variety of courses at Customer locations, at our training and education centers, and over the internet. Our training programs help Customers understand the science, technology, and operation of our products and services. Many of our operator training programs are approved by professional certifying organizations and offer continuing education credits to eligible course participants.
Seasonality.  Our financial results have been, from time to time, subject to seasonal patterns. We cannot assure you that these patterns will continue.
Backlog.  We define backlog as the amount of unfilled capital equipment purchase orders at a point in time. At March 31, 2021, we had a backlog of $286.2 million. Of this amount, $206.3 million and $79.9 million related to our Healthcare and Life Sciences segments, respectively. At March 31, 2020, we had backlog orders of $242.5 million. Of this amount, $170.1 million and $72.4 million related to our Healthcare and Life Sciences segments, respectively. 
Availability of Securities and Exchange Commission Filings.  We make available free of charge on or through our website our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to these reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish such material to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).

You may also obtain copies of these documents by accessing the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov. The content on or accessible through any website referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K unless expressly noted.
We also make available free of charge on our website our Corporate Governance Guidelines, our Director Code of Ethics, and our Code of Business Conduct, as well as the Charters of the Audit Committee, the Compensation and Organization Development Committee, the Nominating and Governance Committee, and the Compliance Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors.

EMPLOYEES AND HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 
Strategy and Overview 
People are the key to our success, which is reflected in our two core Values of People and Teamwork. We are committed to the safety and success of our people. We expect the performance of every person to continually improve with personal initiative and proper support. We expect our people to treat each other with mutual respect. Our ideal business team is engaged, diverse, inclusive and talented, and we create programs and policies in support of these goals.
We believe unity of purpose and teamwork enables us to do far more than we could individually. We draw strength from each other and encourage communication with fairness, candor, respect and courage. Our collaboration turns interesting ideas into great products and services for our Customers.
Our senior management team and Board receive regular updates on our people, including data and metrics on retention, engagement and safety which are used to determine our human resources priorities, programs and training.
Employees by Segment
As of March 31, 2021, we had approximately 13,000 employees throughout the world including certain locations subject to collective bargaining agreements and works council representation. We believe we generally have good relations with our employees.

Total employees | 12,770 | | 12,359

Diversity
We recruit the best available people who are aligned with and embody our core Values. We are committed to equality, assessing candidates based on qualifications. We believe that our success is dependent on attracting and retaining people from a 
cross-section of our communities who understand their markets, and in doing so we continue to create a competitive advantage for STERIS.
Our success depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees, and we intend to do so without regard to race, color, social or economic status, religion, national origin, marital status, age, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity, or any protected status. It is the policy of the Company to make all decisions regarding employment, including hiring, compensation, training, promotions, transfers, or lay-offs, based on the job requirements and skills of the individuals and utilizing the principle of equal employment opportunity without discrimination.

Health, Safety & Environment 
We realize the importance of Health, Safety & Environment (HSE) to the well-being of our Customers, employees, community, the environment, and ultimately our shareholders. To that end, our HSE teams and management are committed to supporting HSE programs with ongoing involvement through our continuous improvement process. Our ultimate goal is to be an incident-free company. The cornerstone of this initiative is the belief that incidents result from unsafe acts or conditions, both of which are preventable. We apply the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration recordkeeping practices worldwide. Key metrics for purposes of benchmarking performance include Total Recordable Cases (TRC) and Days Away From Work (DAFW) injury and illness incident rates, both of which are presented in the table below:

 | STERIS plc | | Industry Benchmarks (2)
 | Fiscal 2021 | Fiscal 2020 | | Average | Best in Class
Total Recordable Cases Rate (1) | 0.91 | 1.48 | | 2.5 | 1.28 
Days Away From Work Rate (1) | 0.37 | 0.45 | | 1.25 | 0.42 

(1)  We apply the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recordkeeping practices worldwide. All rates are based on 100 full-time employees ("FTE") working one year. 100 FTEs equals 200,000 work hours. TRC includes work-related injuries or illnesses requiring medical attention beyond first-aid. DAWF includes work-related injuries or illnesses that cause an employee to be away from work at least one full day after the date of the incident.
(2) Our external benchmarks include the OSHA average and 1st Quartile injury/illness rates which are derived from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Employee Engagement and Development 
We believe that engaged employees are more productive, innovative, and satisfied in their work. Examples of how we engage our employees include quarterly management meetings, a robust intranet for communication with our global teams and various communications efforts within each department. In addition, our global human resources team has programs focused on career development for employees at all levels. 
Our employee turnover rate was 11% and 15% for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively and we are continuously working towards a goal of achieving 10% or under excluding retirements and reductions in force. Although reductions in force are sometimes necessary, we work to avoid them and they must always be approved by executive management. Every year we 
encourage all associates to participate in our Employee Engagement Survey which is administered by a third party on a confidential basis. This process has been valuable in helping us recognize things we do well and foster an open conversation about how we can make STERIS an even better place to work. We are pleased to report that 89% and 86% of our people completed our 2021 and 2020 surveys, respectively. In our most recent survey, overall employee engagement was 77%, and the fourteen principal factors that we measure all improved since 2020, and have generally for a decade. The results indicate that the majority of our people are committed to serving our Customers, are proud to work for STERIS, and have confidence in the stability of our business. 
We are committed to supporting the development of our people. Employees benefit from hands-on continuous improvement (Lean) training, a web-based learning management system, and STERIS University. In addition, we provide annual Code of Conduct training, Harassment Prevention training and other key, required training at all levels of the Company. In our manufacturing and service organizations, we provide training for employees who do not have the appropriate experience or background. This training is conducted through a combination of hands-on and module-based training. Our focus is on safety, quality and consistency in approach and outcome. As a Lean organization, we have created standard work instructions for many processes and refresher courses are offered regularly for existing employees. Where possible, we look to provide cross-training for employees looking to expand their knowledge or grow into new roles. We encourage all employees to create individual development plans and provide the support to assist in that effort.
Compensation and Benefits
Our total rewards offerings include an array of programs to support our employees' financial, physical, and mental well-being, including providing competitive salaries, variable performance pay, healthcare benefits, tuition assistance, paid time off, annual merit increases, and incentive plans based on the national norms of their employment. Total employee compensation is presented in the table below: 

(in thousands) | Fiscal 2021 | | Fiscal 2020
Wages and salaries | $ | 943,503 | | | $ | 905,972 
Social security costs | 58,695 | | | 56,019 |

Total employee costs | $ | 1,135,035 | | | $ | 1,090,887

COVID-19 Pandemic 
Early in calendar year 2020, we implemented several measures to help protect our workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic, including the following:
•Implemented work from home for those employees whose role supported it and put programs in place to support those who did not have the flexibility to work remotely.
•Implemented paid furlough at 100% salary for all employees underutilized due to the pandemic.
•In the U.S., provided pandemic-related paid-time-off for factory and field based personnel who could not work from home and supported COVID vaccination efforts by offering paid-time-off for vaccinations and arranging on-site vaccination clinics where supported by employee interest.
•Implemented additional cleaning protocols in all facilities, limited travel, and discontinued in person meetings where practical. 
•Provided additional personal protective equipment for field-based personnel supporting critical care environments.
•Regularly communicated with employees with regional and global updates.
