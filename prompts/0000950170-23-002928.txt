 Item 1. Business.
 Overview
 We are a leading fully integrated biopharmaceutical solutions organization built to accelerate customer success. We translate unique clinical, medical affairs and commercial insights into outcomes to address modern market realities.
 We bring together a talented team of professionals, who work across more than 110 countries, with a deep understanding of patient and physician behaviors and market dynamics. Together, we share insights, use the latest technologies, and apply advanced business practices to speed our customers’ delivery of important therapies to patients.
 Syneos Health supports a diverse, equitable, and inclusive culture that cares for colleagues, customers, patients, communities, and the environment.
Our operations are divided into two reportable segments, Clinical Solutions and Commercial Solutions. Our Clinical Solutions segment offers comprehensive global services for the development of diagnostics, drugs, biologics, devices, and digital therapeutics that span Phase I to IV of clinical development. This segment offers individual services including regulatory consulting, project management, protocol development, investigational site recruitment, clinical monitoring, technology-enabled patient recruitment and engagement, clinical home health services, clinical trial diversity, biometrics, and regulatory affairs, all across a comprehensive range of therapeutic areas.
Our Commercial Solutions segment provides commercialization services, including deployment solutions, communications solutions (public relations, advertising, and medical communications), and consulting services. We integrate our clinical and commercial capabilities into customized solutions by sharing knowledge, data, and insights. We believe this collaboration across the development and commercialization continuum facilitates unique insights into patient populations, therapeutic environments, product timelines, and the competitive landscape.
 Founded more than three decades ago as an academic organization dedicated to central nervous system research, we have translated that knowledge into a global organization with deep therapeutic expertise, as well as full data services and regulatory advisory and implementation support capabilities. Over the past decade, we have built our scale and capabilities to become a leading global provider of Phase I to Phase IV clinical development services, as well as a full range of commercialization and other complementary services. We were established as INC Research in 1998, and our corporate headquarters are located in Morrisville, North Carolina. INC Research Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in August 2010. We changed our name to Syneos Health, Inc. after our 2017 merger (the “Merger”) with Double Eagle Parent, Inc. (“inVentiv”), the parent company of inVentiv Health, Inc.
 

Our Market
 The market for our solutions is primarily the biopharmaceutical industry that utilizes outsourced clinical drug development and commercialization services. We believe we are well-positioned to benefit from the following market trends:
 Expected growth of clinical drug development market. Biopharmaceutical companies continue to prioritize the outsourcing of Phase I to Phase IV clinical trials to Contract Research Organizations (“CROs”).
We believe that, based on industry sources and management estimates, the Phase I – IV clinical development market for CRO services will grow at a compound average annual rate of 4% to 7% through 2024, driven by a combination of R&D budget increases and further outsourcing spend. We estimate the total addressable clinical development market to be $120 billion, of which $64 billion was outsourced to CROs in 2022.
 Trends in commercialization outsourcing. We believe that, based on industry sources and management estimates, the market for biopharmaceutical commercial outsourcing will grow at a compound average rate of approximately 4% to 7% through 2024. We believe this potential growth is supported by: (i) increased preference for digital engagement strategies, scientifically enabled representatives driving biopharma partners to use Contract Sales Organizations (“CSOs”) to leverage their infrastructure, and flexibility to scale as needed; (ii) increased expectations for data generation and data-driven insights from biopharmaceutical companies; (iii) increased demand for field facing teams that can engage in highly specialized conversations around complex scientific information associated with innovative therapies; and (iv) an evolving industry landscape illustrated by a shift to more strategic relationships, particularly where economies of scale can reduce costs.
Increasingly challenging clinical development and commercialization environment. The biopharmaceutical industry is currently facing several challenges, including: (i) margin deterioration; (ii) reimbursement and provider access hurdles; (iii) significant decline in funding, market valuations, and mergers & acquisitions (“M&A”) activity; (iv) fewer blockbuster and high profitability drugs; (v) continued pressure from generic brand exposure; and (vi) the consolidation of payers, healthcare systems, providers, and pharmacies. These challenges also make it more complicated to engage physicians and patients, making new product launches more difficult. At the same time, the industry is experiencing growing demand for specialty drugs, pressure to improve R&D productivity, the transition of the healthcare industry worldwide from a volume-based to a value-based reimbursement structure, and growing political and pricing pressures.
Globalization of clinical trials. Clinical trials have become increasingly global as biopharmaceutical companies seek to accelerate patient recruitment, particularly within protocol-eligible, treatment-naïve patient populations without co-morbidities that could skew clinical outcomes. Biopharmaceutical companies are also increasingly seeking to expand the commercial potential of their products by applying for regulatory approvals in multiple countries, including fast-growing economies that are spending more on healthcare.
Management of increasingly complex clinical trials. The biopharmaceutical industry operates in an increasingly sophisticated and highly regulated environment and has responded to the demands of novel therapeutics by adapting efficient drug development processes. Complex clinical trial design expertise has emerged as a significant competitive advantage for select CROs that have a track record of successfully navigating country-specific regulatory, clinical trial protocol, and patient enrollment barriers, including sometimes subjective, evolving clinical endpoints.


Rapid adoption of remote technology-enabled platforms. Accelerated by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we have observed a significant increase in the adoption of remote and digital solutions to facilitate continued healthcare delivery to patients and support to healthcare providers (“HCPs”) for our customers’ products. Technology and data that help power site- and patient-centric solutions have been on the rise and include risk-based and remote monitoring, home health, and virtual personal and non-personal outreach to medical facilities and clinics.
Our Business Strategy
 Our goal is to be the partner of choice to the biopharmaceutical industry by translating our unique clinical and commercial insights into superior customer outcomes. We believe our ability to strategically integrate clinical development, medical affairs, and commercial capabilities is unique, allowing for clinical insights to inform commercialization and for commercial insights to improve clinical trial design and execution. The key elements of our business strategy include:
 Transform our organization to improve customer engagement, increase innovation, and achieve operating efficiencies. We are pursuing business transformation initiatives that include enhancing customer engagement and infusing innovation and insights throughout our operations, integrating artificial intelligence and predictive analytics to drive faster data insights and patient outcomes, leveraging tools and automation to simplify processes and improve real-time visibility, optimizing our operational footprint, and streamlining the organization and outsourcing where we believe appropriate. We also seek to improve our productivity, flexibility, quality, functionality, and cost savings by investing in the development and implementation of global platforms and integration of our business processes and functions to achieve economies of scale.
Capitalize on industry trends favoring outsourcing. We believe our Clinical Solutions and Commercial Solutions segments can benefit from specific industry trends that are expected to drive attractive growth rates over the long term. Higher costs and increased complexity are driving our customers to seek efficiency and expertise through outsourcing services. We believe outsourcing both clinical development and commercialization services optimizes returns on invested R&D for biopharmaceutical companies.
Further penetrate the large pharmaceutical market. We believe one of the largest opportunities to increase our market share and improve our market position is to further penetrate large pharmaceutical companies. Large pharmaceutical companies have increasingly focused on partnering with larger outsourcing vendors that offer a full suite of service capabilities. We have invested in expanding our global scale, breadth of services, and infrastructure to build up our service capabilities for this customer sector.
 Continued penetration of the small and mid-sized (“SMID”) biopharmaceutical market. We believe there is opportunity to grow in the SMID biopharmaceutical market segment. Our 2020 acquisition of Synteract further enhanced our position for serving SMID customers, diversifying our customer base and expanding support to emerging biopharmaceutical companies. We aim to leverage our full suite of clinical and commercialization services, our Syneos One® solutions, and our therapeutic expertise and organizational alignment down to the CRA level, as well as our Trusted Process® operating model to further penetrate the SMID biopharmaceutical market.
 

Bring differentiated solutions to the market that accelerate customer outcomes. We believe we are uniquely positioned to address our customers’ evolving needs as a leading fully integrated biopharmaceutical solutions organization. We translate unique clinical, medical affairs and commercial insights into outcomes to address modern market realities. Our breadth of services enables us to provide customized solutions designed to successfully accelerate the time to market for our customers’ clinical and commercial projects. We believe sharing commercial insights during the early phases of clinical trials can lead to better informed decisions around clinical trial design and strategies. Similarly, we believe our therapeutic and clinical trial expertise can lead to improved decisions about regulatory and payer approvals, market access, reimbursement and formulary inclusion, field team development, and other steps that are critical to the commercial success of our customers.
 Strengthen our geographic footprint. We have developed a global platform with a presence in the major biopharmaceutical markets and intend to further expand our business outside of the United States (“U.S.”), targeting regions where we are underpenetrated and that offer significant growth opportunities. We have added geographic reach through both acquisitions and organic growth in Asia-Pacific, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, and Europe. We believe these regions are critical to obtaining business awards from large and mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies. Through our business transformation initiatives, we plan to progress to a more country-based business delivery model.
 Drive acceleration of commercial outsourcing with Syneos One®. We believe our Syneos One® solutions are uniquely positioned to determine the appropriate mix of clinical and commercial services to help customers optimize the development process of their assets and maximize the return on their investment. In addition, Syneos One® enables multiple selling points along the operational timeline of asset development. The need for a full suite of asset development services is particularly strong with our SMID customers in the near-term, given their need to efficiently deploy capital during the asset development process coupled with their limited internal resources. Large biopharmaceutical companies may represent a long-term opportunity if market pressures to reduce fixed-cost infrastructures further intensify. Given our strong relationships in both customer segments and our breadth of services, including our focus on medical affairs, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the needs of both customer types.
 Successfully acquire and integrate companies and continue to evaluate and pursue other strategic initiatives to augment our organic growth. As part of our ongoing business strategy to enhance our services, capabilities, and geographic presence, we regularly evaluate new opportunities for growth through strategic initiatives, including potential acquisitions, investments, dispositions, or other transformative transactions.
Our Services
 We provide services through two reportable segments: Clinical Solutions and Commercial Solutions.
Clinical Solutions
 Our extensive range of clinical solutions supports the entire clinical development process from Phase I to Phase IV and allows us to offer our customers an integrated suite of investigative site support and clinical development services. We have strengths in the complex therapeutic areas such as neuroscience and hematology/oncology, with the latter representing the largest and fastest growing therapeutic area. Our solutions can be delivered on a full-service project basis, on a functional or resource basis (see FSP 360 below), or through a hybrid approach depending on the needs of our customers. We are able to customize our services to provide support to customers within an individual clinical study, a single function, multiple functions within a single therapeutic area, or across a customer’s entire product portfolio. Our comprehensive suite of clinical development services includes the following, among others:

Real World Evidence (“RWE”) and Late Phase Services
 Our Real World, Late Phase group conducts studies to understand how a treatment, service, or method of delivering care works when applied in real world, clinical practice environments.
The market for these services is increasing as regulatory changes are encouraging the use of RWE and payers are demanding these outcomes. Customers are using RWE to supplement clinical efficacy and safety data, to build a value story, and in designing and implementing a successful commercialization strategy. RWE shows relatively low levels of outsourcing penetration and provides both clinical and commercial benefits, offering a growth opportunity for us.
We provide both consultative and operational expertise to our customers in real world data generation, from concept through core development, launch, and commercialization. This is informed by our Dynamic Assembly® approach, which allows us to expand our data access and analytic capabilities, enhancing our ability to help customers demonstrate product value. Our services include patient registries, surveillance and observational studies, patient/health outcomes research, and economic studies.
Commercial Solutions
 Our Commercial Solutions segment provides a broad suite of complementary commercialization services including deployment solutions, communications services (advertising, public relations, and medical communications), and consulting services. Additionally, these capabilities provide behavioral and patient insights used by our Clinical Solutions segment to design smarter clinical trials and to accelerate patient recruitment. Our comprehensive capabilities portfolio also allows us to provide full-service commercialization. This integrated approach allows us to maximize product or portfolio performance for customers, by sharing insights and expertise across the integrated commercial outsourcing team.
 These services are enhanced by our Kinetic offering, our modern customer engagement capability. We use an intelligent and data-enabled approach to digitally enhance our commercialization services by understanding the audiences for our customers’ products, synchronizing their experiences across multiple personal and digital channels and decoding the performance of these interactions to adapt in real-time.

 Our healthcare focused communications services offering provides advertising, public relations, interactive digital strategies, branding and identity consulting services, and medical communications and education services. These services are scalable, as we can support product commercialization both domestically and internationally. Communications services are deployed throughout a product’s existence, beginning well before commercial launch, encompassing regulatory approval and market introduction, and continuing throughout the life of a product.
Consulting Services
 Our consulting services support critical decision points during a biopharmaceutical product’s lifecycle, from licensing, to product and portfolio strategy development, to drug commercialization. These services are centered on maximizing the commercial value of a client’s product pipeline, helping clinical leaders better deploy strategic resources, improve efficiency, and enhance the effectiveness of marketing and sales activities. Our overall consulting services capabilities include the following: commercial strategy development and planning; pricing and market access; medical affairs advisory; quality management and regulatory compliance advisory; and risk and program management.
Customers
 We have a well-diversified customer base of over 900 customers, which includes many of the world’s largest biopharmaceutical companies, which we define as the top 50 biopharmaceutical companies measured by annual R&D spend, as well as numerous emerging and specialty biotechnology companies, medical device, and diagnostics companies. We are diversified across our segments, deriving 75% and 25% of our revenue during 2022 from our Clinical Solutions and Commercial Solutions segments, respectively.
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, our revenue attributable to large biopharmaceutical companies represented approximately 55% of our total revenue and revenue attributable to SMID biopharmaceutical companies represented approximately 45%. Our top five customers accounted for approximately 24% of our revenue in 2022. Additionally, we serve customers in a variety of locations throughout the world, with approximately 60% of our 2022 revenue generated from work performed in the U.S. and Canada, 25% from Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, 12% from Asia-Pacific, and 3% from Latin America. This diversification allows us to grow our business in multiple customer segments and geographies.
 Sales and Marketing
 Our global team of strategic business development professionals and support staff identifies needs, designs solutions, and promotes our services to the biopharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device industries. In addition to significant customer engagement and development experience, many of these individuals have technical and scientific backgrounds.
 Our business development organization works with our leadership team to identify, develop, and maintain key customer relationships in addition to new business development activities. Teams use an integrated, customer-focused approach to develop joint engagement plans for key accounts. For many of our largest customer relationships, dedicated strategic account management teams under our Global Client and Syneos One® groups provide account leadership to meet financial goals, align delivery with strategic goals, and promote innovation.
Competition
 We operate in several highly competitive markets. Our competitors include a variety of companies providing services to the biopharmaceutical industry, including large CROs and smaller specialty CROs, large global communications holding companies, smaller specialized communications agencies, contract sales organizations, and a wide range of consulting companies. Both of our reportable segments face distinct competitors within the markets they serve. Notwithstanding competitive factors, we believe that our deep therapeutic expertise, global reach, integrated model, and operational strengths differentiate us from our competitors across both of our segments.
Clinical Solutions
 Our Clinical Solutions segment competes primarily against other full-service CROs and services provided by in-house R&D departments of biopharmaceutical companies, universities, and teaching hospitals. Since 2018, large CROs have broadly taken share from smaller CROs through both scale and consolidation. This trend is likely to continue as trial complexity evolves, supporting the need for partnership and utilization of diverse capability sets. Although the CRO industry has experienced increased consolidation in the past several years, the landscape remains fragmented. We generally compete based on the following factors:

•experience within specific therapeutic areas•the quality and availability of staff and services•the range of services provided•the ability to recruit principal investigators and patients into studies expeditiously•the ability to organize and manage large-scale, global clinical trials•an international presence with strategically located facilities | •medical database management capabilities•the ability to deploy and integrate IT systems to improve the efficiency of contract research•experience with a particular customer•the ability to form strategic partnerships•speed to completion•financial strength and stability•price•overall value

Commercial Solutions
 Our Commercial Solutions segment competes primarily against the in-house sales and marketing departments of biopharmaceutical companies, other contract pharmaceutical sales and service organizations, communications holding companies and specialized agencies, and consulting firms. We generally compete based on the following factors:

•experience within the specific therapeutic area•quality of the staff and services•creativity of the proposed solution•perceived “chemistry” with the staff to be deployed | •previous experience with a particular customer•price•overall value

Government Regulation
 The biopharmaceutical industry is subject to a high degree of governmental regulation in both domestic and international markets. Regardless of the country or region in which approval is being sought, before a marketing application for a drug is ready for submission to regulatory authorities, the candidate drug must undergo rigorous testing in pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. The clinical trial process must be conducted in accordance with the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act in the U.S. and similar laws and regulations in the relevant foreign jurisdictions (e.g., the European Union Clinical Trials Regulation). These laws and regulations require the candidate drug to be tested and studied in certain ways prior to submission for approval.
Regulation of Our Clinical Solutions Segment
 In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) regulates the conduct of clinical trials of drug products in human subjects, and the form and content of regulatory applications. The FDA also regulates the development, approval, manufacture, safety, labeling, storage, record keeping, import, export, distribution, advertising, sale, and marketing of drug products. The FDA has similar authority and similar requirements with respect to the clinical testing of biological products and medical devices. In the European Union (“EU”) and other jurisdictions where our customers intend to apply for marketing authorization (of drug products) or seek certification (of medical devices), similar laws and regulations apply. Within the EU, these requirements are enforced by the EMA and competent authorities of the EU member states. Additional national requirements may vary slightly from one member state to another. In Canada, clinical trials are regulated by the Health Products Food Branch of Health Canada as well as provincial regulations. Similar requirements also apply in other jurisdictions, including Australia, Japan, and other Asia-Pacific countries, where we operate or where our customers intend to apply for marketing authorization. Sponsors of clinical trials also follow the International Council on Harmonisation (“ICH”) guidelines on Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”), which are enforced by the FDA and other comparable regulatory authorities, and may be amended from time to time.
Our services are subject to various regulatory requirements designed to ensure the quality and integrity of the clinical trial process. In the U.S., we must perform our clinical development services in compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations, including GCP and Good Pharmacovigilance Practice, which govern, among other things, the design, conduct, performance, monitoring, auditing, recording, analysis, and reporting of clinical trials. Before a human clinical trial may begin, the manufacturer or sponsor of the investigational drug or biologic must file an investigational new drug application (“IND”) with the FDA, which contains, among other things, the results of pre-clinical tests, manufacturing information, and other analytical data. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during asset development. Each clinical trial conducted in the U.S. must be conducted pursuant to, and in accordance with, an effective IND. In addition, under GCP regulations, each human clinical trial we conduct is subject to the oversight of an independent institutional review board (“IRB”) which is an independent committee that has the regulatory authority to review, approve and monitor a clinical trial. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the study subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
 Clinical trials conducted outside the U.S. are subject to the laws and regulations of the country where the trials are conducted. These laws and regulations might not be similar to the laws and regulations administered by the FDA and other laws and regulations regarding the protection of patient safety and privacy and the control of study pharmaceuticals, medical devices or other study materials. Studies conducted outside the U.S. can also be subject to regulation by the FDA if the studies are conducted pursuant to an IND, or in the case of a medical device, an investigational device exemption. It is the responsibility of the study sponsor or the parties conducting the studies to ensure that all applicable legal and regulatory requirements are fulfilled.
 To comply with GCP and other regulations, we must, among other things:
 •comply with specific requirements governing the selection of qualified principal investigators and clinical research sites;
 •obtain specific written commitments from principal investigators;
 •obtain review, approval, and supervision of the clinical trials by an IRB or ethics committee;
 •obtain favorable opinion from regulatory agencies to commence a clinical trial;
 

•verify that appropriate patient informed consents are obtained before the patient participates in a clinical trial;
 •ensure that adverse drug reactions resulting from the administration of a drug or biologic during a clinical trial are medically evaluated and reported in a timely manner;
 •monitor the validity and accuracy of data;
 •monitor drug, biologic or device accountability at clinical research sites; and
 •verify that principal investigators and study staff maintain records and reports and permit appropriate governmental authorities access to data for review.
 Similar regulations and guidelines exist in various states and in other countries. In the EU, similarly to the U.S., the various phases of non-clinical and clinical research are subject to significant regulatory controls. Clinical trials of medicinal products (drugs, biologics, and medical devices) that support or are intended to support applications for research or marketing authorization must be conducted in accordance with applicable EU and national regulations and the ICH guidelines on GCP, which are ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. If the sponsor of a clinical trial is not established within the EU, it must appoint an EU entity to act as its legal representative for clinical trials conducted in the EU. Non-clinical studies must be conducted in accordance with the principles of good laboratory practice (“GLP”) as set forth in EU Directive 2004/10/EC.
Non-clinical studies are performed to demonstrate the health or environmental safety of new chemical or biological substances. In particular, non-clinical studies, both in vitro and in vivo, must be planned, performed, monitored, recorded, reported, and archived in accordance with the GLP principles, which define a set of rules and criteria for a quality system for the organizational process and the conditions for non-clinical studies. These GLP standards reflect the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development requirements.
 The regulatory landscape related to clinical trials in the EU has been subject to recent changes. The EU Clinical Trials Regulation (“CTR”), which was adopted in April 2014 and repeals the EU Clinical Trials Directive, became applicable on January 31, 2022. Unlike directives, the CTR is directly applicable in all EU member states, as well as Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland, without the need for member states to further implement it into national law. The CTR notably harmonizes the assessment and supervision processes for clinical trials throughout the EU via a Clinical Trials Information System, which contains a centralized EU portal and database.
The UK left the EU on January 31, 2020, following which existing EU medicinal product legislation continued to apply in the UK during the transition period under the terms of the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement. As of January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”) is the UK’s standalone medicines and medical devices regulator. EU laws that have been transposed into UK law through secondary legislation continue to be applicable as “retained EU law.” However, new legislation such as the EU CTR is not applicable. The UK government has passed a new Medicines and Medical Devices Act 2021, which introduces delegated powers in favor of the Secretary of State or an ‘appropriate authority’ to amend or supplement existing regulations in the area of medicinal products and medical devices. This allows new rules to be introduced in the future by way of secondary legislation, which aims to allow flexibility in addressing regulatory gaps and future changes in the fields of human medicines, clinical trials, and medical devices.


We may be subject to regulatory action if we fail to comply with applicable rules and regulations. Failure to comply with certain regulations can also result in the termination of ongoing research and disqualification of data collected during the clinical trials. For example, violations of GCP could result, depending on the nature of the violation and the type of product involved, in the issuance of a warning letter, suspension or termination of a clinical study, refusal of the FDA or other comparable regulatory authorities to approve clinical trial or marketing applications or withdrawal of such applications, injunction, seizure of investigational products, civil penalties, criminal prosecutions, or debarment from assisting in the submission of new drug applications. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business – If we fail to perform our services in accordance with contractual requirements, regulatory requirements, and ethical considerations, we could be subject to significant costs, liability, or regulatory enforcement actions, and our reputation could be harmed.”
 We monitor our clinical trials to test for compliance with applicable laws and regulations in the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. We have adopted standard operating procedures that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements and serve as a mechanism for controlling and enhancing the quality of our clinical trials. In the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions where we operate, our procedures were developed to ensure compliance with GCP and associated guidelines.
 In addition to its comprehensive regulation of safety in the workplace, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for healthcare employers whose workers might be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as HIV and the hepatitis virus. Furthermore, certain employees might have to receive initial and periodic training to ensure compliance with applicable hazardous materials regulations and health and safety guidelines. We are subject to similar regulations in Canada and Spain.
 Regulation of Our Commercial Solutions Segment
 The safety of medicines continues to be monitored after drug product approvals and throughout their use in healthcare practice. Post-marketing safety surveillance is therefore also subject to FDA regulations as well as the EU pharmacovigilance legislation and other countries’ regulations.
 In addition, our field personnel are subject to all laws, rules and regulations governing the promotion of pharmaceutical products in the U.S. and in every other country where such personnel perform work. In particular, these rules and regulations include limitations on the indications for which a product may be promoted and on promotional spending. Additionally, these laws, rules and regulations govern the manner in which the product may be promoted, and the scientific exchange of information related to the product. Violations of these rules may leave us at risk of direct regulatory enforcement action and/or cause us to be in breach of contract with our customers.
 Some of our field personnel handle and distribute samples of pharmaceutical products. In the U.S., the handling and distribution of prescription drug product samples are subject to regulation under the Prescription Drug Marketing Act and other applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations and other countries may have similar laws or regulations. These laws and regulations regulate the distribution of drug samples by mandating procedures for storage and record-keeping requirements for drug samples and ban the purchase or sale of drug samples. Further, we must comply with the requirements of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, which regulates the distribution, record-keeping, handling, security, and disposal of controlled substances.
 

Our communications offerings are subject to all regulatory risks applicable to similar communications businesses as well as risks that relate specifically to the provision of these services to the biopharmaceutical industry. Such regulatory risks include enforcement by the FDA and the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S., Health Canada, the Department of Health in the UK, competent authorities of the EU member states, as well as state agencies and other foreign regulators enforcing laws relating to product advertising, false advertising, and unfair and deceptive trade practices. In addition to enforcement actions initiated by government agencies, there has been an increasing tendency in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions among biopharmaceutical companies to resort to the courts and industry and self-regulatory bodies to challenge comparative prescription drug advertising on the grounds that the advertising is false and deceptive. There continues to be an expansion of specific rules, prohibitions, media restrictions, labeling disclosures, and warning requirements with respect to the advertising for certain products.
 Data Protection Regulation
 We are subject to data protection laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate that address the privacy, security, and other processing of personal information. These laws and regulations govern the collection, use, handling, and disclosure of health-related and other personal information and require that we adopt and maintain reasonable and appropriate security measures that are designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the information. These laws and regulations also typically require the adoption and maintenance of procedures that facilitate the exercise of an individual’s rights with respect to the information about them. Certain of these laws may also contain requirements relating to the location of the personal information, or the transfer of personal information from one country or region to other countries. Examples of data protection laws and regulations to which we may be subject include Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (“EU GDPR”), the UK General Data Protection Regulation and Data Protection Act 2018 (the “UK GDPR” and, together with the EU GDPR, “GDPR”), and the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”). We are also subject to evolving EU and UK privacy laws on cookies, tracking technologies, and e-marketing. For additional information regarding these laws and regulations and their potential impacts on our business, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business – Current and proposed laws and regulations regarding the protection of personal data could result in increased risks of liability or increased cost to us or could limit our service offerings.”
Intellectual Property
 We develop and use a number of proprietary methodologies, analytics, systems, technologies, and other intellectual property in the conduct of our business. We rely upon a combination of confidentiality policies, nondisclosure agreements, and other contractual arrangements to protect our trade secrets, and patent, copyright, and trademark laws to protect other intellectual property rights. We have obtained or applied for patents, trademarks, and copyright protection in the U.S. and in a number of foreign countries. Our material trademarks include Trusted Process®, PlanActivation®, QuickStart®, ProgramAccelerate®, QualityFinish®, Shortening the distance from lab to life®, Syneos One®, Dynamic Assembly®, KineticTM, Syneos Health®, and other corporate emblems. Although the duration of our intellectual property rights varies from country to country, trademarks generally may be renewed indefinitely so long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained, and so long as they have not been found to have become generic. Although we believe that the ownership of trademarks is an important factor in our business and that our success does depend in part on the ownership thereof, we rely primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence, and marketing abilities of our employees. We do not have any material patents, licenses, franchises, or concessions.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2022, we had 29,395 employees. Of these, 28,768 employees were regular and 627 were temporary. An additional 416 contingent workers provided services for us.
 
Our Culture and Values. Our culture remains the cornerstone of all our human capital programs. Our shared purpose, Shortening the distance from lab to life®, aligns our employees and the customers we serve. This environment is fueled by a belief in caring for our collective well-being, which we refer to as Total Self. This belief enables employees to be their authentic selves at work, fostering a diverse, equitable, and inclusive culture where employees are empowered.
 
Safety and Health. The safety, health, and welfare of our employees are paramount to us. Our global Health and Safety team, with regional and operational expertise, provides for the health and safety of our employees, regardless of where they work or what they do. To support our Health and Safety professionals, we have selected and are implementing a software toolset to support our health and safety efforts. This newly organized team and new toolsets will enable our Health and Safety program to be metrics based with targeted improvements, both as the regulatory environment changes and year over year.
 
We have also activated our Business Continuity and Crisis Response team to help cultivate the safety of our employees in conflict zones across the world, particularly in Ukraine. This team began its work in December of 2021 and was fully prepared to offer employees support in an effort to promote safety for themselves and their families. These efforts include financial and relocation assistance, alternative working arrangements, information sharing from our intelligence partners (such as near real time border crossing wait times and procedures), and direct access to the Business Continuity and Crisis Response team to ensure employees’ needs are met to the best of our ability. We continue to provide this support to ensure our employees have the highest level of care that we can provide as an organization.

Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (“DE&I”). We strive to lead our industry in our DE&I efforts both internally and externally. We believe that addressing complex healthcare challenges requires contributions from diverse viewpoints and an inclusive, equitable space where our employees can achieve their highest potential. We strive to foster a work environment that includes and embraces racial, ethnic, and gender diversity and other individual differences. Our policies prohibit unlawful discrimination based on race, color, creed, gender, religion, marital status, age, national origin or ancestry, genetic information, physical or mental disability, medical condition, sexual orientation, gender expression or identity, or any other characteristic protected by applicable law. The emphasis placed on DE&I by us and by our Board of Directors (“Board”) is demonstrated by the inclusion of DE&I updates and metrics in the materials for each regular meeting of the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board. In 2022, we also created an internal Diversity Action Collab, a peer-to-peer knowledge-sharing forum led by the Chief Scientific Officer, and an external DE&I Advisory Council where we provide our customers with actionable insights and top-tier expertise to navigate complex regulatory guidelines and mandates, and achieve corporate, healthcare, and other business initiatives.
 As of December 31, 2022, 68% of our total workforce, 66% of our global new hires, and 57% of our global management roles at the Director level and above identify as women. As of December 31, 2022, 34% of our U.S. workforce, 38% of our U.S. new hires, and 22% of our U.S. management roles at the Director level and above identified as part of a traditionally underrepresented racial or ethnic group. Our DE&I strategy is managed by our DE&I Council, which oversees and strategically plans for diversity and inclusion within our organization under three pillars of focus: People, Customer, and Community.
 

Throughout 2022, we grew our existing Employee Resource Group (“ERGs”) ecosystem across the globe to eight ERGs and one business community: Asian, Black, ConeXion (for our LatinX community), Developing Professionals (for both early and progressing talent), LGBTQIA+, Persons with Disabilities, Women, Veterans, and RISE (Realizing Inclusivity & Success through Inclusivity) within our commercial business. These ERGs further honor our equitable and inclusive Total Self environment by building, supporting, and creating visibility and engagement opportunities for our internal communities.
 
We maintain a zero-tolerance policy on discrimination and harassment and have several programs under which employees can report incidents in good faith confidentially or anonymously, and without fear of reprisal.
 
Recruitment, Retention and Development. The primary ways we recruit and retain employees are by (1) providing compensation and benefits that are competitive in our industry and in local labor markets, (2) designing our leadership and development programs to support our culture and values while preparing our people for the future, and (3) maintaining an effective service delivery model conducive to work-life balance and employee needs.
 
Our Global Talent Acquisition team leverages numerous resources including industry networks, online and social media platforms, university relations, and industry-focused career events to source talent for open positions. Candidates are thoroughly screened and evaluated against job-specific skills, experience, and education criteria. We continuously work at improving our candidate experience, which has been recognized seven times with a North American Candidate Experience Award, awarded by the Talent Board for excellence in Talent Acquisition.

In 2021, we introduced our Enabling our Talent Advantage (“ETA”) program that concentrates on increased demand for clinical resources with an ultimate focus on our talent acquisition and retention strategies. In 2022, the ETA program has resulted in a new agile talent acquisition operating model, identified opportunities for automation that elevate candidate and hiring manager experiences, and developed external talent community strategies that deliver real-time talent pools for critical in-demand skill sets. In addition, the ETA program has improved our internal mobility policy, developing feeder pools for key roles in support of our early talent strategy and developing a line manager curriculum to better and more simply equip managers to support our workforce. As an operational example of the ETA program’s impact, in the first six months of 2022, we successfully recruited, hired, and integrated approximately 500 entry level CRA’s (“CRA I’s”), dramatically expanding our site monitoring capabilities and preparedness.

We offer extensive, award-winning training programs that provide regulatory, business, foreign language, leadership, and management training and other opportunities for professional and personal development. As part of our empowered employee experience, we offer a suite of tools to assist employees to own their careers and aim to reach their highest professional potential. As an organization with services spanning clinical and commercial as well as numerous corporate functions, we encourage and enable internal mobility to support retention.
We regularly evaluate our compensation and benefit programs using external market data and feedback from our Global Talent Acquisition team and have established processes to make necessary revisions. Our Total Rewards team introduced a new global salary structure to drive consistent enterprise-wide compensation and job level practices, ensuring our compensation remains competitive in the many countries in which our employees reside.
 
Listening to our Employees. We are an agile and continuous learning organization, listening to employees at all levels – particularly at key moments that matter – and harvesting actionable insights to shape the employee experience. A key element of our listening strategy includes purposeful pulse surveys designed to check on key audiences at key moments. Overall, our listening includes our employee engagement survey and regular employee lifecycle surveys, including onboarding (following the first week and at 90 days of employment) and exit surveys. Ultimately, we leverage these insights to inform and improve our employee programs and services.
