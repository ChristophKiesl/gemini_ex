Item 1. Business
Overview
 Waitr Holdings Inc. (together with its wholly owned subsidiaries, the “Company,” “Waitr,” “we,” “our” or “us”) operates an online ordering technology platform, including the Waitr and Bite Squad mobile applications (the “Platforms”), providing delivery, carryout and dine-in options, connecting restaurants, drivers and diners in cities across the United States. The Platforms are a convenient way to discover, order and receive great food and other products from local restaurants, national chains and grocery stores. Our strategy is to bring delivery, carryout and dine-in infrastructure to underserved populations of restaurants, grocery stores and diners and establish strong market presence or leadership positions in the markets in which we operate. As of December 31, 2020, we operated in small and medium sized markets across the United States, spanning more than 700 cities. 
 Our business has been built with a restaurant-first philosophy by providing differentiated and brand additive services to the restaurants on the Platforms. Restaurants benefit from the online Platforms through increased exposure to consumers for expanded business in delivery, carryout and dine-in services as well as providing convenient payment solutions. For diners, Waitr optimizes the journey from restaurant and food discovery through delivery, while providing a diverse restaurant selection and a great customer experience. The intuitive, easy-to-use Platforms allow consumers to browse local restaurants and menus, track order and delivery status, and securely store previous orders for ease of use and convenience. During 2020, we expanded into new delivery verticals such as same-day groceries and alcohol delivery services, and also diversified our product offering beyond restaurant food delivery with the introduction of our tableside service technology for restaurants.
 We generate revenue primarily when diners place an order via online payment on one of the Platforms. We recognize revenue from diner orders when orders are completed. Our revenue consists primarily of net fees received from restaurants and net diner fees generated on these orders.

--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Business Strategy
 We have historically grown our business by increasing the number of quality restaurants available on the Platforms, which has facilitated growth in diners and orders. Leveraging best practices from the launch of prior markets, we continuously refine our processes in onboarding new restaurants, deploying adequate resources to markets, sales and ongoing business development. During 2020, we also focused our efforts on diversifying our product offering beyond restaurant food delivery with expansion into new delivery verticals. We intend to pursue the following growth strategies to grow the Platforms:
 Expansion into new markets, development of new products and services and investment in new technology
 Our long-term business strategy includes expansion into new cities and geographies, development of new product offerings and services across our marketplace and investment in new technology, all of which will continue to enhance the user experience of the Platforms.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
 
Increase sales through further penetration of existing markets
 We plan to continue marketing and actively building our brands in existing markets by improving our restaurant offerings and technology platform depth, continuing to enhance the quality of our customer service and increasing the presence in the local communities.
Pursue Strategic Acquisitions
 We intend to selectively evaluate and pursue expansion of both our core business and diversification opportunities through strategic acquisitions in both existing and new markets.
 Deliver an excellent diner experience
 We believe that by tailoring experiences on our Platforms to the nuances of local or regional markets, we can further improve the user experience and drive growth for our restaurant partners. We plan to invest in our direct sales teams and to add more restaurants and restaurant variety to the Platforms. We will continue to further refine our customer support team to provide a high-quality experience to our diners. We believe significant opportunity exists to increase existing diner spend, add new diners, and further establish our market positions.
 Leverage relationships with our restaurant partners
 We intend to utilize our existing relationships with diverse, high-quality restaurant partners to expand our presence within our current markets as well as support in the expansion into new markets. 
 Marketing
 The Platforms are an important extension of restaurant branding. Restaurants promote Waitr and Bite Squad as a feature for their diners through in-restaurant advertising collateral such as door stickers, table tents and push cards, and other promotional items. Our remaining sales and marketing initiatives are through paid digital marketing, social media strategies and local sponsorships. 
Sales
 Our sales team is constantly focused on signing restaurants across our current and target markets. By focusing our sales efforts on onboarding new restaurants and showing them the value of the Platforms, restaurants promote themselves on the Platforms to their own diner bases. This increase in diners helps to drive more sales and ultimately more orders to the Platforms. After market launch, we typically continue the sales efforts with business development managers, while also conducting sales initiatives at the regional and corporate level with key partners and larger national accounts thereby continually bolstering our restaurant base. After opening new markets, our local market and sales teams continue to work with the restaurants to increase overall order volume and ensure a high level of quality across the Platforms.
Products and Services
 Restaurant Products and Services
 Restaurant Onboarding.  We offer restaurants a streamlined onboarding process that features direct menu management and high levels of customer service from our market level management and restaurant support team. 
 Product Features.  We provide restaurants with the ability to offer promotions and tailored daily specials, optimize orders through real time analytics and manage restaurant menus. The Platforms include a dedicated mobile application for restaurants which simplifies the aggregation of restaurant order and delivery tasks onto a central in-app controller and provides flexibility to edit menus based on inventory or promotions. This is all performed through user-friendly hardware that receives orders on-site and integrates them seamlessly into existing kitchen flow. We have also begun to integrate with online ordering and point-of-sale vendors in order to further enhance our restaurant partners’ efficiency when fulfilling orders generated on our Platforms. The Platforms are also able to provide featured placement of certain restaurants within the application.
 Restaurant Support.  We also provide restaurants with a team of support representatives to ensure a high-quality restaurant experience.
 Delivery.  We provide ordering and delivery Platforms for restaurants through a network of independent contractor drivers to address the growing demand for delivery services.

Tableside Service Technology.  We recently introduced our tableside service technology offering restaurants an integrated payment solution that can help improve their safety protocols, sales and efficiency.
Diner Products and Services
 Features.  The Platforms simplify the diner ordering process to a few steps. These include setting location, specifying delivery method, immediate or future order, selecting and customizing menu items and tracking orders until completion. Diners have search capabilities to locate a certain restaurant or search by cuisine type and can easily view their favorite restaurants and past orders.
 Restaurant Selection and Customization.  The restaurants on the Platforms offer diners a wide array of cuisine types, both from local independent restaurants and national chain restaurants. Our goal is to create a personalized experience for diners, where they can tailor their orders to several layers of customization: getting what they want, when they want it.
  Customer Support.  We also provide diners with a team of customer support representatives to ensure a high-quality diner experience.
 Customers
 As of December 31, 2020, we had over 20,000 restaurants on the Platforms and served approximately 1.9 million Active Diners. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, none of the restaurants on the Platforms or Active Diners accounted for 1% or more of the Company’s revenues. 
Competition
 Our primary competition consists of other online ordering and delivery service providers, who compete with us for restaurants, diners and delivery drivers within the markets we serve. Over the last few years, we have experienced increased competition from national delivery service providers. 
 Additionally, we face competition from traditional offline options used by the vast majority of restaurants in our markets, including paper menus, telephone orders for delivery or takeout, and local advertising placed by restaurants. Management believes that the Company competes favorably with the traditional ordering process by aggregating restaurant and menu information on the Platforms, making it more convenient for diners to locate restaurants by proximity, cuisine type and/or price point, and efficiently placing a customized order or a repeat order for delivery or carryout, without ever having to interact directly with the restaurant. Our tableside service technology which was introduced in certain markets in October 2020 allows diners to access a restaurant’s menu from their table, place an order, and facilitate contactless payment on the Platforms. For restaurants, we offer a more targeted marketing opportunity than traditional, offline, local advertising channels, providing exposure to our network of hungry diners, who routinely access our Platforms.
 Impact of COVID-19 on our Business
 In December 2019, an outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) began in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. The potential impacts and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and on the Company’s business, in particular, are uncertain and may be difficult to assess or predict at this time. 
 In March 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic became more widespread in the United States, we launched several initiatives to help protect and support our restaurant partners, diners, independent contractor drivers and our employees during these unprecedented times. Waitr has thus far been able to operate effectively during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, the pandemic could impact the demand for the Company’s services. In addition, a prolonged recession or additional financial market corrections resulting from the spread of COVID-19, including an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases, could adversely affect demand for the Company’s services. To the extent that the COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacts the Company’s business, results of operations, liquidity or financial condition, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in the Risk Factors in this Form 10-K. We continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 global outbreak, although there remains significant uncertainty related to the public health and the global economic situation. 
 Seasonality and Holidays
 Our business tends to follow restaurant closure and diner behavior patterns. In many of our markets, we have historically experienced variations in order frequency as a result of weather patterns, university summer breaks and other vacation periods. In

addition, most restaurants tend to close on certain major holidays, including Thanksgiving and Christmas Eve Day, in our key markets. Further, diner activity may be impacted by unusually cold, rainy, or warm weather. Cold weather and rain typically drive increases in order volume, while unusually warm or sunny weather typically drives decreases in orders. Furthermore, snowstorms, hurricanes and tropical storms have adverse effects on order volume, particularly if they cause property damage or utility interruptions to our restaurant partners. Consequently, our results between quarters, or between periods may vary as a result of prolonged periods of unusually cold, warm, inclement, or otherwise unexpected weather and the timing of certain holidays. As shown in our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020, the macroeconomic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have had an impact on our typical seasonality trends and could impact future periods.
Technology and Intellectual Property
 Our Platforms use scalable software to provide a consistent and robust user experience as user adoption increases. The internally developed Platforms are purpose-built to streamline online ordering and fulfillment for consumers and restaurants. The Platforms are 100% hosted in the cloud. Cloud hosting assists us with addressing potential capacity constraints that we may face as we grow our core applications and provide a level of redundancy, fault tolerance and cost effectiveness. 
 We protect our intellectual property through a combination of trademarks, trade dress, domain name registrations, trade secrets, patents, and copyrights.
 As of December 31, 2020, we had registered trademarks covering “Waitr” and “Bite Squad” and the stylistic designs associated with our brands. We have also filed other trademark applications in the United States and may pursue additional trademark registrations to the extent management believes it will benefit the business and be cost effective.
 As of December 31, 2020, we filed two patent applications in the United States, which seek to cover proprietary inventions relating to our products and services. We may pursue further patents to the extent that management believes it will benefit Waitr’s business and be cost effective.
 We hold several registrations to domain names relating to our business, including waitrapp.com, bitesquad.com, and others.
 Our employees are required to maintain proprietary and non-public information confidential and to assign any and all inventions or other intellectual property relating to the business to Waitr. The policies and applicable terms of use of the Platforms also contain confidentiality and assignment of intellectual property provisions and restrict the distribution or use of the Company’s technology in unauthorized manners. Additionally, we enter into confidentiality agreements with consultants and contractors who are given access to confidential information about the Company.
 Government Regulation
  Our industry and business model are relatively new, have been evolving, and are subject to rapid changes in technology and the adoption and application of regulation.  We are subject to a variety of law, regulations, and local ordinances in the jurisdictions in which we operate and they are also evolving and difficult to predict. These include laws and regulation relating to (i) pricing and fee structures, (ii) food safety, (iii) labor and employment, (iv) acceptance of credit card payments and consumer protection, (v) website and mobile application accessibility, security, and data privacy, (vi) alcoholic beverages, (vii) background checks, (viii) taxes, and (ix) other regulated matters. These laws, regulations, and ordinances can be subject to interpretation and can lack certainty and specificity relative to our business. In many cases, it may be unclear whether certain of these regulatory schemes apply to our business and how best to navigate potential differing standards, interpretations, and even conflicts among the different governmental authorities who adopt and enforce such regulation. 
 Recent political, financial, and world events may have the effect of increasing scrutiny on technology companies and on gig economy enterprises reliant on an independent contractor workforce. Governmental entities may enact new measures that are adverse to our business, like measures capping commissions charged to restaurant merchants that have been recently enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in several state and city jurisdictions. While most of such limits have been implemented to be a temporary response to the pandemic, it is unclear whether they could be implemented on a more permanent basis or otherwise extended in some jurisdictions. As a result, we may be forced to either increase fees to consumers, if legally permitted, reduce our margins and profitability in such jurisdictions, or cease providing services in such jurisdictions, thereby reducing our geographic footprint and expansion opportunities. We may also be compelled to expend significant resources or discontinue certain services or features which could adversely affect our business. 
 While we hope to continue to expand and make our technology platforms broadly available, these laws, regulations, and ordinances may limit our ability to expand geographically or require us to expend significant resources to modify our platforms, systems, or alter our business model in order to do so. Further, if we are unable to comply with regulation imposed upon our business, we could be subject to regulatory proceedings, fines or other penalties, along with potential civil and criminal

proceedings. Finally, such proceedings could become the focus of increased media attention or other negative impacts on our brand identity or our public relations initiatives, thereby adversely impacting our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Human Capital
 As of March 3, 2021, we had approximately 1,034 employees. We also engage contractors and consultants. None of our employees are represented by a labor union with respect to their employment with the Company. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
 Our success depends upon our ability to identify, attract and retain highly qualified management and other key operating and technology personnel. Factors that may affect our ability to attract and retain qualified employees include employee morale, our reputation, competition from other employers, and availability of qualified individuals. We consider talent management a very important factor in our ability to drive our strategic initiatives and execute our long-term growth strategy and appreciate the importance of retention, growth and development of our employees. We strive to maintain a diverse and inclusive workforce and are committed to a culture which values equality and respect. Our employees are offered competitive compensation and benefits programs, as well as opportunities for career growth and development. We are committed to a safe workplace and an ethical environment in which employees can continually develop their skills and expertise to advance their careers.
 The recruitment of qualified independent contractor drivers is an important part of our success. We provide independent contractor drivers with a streamlined onboarding process and educational opportunities that help to maximize their earnings potential. We strive to maintain a diverse network of independent contractor drivers and are committed to providing the tools and resources needed to ensure they provide exceptional customer service. 
 In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented several initiatives to help protect and support our restaurant partners, diners, independent contractor drivers and our employees, including offering no-contact delivery in select markets for certain restaurant delivery orders; offering no-contact grocery delivery in select markets; working with certain restaurant partners to waive diner delivery fees; deploying free marketing programs for certain restaurants; and providing masks, gloves and hand sanitizer to drivers. Additionally, we have allowed our employees to work remotely as appropriate, while implementing safety measures designed to protect the health of all those entering our facilities.
 Corporate History
 Waitr Incorporated began operations in 2014 in Lake Charles, Louisiana as a restaurant platform for online ordering and delivery services, and grew quickly, connecting restaurants and diners in various markets. Landcadia Holdings, Inc. was a special purpose acquisition company (“SPAC”) whose business was to effect a business combination. The November 2018 merger between Waitr Incorporated and Landcadia Holdings, Inc. (the “Landcadia Business Combination”) provided a platform for Waitr Incorporated to gain access to the U.S. public markets. Prior to the consummation of the Landcadia Business Combination, the common equity of the SPAC was traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market (the “Nasdaq”) under the symbol “LCA”. Effective November 2018, the Company’s common equity began trading on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “WTRH”. 
 In January 2019, Waitr acquired BiteSquad.com, LLC (“Bite Squad”). Founded in 2012 and based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Bite Squad operates an online ordering platform with operations similar to those of Waitr. The acquisition of Bite Squad (the “Bite Squad Merger”) expanded the Company’s scale and footprint across the United States. 
 Basis of Presentation
 
The Landcadia Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”). Under this method of accounting, Landcadia Holdings, Inc. has been treated as the “acquired” company for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the Landcadia Business Combination was treated as the equivalent of Waitr Incorporated issuing stock for the net assets of Landcadia Holdings, Inc., accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of Landcadia Holdings, Inc. were stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. Reported amounts from operations included herein prior to the Landcadia Business Combination are those of Waitr Incorporated. The shares and earnings per share available to holders of the Company’s common stock, prior to the Landcadia Business Combination, have been retroactively restated to reflect the exchange ratio established in the Landcadia Business Combination.
 
The Bite Squad Merger was considered a business combination, in accordance with GAAP, and has been accounted for using the acquisition method. Under the acquisition method of accounting, total merger consideration, acquired assets and assumed liabilities are recorded based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of merger consideration over the fair value of the assets less liabilities acquired has been recorded as goodwill. The results of operations of Bite Squad are included in our consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date, January 17, 2019.
