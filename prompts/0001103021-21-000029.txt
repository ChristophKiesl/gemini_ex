Background on Chronic Pain, Opioid Induced Constipation and Opioid Dependence
Chronic Pain
Chronic pain is often defined as any pain lasting more than 12 weeks. Whereas acute pain is a normal sensation that alerts us to possible injury, chronic pain persists – often for months or even longer. Chronic pain may arise from an initial injury, such as back sprain, or there may be an ongoing cause, such as an illness. Sometimes there is no clear cause. According to results from a National Health Interview Survey, there are over 25 million American adults experiencing daily chronic pain, with over 10 million of these experiencing severe pain on a daily basis.
Treatment Landscape for Chronic Pain
The pain market is well established, with many pharmaceutical companies marketing various formulations of existing molecules, as well as generic versions of older, non-patent protected products. In 2020, according to data from Symphony Health, the market for long-acting opioids in the U.S. totaled approximately $3 billion in annual sales with almost 12 million prescriptions dispensed. However, prescription volume of long-acting opioids declined more than 11% in 2020 compared to 2019 amidst continuing efforts to curb misuse, abuse and over use of opioids in order to address the current opioid crisis.
A number of products are competitors to BELBUCA, including BuTrans from Purdue Pharma L.P., or Purdue, a transdermal formulation of buprenorphine which also has a generic equivalent available. Other competitors are U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, ("DEA") Schedule II opioids. Approximately 73% of the prescriptions for long-acting opioids are dispensed as a generic product.
In addition to product competition, there are other factors that have impacted the market for pain products in general. Opioids continue to garner increased scrutiny based on the widespread problem of prescription drug abuse and addiction. The FDA and other government agencies have taken an increasing number of actions to address the problem of opioid abuse and addiction.
•In July 2012, the Federal Drug Administration, ("FDA"), approved a class-wide Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, program for the extended release and long-acting opioids. The class-wide REMS program consists of a REMS-compliant educational program offered by an accredited provider of continuing medical education, patient counseling materials and a medication guide. BELBUCA falls within the existing class-wide REMS program.
•In August 2014, the DEA published its final ruling in the Federal Register moving hydrocodone combination products (such as Vicodin, Lortab, Norco, etc.) from Schedule III to the more-restrictive Schedule II, as recommended by the Assistant Secretary for Health of HHS and as supported by the DEA’s own evaluation of relevant data. As a result of the ruling, hydrocodone containing products are now classified in the same category (Schedule II) as morphine and oxycodone.
•In March 2016, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, ("HHS’"), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or the CDC, issued guidelines for prescribing opioids for chronic pain. CDC developed and published the CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain to provide recommendations for the prescribing of opioid pain medication for patients 18 and older in primary care settings. Recommendations focus on the use of opioids in treating chronic pain. The guidelines advocate use of non-pharmacologic therapy and non-opioid pharmacologic therapy as first line therapy for chronic pain. When starting opioid therapy for chronic pain, clinicians are advised to prescribe immediate-release opioids instead of extended-release/long-acting, or ER/LA, opioids and to prescribe the lowest effective dosage. Clinicians were directed to reassess patient’s medication needs when considering doses of 50 morphine milligram equivalents, or MME or greater and should avoid increasing total daily doses to 90 MME or greater. A sharp reduction in prescriptions among primary care physicians and an increase among pain specialists are evidence of the shift in prescribing and in the dynamics of pain treatment.
•In June 2017, the FDA requested that Endo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. remove Opana ER (oxymorphone), from the market based on concerns that the benefits of the drug may no longer outweigh its risks. This was the first time the agency took steps to remove a currently marketed opioid pain medication from sale due to the public health consequences of abuse. The FDA’s decision was based on a review of all available post-marketing data, which demonstrated a significant shift in the route of abuse of Opana ER from nasal to injection following the product’s reformulation. 
•In September 2017, the CDC removed the MME conversion factors for buprenorphine from its online oral MME data file. And, in 2018, it included a statement in the MME data file noting “Buprenorphine doses are not expected to be associated with overdose risk in the same dose-dependent manner as doses for full agonist opioids.”
•In May 2019, the Health and Human Services Pain Management Best Practices Inter-Agency Task Force issued their Final Report on Pain Management Best Practices: Updates, Gaps, Inconsistencies, and Recommendations. The report identified that one of the barriers in pain management best practices “includes lack of coverage and reimbursement for buprenorphine as well as the lack of education and training on the proper usage of buprenorphine. There has been a lack of access to buprenorphine treatment for chronic pain.” The report then makes recommendations that third-party payers should provide coverage and reimbursement for buprenorphine treatment approaches. The report also encouraged the primary use of buprenorphine when opioids are appropriate for chronic pain. In October 2019, the HHS issued a guide for clinicians on how to appropriately reduce the dose for patients on long-term opioids. Within this guidance, it was noted that if patients on high opioid dosages are unable to taper despite worsening pain and/or function with opioids, clinicians should consider transitioning the patient to buprenorphine. The guide also noted that in addition to treating pain, buprenorphine has other properties that may be helpful, including less opioid-induced hyperalgesia and easier withdrawal than full mu-agonist opioids, and less respiratory depression than other long-acting opioids.
•For 2019, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services adopted a soft edit of 90 MME per day for patients, aligning with the 2016 CDC Guideline recommendation. A medication soft edit can be used to alert the pharmacist to a potential safety risk for the patient, but can often be overridden after consulting with the prescriber.
Opioid Induced Constipation
Opioid analgesics are an important therapeutic option for patients with moderate-to-severe chronic pain. However, a common side-effect of opioid therapy is opioid-induced constipation, or OIC, which is characterized by reduced bowel movement frequency, increased straining, sensation of incomplete evacuation, and hard stools after the initiation of opioid 
therapy. Unlike many other opioid-related adverse effects, opioid-induced constipation does not subside over time. According to the 2018 American Gastroenterological Association Institute Guideline on the Medical Management of Opioid-Induced Constipation, OIC is estimated to affect 40% to 80% of patients taking chronic opioid therapy. One-third of patients with OIC report skipping, reducing, or stopping use of opioids—despite experiencing an increase in pain—in an effort to have a bowel movement. 
Treatment Landscape for Opioid Induced Constipation
First-line treatment for opioid-induced constipation typically involves a combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions such as laxatives and increased dietary fiber. However, these approaches are associated with sub-optimal efficacy and do not address the underlying mechanism of OIC. OIC results from the specific effects of opioids on the gastrointestinal tract, differing mechanistically from other forms of constipation. Therefore, medical management of this disorder requires targeted treatment.
In 2010, Relistor injectable was approved by the FDA as the first peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonist, or PAMORA, for the treatment of OIC in adults with chronic non-cancer pain. The PAMORA mechanism of action targets the underlying cause of OIC, selectively blocking opioid actions at peripheral μ-opioid receptors, including those in the enteric nervous system, without affecting analgesia in the central nervous system ("CNS"). In 2014, Movantik was the first oral PAMORA approved for the treatment of OIC, with the oral formulation of Relistor approved in mid-2016. In March 2017, Symproic was the third PAMORA approved for the treatment of OIC in adults with chronic non-cancer pain.
In addition to the PAMORA agents, Amitiza is also approved for the treatment of OIC in adults with chronic non-cancer pain. Amitiza is a chloride channel 2 activator in the gut, which increases intestinal fluid secretion and enhances transit through the gut without altering sodium and potassium serum concentrations.
In October 2018, the American Gastroenterological Association, or AGA, issued guidelines for the medical management of OIC to help reduce practice variation and promote high quality and high-value care for patients suffering from OIC. For patients in whom traditional laxative therapy results in sub-optimal symptom control, the AGA recommends the use of PAMORAs. Of the PAMORAs, Symproic is the only OIC therapy with a strong recommendation and high quality of evidence from the AGA. Due to insufficient evidence, the AGA did not issue a recommendation regarding the use of Amitiza in OIC.
In 2020, according to data from Symphony Health, the PAMORA market totaled $338 million in annual sales. There were over 577,000 PAMORA prescriptions dispensed, a decrease of 6% from 2019, driven by the decline in opioid prescribing.
Breakthrough Cancer Pain 
Cancer patients often suffer from a variety of symptoms including pain as a result of their cancer or cancer treatment. Pain is a widely prevalent symptom in cancer patients, and an estimated 50% to 90% of those with cancer also suffer from what is referred to as breakthrough cancer pain, or BTCP. BTCP episodes have a rapid onset that peaks in three to five minutes and can last several minutes to an hour, and usually occur several times per day.
Treatment Landscape for Breakthrough Cancer Pain
BTCP can be difficult to treat due to its severity, rapid onset and the often unpredictable nature. Physicians typically treat BTCP with a variety of short-acting opioid medications, including morphine and fentanyl. The breakthrough cancer pain market has become increasingly crowded and more competitive in recent years.
Opioid Dependence
Opioid dependence is a medical diagnosis that is characterized by the inability of an individual to stop using opioids, either prescription opioids such as morphine, hydrocodone and oxycodone, or illicit opioids such as heroin, even when it is in the best interest of the individual to do so. Opioid dependence is a complex medical condition that often requires long-term treatment and care. The treatment of opioid dependence is important to reduce both the associated health and social consequences and to improve the well-being and social functioning of people affected. According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, in 2019, 1.6 million people in the U.S. had an opioid use disorder.
Treatment Landscape for Opioid Dependence
Treatment with buprenorphine reduces the typical cravings and withdrawal symptoms associated with coming off opioid prescription painkillers and heroin. This allows the individual suffering from an addiction to opioids – along with counseling and support – to work toward recovery. On average, treatment lasts several months, reflecting relatively high dropout rates, but a significant number of people remain on buprenorphine treatment chronically, with nearly one-quarter of patients still on therapy after nine months.
Our BEMA Drug Delivery Technology
Our BEMA drug delivery technology consists of a small, bi-layered erodible polymer film for application to the buccal mucosa (the lining inside the cheek). BEMA films have the capability to deliver a rapid, reliable dose of drug across the buccal mucosa for time-critical conditions such as “breakthrough” cancer pain or in situations where gastrointestinal absorption of an oral drug is not practical or reliable, or in facilitating the administration of drugs with poor oral bioavailability.
We believe that the BEMA technology permits control of two critical factors allowing for better dose-to-dose reproducibility: (i) the contact area for mucosal drug delivery, and (ii) the time the drug is in contact with that area, known as residence time. In contrast to competing transmucosal delivery systems such as 1) lozenges, 2) buccal tablets and 3) matrix-based delivery systems placed under the tongue or sprayed in the oral cavity, BEMA products are designed to:
•adhere to buccal mucosa in seconds and dissolve in minutes;
•permit absorption without patients being required to move the product around in the mouth for absorption, thus avoiding patient intervariability;
•allow for unidirectional drug flow into the mucosa as a result of a backing layer on the side of the BEMA film facing into the patient’s mouth;
•provide a reproducible delivery rate, not susceptible to varying or intermittent contact with oral membranes; and
•dissolve completely, leaving no residual product or waste and avoiding patient removal, and the possibility for diversion or disposal of partially used product.
We currently own the BEMA drug delivery technology.

BUNAVAIL | Treatment of opioid dependence | Approval: U.S. in June 2014 | Not currently marketed* 

*We discontinued all marketing of BUNAVAIL in June 2020.
The pharmaceutical industry and the therapeutic areas in which we compete are highly competitive and subject to rapid and substantial regulatory and technological changes. Developments by others may render our BEMA technology and marketed products noncompetitive or obsolete, or we may be unable to keep pace with technological developments or other market factors. Technological competition in the industry from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities, governmental entities and others diversifying into the field is intense and is expected to increase.
There have been a growing number of companies developing products utilizing various thin film drug delivery technologies. While numerous over-the-counter pharmaceutical products have been brought to market in thin film formulations, few containing prescription products have been introduced in the U.S. Among the products to receive FDA approval are BELBUCA, BUNAVAIL, and ONSOLIS (BDSI), Suboxone film (Indivior PLC) and Zuplenz (Midatech Pharma PLC). Companies in the development and manufacture of thin film technologies include LTS, Lohmann Therapie-Systeme AG, ARx, LLC and Aquestive Therapeutics, Inc. (formerly known as MonoSol Rx LLC, or Aquestive). In addition, a number of companies are developing improved versions of existing products using oral dissolving, nasal spray, aerosol, sustained release 
injection and other drug delivery technologies. We believe that potential competitors are seeking to develop and commercialize technologies for buccal, sublingual or mucosal delivery of various therapeutics or groups of therapeutics. While our information concerning these competitors and their development strategy is limited, we believe our technology can be differentiated because the BEMA technology provides for a rapid and consistent delivery, high drug bioavailability and convenient use based on how the BEMA technology adheres to the buccal membrane and dissolves. Our clinical trials across a number of BEMA products have demonstrated that the technology is an effective means of drug delivery that is well tolerated and offers convenience to patients.
Since 2016, we have utilized our own sales force, which provides us with significantly more control over commercialization efforts and greater flexibility to accommodate future strategic options. We have left commercialization of our ONSOLIS product in ex-U.S. markets with partners. As of January 2021, BELBUCA and Symproic are supported by a field force of approximately 118 sales representatives, 13 regional sales managers and two area directors.
BELBUCA (buprenorphine buccal film), CIII, for Chronic Pain
BELBUCA is a buccal film that contains buprenorphine, a Schedule III opioid, and was approved by the FDA on October 26, 2015 for use in patients with pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment for which alternative options are inadequate. BELBUCA is differentiated from other opioids and has the potential to address some of the most critical issues facing healthcare providers treating chronic pain with prescription opioids – abuse, misuse, addiction and the risk of overdose. As a Schedule III opioid, buprenorphine has less abuse and addiction potential compared to Schedule II opioids such as oxycodone, fentanyl, hydrocodone and morphine. Compared to currently marketed products and products under development, we believe that BELBUCA is differentiated based on the following features:
•strong and durable efficacy in both opioid naïve and opioid experienced patients;
•Schedule III designation by DEA, which indicates less abuse and addiction potential compared Schedule II opioids, which include oxycodone, hydrocodone and morphine;
•published studies have shown that buprenorphine’s physiologic effects reach a plateau, and this ceiling effect may result in a lower risk of overdose related respiratory depression;
•favorable tolerability with a low incidence of constipation and low discontinuation rate;
•flexible dosing options with seven available strengths; and
•buccal administration to optimize buprenorphine delivery.
Because of the safety, tolerability and efficacy benefits associated with buprenorphine, we believe that BELBUCA should be the first-line long-acting opioid for patients with pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment for which alternative treatments, such as non-opioids or immediate release opioids, are inadequate.
Additionally, we recently completed a Phase I randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, 6-period, placebo-controlled, crossover study to compare the effects of BELBUCA and oral oxycodone hydrochloride (a full μ-opioid receptor agonist) on respiratory drive, as measured by the ventilatory response to hypercapnia (VRH) in healthy recreational opioid users. The Phase I study demonstrated that:
•BELBUCA did not reduce respiratory drive at any dose (300, 600, or 900 mcg);
•oxycodone resulted in a significant dose-dependent decrease in respiratory drive; 
•significant increases in tidal volume were observed for BELBUCA at all doses relative to oxycodone 60mg;
•pupil diameter appeared to decrease with both BELBUCA and oxycodone; however maximum decrease from predose was observed 2 hours after administration of oxycodone 60 mg;
•blood plasma levels were similar among all BELBUCA doses and both oxycodone doses; and
•single doses of BELBUCA and single oral doses of 30 mg and 60 mg of oxycodone were generally safe and well tolerated.
To conclude, this first study comparing the effects of BELBUCA vs. a CII full mu-opioid agonist on respiratory drive confirms the better respiratory safety of BELBUCA over oxycodone hydrochloride:
•BELBUCA exhibited no impact on respiratory drive at any dose relative to placebo; and
•oxycodone demonstrated a dose-dependent decrease in respiratory drive.
The results of this study support, validate, and provide clinically-meaningful data beyond previous studies showing buprenorphine's ceiling effect on respiratory drive.
The primary results were presented at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Pain Medicine (AAPM) in National Harbor, MD, February 26 to March 1, 2020; additionally, the secondary outcomes were presented at PAINWeek 2020. Beyond nine abstracts which were submitted, accepted and presented at scientific congresses in 2020, four manuscripts were published in 2020 in key scientific journals.
We believe that there are long-term growth opportunities for BELBUCA and we focus our commercial efforts primarily on BELBUCA. 
Our sales force is focused on current BELBUCA prescribers and clinicians we believe have the greatest opportunity to be adopters of BELBUCA, such as high prescribers of long-acting opioids, BuTrans/buprenorphine transdermal and/or HCPs who prescribe short acting opioids around-the-clock for patients with chronic pain. In parallel, we are heavily focused on increasing market access for BELBUCA. As of January 2021, BELBUCA had formulary coverage for more than 90% of commercial lives. Approval rates within the commercial channel in 2020 were approximately 90%. BELBUCA also continued to have favorable approval rates of approximately 90% in Medicare Part D plans for the year.
In 2020, BELBUCA continued to have strong coverage with over 100 million lives having preferred access and around 250 million lives having access to BELBUCA across all channels . BELBUCA total prescriptions in 2020, according to Symphony Health, totaled over 431,000, an increase of 30% over 2019. BELBUCA's share of total buprenorphine prescriptions (products for the treatment of chronic pain only) for 2020 totaled 44% compared to 38% for the prior year, exiting 2020 with a 46% share in December 2020. In addition to a steady increase in BELBUCA prescription volume through 2020, there was also an increase in the use of higher doses of BELBUCA as healthcare providers continued to gain comfort titrating patients to higher optimal doses. In 2020, 47% of BELBUCA prescriptions were for doses of 450 mcg or greater, compared to 41% in 2019. Therefore, the weighted average price per prescription continued to increase in 2020.
Symproic (naldemedine), for Opioid Induced Constipation
Symproic was approved by the FDA on March 23, 2017 for the treatment of OIC in adult patients with chronic non-cancer pain, including patients with chronic pain related to prior cancer or its treatment who do not require frequent (e.g., weekly) opioid dosage escalation. Compared to currently marketed products and products under development, we believe that Symproic is differentiated based on the following features:
•strong and durable efficacy observed in randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trials of 12 week and 52 week duration in OIC patients;
•OIC relief that was more frequent, more complete, with less straining than patients taking placebo;
•recommended by the American Gastroenterological Association for patients with laxative refractory OIC;
•adverse event profile comparable to placebo, with low rates of abdominal pain observed across the phase III program; and
•the only prescription OIC medication with the convenience of once daily dosing, with only a tablet strength, and that can be taken with or without food and with or without laxatives.
Because of the durable efficacy, tolerability and convenience benefits, we believe that Symproic is a best-in-class PAMORA that reliably provides durable relief of OIC, which frees both the patient and the healthcare provider to focus on treating the patient’s chronic pain.
On April 4, 2019, we entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with Shionogi to commercialize Symproic in the U.S. and Puerto Rico for the treatment of OIC in adults with chronic non-cancer pain.
Symproic is a strong complementary product to BELBUCA, as patients requiring a PAMORA are by definition taking an opioid. Therefore, our sales force remains focused on high prescribers of long-acting opioids, BuTrans/buprenorphine transdermal and/or HCPs who prescribe short-acting opioids around-the-clock for patients with chronic pain.
In 2020, we also focused on increasing market access for Symproic. As of January 2021, Symproic had formulary coverage for over 90% of commercial lives. Approval rates within the commercial channel remained favorable throughout 2020 at about 85% and Medicare approval rates were above 70%.
In 2020, Symproic had approximately 100 million lives across the country with preferred access. Symproic total prescriptions in 2020, according to Symphony Health, totaled over 71,000, an increase of 12% over 2019. Symproic share of PAMORA prescriptions in 2020 totaled 12.4% versus 10.4% for the prior year, exiting 2020 with a 13.4% share in December.
ONSOLIS (fentanyl buccal soluble film) for Breakthrough Cancer Pain
In July 2009, ONSOLIS was approved for the management of breakthrough pain in cancer patients 18 years of age and older who are already receiving and who are tolerant to opioid therapy for their underlying persistent cancer pain. ONSOLIS is indicated for the treatment of BTCP. ONSOLIS provides significant reduction in pain for patients suffering from BTCP in a convenient formulation with a range of doses to allow patients to titrate to an adequate level of pain control. We currently license ONSOLIS to TTY Biopharm Co., Ltd., or TTY, which markets the product as PAINKYL in Taiwan, and to Mylan N.V., which markets the product as BREAKYL in Europe.
BUNAVAIL(buprenorphine and naloxone buccal film), CIII, for Opioid Dependence
In June 2014, BUNAVAIL was approved by the FDA for the maintenance treatment of opioid dependence as part of a complete treatment plan to include counseling and psychosocial support, and on November 3, 2014, we announced the availability of BUNAVAIL in the U.S. BUNAVAIL provides an alternative treatment utilizing the advanced BEMA drug delivery technology. BUNAVAIL provides the highest bioavailability of any buprenorphine-containing product for opioid dependence, allowing for effective treatment with half the dose compared to Suboxone film.
As noted above, in January 2017 with the reacquisition of BELBUCA, we transitioned our primary commercial emphasis from BUNAVAIL to BELBUCA; and with the licensing of Symproic in April 2019, our commercial efforts shifted to the continued growth of BELBUCA and Symproic. In March 2020, we announced that we the discontinuation of marketing for BUNAVAIL.
Additional Overview Information
From our inception through December 31, 2020, we have recorded accumulated losses totaling approximately $340.9 million. Our historical operating losses have resulted principally from our prior research and development activities, including clinical trial activities for our products, sales, and general and administrative expenses. Ultimately, if we secure additional approvals from the FDA and other regulatory bodies throughout the world for other products that we may acquire or in-license in the future, our goal will be to augment our current sources of revenue and, as applicable, with sales of such products or royalties from such sales, on which we may pay royalties or other fees to our licensors and/or third-party collaborators as applicable.
We intend to materially finance our commercialization and distribution efforts and our working capital needs primarily through:
•commercializing our approved products such as BELBUCA and Symproic;
•partnering with other pharmaceutical companies to assist in the distribution and commercialization of our products, for which we could expect to receive an upfront payment, milestones and/or royalty payments; and
•securing proceeds from public and private financings and other potential strategic transactions.
We have based our estimates of market size estimates, peak annual sales projections and similar matters described below and elsewhere in this Report on our market research, third party reports and publicly available information which we consider reliable. However, readers are advised our projected sales and similar metrics regarding BELBUCA and Symproic are merely estimates and subject to many factors, many of which may be beyond our control, which will likely cause us to revise such estimates. Readers are also advised that our projected sales figures do not consider the royalties and other payments we will need to make to our licensors and strategic partners. Our estimates are based upon our management’s reasonable judgments given the information available and their previous experiences, although such estimates may not prove to be accurate.
Key Collaborative, Supply and Manufacturing Agreements
We are and have been a party to collaborative agreements with corporate partners, contractors, universities and government agencies. Our collaboration arrangements are intended to provide us with access to greater resources and scientific expertise in addition to our in-house capabilities. We also have supply arrangements with several of the key component producers of our delivery technology and we rely on third-party manufacturers and packagers to produce commercial product. Our collaborative, supply and manufacturing agreements include:
•ARx. Effective January 6, 2017, we assumed Endo’s agreement with ARx to supply BELBUCA laminate (bulk product). This agreement automatically renews for successive terms of one year each and currently covers minimum annual commitments for supply of bulk product through 2023.
•Sharp. Effective January 6, 2017, we assumed Endo’s agreement with Sharp which covers annual commitments for supply of packaged BELBUCA finished product through 2022.
•Tapemark. Effective January 6, 2017, we assumed Endo’s agreement with The Tapemark Company, or Tapemark, to convert the BELBUCA laminate (bulk product) into individual dosage units which were then transferred to Sharp for secondary packaging and supply of BELBUCA finished product. Tapemark continued to provide such services for BELBUCA through 1st quarter of 2018 as we transitioned the converting and primary packaging operations for BELBUCA over to an alternate packaging site in 2018. Tapemark is qualified to conduct converting, primary and finished goods packaging and release testing.
•Shionogi. Effective April 4, 2019, we entered into an agreement with Shionogi, Inc. pursuant to which Shionogi acts as a supplier of Symproic finished product. Our supply agreement with Shionogi runs until April 2021 and can be extended by written amendment up to two consecutive 6-month periods. In addition, we also entered into an agreement with UPM Pharmaceuticals (effective March 5, 2020 for a term of 5 years) and with Cardinal Health Packaging Solutions (effective July 28, 2020 for a term of 2 years with 1-year renewable periods) for purposes of utilizing their contract manufacturing and packaging services, respectively, for Symproic production. 
Relationship with CDC IV, LLC
On July 14, 2005, we entered into a Clinical Development and License Agreement, or CDLA, with the predecessor of CDC IV, LLC, or CDC IV, which provided funds to us for the development of ONSOLIS. Under the CDLA, as amended, we pay CDC IV a mid-single digit royalty, which shall not be less than $375,000 per quarter, on sales of ONSOLIS. The CDLA royalty term ends upon the latter of expiration of the patent for ONSOLIS or generic entry into any particular country, or the CDLA is terminated. We and CDC IV are also party to a Royalty Purchase and Amendment Agreement, or the RPAA, pursuant to which we pay CDC IV a 1% royalty on sales of BELBUCA. The RPAA royalty term shall terminate upon the earlier of (i) such time at which annual net sales of BUNAVAIL or BELBUCA equal less than $7.5 million in any calendar year following the third (3rd) anniversary of initial launch of the product and CDC IV receives $18,750 in three (3) consecutive quarters as payment for CDC IV’s 1% royalty during such calendar year or (ii) upon the last commercial sale of BELBUCA anywhere in the world.
Licenses, Intellectual Property and Proprietary Information
Our intellectual property strategy is intended to maximize protection of our proprietary technologies and know-how and to further expand targeted opportunities by extension of our patents, trademarks, license agreements and trade secrets portfolio. In addition, an element of our strategic focus provides for varying specific royalty or other payment obligations by our commercial partners as our applicable intellectual property portfolio changes or business activity reaches certain thresholds.
However, patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical organizations are uncertain and involve complex legal and technical issues. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the breadth of claims in patent cases which results in varied degrees of protection. While we believe that our intellectual property position is sound, it may be that our pending patent applications will not be granted or that our awarded claims may be too narrow to protect the products against competitors. It is also possible that our intellectual property positions will be challenged or that patents issued to others prior to our patent issuance may preclude us from commercializing our products. It is also possible that other parties could have or could obtain patent rights which may cover or block our products or otherwise dominate our patent position.
BEMA Technology
The drug delivery technology space is congested, although we do not believe that our BEMA products conflict with, are dominated by, or infringe any external patents and we do not believe that we require licenses under external patents for our BEMA based products in the U.S. It is possible, however, that a court of law in the U.S. or elsewhere might determine otherwise. If a court were to determine that we were infringing other patents and that those patents were valid, we might be required to seek one or more licenses to commercialize our products or technologies and we may be unable to obtain such licenses from the patent holders. If we were unable to obtain a license, or if the terms of the license were onerous, there may be a material adverse effect upon our business plan to commercialize these products.
On March 1, 2011, we were granted a patent extending the exclusivity of the BEMA drug delivery technology in Canada to 2027. The Canadian Patent No. 2,658,585 provides additional patent protection for ONSOLIS and BELBUCA. In April 2012, the USPTO granted US Patent No. 8,147,866, which will extend the exclusivity of the BEMA drug delivery technology for BELBUCA and BUNAVAIL in the U.S. from 2020 to 2027. In April 2014, the USPTO granted US Patent No. 8,703,177 (issued from US Patent Application No. 13/590,094), which will extend the exclusivity of the BEMA drug delivery technology for BUNAVAIL in the U.S. to at least 2032. In February 2018, we were granted US Patent No. 9,901,539, which will extend the exclusivity of the BEMA technology for BELBUCA in the U.S. to December 21, 2032.
We own various patents and patent applications relating to the BEMA technology. US Patent No. 6,159,498 (expiration date October 2016), US Patent No. 7,579,019 (expiration date January 22, 2020), US Patent No. 8,147,866 (expiration date July 23, 2027), US Patent 8,703,177 (expiration date August 20, 2032), US Patent 9,522,188 (expiration date April 24, 2035), US Patent 9,597,288 (expiration date July 23, 2027), US Patent 9,655,843 (expiration date July 23, 2027), US Patent 9,901,539 (expiration date December 21, 2032), Canadian Patent No. 2,658,585 (expiration date July 2027), EP2054031 (expiration date July 2027) and EP 0 973 497 (expiration date October 2017) are of particular value to our business and technology platform relating to the BEMA delivery technology. On February 16, 2010, we filed a complaint with the United States Federal District Court for the District of Columbia, requesting the USPTO be required to further extend the patent term for US 7,579,019 from 835 days to 1,191 days. In March 2011, we prevailed in this case, and the patent expiration date of US Patent No. 7,579,019 was extended from January 31, 2019 to January 22, 2020.
On January 22, 2014, Aquestive filed a Petition for Inter Partes Review, or IPR, on US Patent No. 7,579,019 with the USPTO. In the Petition, Aquestive is requesting an inter partes review because it is asserting that the claims of US Patent No. 7,579,019 are alleged to be unpatentable over certain prior art references. The USPTO instituted the IPR on the US Patent No. 7,579,019 (which we refer to as the ’019 Patent). The USPTO found all claims patentable and Aquestive filed a Request for Rehearing. On December 19, 2016, the PTAB issued a final decision denying Aquestive’s request for rehearing. Aquestive did not appeal this final decision.
Medical Affairs Initiatives
Beginning in late 2018, we transitioned from a research and development-oriented organization into one that is more commercially focused. As such, we expanded our medical affairs capabilities and honed our efforts toward maximizing our products in the market, particularly with our lead asset, BELBUCA. While we continue to modify our capabilities to best educate and support the medical and scientific community, some enhancements include:
•strategically expanding our medical affairs department to include scientific communications, publications, and deeper medical expertise regarding clinical and Health Economic and Outcomes Research (HEOR) initiatives;
•developing robust medical affairs plans for BELBUCA and Symproic in order to define future clinical studies, publications, congress activities, and educational initiatives to deliver on the strategic imperatives in order to inform all stakeholders on the attributes of these products;
•proactively planning public policy initiatives and utilizing policy expertise in order to capitalize on federal and state tailwinds in chronic pain; 
•continuing to progress post-marketing requirements (PMRs), for BELBUCA and Symproic; and
•providing regulatory, pharmacovigilance (PV), and drug safety support for BELBUCA, Symproic, and ONSOLIS.
Our estimates of medical affairs initiatives, and our projected sales associated with each of our products discussed below and elsewhere in this Report are merely estimates and subject to multiple factors, many of which are, or may be beyond our control, including those detailed in the Risk Factors section of this Report. These factors and risks could cause delays, cost overruns or otherwise cause us to not achieve these estimates. Readers are also advised that our projected sales figures do not consider the royalties and other payments we will need to make to our licensors and strategic partners. Our estimates are based upon our market research and management’s reasonable judgments, but readers are advised that such estimates may prove to be inaccurate.
The following is a summary of our medical affair initiatives for our current products at December 31, 2020:
BELBUCA (buprenorphine buccal film). Following the transfer of BELBUCA to us in January 2017, we led clinical and Medical Affairs support behind BELBUCA. We have assumed responsibility for the conduct of post approval commitments specified by FDA in the approval of BELBUCA, which include a thorough QT (TQT) study and a pediatric study. In September 2013, the FDA announced that it will require all companies holding NDAs for extended-release/long-acting, or ER/LA opioid analgesic drug products to conduct four post-marketing studies regarding risks associated with their long-term use and one clinical trial to estimate risk of hyperalgesia. The FDA replaced the original requirements with new post-marketing requirements in February 2016. The Opioid PMR Consortium was formed with representatives from each of the member companies providing an opportunity for one set of studies to be completed to satisfy the FDA requirements and distributing the associated costs across all member companies. Each member company pays an equal share of the program costs and new members are required to pay equal share of the costs to date upon program entry and of future costs going forward. We joined the Opioid PMR Consortium in October 2017 and our initial share of the program cost was paid in late 2017. To date, seven of eleven studies have been completed and the program is expected to continue into 2021 and beyond. In addition, during the past year, we have completed and fully-analyzed a Phase 1 study which compared the effects of therapeutic doses of BELBUCA and oxycodone hydrochloride on respiratory drive in response to hypercapnia. 
SYMPROIC. We continue to advance an FDA PMR which is an observational study to access the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in naldemedine users. 
BUNAVAIL. Activities in 2017 included work to support a label expansion of BUNAVAIL for the induction (conversion to buprenorphine) of opioid dependent subjects, performance of FDA post-marketing study requirements and improvements in commercial manufacturing. In May 2017, we announced that the FDA expanded the BUNAVAIL label to include induction of opioid dependent patients. We discontinued all marketing of BUNAVAIL in June 2020, however the NDA remains active.
Government Regulation
The nonclinical and clinical development, manufacturing and marketing of any drug product is subject to significant regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries. Complying with these regulations involves considerable time, expense and uncertainty.
In the U.S., drugs are subject to rigorous federal regulation and, to a lesser extent, state regulation. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of our drugs. Drug development and approval within this regulatory framework is difficult to predict, requires several years and involves the expenditure of substantial resources. Moreover, ongoing legislation by Congress and rulemaking by the FDA presents an ever-changing landscape where we could be required to undertake additional activities before any governmental approval to market our products is granted.
Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy
In March 2008, new legislation designated as the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (the FDAAA) took effect. This legislation strengthened the FDA’s authority over drug safety and directs the FDA to develop systems aimed at managing the risk-benefit ratio of a drug, with a particular focus on post-approval safety. FDAAA authorized the FDA to require and enforce a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, if the FDA determines that it is necessary to ensure that the benefits of a drug outweigh the potential risks. The legislation also provides the FDA with authority to require a REMS at any point in a drug product’s lifecycle based on new safety information.
A REMS is defined by the FDA as a strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a drug or biological product. The FDA’s assessment of whether to require a REMS as a condition for approval considers factors such as the size of the population likely to use the drug, the seriousness of the disease or condition that is to be treated by the drug, the expected benefit, and the seriousness of any known or potential adverse events that may be related to the drug. A REMS may be conveyed through the use of a number of tools including a Medication Guide for distribution when the drug is dispensed, a communication plan to physicians to convey potential risks, and elements to ensure safe use. These elements may include provisions that healthcare providers who prescribe the drug and pharmacists who dispense the drug have particular training, experience or special certifications; that the drug be dispensed only in certain healthcare settings; that the drug be dispensed to patients with evidence of safe-use conditions; and/or that patients must be enrolled in a registry. Under the FDAAA, the FDA has also been granted enforcement authority over violations of the REMS provisions. The FDA may impose civil monetary penalties, the drug or biological product can be deemed misbranded, and/or the FDA may obtain injunctive relief against further distribution of the product.
On December 29, 2011, the FDA approved a “class-wide” REMS program covering all transmucosal fentanyl products under a single risk management program. ONSOLIS is subject to this REMS, which includes a number of Elements to Assure Safe Use (ETASU).
Additionally, FDA has implemented a class-wide REMS covering all opioid analgesic drug products. The class-wide REMS includes a REMS-compliant educational program offered by an accredited provider of continuing medical education, patient counseling materials and a medication guide. BELBUCA is subject to this REMS.
A REMS is also in place for buprenorphine for the treatment of opioid dependence. BUNAVAIL is included in this REMS, which includes a medication guide and healthcare professional and patient education.
The cost and implementation of all of these “shared system” REMS is shared among multiple companies that are required to participate by way of having an approved product that is subject to the particular REMS.
International Approval
Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by regulatory authorities in foreign countries must be obtained prior to the commencement of commercial sales of the drug in such countries. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and drug approvals vary widely from country to country, and the time required for approval may be 
longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. Although there are some procedures for unified filings for certain European countries, in general, each country currently has its own procedures and requirements.
ONSOLIS (under different trade names and with a slightly different formulation) is approved in Europe and in Taiwan. In 2019, after learning that Purdue would no longer be marketing BELBUCA in Canada, BDSI requested that Purdue ask Health Canada to cancel its registration and approval there. BDSI has no plans at the moment to market BELBUCA outside of the U.S.
Other Regulation
In addition to regulations enforced by the FDA, we are also subject to U.S. regulation under the Controlled Substances Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other present and potential future federal, state, local or similar foreign regulations. Although we believe that our safety procedures comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations, the risk of injury cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of any accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed our resources.
Human Capital Resources
As of March 9, 2021, we have 176 full-time employees. Of which, 134 handle our outside sales and training, 7 are involved in our medical affairs, clinical development program and regulatory, 23 handle our administration, finance, legal, human resources, operations, quality and supply chain management, and 12 handle our marketing and market access. Advanced degrees and certifications of our staff include one M.D., three PharmDs, two CPAs, one chartered accountant, twenty MBAs, nine MSs, six MAs, three JDs, one MPA, one MEDU and three RNs. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. From time to time, we also employ independent contractors on a consulting basis or to support our administrative functions. We consider relations with all our employees to be in good standing. Each of our employees has entered into confidentiality, intellectual property assignment and non-competition agreements with us.
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward employees by granting equity-based compensation awards to increase shareholder value and the success of our company by motivating employees to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our corporate objectives.
