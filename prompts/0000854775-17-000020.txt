ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General Background and Product Offerings
Digi International Inc. ("Digi," "we," "our," or "us") was incorporated in 1985 as a Minnesota corporation. We were reorganized as a Delaware corporation in 1989 in conjunction with our initial public offering. Our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol DGII. Our World Headquarters is located at 11001 Bren Road East, Minnetonka, Minnesota 55343. The telephone number at our World Headquarters is (952) 912-3444. 
We are a leading global provider of business and mission-critical and Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity products and services. We help our customers create next-generation connected products and deploy and manage critical communications infrastructures in demanding environments with high levels of security and reliability. As of the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2017, we determined that we have two reportable operating segments for purposes of ASC 280-10-50 "Segments Reporting": (i) machine-to-machine (M2M), and (ii) Solutions. 
Our M2M segment consists primarily of distinct communications products and communication product development services. Among other things, these products and services help our customers create next generation connected products and deploy and manage critical communications infrastructures in demanding environments with high levels of security and reliability. This segment creates secure, easy to implement embedded solutions and services to help customers build IoT connectivity. It also deploys ready to use, complete box solutions to connect remote equipment. The M2M segment also offers dedicated professional services for the design of specialized wireless communications products for customers. Finally, this segment offers managed cloud services that enable customers to capture and manage data from devices they connect to networks. M2M products and services are used by a wide range of businesses and institutions.
Our Solutions segment offers wireless temperature and other environmental condition monitoring services as well as employee task management services. These products and services are provided to food service, transportation, education, healthcare and pharma, and industrial markets and are marketed as Digi Smart Solutions™. We have formed and expanded the Solutions segment primarily through four acquisitions: the October 2015 acquisition of Bluenica Corporation (Bluenica), the November 2016 acquisition of FreshTemp, LLC (FreshTemp), the January 2017 acquisition of SMART Temps, LLC (SMART Temps) and the October 2017 acquisition of TempAlert, LLC (TempAlert). Because the acquisition of TempAlert was subsequent to September 30, 2017, it's results are not included in our Consolidated Financial Statements (see Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements).
For more in-depth descriptions of our primary products and services, please refer to the heading "Listing of Principal Products and Services" at the end of Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K.
In October 2015, we sold our Etherios, Inc. customer relationship management (CRM) consulting services business (Etherios), which focused on integration and configuration of enterprise resource management (ERM) systems, including CRM systems. This part of our business principally provided integration and configuration of salesforce.com products. As a result of the sale of Etherios, we have accounted for it as a discontinued operation. Accordingly, amounts in the Consolidated Statement of Operations, the Consolidated Balance Sheets and notes thereto, for all periods affected, have been reclassified to reflect discontinued operations accounting for that business. For more information on this divestiture see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Our M2M revenue represented 95.9%, 99.6% and 100.0% of our total revenue during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Solutions revenue represented 4.1% and 0.4% of our total revenue in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. We had no Solutions revenue in fiscal 2015.

Industry and Marketplace Conditions
Current Market Conditions and Status of Our Business
We believe the marketplace for IoT products and services will continue to expand generally. 
Despite this expected expansion, our M2M segment contracted in fiscal 2017. Our M2M segment sells both wired and wireless products that are either embedded into the products of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) or stand-alone to provide connectivity to stand-alone assets of customers. Certain of these products have been sold for many years, are in the mature phase of their life cycle and have been experiencing declining sales for several years. In fiscal 2017, sales of these legacy products experienced larger than expected declines largely because a long-term customer of certain of these products significantly curtailed its purchase of our products in fiscal 2017. These declines were not offset by increases in sales of other products, which, among other issues, were hampered by delays in the release of new products. While we generally expect the trend of marketplace growth to continue, it is susceptible to downturns either because of general economic conditions, the continued development of technology and uncertainty or changes in the regulatory environments. Relative to our own M2M segment business, sales of many of our products are subject to large project-based customer deployments. As such, if we are unable to identify and commence new deployments with equal or greater significance than completed projects, our growth from period to period may be inconsistent and our M2M segment may in any given period contract.
While the performance of our M2M segment, which is the significant majority of our sales, was less than anticipated in fiscal 2017, our Solutions segment experienced significant growth as we completed the acquisitions of FreshTemp and SMART Temps in our first and second fiscal quarters, respectively. We continue to see steadily growing demand for our Solutions products and services and presently expect this trend to continue.
Strategy
We continue to take significant steps to transform Digi into a company that can deliver consistent long-term growth with higher levels of profitability. This transformation began when we appointed Ronald E. Konezny as our Chief Executive Officer in December 2014 and today is centered on managing each of our operating segments towards different primary objectives.
M2M Segment
Our M2M segment, which represents the significant majority of our revenues is being managed for modest revenue growth and higher levels of profitability through greater operating expense leverage. A significant part of this business remains based in legacy networking products that are in the mature phase of their product life cycles. For many years these products have been experiencing year over year revenue declines that create a natural headwind to driving significant growth in this operating segment as a whole. In addition, sales of many of our products throughout this segment are based on significant one time projects. As a result, for many years Digi has experienced inconsistent revenue growth as project based revenues have fluctuated.
In this operating environment we have taken the following steps to meet our aims:

• | We sold our Etherios CRM consulting business in 2015. This business initially was acquired with the expectation it would drive engagements with companies that utilize the salesforce.com platform and were looking to deploy solutions within their businesses. We were not, however, rewarded in the marketplace as we had expected. As a result, we disposed of a consulting business that was losing money and not fully tied to our core hardware expertise. 


• | We significantly reduced the number of hardware product stock keeping units (SKUs) we produce in order to simplify our operations, improve our ability to manage inventory effectively, improve channel stocking strategies and control costs. At present, SKUs have been reduced from close to 5,000 at the beginning of fiscal 2016 to approximately 1,400. 


• | We consolidated and relocated office locations to improve efficiencies and provide costs savings. In the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we moved our Digi Wireless Design Services team from an office in downtown Minneapolis to our World Headquarters in suburban Minnetonka. In the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we closed our office in Dortmund, Germany and moved the corresponding positions to our existing office in Munich, Germany. In the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we announced the closure of our Paris, France office to further consolidate European operations in 

2

Munich, Germany. These moves improved our operating expenses and better position our employees to drive positive results in our operations through increased collaboration.

• | In October 2017, we have added new leadership to our M2M team in the areas of product management and research and development to drive greater alignment around the products we bring to market to meet the needs and desires of potential customers in key markets in a timely manner. We believe this increased alignment can greater lever our technical capabilities to drive more consistent growth. 

Solutions Segment
Our Solutions segment, which has grown from no revenue during fiscal 2015 to almost 5% of our total revenue in fiscal 2017, is being managed primarily for revenue growth. The segment was formed and has been grown primarily through our acquisitions of Bluenica in October 2015, FreshTemp in November 2016, SMART Temps in January 2017 and, most recently, TempAlert in October 2017. Following our acquisition of TempAlert we believe in fiscal 2018 this business will deliver between 10-15% of our revenues.
This business helps businesses track the completion of employee tasks and monitor environmental conditions (most notably, temperature) of perishable or sensitive inventories. Our efforts have created a market-leading, high-growth hardware enabled service business with significant recurring revenue potential. Following our recent TempAlert acquisition we now serve over 35,000 customer sites for many leading brands in the foodservice, transportation, education, healthcare and pharma and industrial marketplaces. 
We have chosen to enter this marketplace aggressively for several reasons. First, it provides us with the opportunity to develop a recurring revenue business that is focused on a large addressable market that has not been penetrated significantly. Restaurants, pharmacies, hospitals and other businesses that maintain significant inventories of perishable or other sensitive goods are a large part of the market. These businesses by and large presently rely primarily on employees to log the temperature or other environmental conditions of these goods as well as the completion of other tasks using pencil and paper. This is not as cost effective or secure as using wireless communications sensors to track conditions automatically and provide real time alerts if established parameters are breached. It also is not as effective for tracking the completion of other tasks as using an application enabled smart phone or other wireless communications device. Second, at present this marketplace primarily is served by smaller companies that lack the infrastructure to provide hardware enabled service to customers in as effective and efficient a manner as we are able to do because of our long-standing history as an IoT hardware provider. Third, we believe customers in this marketplace will not require significant customization or development of existing products before they will commit to purchase the solution. This differs from many of our hardware customers who often ask us to create a highly customized product that cannot be easily sold to other parties. This potential for repeatable sales of an established product suite appeals to us. Fourth, by protecting valuable goods that impact health and safety, the solution provides a clear return on investment for potential customers whose business and reputation is highly reliant on maintaining safe operations that will not harm customers.
We believe this marketplace represents an opportunity for significant revenue growth for Digi that is both recurring and high-margin in nature. To that end at present our primary aim with this business is to manage it for customer acquisition and revenue growth while assuring we do not negatively impact the overall profitability of the Company in any material way.
In summary, we intend to continue to take steps to simplify our operations, improve operating expenses to increase our profit leverage and expand our business in ways that we believe can drive long-term profitable growth. We will continue to seek and evaluate acquisitions that will further enhance our Solutions segment as we believe this marketplace offers a path to a significant base of recurring revenue that can provide both stability and significant growth for us. We may also seek to acquire hardware or other businesses that we believe can improve our market position in our M2M segment.
Acquisitions and Dispositions
Acquisitions
Since fiscal 2015 we have acquired four businesses that form the basis of our Solutions segment.
In October 2015, we acquired Ontario based Bluenica, a company focused on temperature monitoring of perishable goods in the food industry by using wireless sensors which are installed in grocery and convenience stores, restaurants, and in products during shipment and storage to ensure that quality, freshness and public health requirements are met (see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements).
3

In November 2016, we acquired Pittsburgh based FreshTemp. FreshTemp offered restaurants, convenience stores and other retailers the ability to monitor the temperature of food products automatically through the use of wireless sensors. The company also enabled these businesses to track the completion of operational tasks by their employees that could impact human health and safety in real time - a capability that we believe significantly enhanced our product offering (see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements).
In January 2017, we acquired Indiana based SMART Temps. SMART Temps provided real-time foodservice temperature management for restaurant, grocery, education and hospital settings as well as real-time temperature management for pharmacy, blood bank and laboratory environments. The acquisition significantly expanded our customer base, especially in the pharmacy and education marketplaces (see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements).
On October 20, 2017, subsequent to the end of fiscal 2017, we acquired TempAlert, a provider of automated, real-time temperature monitoring and task management solutions for the healthcare, industrial and foodservice industries. This acquisition more than doubled the number of customer sites we monitor while enhancing our ability to analyze data collected from our services. Because the acquisition of TempAlert was subsequent to September 30, 2017, TempAlert is not included in our Consolidated Financial Statements (see Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements).
Disposition
On October 23, 2015, we entered into a stock purchase agreement with West Monroe Partners, LLC, pursuant to which they acquired our Etherios CRM consulting services business. We sold Etherios as part of a strategy to focus on providing highly reliable machine connectivity solutions for business and mission-critical application environments (see Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements).
These are the only acquisitions and dispositions we have completed in the past five years. We will continue to evaluate strategic opportunities to acquire businesses as they arise and may seek to divest businesses or assets we no longer consider appropriate to our long-term strategy.
Sales Channels
We sell our products through a global network of distributors, systems integrators and value added resellers (VARs) which accounted for 61.5%, 66.1% and 61.8% of our total revenue in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We also complete sales through our own dedicated sales organization to OEMs and other customers which accounted for 38.5%, 33.9% and 38.2% of our total revenue in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
Distributors
Our larger distributors, based on sales we make to them, include Anewtech Systems Pte Ltd., Arrow Electronics, Inc., Astone Technologies, Atlantik Elektronik GmbH, Avnet, Digi-Key Corporation, Express Systems & Peripherals, Future Electronics, Ingram Micro, Mouser Electronics, Novotech, Sapply Pty. Ltd., Solid State Supplies, Ltd., Sphinx Computer Vertriebs GmbH, Synnex, Tech Data Corporation and Tokyo Electron Device Ltd. We also maintain relationships with many other distributors in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America.
Strategic Sales Relationships 
We maintain alliances with other industry leaders to develop and market technology solutions. These include many major communications hardware and software vendors, operating system suppliers, computer hardware manufacturers, enterprise application providers and cellular carriers. Among others, partners include: AT&T, Bell Mobility, NXP, Telit, Rogers, Silicon Laboratories, Sprint, Telus, Verizon and several other cellular carriers worldwide. Furthermore, we maintain a worldwide network of authorized developers that extends our reach into certain other technology applications and geographical regions.
We have established relationships with equipment vendors in a range of industries such as energy, industrial, retail, transportation, medical, and government that allow the vendors to ship our products and services as component parts of their overall solutions. Our products are used by many of the world’s leading telecommunications companies and Internet service providers, including AT&T Inc., Sprint Corporation and Verizon Communications Inc.
No single customer comprised more than 10% of our consolidated revenue for any of the years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 or 2015.

Competition
We compete primarily in the communications technology industry, which is characterized by rapid technological advances and evolving industry standards. The market can be affected significantly by new product introductions and marketing activities of industry participants. In addition, we may compete with other companies to acquire new businesses or technologies and the competition to secure such assets may be intense. We compete for customers on the basis of existing and planned product features, service and software application capabilities, company reputation, brand recognition, technical support, alliance relationships, quality and reliability, product development capabilities, price and availability. While no competitor offers a comparable range of products and services, various companies do compete with us with respect to one or more of our products or solutions. With respect to many of our product and service offerings, we face competition from companies who dedicate more resources and attention to that particular offering than we are able to do given the breadth of our business. As the marketplace for IoT connectivity products and solutions continues to grow, we expect to encounter increased competition. Some of these competitors may have access to significantly more financial and technical resources than we possess.
Manufacturing Operations
Our manufacturing operations are conducted through a combination of internal manufacturing and external subcontractors specializing in various parts of the manufacturing process. We rely on third party foundries for our semiconductor devices that are Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and we outsource printed circuit board production. This approach allows us to reduce our fixed costs, maintain production flexibility and optimize our profits. 
Our products are manufactured to our designs with standard and custom components. Most of the components are available from multiple vendors. We have several single-sourced supplier relationships, either because alternative sources are not available or because the relationship is advantageous to us. If these suppliers are unable to provide a timely and reliable supply of components, we could experience manufacturing delays that could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations in a material way.
Seasonality
In general, our business is not considered to be highly seasonal, although our first fiscal quarter revenue is often less than other quarters due to holidays and fewer shipping days. 
Working Capital
We fund our business operations through a combination of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and cash generated from operations. We believe that our current financial resources, cash generated from operations, and our capacity for debt and/or equity financing will be sufficient to fund our business operations for the next twelve months and beyond.
Research & Development and Intellectual Property Rights
During fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, our research and development expenditures were $28.6 million, $31.0 million and $29.9 million, respectively.
Due to rapidly changing technology in the communications technology industry, we believe a large part of our success depends upon the product and service development skills of our personnel as well as our ability to integrate any acquired technologies with organically developed technologies. While we dedicate significant resources to research and development, many of our competitors are focused on a smaller set of products than us and are likely able to dedicate more resources than us toward the portions of the market in which we compete. 
Our proprietary rights and technology are protected by a combination of copyrights, patents, trade secrets and trademarks.
We have established common law and registered trademark rights on a family of marks for a number of our products. Our products and services primarily are sold under the Digi, Rabbit® and Xbee® brands. We believe that the Digi and Rabbit® brands have established strong identities with our targeted customer base and our customers associate the Digi brand with "reliability" and the Rabbit® brand with "ease of integration." We believe that our customers associate Xbee® with "ease of use." Many of our customers choose us because they are building a very complex system solution and they want the highest level in product reliability and ease of integration and use. Our Etherios® brand was sold in connection with the sale of Etherios in October 2015.
Our patents are applicable to specific technologies and are valid for varying periods of time based on the date of patent application or patent grant in the U.S. and the legal term of patents in the various foreign countries where patent protection is 
5

obtained. We believe our intellectual property has significant value and is an important factor in the marketing of our company and products.
Backlog
Backlog as of both September 30, 2017 and 2016 was $25.3 million. The majority of the backlog at September 30, 2017 is expected to be shipped in fiscal 2018. Backlog as of any particular date is not necessarily indicative of our future sales trends.
Employees
We had 514 employees on September 30, 2017. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. 
Geographic Areas and Currency Risks
Our customers are located throughout North America, Europe, Middle East & Africa (EMEA), Asia Pacific and Latin America. We are exposed to foreign currency transaction risk associated with certain sales being denominated in Euros, British Pounds, Japanese Yen and Canadian Dollar and foreign currency translation risk as the financial position and operating results of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars for consolidation. We manage our net asset or net liability position for U.S. dollar accounts in our foreign locations to reduce our foreign currency risk. We have not implemented a formal hedging strategy to reduce foreign currency risk.
During 2017, we had approximately $63.9 million of revenue related to foreign customers including export sales, of which $18.2 million was denominated in foreign currency, predominantly the Euro and British Pound. During fiscal 2016 and 2015, we had approximately $71.5 million and $76.2 million, respectively of revenue to foreign customers including export sales, of which $22.9 million and $21.3 million, respectively, were denominated in foreign currency, predominantly the Euro and British Pound. In future periods, we expect that the majority of our sales will be in U.S. Dollar.
Financial information about geographic areas appears in Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.
PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
Our primary products and services for each operating segment are as follows:
M2M Segment
Hardware Products
Cellular routers and gateways - Cellular routers provide connectivity for devices over a cellular data network. They can be used as a cost effective alternative to landlines for primary or backup connectivity for remote locations and devices. These products have been certified by the major wireless providers in North America and abroad, including, among others, AT&T®, Verizon Wireless®, Sprint®, Bell Mobility, Rogers and Vodafone. Cellular gateway products enable devices or groups of devices to be networked in locations where there is no existing network or where access to a network is prohibited. All of our cellular products include a unique remote management platform that provides secure management of devices across remote networks and can all use the Digi Remote Manager® for remote management. In addition, application connectivity, management and customization are enabled via the Digi Remote Manager® platform for many of these products.
Radio Frequency (RF) - Our RF products are small box or module products that utilize a variety of wireless protocols for PC-to-device or device-to-device connectivity, often in locations where deploying a wired network is not possible either because of cost, disruption or impracticality. By supporting ZigBee®, Wi-Fi® and other radio frequency (RF) technologies, we can meet most customer application requirements. In conjunction with one of our gateways, RF products can be connected into the Digi Remote Manager® for remote management, application connectivity and customization.
Embedded - Our Connect, Rabbit®, and ARM-based embedded systems on module, and single board computers are designed and developed with small footprints, low power consumption and software, making them ideal for medical, transportation and industrial device manufacturers. A number of these modules can be connected directly to the Digi Remote Manager® or other similar platforms, enabling remote management and remote application connectivity. Also included in our embedded grouping are our chips (or microprocessors) that provides the "brains" and processing power of an intelligent electronic device or communication sub-system. Some of our higher volume customers choose to purchase chips and build their own products. Chips are low cost but require the highest level of development expertise. Chip development is not part of our strategy; instead we use commercial-off-the-shelf technology from companies such as Freescale and Ember for our products.
