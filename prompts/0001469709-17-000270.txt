ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview

Esports Entertainment Group, Inc., ("Esports Entertainment", "the Company", our or "we") was incorporated in Nevada on July 22, 2008. Esports Entertainment is a development-stage online gambling and 18+ gaming company and plans to offer wagering on esports events and the ability to participate in video game tournaments for real-money in a licensed and secure environment.

The online gambling market represents one of the fastest growing segments of the gambling industry. H2 Gambling Capital, a leading supplier of data and market intelligence on the global gambling industry, estimates the current size of the global online gambling market is in excess of US$50 billion. Source: H2 Gambling Capital, Global Online Gambling Report 2016.

The esports market represents the fastest growing sports market in the world. According to market research firm Newzoo, the global esports audience will reach 385 million in 2017, made up of 191 million esports enthusiasts and a further 194 million occasional viewers. The number of enthusiasts is expected to grow by 50% toward 2020, totaling 286 million. According to Fortune Magazine, the esports fan base will surpass the NFL by 2017. In 2016, there were 424 esports events with a prize pool above $5,000 worldwide. North America held the 28% of the events, followed by Western Europe with 26%, and Eastern Europe with 13%. Total esports prize money in 2016 reached $93.3 million, up from $61.0 million in 2015, or an increase of 52.9% year on year. For major esports events with prize pools above $5,000, total prize money reached $81.5 million, up from $54.7 million in 2015, or an increase of 49.0% year on year. Forbes magazine projects fans of esports will wager $23 billion by 2020. 

Esports is the professionalization of video games. Contrary to its name, esports does not involve video games of traditional sports such as football and basketball. Rather, esports typically takes the form of organized, multiplayer video games that include real-time strategy, fighting, first-person shooter, and multiplayer online battle arena games. The best-known example of an esports game among non-esports enthusiasts is Call of Duty. Currently, however, the two most successful esports games are Dota 2 and League of Legends (a multiplayer online battle arena game) and Counter Strike: Global Offensive (a first-person shooter game). Other popular games include Smite, StarCraft II, Call of Duty¸ Heroes of the Storm, and Hearthstone. Esports also includes games which can be played, primarily by amateurs, in multiplayer competitions such as WII (Nintendo), and Halo (343 Industries). 

Although official competitions have long been a part of video game culture, participation and spectatorship of such events have seen a massive global surge in popularity with the rapid growth of online streaming over the last few years. The advent of online streaming technology has turned esports into a global industry that includes professional players and teams competing in major events that are simultaneously watched in person in stadiums (which are often sold out), as well as of online viewers (which regularly exceed 1,000,000 for major tournaments). The impact has been so significant, that many video game developers now build features into their games designed to facilitate competition.

Esports Entertainment intends to offer esports enthusiasts from around the world, excluding the United States, the ability to wager on a wide variety of esports events. Esports Entertainment intends to offer users the opportunity to wager against other users utilizing a peer-to-peer wagering system with no risk to the Company. Esports Entertainment plans to generate revenue from fees charged to players based on a percentage of the

amount wagered on an event. Esports Entertainment intends to offer spectators the ability to wager on all major professional esports events and a wide range of amateur esports events.

Esports Entertainment also intends to offer users from around the world, excluding 13 States within the United States, the ability to participate in online mobile and PC video game tournaments and win cash prizes. Participants will be able to enter and play against each other with prize money distributed to the last remaining competitors. Esports will collect a percentage of tournament entry fees and will not have any of its own capital at risk. Esports Entertainment intends to offer users a wide selection of video games of skill to be played online for real money in both small groups and major tournaments.

Esports Entertainment will not offer online users traditional casino style games such as poker, craps or slots, nor will it offer online wagering on traditional sporting events such as football or soccer. Esports Entertainment will be focused solely on offering online wagering on the widest range of esports events broadcast from around the world, as well as, hosting online video game tournaments for enthusiasts.

Given the global demand for live esports events, Esports Entertainment also intends to acquire the 62,000-square foot Grand Princess Casino in Antigua, for the purposes of converting it into an Esports Coliseum that will hold a variety of esports events such as: hosting spectators as they watch live esports events on the main floor; and hosting video game tournaments that provide visitors with the opportunity to participate in tournaments on the second floor.

Our initial plan to launch and operate our business involves two phases.

In the first phase, we intend to complete the development, testing and launching of our esports focused online gambling website. We estimate that the costs involved in completing the first phase will be approximately $2,000,000. Our sales and marketing efforts began in the third quarter of 2017. We intend to launch our online esports focused wagering website in the fourth quarter of 2017.

In the second phase, we intend to acquire, renovate, equip and operate our land based Esports Coliseum. We estimate the cost of acquiring and refurbishing the Grand Princess Casino in Antigua to be approximately $14,000,000. We further estimate the cost of equipping and operating the esports focused multi-purpose facility at approximately $6,000,000 to $8,000,000. We intend to acquire, renovate, equip and launch our esports focused multi-purpose facility in Antigua within twelve months of raising the necessary funds. We expect our sales and marketing efforts to begin within six months of the commencement of operations. 

We currently have eight full time and four part time employees. If we are able to raise sufficient capital, we plan to hire additional employees by December 31, 2017.

To date, our operations have been limited to the design, develop and test our wagering systems. As of September 30, 2017, we have not commenced commercial operations. As of September 30, 2017, we have not generated any revenue from our operations.

Our executive and business offices are located at Commercial Centre, Jolly Harbour, St. Marys, Antigua and Barbuda. Our telephone number is (268) 562-1119.

Online Operations

Esports Entertainment intends to offer users the opportunity to wager against other users utilizing a peer-to-peer wagering system with no risk to the Company. Esports Entertainment intends to offer spectators the ability to wager on all major professional esports events and a wide range of amateur esports events that will be broadcast live via streaming services including, twitch.tv, azubu.tv, ustream.tv and youtube.com.

Esports Entertainment has been issued a Client Provider Authorization Permit from the Kahnawake Gaming Commission in Canada. The computer servers and related equipment required for our esports gambling business will be located in the data center facilities on the Mohawk of Kahnawake Indian Reservation in Canada. Although this Permit allows Esports Entertainments wholly-owned subsidiary to conduct real-money online gambling and wagering activities on a global basis, Esports Entertainment believes that also operating from Curacao, in addition to from the Mohawk Indian Reservation in Canada, is more beneficial for the following reasons:

·
 access to experienced staff

·
 access to premium office space

·
 lower operating costs

Accordingly, Esports Entertainment has been issued a Curacao eGaming License in Curacao in the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The License allows Esports Entertainments wholly-owned subsidiary to conduct real-money online gambling and wagering activities on a global basis from Curacao.

We have a Betting Gaming Platform Software Agreement with Swiss Interactive Software GmbH, a company controlled by Yan Rozum, one of our directors. Under the Agreement, Swiss Interactive has agreed to grant Esports Entertainment an exclusive license to offer certain Swiss Interactive developed esports event wagering platforms for real money play and wagering. 

We have agreements with a number of entities that allows us to process money transfers through the internet.

We will control the payments, customer service, marketing and other aspects of our business.

Land Based Operations

In June 2016, the Company made an offer to purchase the Grand Princess Casino, located in Jolly Harbor, Antigua, for $8,000,000 (US$). A condition of the purchase is the Company is required to pay a deposit of $800,000. While the Company continues to seek additional sources of equity capital, as of September 30, 2017 the Company has not yet paid the required deposit.

In addition to the purchase price, the Company will also need approximately $5,000,000 to refurbish and renovate the facility plus $6,000,000 to $8,000,000 to purchase equipment and provide working capital during the start-up phase following its opening. The Company estimates the facility, if and when it begins operations, will have approximately 12 employees and will cost approximately $50,000 per month to operate. If the Companys offer is accepted, and needed capital is raised, the Company estimates the esports casino will not begin operations until 12 months after the needed capital is raised.

The Grand Princess Casino will not be operated as a traditional casino. Rather, it will host spectators as they watch live esports events on the main floor, as well as, provide visitors with the opportunity to participate in video game tournaments on the second floor, all under the Esports Coliseum brand.

A live esports event normally involves two or more professional teams which are contracted to participate. The sponsor of the event is typically required to pay the transportation and lodging expenses of the participating teams. The quality of teams participating is based on the cash prize offered to the winner. As a sponsor of the event, we will be a major contributor to the cash prize pool with the goal of making the prize pool as large as possible so as attract the highest quality teams.

The Grand Princess Casino consists of 62,000 square feet over three floors and will be rebranded as the Esports Coliseum. 

Initially, the first floor of the Esports Coliseum will be used to host events arranged by existing and established esports tournament organizers. We intend to work with multiple esports tournament organizers and arrange for them to host one or a series of events at the Esports Coliseum. As a permanent esports event hosting facility, tournament organizers will benefit from the cost efficiency of not having to ship, assemble and then remove the equipment and services needed to host an esports event involving multiple teams, 1,500 spectators and broadcasting in a temporary facility. The Esports Coliseum plans to generate revenue from facilities rental to tournament organizers in the form of a flat fee or as a percentage of ticket sales.

Ultimately, we also intend to organize and host our own esports events on the first floor of the Esports Coliseum. We intend to negotiate with multiple video game publishers to secure the rights to their game software to enable us to host one or more esports events at the Esports Coliseum. The cost of the game software licenses are negotiated individually and can be based on a flat fee, as a percentage of the prize pool, as a percentage of ticket sales, or at no cost. We intend to attract esports spectator demographic focused sponsors and advertisers to make financial contributes to the event prize pool. We intend to enter into agreements with the esports teams from around the world to have them participate in our events. The teams will have the opportunity to compete for the prize pool offered. We intend to broadcast globally all esports events live on multiple video streaming platforms, such as twitch.tv and youtube.com. We intend to market the events primarily through online advertising on esports focused websites and the websites and social media of professional esports players and teams. We plan to generate revenue in the form of ticket sales, third party sponsorship and advertising fees, both at the Esports Coliseum and on online broadcasts of tournaments.

The second floor of the Esports Coliseum will provide a tournament play area with space for up to 200 participants who will play video games among themselves. The tournament play area will be equipped with 200 gaming stations, each of which will include the latest in gaming hardware and accessories, a computer with a large monitor, desk and ergonomic chair. Participants will be able to enter and play against each other for tournament chips with prize money distributed to the last remaining competitors. We will collect a tournament entry fee for scheduled tournaments and will not have any of our own capital at risk. No spectator seating will be available on the second floor and the tournaments played on the second floor will not be broadcast.

The second floor will also host a full-service restaurant and lounge. A portion of the third floor is planned for a roof top patio bar area. The remainder of the third floor will be utilized for offices.

Sales and Marketing

We plan to:

·
 implement an affiliate marketing program. Affiliate marketing is a type of performance-based marketing by which a business, such as ours, rewards affiliates for each customer brought by the affiliate's marketing efforts. Affiliate marketing is a very successful form of online marketing and is utilized by global leaders such as Amazon, Apple and all leading online gambling sites. 

·
 advertise and sponsor major professional esports events held in stadiums around the world that are broadcast online to a global audience.

·
 utilize professional esports players and other celebrities, who have an interest in video games and esports, to generate new customers.

·
 use a multimedia approach focusing on acquiring and retaining customers.

7

·
 use online advertisements, paid search optimization, and various social media campaigns to increase our online presence and drive traffic to our website. 

If we are able to acquire the Grand Princess Casino in Antigua, the Esports Entertainment brands will be featured prominently as a major sponsor of professional esports events held at the facility and broadcast globally.

Competition

The online gambling and wagering industry is increasingly competitive. With relatively low barriers to entry, new competitors are entering the esports wagering and video game tournament segments. In both of these segments, there currently exist several major competitors. Because many of these competitors focus on delivering one product, as opposed to a full suite of esports and video gambling products and services that Esports Entertainment intends to offer, the competitors may offer an equivalent or superior product to that of the Company. Esports Entertainment expects the number of companies offering products and services in each market segment to increase. Many of Esports Entertainments current and potential competitors, including but not limited to Unikrn, Skilz, bet365, William Hill, Betway, and Pinnacle Sports, have far greater resources than Esports Entertainment.
Regulations Affecting our Business

The offering and operation of online real-money gambling platforms and related software and solutions is subject to extensive regulation and approval by various federal, state, provincial, tribal and foreign agencies (collectively, gaming authorities). Gambling laws require us to obtain licenses or findings of suitability from gaming authorities for Esports Entertainment, including each of our subsidiaries engaged in these activities, and certain of our directors, officers, employees and in some instances, significant shareholders (typically beneficial owners of more than 5% of a companys outstanding equity). The criteria used by gambling authorities to make determinations as to qualification and suitability of an applicant varies among jurisdictions, but generally require the submission of detailed personal and financial information followed by a thorough investigation. Gaming authorities have broad discretion in determining whether an applicant qualifies for licensing or should be found suitable. Gambling authorities generally look to the following criteria when determining to grant a license or finding of suitability, including (i) the financial stability, integrity and responsibility of the applicant, (ii) the quality and security of the applicants online real-money platform and gaming equipment and related software, as applicable, (iii) and, the past history of the applicant. Gambling authorities may, subject to certain administrative proceeding requirements, (i) deny an application, or limit, condition, restrict, revoke or suspend any license, registration, finding of suitability or approval, and (ii) fine any person licensed, registered or found suitable or approved. Notwithstanding the foregoing, some jurisdictions explicitly prohibit gaming in all or certain forms and we will not market our gambling services in these jurisdictions. If any director, officer or employee of ours fails to qualify for a license or is found unsuitable (including due to the failure to submit the required documentation) by a gaming authority, we may deem it necessary, or be required to, sever our relationship with such person, which may include terminating the employment of any such person. Gambling authorities have the right to investigate any individual or entity having a material relationship with us, to determine whether such individual or entity is suitable or should be licensed to do business as a business associate of ours. In addition, certain gambling authorities monitor the activities of the entities they regulate both in their respective jurisdiction and in other jurisdictions to ensure that these entities are in compliance with local standards on a worldwide basis. As a regulated entity, we will be required to maintain strong corporate governance standards and will be required to, among other things, maintain effective internal controls over our financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, maintain systems for accurate record keeping, file periodic reports with gaming authorities and maintain strict compliance with various laws and regulations applicable to our business. 

We will work to obtain all permits, authorizations, registrations and/or licenses required in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We will have a zero-tolerance approach to money laundering, fraud and collusion and we will work with regulators and law enforcement globally in this area. We plan to have a dedicated compliance team that will work to ensure that we comply with all regulatory requirements under our licenses, as well as all applicable anti-money laundering, anti-fraud and anti-collusion rules and laws.

We will be dedicated to responsible gambling practices and will seek to provide our customers with the resources and services they need to play responsibly. These practices, resources and services are expected to include deposit limits, table and game play limits, voluntary restrictions on access and use of certain games, 

8

self-exclusion and cooling off periods, and voluntary permanent exclusions from our services, sites and applications.
