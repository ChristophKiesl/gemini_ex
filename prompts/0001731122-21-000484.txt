ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
OVERVIEW
 
GBT Technologies Inc. (formally known as Gopher Protocol Inc., the Company, GBT, Gopher, Gopher Protocol GOPH or GTCH) was incorporated on July 22, 2009 under the laws of the State of Nevada. GBT is targeting growing markets such as development of Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled networking and tracking technologies, including wireless mesh network technology platform and fixed solutions, development of an intelligent human body vitals device, asset-tracking IoT, and wireless mesh networks. Effective August 5, 2019, the Company changed its name from Gopher Protocol Inc. to GBT Technologies Inc. The Company derived revenues from the provision of IT services. The Company is seeking to generate revenue from the licensing of its technology.
 
Asset tracking IoT - and Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled networking (including AI Medical Advisor platform and potential products)
 
The Company plans to launch a series of software and microchip design products that integrate into strategic technology partners solutions and enable real-time tracking and management of IoT or connected assets. Through its investment in GBT Technologies S.A. and its Joint Venture with Tokenize – It S.A., this platform was further developed with an Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled networking as well as a stand-alone AI platform.
 
Asset tracking IoT markets and Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled networking (including AI Medical Advisor platform and potential products)
 
The Company expects that the applications for its solutions include segments such as public sector, healthcare sector, banking financial services and insurance (BFSI) sector, transport and logistics sector, retail sector, commercial sector, industrial sector, energy and utility sector, manufacturing sector and other sectors. 
 
Through the Joint Venture with Tokenize – It S.A., the parties commenced development of a development of an intelligent human vital signs device, suggested named qTerm. The platform is an expansion of the existing license agreement with GBT Tokenize Corp., which provided GBT Tokenize Corp. with an exclusive territory of California to develop certain of the Companys technology. As the nature of the platform cannot be restricted only to California, the Companys joint venture, GBT Tokenize Corp., will be compensated with an additional two hundred million shares of the Company to strengthen its funding, subject to board approval. A provisional patent application for the qTerm Medical Device was filed on March 30, 2020 with the USPTO. The application has been assigned serial number 63001564. The Joint Venture completed successfully the first prototype. There is no guarantee that the Company will be successful in researching, developing or implementing this product into the market. In order to successfully implement this concept, the Company will need to raise adequate capital to support its research and, if successfully researched, developed and granted regulatory approval, the Company would need to enter into a strategic relationship with a third party that has experience in manufacturing, selling and distributing this product. There is no guarantee that the Company will be successful in any or all of these critical steps.
 
Asset tracking IoT and Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled networking (including AI Medical Advisor platform and potential products) competition
 
The prevailing AI solutions in the marketplace currently are a combination of barcoding and RFID technologies. Existing solutions require that the asset is near the scanner to be scanned. Further, such existing solutions are point to point, meaning they require repeated scan points along a route in order to update the location of the asset. The Companys asset tracking solutions are designed to be more accurate and when placed on or into the asset, has the ability to interactively locate and update information on an asset anywhere on Earth. Its solutions works through-enabled global mesh network and does not need GPS or GSM to locate the package. In addition, the Companys solutions are planned to include resource and distributed database management features which are not normally found in IoT systems. There are many competitors supplying AI standalone, and AI asset tracking and asset tracking IoT systems today, including companies such as AT&T, IBM and Verizon. It is Companys goal to offer the GopherInsight platform to some or all of these competitors to upgrade and differentiate their solutions.

Wireless mesh networking
 
Wireless mesh networks consist of LAN/MAN/WAN solutions that are infrastructural-intensive, may rely on regulated frequencies and bandwidth, often have so-called last mile problems areas where either economics or population density make it too expensive for current solutions to cover, and difficult to manage centrally. The Companys GopherInsight platform makes it easy to add and manage last mile capacity. The solution is easily integrated into existing networks. The Companys AI platform is designed for easy integration with, and management of, additional coverage for customer networks.
 
Wireless mesh networking markets
 
The Company potentially will target telecommunications providers, corporate entities that run LAN or wide-area networks, universities, and government entities. 
 
Wireless mesh networking markets competition
 
The competitors for wireless mesh networking solutions, and AI solutions, are the entities themselves that have their own capability. The Companys strategy is to integrate and wrap around those solutions to make them more efficient, less costly, and less infrastructural-intensive, while at the same time solving last mile problems to the end user.
 
Prepaid services (completely disposed of in 2020)
 
On September 1, 2017, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with a third party, RWJ Advanced Marketing, LLC, a Georgia corporation. The Company entered into this Asset Purchase Agreement to acquire terminals in approximately 9,400 locations by which, and at which, the Company planned to deploy its IoT/asset tracking technology. The operations consist primarily of the sale of phones and phone card products, including PINS for cell minutes, SIM cards for cell minutes, as well as gift cards and prepaid long distance cards. The Company incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary, UGopherServices Corp. (UGopherServices), to operate the acquired assets. The assets acquired in the purchase consisted of racks that contain 9-12 items per rack that are displayed in retail locations, mainly convenience stores; and payment terminals at those same points of sale.
 
On March 16, 2018, the Company entered into and closed an asset purchase agreement dated March 1, 2018 with ECS Prepaid, LLC (ECS), a Missouri limited liability company, pursuant to which the Company purchased certain assets from ECS, including, but not limited to, the processing prepaid platform, servers, POS terminals, customer list, a processing software program and goodwill, in consideration of $1,100,000 of which $100,000 was paid on the Closing Date and the balance is to be paid pursuant to a secured promissory note in the amount of $1,000,000. In addition, the Company issued 500,000 shares of common stock of the Company and warrants to purchase 500,000 shares of common stock that are exercisable for a period of five years at a fixed exercise price of $1.85 per share. The note is secured by the assets acquired by the Company from ECS and the Company is required to make ten equal principal payments of $100,000 commencing on April 15, 2018. The Company may prepay the note at any time without penalty.
 
On April 2, 2018, the Company entered into and closed an asset purchase agreement with Electronic Check Services, Inc. (Electronic Check), a Missouri corporation, pursuant to which the Company purchased certain assets from Electronic Check, including, but not limited to, assets associated with software that validates written check authenticity. The purchase price was $75,000 in cash, and the Company issued 250,000 shares of common stock of the Company and warrants to purchase 250,000 shares of common stock that are exercisable for a period of five years at a fixed exercise price of $2.70 per share.

On April 2, 2018, the Company entered into and closed an asset purchase agreement with Central State Legal Services, Inc. (CSLS), a Missouri corporation, pursuant to which the Company purchased certain assets from CSLS, including, but not limited to, assets associated with a system to recover funds from returned checks, for $25,000 in cash.
 
The Company entered into these asset purchase agreements to acquire the software needed to process transactions for its prepaid business, and to acquire additional terminal locations by which the Company will deploy its technology. On a combined basis, there are approximately 9,400 points of sale as a result of acquiring certain assets from both RWJ Advanced Marketing LLC and ECS.
 
On or around November 10, 2017, UGopherServices experienced a suspension of operations on the terminals that the Company acquired in its acquisition on September 1, 2017 from RWJ Advanced Marketing LLC. Management of the Company believes that this shutdown came as a result of the decision of Paypal Holdings Inc. (Paypal) decision to suspend operations of TIO Networks (TIO), and appears to have affected all of TIOs customers. TIO was acquired by Paypal in or around July 2017. Prior to the suspension, the Company received no notice from TIO, or from RWJ Advanced Marketing LLC, which sold the assets to UGopherServices, that the suspension would be taking place. Although the Company worked diligently to contain the fallout from the suspension of operations by TIO, the vast majority of the customers that were acquired as part of the transaction defected as a result. The subsequent acquisition of ECS was done partly to stem the customer defections, as many of the customers of UgopherServices sought the services of ECS. In doing so, the Company got many, though not all, of the customers back.
 
The Company is currently in litigation with RWJ Advanced Marketing, LLC, its executives and other third parties, and wrote off a substantial portion of its investment in UgopherServices from September 1, 2017. The Companys position is that it was defrauded by the Seller and certain third parties due to the lack of disclosure of TIOs decision to suspend operations.
 
On September 30, 2019, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Surge Holdings, Inc., a Nevada corporation (SURG) pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell and assign to SURG all the assets and certain specified liabilities of its ECS Prepaid, Electronic Check and the CSLS businesses in consideration of $5,000,000 to be paid through the issuance of 3,333,333 shares of SURGs common stock and a convertible promissory note in favor of the Company in the principal amount of $4,000,000. The 3,333,333 shares of SURGs common stock have been pledged to a third party for providing working capital needs of the Company. The convertible promissory note was issued to AltCorp Trading, LLC a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
 
On January 1, 2021 SURG, AltCorp and Stanley entered into a Mutual Release and Settlement Agreement (Settlement Agreement). Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, SURG agreed to amend the AltCorp Exchange Agreement where SURG acknowledged a debt of $3,300,000 (the Debt) to be paid via 33 monthly payments of $100,000 payable in shares of common stock of SURG at a per share price equal the volume weighted average price of SURGs common stock during the ten (10) trading days immediately preceding the issuance. At the end of the 33rd month, if AltCorp has not realized gross, pre-tax proceeds at least equal to the amount of the Debt, SURG shall transfer to AltCorp and/or its designee additional shares of SURGs common stock necessary to satisfy the Debt. To the date of this report, SURG has made three payments per the settlement agreements
 
On September 18, 2020, the Company entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with Mr. LightHouse LTD., an Israeli corporation (MLH) pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell and assign to MLH, effective July 1, 2020 all the shares, and certain specified liabilities, of Ugopherservices Corp. (UGO), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, in consideration of $100,000 to be paid through the delivery of a promissory note payable to the Company (the Note), upon the terms and subject to the limitations and conditions set forth in the Note.

GBT Tokenize is seeking approval filing for its qTerm device with the United Stated Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA classifies medical devices from Class 1 – 3, each of which must be subjected to robust evaluations and reviews to comply with manufacturing quality control (QC) standards. The FDA regulates the marketing/sale of medical device products in the U.S. and monitors the safety of all regulated medical products. FDA Section 201(h) of the Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) defines a device as: an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including a component part or accessory which is recognized in the official National Formulary, or the United States Pharmacopoeia, or any supplement to them, intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man or other animals, or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals.
 
GBT Tokenize engaged M Squared Associates (M2) to assist with developing the FDA premarket strategy for its qTerm device. The process of filing for FDA clearance involves development of a sound regulatory strategy for pathway to market, including required preclinical and performance testing, software verification and validation activities and ensuring user needs are met. In addition, GBT/tokenize will partner with M2 to finalize technical design documentation, device labeling claims and intended use. Other aspects that will be evaluated include manufacturing processes, usability / human factors and the development of valid scientific evidence. The company will work with M2 to develop a detailed description of the devices software and algorithm training requirements, including design specifications. qTerm computer program will be reviewed for its control functions and other required performance testing plans and criteria according to FDA guidance documentation.

Even though not needed per the law, there is no guarantee that the Company will be successful in obtaining any regulatory approval. In order to successfully implement this concept, the Company will need to raise adequate capital to support its compliance research and, if successfully researched, developed and granted regulatory approval, the Company would need to enter into a strategic relationship with a third party that has experience in manufacturing, selling and distributing this product. There is no guarantee that the Company will be successful in any or all of these critical steps.
 
Intellectual Property
 
To date, the Company, has filed for different patents covering certain fields of its technologies, as well as trademarks. These patents and trademarks, as well as various websites and social media platforms, comprise the Companys intellectual properties. On February 27, 2020 GBT Technologies, S.A., as successor in interest to Hermes Roll, LLC had notified the Company that it was in default on its Amended and Restated Territorial License Agreement (ARTLA) dated June 15, 2015 and that the ARTLA had been cancelled and rescinded.
 
On January 31, 2020, in the arbitration titled GBT Technologies Inc. (k/n/a Gopher Protocol, Inc. v. Discover Growth Fund, LLC (Discover) (JAMS Ref. No. 1260005395), the Company was informed that a final award was entered (the Final Award). The Final Award affirms that certain sections of the Senior Secured Redeemable Convertible Debenture (the Debenture) constitute unenforceable liquidated damages penalties and were stricken. Further, it was determined that neither Discover nor John Kirkland, President and General Partner of Discover, were entitled to recovery of their attorneys fees. Consequently, and consistent with the expectations of the Company, the arbitrator awarded Discover an award of $4,034,444 plus interest of 7.25% accrued from May 15, 2019 and costs in the amount of $55,613.00. On February 18, 2020, the Company filed a motion with the United States District Court District of Nevada (the Nevada Court) to confirm the Final Award and a motion to consolidate Discovers application to confirm the Final Award filed in the U.S. District Court of the Virgin Islands (Case No: 3 :20-cv-00012-CVG-RM) (the Virgin Island Court). On February 27, 2020, the Nevada Court denied the Companys motion to confirm the Final Award and motion to consolidate and further decided that the confirmation of the Final Award should be litigated in the Virgin Island Court. As such, on February 27, 2020, the Company filed a Notice of Entry of Order as well as a Motion to Confirm the Arbitration Award; Address the Outstanding issue regarding whether Discovers rights are subordinated to other creditors and, thereafter, oversee a commercially reasonable foreclosure sale (Case No: 3 :20-cv-00012-CVG-RM). It was the Companys position that the Final Award must first be confirmed and all questions regarding the rights of Discover relative to those of other creditors must be determined before any foreclosure sale can proceed. It was further the position of the Company that the previously disclosed foreclosure sale scheduled by Discover is being conducted in a commercially unreasonable manner and that if Discover proceeded forward with the foreclosure sale it did so at its own risk. Nevertheless, on February 28, 2020, Discover advised that it conducted a sale of the Companys assets. As the date of this report Investor failed to present a deed of sale for the alleged sale that allegedly took place as noticed. The Company filed with Virgin Island Court the motions disputing the validity of the alleged sale.
 
On March 6, 2020, the Company through its newly acquired wholly owned subsidiary, Greenwich International Holdings, a Costa Rica corporation (Greenwich), entered into a Joint Venture and Territorial License Agreement (the Tokenize Agreement) with Tokenize-It, S.A. (Tokenize) to develop, maintain and support source codes for its proprietary technologies including advanced mobile chip technologies, tracking, radio technologies, AI core engine, electronic design automation, mesh, games, data storage, networking, IT services, business process outsourcing development services, customer service, technical support and quality assurance for business, customizable and dedicated inbound and outbound calls solutions, as well as digital communications processing for enterprises and startups (Technology Portfolio). Via this Joint Venture the parties commenced development of a development of an intelligent human vital signs device, suggested named qTerm. The Joint Venture completed successfully the first prototype.
