RECENT EVENTS
Coronavirus Pandemic (“COVID-19”)
In early 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. In an effort to contain COVID-19 and slow its spread, governments throughout the world, including global and regional markets served by the Company, enacted various measures, including orders to close "non-essential" businesses, isolate residents in their place of residence, and practice social distancing. These actions and the global health crisis caused by COVID-19 continue to adversely impact global business activity, which could continue to have a material negative impact on our financial performance. Each region where the Company conducts business, including North America, Europe and Asia, has been impacted by the pandemic. The timing and extent of the impact related to COVID-19 varies by country and region.
In addition to impacting the Company's financial performance during 2020, the Company experienced labor shortages and operational inefficiencies, directly related to COVID-19, as customer demand increased, primarily in the Company's Hamptonville, North Carolina operations of the Thermal Acoustical Solutions segment. As a result, the Company was unable to manufacture parts timely, leading to customer production line stoppages in some instances. Early in the fourth quarter 2020, the Company invoked force majeure, or commercial impracticability, to certain customers as the basis for delayed performance of contracts and as a legal defense to any claim that may be asserted by these customers due to the unforeseen and unforeseeable nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is not in the Company’s control. The resurgence of cases in that same facility during the fourth quarter of 2020 caused the Company to expand its declaration of force majeure, or commercial impracticability, to other impacted customers. 
As of the date of this report, all of our manufacturing facilities around the world are open. The Company has taken steps, at all locations, to mitigate the potential risks to employees and the Company posed by the spread, related circumstances, and economic impacts of COVID-19. As employees returned to work at various times during 2020, the Company implemented changes to help ensure the safety and health of all its employees and continues to assess and update its business continuity plans in the context of this pandemic. The Company established the Lydall Emergency Preparedness Team, which implemented strict travel restrictions, enforced rigorous hygiene protocols, increased sanitization efforts at all facilities, and implemented remote working arrangements for the majority of employees who work outside of our facilities. The Company will continue its efforts to maintain a safe and healthy work environment and continue to allow remote working arrangements, where appropriate, as long as necessary.
The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased worldwide and regional economic uncertainty and impacted demand for some of the Company's products in many of the markets we serve, which could continue for an unknown period-of-time. In these circumstances, there may be developments outside of our control, including the length and extent of the COVID-19 pandemic, government-imposed measures, and disruptions to the Company's supply chain, inhibiting the Company's ability to ship products and requiring it to adjust operating plans. As such, given the dynamic nature of this situation, we cannot estimate with certainty the future impacts of COVID-19 on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
See Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors", and Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations", for further discussion regarding the impact of COVID-19 on our business financial condition and results of operations.
Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets Impairment Charges
During the three-month period ended March 31, 2020, the Company began to experience disruptions in some operations from lower customer demand directly attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. Lower expected demand in automotive and other end markets due to the COVID-19 pandemic during that period resulted in a reduction in sales and cash generation projections as compared to prior projections for the Company's reporting units and a significant decrease in the Company's share price and market capitalization. As a result, the Company performed an interim quantitative impairment assessment of goodwill held at its Performance Materials and Technical Nonwovens reporting units. In addition, the Company performed an impairment assessment of a long-lived asset group of an underperforming European facility within the Performance Materials segment. As a result, the Company recorded non-cash goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges of $48.7 million and $12.4 million, respectively, for its Performance Materials segment during the three-month period ended March 31, 2020. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Estimates" in Part II, Item 7 and Note 6, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets", in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Restructuring
In the third quarter of 2020, the Company’s Performance Materials segment undertook actions to discontinue production of a lower efficiency air filtration media product and, in turn, fully depreciated the supporting machinery and equipment in North America, consolidated certain product lines, and began exiting underperforming facilities in Europe. These restructuring activities, which are projected to conclude in 2021, are expected to reduce operating costs, increase production efficiency, and enhance the Company’s flexibility by better aligning its manufacturing operations with the segment's customer base. As a result, the Company expects to record total pre-tax expenses of approximately $19.0 million to $21.0 million, primarily related to severance and employee retention expenses, in connection with these restructuring activities, of which approximately $13.2 million to $15.2 million are expected to result in cash expenditures. The Company incurred a total of $15.9 million as of December 31, 2020, of which $5.8 million were non-cash expenditures, which consisted of fully depreciating and/or amortizing long-lived assets and, to a lesser extent, writing-off inventory.
See Note 14, “Restructuring”, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

These regulations include, but are not limited to, tax, employment, privacy, governmental contracts and defense, imports/exports, healthcare, environmental protection, antitrust, anti-corruption, marketing, fraud and abuse, product safety and efficacy, and other areas.
Environmental Regulation
The Company’s operations are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign environmental regulations relating to the use, storage, handling and disposal of regulated materials, chemicals, and certain waste products. In the United States, the Company is subject to the federal regulation and control of the Environmental Protection Agency and similar agencies in various states in which we operate. In the foreign locations in which the Company operates, we are subject to similar or comparable authorities. The Company’s policy is that all operations shall, at a minimum, meet all applicable legal and regulatory environmental requirements. The Company believes that compliance with those regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, operating cash flows, capital expenditures and financial position; or our ability to compete in the industries in which the Company operates.
Although the Company believes our safety procedures for using, handling, storing, and disposing of such regulated materials, chemicals, and certain waste products comply with the standards required by federal and state laws and regulations, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these regulated materials. In the event of contamination involving such regulated materials, the Company could be liable for damages and such liability could exceed the amount of our liability insurance coverage and the resources of our business.
Regulatory Compliance
The Company has certain contracts with U.S. government agencies and entities or with entities whose projects are funded by or products sold to these agencies. At times, the Company contracts with similar government authorities outside of the U.S. and is subject, in all cases, to the applicable law. Consequently, the Company must comply with and is affected by regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of such U.S. government and other contracts governing such matters.
The Company is subject to laws concerning our business operations and marketing activities in foreign countries where we conduct business. For example, the Company is subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the 
"FCPA"), U.S. export control and trade sanction laws, and similar anti-corruption and international trade laws in certain foreign countries, such as the U.K. Bribery Act.

The Company is not aware of any regulatory compliance matters that are expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, competitive position, financial position, results of operations, capital expenditures or cash flows.
COMPETITION
Competitors include public and private companies, some of which are much larger than the Company. The Company expects the markets for our products to remain competitive. The Company believes our competitive differentiators for our products and the markets we serve include our deep materials science and applications engineering expertise; flexible, customized production assets with precision quality; and our global footprint, which is optimized to meet near sourced requirements. 
The Company's businesses generally require specialized technical expertise and proprietary manufacturing know-how. In addition, the Company has long-standing and deeply embedded customer relationships and it is important to our customers that we have a global manufacturing footprint. Each of these factors contribute to a barrier to entry for prospective new competitors. 
AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS
While the Company believes it has sufficient sources for the materials, components, services, and supplies used in its manufacturing activities, the Company is highly dependent on the availability of essential materials, parts, and tooling from its suppliers and subcontractors. The Thermal Acoustical Solutions, Technical Nonwovens and Performance Materials segments use various petroleum-derivative fibers in manufacturing products and the Performance Materials segment uses various glass-derivative fibers in manufacturing products. The Thermal Acoustical Solutions segment also uses a wide range of raw material metal alloys in the manufacturing of its products, including aluminum, aluminized steel, and stainless steel to manufacture most of its products.
Many major parts and tooling items are procured from or subcontracted on a sole-source basis with a number of domestic and non-U.S. companies. Although alternative sources generally exist for these raw materials, qualification of the sources could take a year or more.
The Company is dependent upon the ability of a large number of suppliers and subcontractors to meet performance specifications, quality standards and delivery schedules at anticipated costs. While the Company maintains an extensive qualification system to control risk associated with such reliance on third parties, failure of suppliers or subcontractors to meet commitments could adversely affect production schedules and contract profitability, while jeopardizing the Company's ability to fulfill commitments to its customers. From time to time, the Company has experienced shortages in supplied materials which has impacted its near term results; however, the Company does not foresee any near term unavailability of materials, components or supplies that would have a material adverse effect on its business. For further discussion on the possible effects of changes in the cost or availability of raw materials on the Company's business, see Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
HUMAN CAPITAL
Our employees are the foundation of the Company's business success and are the creative, strategic, and operational engine of the Company. The Company seeks to support and maintain a culture of inclusion and innovation, creativity and collaboration, and superior service to all customers, recognizing that the Company succeeds when our customers succeed. We are proud to invest in our people through competitive pay and benefits, flexibility and support in order to balance work and personal demands, and professional and personal learning and development programs. The Company's human capital is governed by various federal, state, and local regulations.

We value employee diversity from gender and race to interests, languages, and beliefs and the Company encourages employees to leverage their varied life experiences to contribute to our strong organization.
Training and Professional Development
Training is an integral part of developing and retaining our employees and creating a culture of leadership within the Company. As part of our standard onboarding program, employees complete training courses covering our commitment to leadership, diversity, ethics, Company policies, safety, preventing unconscious biases and Company values. The Company also trains employees on important environmental health and safety topics to help ensure our people, and the environment in which the Company operates, are protected. The Company further encourages employees to obtain additional training and formal education, which will assist them in their current positions and prepare them for advancement opportunities. In order to support such endeavors, the Company offers an Educational Assistance Program in which eligible employees are reimbursed for tuition and related costs. 
Compensation and Benefits
The Company's commitment to employees starts with benefit and compensation programs that value the contributions made by employees and offers physical, financial, and personal health programs to employees and their families. The Company recognizes financial stability is a critical component to an employee's well-being. In addition to competitive pay, the Company's benefit plan in the U.S. offers a 401(k) match and performance-based financial programs. Additionally, physical health programs and medical and dental coverage, help employees to feel their best on the job and at home. Full-time and part-time employees in the U.S. working 20+ hours per week are eligible for various insurance benefits, including, but not limited to, medical, dental, vision, and disability, in addition to wellness plans such as a fitness reimbursement program and a matching donation program. 
Workplace Safety
The health and safety of our employees is a top priority for the Company. We offer an Environmental, Health and Safety program that focuses on implementing related policies and training programs, and the Company monitors workplace safety regularly. During 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and in an effort to safeguard our employees from exposure, the Company implemented measures based on guidelines established by the Centers for Disease Control, the World Health Organization, and our own safety standards.
