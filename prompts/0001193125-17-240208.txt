ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 Neogen Corporation and subsidiaries (Neogen or the Company) develop, manufacture and market a diverse line of products dedicated to food and animal safety. The Companys Food Safety segment consists primarily of diagnostic test kits and complementary products (e.g., dehydrated culture media) sold to food producers and processors to detect dangerous and/or unintended substances in human food and animal feed, such as foodborne pathogens, spoilage organisms, natural toxins, food allergens, genetic modifications, ruminant by-products, meat speciation, drug residues, pesticide residues and general sanitation concerns. The diagnostic test kits are generally less expensive, easier to use and provide greater accuracy and speed than conventional diagnostic methods. The majority of the tests are disposable, single-use, immunoassay and DNA detection products that rely on the Companys proprietary antibodies and RNA and DNA testing methodologies to produce rapid and accurate test results. The Companys expanding line of food safety products also includes bioluminescence-based diagnostic technology. 
 Neogens Animal Safety segment is engaged in the development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of veterinary instruments, pharmaceuticals, vaccines, topicals, diagnostic products, rodenticides, cleaners, disinfectants, insecticides and genomics testing services for the worldwide animal safety market. The majority of these consumable products are marketed through a network of national and international distributors, as well as a number of large farm supply retail chains in the United States and Canada. The Companys USDA-licensed facility in Lansing, Michigan, produces immunostimulant products for horses and dogs, and a unique equine botulism vaccine. The Companys line of drug detection products is sold worldwide for the detection of abused and therapeutic drugs in animals and animal products, and has expanded into the human forensic market. 
 Neogens products are marketed by Company sales personnel in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom and other parts of Europe, Brazil, China, India and by distributors throughout the rest of the world. 
 Neogens mission is to be the leading company in the development and marketing of solutions for food and animal safety. To meet this vision, a growth strategy consisting of the following elements has been developed: (i) increasing sales of existing products; (ii) introducing new products and product lines; (iii) expanding international sales; and (iv) acquiring businesses and forming strategic alliances. The Company has historically been successful at increasing product sales organically and maintains an active acquisition program to identify and capitalize on opportunities to acquire new products and/or businesses. 
 Neogen Corporation was formed as a Michigan corporation in June 1981 and actual operations began in 1982. The Companys principal executive offices are located at 620 Lesher Place, Lansing, Michigan 48912-1595 and its telephone number is (517) 372-9200.

Neogen operates in two business areas: the Food Safety and the Animal Safety segments. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Form 10-K for financial information about the Companys business segments and international operations. 
 FOOD SAFETY SEGMENT 
 Neogens Food Safety segment is primarily engaged in the production and marketing of diagnostic test kits and complementary products marketed to food and feed producers and processors to detect dangerous and/or unintended substances in food and animal feed, such as foodborne pathogens, spoilage organisms, natural toxins, food allergens, genetic modifications, meat speciation, drug residues, pesticide residues and general sanitation concerns. 
 Neogens products include tests for: 
 Mycotoxins. Grain producers and processors of all types and sizes use the Companys Veratox, Agri-Screen, Reveal, Reveal Q+ and Reveal Q+ MAX tests to detect the presence of mycotoxins, including aflatoxin, deoxynivalenol, fumonisin, ochratoxin, zearalenone and T-2/HT-2 toxin, to help ensure product safety and quality in food and animal feed. 
 Food allergens. The worlds largest producers of cookies, crackers, candy, ice cream and many other processed foods use the Companys Veratox, Alert, Reveal, Reveal 3-D and BioKits testing products for food allergens to help protect their food-allergic customers from the inadvertent contamination of products with food allergens, such as peanut, milk, egg, almond, gliadin (gluten), soy and hazelnut residues. 
 Dairy antibiotics. Dairies are the primary users of Neogens BetaStar, BetaStar Combo, BetaStar 4D and Penzyme diagnostic tests to detect the presence of beta-lactam and tetracycline antibiotics in milk. The presence of these drugs in milk is a public health hazard and an economic risk to processors as it limits the milks further processing. 
 Foodborne pathogens. Meat and poultry processors, seafood processors, fruit and vegetable producers and many other market segments are the primary users of Neogens ANSR and Reveal tests for foodborne bacteria, including E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella, Listeria and Campylobacter. Neogens ANSR pathogen detection system is an isothermal amplification reaction test method which exponentially amplifies the DNA of any bacteria present in food and environmental samples to detectable levels in 10 minutes. Combined with ANSRs single enrichment step, Neogens pathogen detection method provides DNA-definitive results in a fraction of the time of other molecular detection methods. Reveals lateral flow device combines an immunoassay with chromatography for a rapid and accurate one-step result. 
 Spoilage microorganisms. Neogens Soleris and BioLumix products are used by food processors to identify the presence of spoilage organisms (e.g., yeast and mold) and other microbiological contamination in food. The systems measure microbial growth by monitoring biochemical reactions that generate a color change in the media as microorganisms grow. The sensitivity of the system allows detection in a fraction of the time needed for traditional methods, with less labor and handling time. 
 Sanitation monitoring. Neogen manufactures and markets its AccuPoint Advanced rapid sanitation test for adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a chemical found in all living cells. This easy-to-use and inexpensive test uses bioluminescence to quickly determine if a contact surface has been completely sanitized. When ATP comes into contact with the reagents contained in the test device, a reaction takes place that produces light. More light is indicative of higher levels of ATP and a need for more thorough sanitation. The Companys worldwide customer base for its ATP sanitation testing products includes food and beverage processors, the food service and healthcare industries, as well as many other users. 
 Dehydrated culture media. Neogens Acumedia and Lab M products offer dehydrated culture media for varied purposes, including traditional bacterial testing and the growth of beneficial bacteria, such as cultures for sausages and beer. The Companys customers for dehydrated culture media also include commercial and research laboratories and producers of pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and veterinary vaccines. 
 Seafood contaminants. Neogens specialty products for the seafood market include tests for histamine, a highly allergenic substance that occurs when certain species of fish begin to decay; chloramphenicol, a banned antibiotic in most of the world, but still used by some shrimp farmers to improve the yield of their products; sulfite, an effective but potentially allergenic shrimp preservative; and shellfish toxins. 
 The majority of Neogens food safety test kits use immunoassay technology to rapidly detect target substances. The Companys ability to produce high quality antibodies sets its products apart from immunoassay test kits produced and sold by other companies. The Companys kits are available in microwell formats, which allow for automated and rapid processing of a large number of samples, and lateral flow and other similar devices that provide distinct visual results. Typically, test kits use antibody-coated test devices and chemical reagents to indicate a positive or negative result for the presence of a target substance in a test sample; the simplicity of the tests makes them accessible to all levels of food producers, processors and handlers. Neogen also offers other test methods and products to complement its immunoassay tests.

The Companys test kits are generally based on internally developed technology, licensed technology, or technology that is acquired in connection with acquisitions. In fiscal 2017, the Food Safety segment incurred royalty expense totaling $1,710,000 for licenses and royalties for technology used in the Companys products, including expense of $863,000 for allergen products, $199,000 for the pathogen product line and $375,000 for licenses related to the dairy antibiotics product line. Generally, the Companys royalty rates are in the range of 2% to 10% of revenues on products containing the licensed technology. Some licenses involve technology that is exclusive to Neogens use while others are non-exclusive and involve technology licensed to multiple licensees. 
 Neogens international operations in the United Kingdom, Mexico, Brazil, China and India originally focused on the Companys Food Safety products, and each of these units reports through the Food Safety segment. In recent years, these operations have expanded to offer the Companys complete line of products and services, including those usually associated with the Animal Safety segment such as cleaners, disinfectants, rodenticides, insecticides, veterinary instruments and genomics services. These additional products and services are managed and directed by existing management, and are reported through the Food Safety segment. 
 Revenues from Neogens Food Safety segment accounted for 47.4%, 45.6% and 46.5% of the Companys total revenues for fiscal years ended May 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 ANIMAL SAFETY SEGMENT 
 Neogens Animal Safety segment is primarily engaged in the development, manufacture and marketing of veterinary instruments, pharmaceuticals, vaccines, topicals, diagnostic products, a full suite of agricultural biosecurity products, such as rodenticides, cleaners, disinfectants and insecticides, and genomics services. 
 Veterinary instruments. Neogen markets a broad line of veterinary instruments and animal health delivery systems under the Ideal brand name. Approximately 250 different products are offered, many of which are used to deliver animal health products, such as antibiotics and vaccines. Ideals D3 Needles are stronger than conventional veterinary needles and are uniquely detectable by metal detectors at meat processing facilities  a potential market advantage in the safety-conscious beef and swine industries. Neogens Prima Tech product line consists of highly accurate devices used by farmers, ranchers and veterinarians to inject animals, provide topical applications and to use for oral administration. Prima Tech is also a supplier of products used in artificial insemination in the swine industry. Other products include animal identification and handling equipment. 
 Veterinary pharmaceuticals. Animal Safetys NeogenVet product line provides innovative, value-added, high quality products to the veterinary market. Top NeogenVet products include PanaKare, a digestive aid that serves as a replacement therapy where digestion of protein, carbohydrate and fat is inadequate due to exocrine pancreatic insufficiency; Natural Vitamin E-AD, which aids in the prevention and treatment of vitamin deficiencies in swine, cattle and sheep; and RenaKare, a supplement for potassium deficiency in cats and dogs. Other products sold under the NeogenVet brand include Vita-15 and Liver 7, which are used in the treatment and prevention of nutritional deficiencies. The Company also manufactures and markets Uniprim, a leading veterinary antibiotic. 
 Veterinary biologics. Neogens BotVax B vaccine has successfully protected thousands of high-value horses and foals against Type B botulism, commonly known as Shaker Foal Syndrome. The Companys product is the only USDA-approved vaccine for the prevention of Type B botulism in horses. Years of research and many thousands of doses have proven Neogens EqStim immunostimulant to be safe and effective as a veterinarian-administered adjunct to conventional treatment of equine bacterial and viral respiratory infections. The Companys ImmunoRegulin product uses similar immunostimulant technology to aid in the treatment of pyoderma (a bacterial skin inflammation) in dogs. 
 Veterinary OTC products. Animal Safety products offered by Neogen to the retail over-the-counter (OTC) market include Ideal brand veterinary instruments packaged for the retail market. OTC products also include Stress-Dex, an oral electrolyte replacer for performance horses, and Fura-Zone, for the prevention and treatment of surface bacterial infections in wounds, burns and cutaneous ulcers. Ag-Tek and other hoof care, disposables and artificial insemination supplies are marketed to the dairy and veterinary industries. 
 Rodenticides. Neogens comprehensive line of proven rodenticides, sold under brand names such as Ramik and Havoc, effectively address rodent problems of any size and serve as a critical component of an overall biosecurity plan for animal protein production operations. Neogen offers several rodenticide active ingredients including diphacinone, bromethalin, brodifacoum, and zinc phosphide formulated with food grade ingredients to generate the highest acceptance and most palatable bait possible. 
 Cleaners and disinfectants. Used in animal and food production facilities, Neogens cleaners and disinfectants, including DC&R, 904 Disinfectant, Acid-A-Foam, Preserve, Tetradyne and FarmFluid S, can stop a disease outbreak before it starts. The products also are used in the veterinary clinic market to maintain sanitary conditions and limit the potential hazards of bacteria, fungi and viruses. 
 Insecticides. Neogens highly effective insecticides utilize environmentally friendly technical formulas, and several are approved for use in food establishments. The companys Prozap insecticide brand is well known in the large animal production industry, particularly with dairy and equine producers. 
 Animal genomics services. Neogens animal genomics businesses, GeneSeek and Igenity, provide value-added services to leading agricultural genetics providers, large national cattle associations, companion animal breed registries, university researchers, and numerous commercial beef and dairy cattle, swine and poultry producers. With state-of-the-art genetics laboratories and the comprehensive bioinformatics to interpret genetic test results, Neogen offers identity and trait determination and analysis. GeneSeeks technology employs high-resolution DNA genotyping for identity and trait analysis in a variety of important animal and agricultural plant species. Igenitys extensive bioinformatics database identifies and predicts an animals positive or negative traits based on DNA test results. This information has helped livestock producers make significant improvements in the genomic makeup and overall quality of their animals.

Life sciences. Neogens line of approximately 100 drug detection immunoassay test kits is sold worldwide for the detection of approximately 300 abused and therapeutic drugs in farm animals and racing animals, and for detection of drug residues in meat and meat products. The test kits are also used for human forensic toxicology drug screening applications. This line includes tests for narcotics, analgesics, stimulants, depressants, tranquilizers, anesthetics, steroids and diuretics. Neogen also has several products used by researchers for the detection of biologically active substances. 
 Many of the products and services in the Animal Safety segment use licensed technology. Animal Safety incurred royalty expense totaling $949,000 for licenses and royalties in fiscal 2017 for technology used in the segments products and services, including expense of $410,000 for licenses related to the genomics services line. 
 Revenues from Neogens Animal Safety segment accounted for 52.6%, 54.4% and 53.5% of the Companys total revenues for fiscal years ended May 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 GENERAL SALES AND MARKETING 
 Neogen is organized under two segments  Food Safety and Animal Safety. Within these segments, the Companys sales efforts are generally organized by specific markets, rather than by products or geography. During the fiscal year that ended May 31, 2017, the Company had approximately 23,000 customers for its products. Since many customers for animal safety products are distributors, and certain animal safety products are offered to the general retail market, the total number of end users of the Companys products is considerably greater than 23,000. As of May 31, 2017, a total of 375 employees were assigned to sales and marketing functions within the Company, compared to 348 at the end of May 2016. During the years ended May 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, no single customer or distributor accounted for 10% or more of the Companys revenues. 
DOMESTIC SALES AND MARKETING 
 FOOD SAFETY 
 To reach each customer and prospect with expertise and experience, Neogen has a staff of specialized food safety sales and technical service representatives assigned to specific markets. This staff sells Company products directly to end users, and also handles technical support issues that arise with customers in the United States and Canada. 
 Neogens food safety markets are primarily comprised of: milling and grain, including grain elevators, feed mills, pet food manufacturers, and grain inspection companies; meat and poultry, including meat and poultry processors, producers of ready-to-eat meat and poultry products, and the USDAs Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS); grocery products, including flour millers, malters, bakeries, candy and confection manufacturers, manufacturers of prepared meals, nuts, spices, cookies, crackers and other snack foods; fruits and vegetables, including growers and processors of juice and packaged fresh cut grocery items; seafood, including harvesters and processors of a wide variety of seafood products; dairy, including milk and yogurt processors; beverage, including soft drink bottlers and beer and wine producers; healthcare, including hospitals and distributors to the healthcare industry; traditional culture media markets, including commercial and research laboratories and producers of pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and veterinary vaccines; food service, including fast food service establishments and retail grocery market chains, and nutraceuticals, including producers and marketers of a wide variety of nutritional and holistic consumer products.

As a commercial laboratory, GeneSeek provides genomics services direct to large-herd beef and dairy cattle, swine, poultry and sheep producers, universities and other research organizations, and various livestock and canine breed associations. 
 INTERNATIONAL SALES AND MARKETING 
 Neogen maintains 10 Company-owned locations outside of the United States to provide a direct presence in regions of particular importance to the Company, and maintains an extensive network of distributors to reach countries where the Company does not have a direct presence. 
 Neogen Europe. Neogen Europe, Ltd., located in Ayr, Scotland, provides the Company access to the European Union (E.U.), and sells products and services to its network of customers and distributors throughout the E.U. Customers in the United Kingdom, France, Germany and the Netherlands are served by Company employees. In other European regions, customers are generally serviced by distributors managed by Neogen Europe personnel. Neogen Europes research and development team continues to be a strong asset in the development of products tailored to meet the unique requirements of the European market. Neogen Europe management is also responsible for sales and marketing for the Companys England-based Lab M and Quat-Chem businesses. In August 2015, Neogen acquired the stock of Lab M Holdings (Lab M), a developer, manufacturer and supplier of microbiological culture media and diagnostic systems located in Heywood, England. Lab Ms extensive range of microbiological culture media, supplements, immunomagnetic separation techniques and proficiency testing systems are used in laboratories around the world. In December 2016, Neogen acquired Quat-Chem Ltd., a Rochdale, England-based chemical company specializing in the development, manufacture and sale of agricultural, industrial, and food processing biocidal hygiene products, including cleaners and disinfectants. Quat-Chem sells its products on a global basis, with a focus on the United Kingdom, European Union, Middle East and Asia. 
 Neogen Latinoamérica. The Companys subsidiary in Mexico, Neogen Latinoamérica, is headquartered near Mexico City and distributes Neogens products throughout Mexico and Central America. Neogen Latinoamérica manages the Companys business activities throughout the region to animal and crop producers and food processors, utilizing its direct sales representatives to sell Food Safety products and marketing cleaners, disinfectants and other Animal Safety products through distributors. 
 Neogen do Brasil. Neogen do Brasil (translated as Neogen of Brazil), headquartered near São Paulo, distributes Neogens products throughout Brazil. Brazil is one of the world leaders in the export of numerous food commodities, including beef, poultry, soybeans, coffee, sugar and orange juice, and this operation gives the Company direct sales representation to these important markets. Neogen do Brasil management is also responsible for sales and marketing for the Companys Brazil-based Deoxi and Rogama businesses. Neogen owns Deoxi Biotecnologia Ltda, a genomics testing laboratory located in Aracatuba, Brazil, which it purchased in April 2016. In December 2016, Neogen acquired Brazil-based Rogama Indústria e Comércio Ltda., a company which develops, manufactures and markets rodenticides and insecticides. Rogama was founded in 1979 and offers more than 70 registered pest control products to Brazils agronomic, professional, and retail markets. 
 Neogen China. Neogens Chinese subsidiary, with offices in Shanghai and Beijing, employs sales representatives who sell directly to Chinese customers. Chinas burgeoning middle class, with its rapidly growing demand for higher quality meat and dairy products, makes the country a substantial growth opportunity for Neogen products  both for animal production on the countrys farms, and in processing plants throughout Chinas food production and distribution channels. The Company utilizes both direct sales representatives and distributors to market its complete portfolio. 
 Neogen India. In June 2015, Neogen acquired the assets of Sterling Test House, a leading commercial food testing laboratory based in southwest India, to serve as a base for the Companys operations in India. Sterling Test House was incorporated in 1990, and its business includes food safety and water quality testing for major hotels and restaurants in its home region, as well as safety and quality analysis for the countrys expanding nutraceutical market, and growing food export businesses. The laboratory is located in Kochi, in the state of Kerala, which is Indias leading region for the export of spices, tea, and fresh fruits and vegetables. In late fiscal 2016, Neogen transferred sales responsibility for its Food Safety products directly to sales representatives at Neogen India. 
 Neogen Canada. In September 2015, Neogen opened a Canadian location in Guelph, Ontario. Currently, this office is used for genomics sales and sample reception, and reports through the Animal Safety segment.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 
 Management maintains a strong commitment to Neogens research and development activities. The Companys product development efforts are focused on the enhancement of existing products and in the development of new products that fit its business strategy. As of May 31, 2017, the Company employed 92 individuals in its worldwide research and development group, including immunologists, chemists and microbiologists. Research and development costs were approximately $10.4 million, $9.9 million and $9.6 million representing 2.9%, 3.1% and 3.4% of total revenues in fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Management currently expects the Companys future research and development expenditures to approximate 3% to 4% of total revenues. 
 Neogen has ongoing development projects for a number of new and improved diagnostic tests and other complementary products for both the food safety and animal safety markets. Management expects that a number of these products will be commercially available at various times during fiscal years 2018 to 2020. 
 Portions of certain technologies utilized in some products manufactured and marketed by Neogen were acquired from or developed in collaboration with affiliated partnerships, independent scientists, governmental units, universities and other third parties. The Company has entered into agreements with these parties that provide for the payment of license fees and royalties based upon sales of products that utilize the pertinent technology. License fees and royalties, expensed to sales and marketing, under these agreements amounted to $2,659,000, $1,969,000 and $2,189,000 in fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 PROPRIETARY PROTECTION AND APPROVALS 
 Neogen uses trade secrets as proprietary protection in many of its food and animal safety products. In many cases, the Company has developed unique antibodies capable of detecting microorganisms and residues at minute levels. The supply of these antibodies, and the proprietary techniques utilized for their development, may offer better protection than the filing of patents. Such proprietary reagents are maintained in secure facilities and stored in more than one location to reduce exposure to complete destruction by natural disaster or other means. 
 Patent and trademark applications are submitted whenever appropriate. Since its inception, Neogen has acquired and received numerous patents and trademarks, and has several pending patents and trademarks. The patents expire at various times over the next 22 years. 
 A summary of patents by product categories follows: 
 

 | USA | | International | | Expiration
Natural Toxins, Allergens, & Drug Residues | | 6 | | 31 | | 2018-2038
Bacterial & General Sanitation | | 17 | | 18 | | 2017-2030
Life Sciences | | 0 | | 7 | | 2024 
Veterinary Instruments & Other | | 14 | | 32 | | 2017-2039
Genomics Services | | 7 | | 1 | | 2021-2029

 The Company does not expect the near-term expiration of any patent to have a significant effect on future results of operations. 
 Management believes that Neogen has adequate protection regarding proprietary rights for its products. However, it is aware that substantial research has taken place at universities, governmental agencies and other companies throughout the world and that numerous patents have been applied for and issued for technologies which may be used in the Companys products. To the extent some of the Companys products may now, or in the future, embody technologies protected by patents, copyrights or trade secrets of others, licenses to use such technologies may need to be obtained in order to continue to sell the products. These licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. Failure to obtain any such licenses may delay or prevent the sale of certain new or existing products. In addition, patent litigation is not uncommon. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Companys existing patents will be sufficient to completely protect its proprietary rights. 
 One of the major areas affecting the success of biotechnology development involves the time, cost and uncertainty surrounding regulatory approvals. Neogen products requiring regulatory approval, which the Company currently has in place, include BotVax B, EqStim, ImmunoRegulin, Uniprim and BetaStar. The Companys general strategy is to select technical and proprietary products that do not require mandatory approval to be marketed. Neogens rodenticide, disinfectant and insecticide products are subject to registration in the United States and internationally. 
 Neogen utilizes third-party validations on many of its disposable test kits as a marketing tool to provide its customers with assurances that the Companys products perform to specified levels. These include validation by the AOAC International, independently administered third-party, multi-laboratory collaborative studies and approvals by the U.S. Federal Grain Inspection Service and the USDA Food Safety Inspection Service for the use of Company products in their operations.

PRODUCTION AND SUPPLY 
 Neogen manufactures its products in Michigan, Kentucky, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Iowa, Tennessee, California, the United Kingdom and Brazil and provides genomics services in Nebraska, Scotland and Brazil. As of May 31, 2017, there were approximately 680 full-time employees assigned to manufacturing and providing of services in these locations, operating on one or two shifts; with occasional 24/7 production during high demand periods. Future demand increases could be accommodated by adding shifts. Management believes it could increase the current output of its primary product lines by more than 50% using the current space available; however, to do so would require investment in additional capital equipment. 
 Food safety diagnostics. Manufacturing of diagnostic tests for the detection of natural toxins, pathogens, food allergens, dairy antibiotics, spoilage organisms and pesticides, final kit assembly, quality assurance and shipping takes place in the Companys facilities in Lansing, Michigan. Proprietary monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies for Neogens diagnostic kits are produced on a regular schedule in the Companys immunology laboratories in Lansing. Generally, final assembly and shipment of diagnostic test kits to customers in Europe is performed in the Companys Ayr, Scotland facility. Assembly and shipment of electronic readers and disposable single-use samplers takes place in the Companys facilities in Lansing. Soleris and BioLumix instrument readers are produced by third party vendors to the Companys specifications, quality tested in Lansing, and then shipped to customers. Dehydrated culture media products are manufactured in a FDA-registered facility in Lansing and also in Heywood, England. Products are blended following strict formulations or custom blended to customer specification and shipped directly to customers from Lansing and Heywood. 
 Animal health products. Manufacturing of animal health products, pharmacological diagnostic test kits and test kits for drug residues takes place in the Companys FDA-registered facilities in Lexington, Kentucky. In general, manufacturing operations including reagent manufacturing, quality assurance, final kit assembly and packaging are performed by Neogen personnel. Certain animal health products and veterinary instruments that are purchased finished or that are toll manufactured by third party vendors are warehoused and shipped from the Companys Lexington facilities. Other veterinary instruments are produced in the Companys facilities in Lansing, and are generally then shipped to Lexington, for distribution to customers. Manufacturing and shipment of devices used for animal injections, topical applications and oral administration takes place in a Company-owned facility in Kenansville, North Carolina. 
 Veterinary biologics. Neogen maintains a Lansing-based USDA-approved manufacturing facility devoted to the production of the biologic products EqStim and ImmunoRegulin. P. acnes seed cultures are added to media and then subjected to several stages of further processing resulting in a finished product that is filled and packaged within the facility. The Companys BotVax B vaccine is also produced in the Lansing facility utilizing Type B botulism seed cultures and a traditional fermentation process. All completed biologic products are then shipped to Neogens Lexington facilities for inventory and distribution to customers. 
 Agricultural genomics services. Neogen offers agricultural genomics laboratory services and bioinformatics at its locations in Lincoln, Nebraska; Ayr, Scotland; and Aracatuba, Brazil. Through its laboratory services and bioinformatics (primarily in beef and dairy cattle, pigs, sheep, poultry, horses and dogs), GeneSeek empowers its customers to speed genetic improvement efforts, as well as identify economically important diseases. In fiscal 2016, the Company added to its processing capabilities in Scotland, while also purchasing a genomics business in Brazil to enhance its presence there. 
 Cleaners, disinfectants and rodenticides. Manufacturing of rodenticides and/or cleaners and disinfectants takes place in the following locations: Randolph, Wisconsin; Memphis, Tennessee; Turlock, California; Rochdale, England; and Pindamonhangaba, Brazil. Manufacturing of rodenticides consists of blending technical material (active ingredient) with bait consisting principally of various grains. Certain cleaners and disinfectants are manufactured in Neogen facilities, while others are purchased from other manufacturers for resale, or toll manufactured by third parties. 
 Pesticides. Neogen manufactures insecticides and other pesticides at its facilities in Pleasantville, Iowa and Pindamonhangaba, Brazil. 
 Neogen purchases component parts and raw materials from more than 900 suppliers. Though many of these items are purchased from a single source in order to achieve the greatest volume discounts, the Company believes it has identified acceptable alternative suppliers for most of its key components and raw materials where it is economically feasible to do so. There can be no assurance that the Company would avoid a disruption of supply in the event a supplier discontinues shipment of product. Shipments of products are generally accomplished within a 48-hour turnaround time. As a result of this quick response time, Neogens backlog of unshipped orders at any given time has historically not been significant.

COMPETITION 
 Although competitors vary in individual markets, management knows of no competitor that is pursuing Neogens fundamental strategy of developing and marketing a broad line of products, ranging from disposable tests and dehydrated culture media to veterinary pharmaceuticals and instruments for a large number of food safety and animal safety concerns. For each of its individual products, the Company faces intense competition from companies ranging from small businesses to divisions of large multinational companies. Some of these organizations have substantially greater financial resources than the Company. Neogen competes primarily on the basis of ease of use, speed, accuracy and other similar performance characteristics of its products. The breadth of the Companys product line, the effectiveness of its sales and customer service organizations, and pricing are also components in managements competitive plan. 
 Future competition may become even more intense, and could result from the development of new technologies, which could affect the marketability and profitability of Neogens products. The Companys competitive position will also depend on managements ability to develop proprietary products, attract and retain qualified scientific and other personnel, develop and implement production and marketing plans and obtain patent protection. Additionally, the Company must have adequate capital resources to execute its strategy. 
 FOOD SAFETY: 
 With a large professional sales organization offering a comprehensive catalog of food safety solutions, management believes the Company maintains a general advantage over competitors offering only limited product lines. In most cases, Neogen sales and technical service personnel can offer unique insight into a customers numerous safety and quality challenges, and offer testing and other solutions to help the customer overcome those challenges. 
 Competition for pathogen detection products includes traditional methods and antibody and genetic-based platforms; competition for natural toxins and allergen detection products include instrumentation and antibody-based tests. While the Companys offerings will not always compete on all platforms in all markets, the products that are offered provide tests that can be utilized by most customers to meet their testing needs. 
 Besides its extensive product offerings and robust distribution network, the Company focuses its competitive advantage in the areas of customer service, product performance, speed and ease of use of its products. Additionally, by aggressively maintaining itself as a low-cost producer, Neogen believes that it can be competitive with new market entrants that may choose a low pricing strategy in an attempt to gain market share. 
 ANIMAL SAFETY: 
 Neogens Animal Safety segment faces no one competitor across the products and markets it serves. In the racing industry market, the Company believes it holds a leading market share position. In the life sciences and forensic markets, the Company competes against several other diagnostic and reagent companies with similar product offerings. 
 In the veterinary market, Neogen markets BotVax B, the only USDA-approved vaccine for the prevention of botulism Type B in horses. The Company competes on other key products through differentiated product performance and superior customer and technical support. With some of its products, the Company provides solutions as a lower cost alternative and offers a private label option for its distributors. 
 Competition in the rodenticide market includes several companies of comparable size that offer products into similar market segments. The retail rodenticide market is not dominated by a single brand. While the technical materials used by competing companies are similar, Neogen uses manufacturing and bait formula techniques which the Company believes may better attract rodents to the product and thereby improves overall product performance. 
 Within the insecticide market, the Companys products specifically focus on the area of insect control for food and animal safety applications. There are several competitors offering similar products, however, the Company has a proprietary formulation chemistry that optimizes the delivery and safe application of insecticides at the customers location. These products are currently only sold in the U.S. through a combination of direct sales and distributors. 
 Numerous companies, including a number of large multinationals, compete for sales in the cleaner and disinfectant product segment. Neogens broad line of products are sold through its distributor network around the world, primarily to assist in the cleaning and disinfecting of animal production facilities. 
 In addition to the Companys extensive portfolio of Animal Safety products, Neogen also competes in the retail market by providing solutions to common retail problems, such as stock outs, wasted floor space and inconsistent brand identity. The Company differentiates itself by offering planograms and convenient reordering systems to maximize turns and profitability for its retail customers.

GeneSeek, the leading commercial agricultural genomics laboratory in the U.S., employs cutting-edge technology in the area of genomics. The result of this technology allows the acceleration of natural selection through selective breeding of traits such as disease resistance, yield improvement and meat quality. Competition comes mainly from a number of service providers, whose primary focus are the human and pharmaceutical industries, as well as several smaller companies offering genomics services. GeneSeek is not involved in cloning or the development of transgenic animals. 
 GOVERNMENT REGULATION 
 A significant portion of Neogens products and revenues are affected by the regulations of various domestic and foreign government agencies, including the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Changes in these regulations could affect revenues and/or costs of production and distribution. 
 Neogens development and manufacturing processes involve the use of certain hazardous materials, chemicals and compounds. Management believes that the Companys safety procedures for handling and disposing of such commodities comply with the standards prescribed by federal, state and local regulations; however, changes in such regulations or rules could involve significant costs to the Company and could be materially adverse to its business. 
 The rodenticides, insecticides, cleaners, disinfectants and sanitizers manufactured and distributed by Neogen are subject to EPA and various state regulations. In general, any international sale of the product must also comply with similar regulatory requirements in the country of destination. Each country has its own individual regulatory construct with specific requirements (e.g., label in the language of the importing country). To the best of the Companys knowledge, Neogen products are in compliance with applicable regulations in the countries where such products are sold. 
 Dairy products used in National Conference on Interstate Milk Shipments (NCIMS) and other milk monitoring programs are regulated by the FDA. Before products requiring FDA approval can be sold in the U.S., extensive product performance data must be submitted in accordance with the FDA-approved protocol administered by the AOAC Research Institute (AOAC RI). Following approval of a product by the FDA, the product must also be approved by NCIMS, an oversight body that includes federal, state and industry representatives. The Companys BetaStar U.S. dairy antibiotic residue testing product has been approved by the FDA, NCIMS, and AOAC RI. While some foreign countries accept AOAC RI approval as part of their regulatory approval processes, many countries have their own regulatory requirements. 
 Many of the food safety diagnostic products to detect allergens and spoilage organisms do not require direct government approval. However, the Company has pursued AOAC approval for many of these products to enhance their marketability. Products for mycotoxin detection, which are used by federal inspectors, must be approved by the USDA. Neogen has obtained and retained the necessary approvals to conduct its current operations. 
 Neogens veterinary vaccine products and some pharmaceutical products require government approval to allow for lawful sales. The vaccine products are approved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Center for Veterinary Biologics (USDA-CVB) and the pharmaceutical products are approved by the FDA. The products, and the facilities in which they are manufactured, are in a position of good standing with both agencies. The Company has had no warning letters based on any review of these products or facility inspection, no recalls on any of these products, and knows of no reason why it could not manufacture and market such products in the future. 
 Other animal safety and food safety products generally do not require additional registrations or approvals. However, Neogens regulatory staff routinely monitors amendments to current regulatory requirements to ensure compliance. 
 EMPLOYEES 
 As of May 31, 2017, the Company employed 1,413 full-time persons worldwide. None of the employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. There have been no work stoppages or slowdowns due to labor-related problems, and management believes that its relationship with its employees is generally good. Employees having access to proprietary information have executed confidentiality agreements with the Company.
