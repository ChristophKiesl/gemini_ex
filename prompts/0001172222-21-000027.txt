ITEM 1.    BUSINESS.
Overview
Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. (the Company, Holdings, we, us, and our) is a holding company incorporated in the State of Delaware. The Company's primary asset is sole ownership of all issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Hawaiian Airlines, Inc. (Hawaiian). Hawaiian was originally incorporated in January 1929 under the laws of the Territory of Hawai'i and became our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary pursuant to a corporate restructuring that was consummated in August 2002. Hawaiian became a Delaware corporation and the Company's direct wholly-owned subsidiary concurrent with its reorganization and reacquisition by the Company in June 2005.
Our Business
We are engaged in the scheduled air transportation of passengers and cargo amongst the Hawaiian Islands (the Neighbor Island routes), between the Hawaiian Islands and certain cities in the United States (the North America routes, and together with the Neighbor Island routes, the Domestic routes), and between the Hawaiian Islands and the South Pacific, Australia, New Zealand and Asia (the International routes), collectively referred to as our Scheduled Operations. We offer non-stop service to Hawai'i from more U.S. gateway cities (13) than any other airline, and also provide approximately 76 daily flights between the Hawaiian Islands. In addition, we operate various charter flights.
We are the longest serving airline, as well as the largest airline headquartered, in the State of Hawai'i, and the 11th largest domestic airline in the United States based on revenue passenger miles (RPMs) reported by the Research and Innovative Technology Administration Bureau of Transportation Services as of October 2020, the latest data available.
At December 31, 2020, our fleet consisted of 19 Boeing 717-200 aircraft for the Neighbor Island routes and 24 Airbus A330-200 aircraft and 18 Airbus A321-200 for the North America and International routes (inclusive of charter flights). We also own four ATR42 aircraft for the "Ohana by Hawaiian" Neighbor Island service and four ATR72 aircraft for our Neighbor Island cargo operations. During the first quarter of 2019, we retired the last of our Boeing 767-300 fleet, completing the transition to our A321 aircraft, and allowing for optimization of our products and better management of capacity. 
Our goal is to be the number one destination carrier serving Hawai'i. We are devoted to the travel needs of the residents of and visitors to Hawai'i and we offer a unique travel experience. We are strongly rooted in the culture and people of Hawai'i and we seek to provide high quality service to our customers that exemplifies the spirit of Aloha.
Purpose and Values
Our purpose is to connect people with Aloha. It captures how we bring people closer together, and how we share the aloha spirit with the people and places we serve. It is core to who we are, how we see the world and how we engage with the people and places around us. Aloha is a way of life, but also a choice each of our employees makes every day, constantly striving to be the very best we can be. With aloha in everything we do, we share moments and our spirit with guests and each other. 
Our values, reflected below, guide how we act, lead, and make decisions:
•Mālama (Care): We care about the people and places we serve, and personally commit to their well-being 
•Ho‘okipa (Hospitality): We are genuine hosts, welcoming people into our home with warmth, gratitude and full hearts 
•Lōkahi (Collaboration): We come together in harmony, always seeking better ways to succeed as a team 
•Po‘okela (Excellence): We strive for excellence, competing to thrive
Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic
Due to the rapid and unprecedented spread of COVID-19, what began with suspension of our service to South Korea and Japan in late February 2020 accelerated in March 2020 when governments instituted requirements of self-isolation or quarantine for incoming travel. This was followed by the announcement in late March 2020 and early April 2020 of a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all travelers to, from and within the State of Hawai'i, respectively. On December 17, 2020, the mandatory self-quarantine period was reduced from 14 to 10 days. These restrictions, combined with the ongoing spread and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic globally, have continued to significantly suppress customer demand, which remains at historically low levels.
Restrictions for travel to and within the State of Hawai'i as well as travel to and from various international locations, including those in the Hawaiian network, remain in effect. Since October 15, 2020, the State of Hawai'i has allowed travelers coming to Hawai'i from the mainland U.S. to bypass the quarantine requirement with proof of a negative COVID-19 test from a state-
approved testing partner (the pre-travel testing program), and the pre-travel testing program has since been expanded to include international travelers from Japan, South Korea, and Canada. The State of Hawai'i and counties within the state continue to evaluate and update testing requirements for travel to and within the state, including the required timing of testing results and the expansion of the pre-travel testing program to travelers from other international locations. In addition to restrictions mandated by the State of Hawai'i, on January 21, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that requires international travelers to produce proof of a recent negative COVID-19 test prior to entry into the United States and comply with applicable Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines concerning international travel, including recommended periods of self-quarantine after entry into the United States.
Following the announcement and implementation of the pre-travel testing program, we saw an increase in bookings and have begun rebuilding our North America, Neighbor Island and International flight schedules commensurate with anticipated increases in demand. During the fourth quarter, we reinstated non-stop service from Honolulu to Las Vegas, Phoenix, San Jose, Oakland, New York and Boston, thereby restoring service to all of our pre-pandemic origin points on the U.S. mainland, as well as non-stop service from Honolulu to Tokyo (Haneda and Narita), Japan, Osaka, Japan, and Seoul, South Korea. While we doubled our capacity during the fourth quarter of 2020, as compared to the third quarter of 2020, our capacity was down approximately 72% compared to the same period in 2019. In December 2020, we announced the addition of three new U.S. mainland cities: Austin, Texas, Orlando, Florida, and Ontario, California with service to and from Honolulu, Hawai'i, beginning on April 21, March 11, and March 16, 2021, respectively. We also expanded service with daily non-stop flights between Kahului, Hawai'i and Long Beach, California commencing in March 2021.
While certain markets have reopened, others, particularly international markets, remain closed or continue to enforce extended quarantines, including as new strains of COVID-19 are identified. There can be no assurance whether, at some point, other counties or the entire State of Hawai'i may limit or suspend the pre-travel testing program should the prevalence of the COVID-19 pandemic worsen. For example, the County of Kaua'i suspended its participation in the statewide pre-travel testing program in late November and, effective January 5, 2021, resumed its participation in the pre-travel testing program for interisland travelers and instituted an Enhanced Movement Quarantine pre- and post-travel testing program for transpacific travelers. The United States and international governments could also impose, extend or otherwise modify existing travel restrictions on international travel into the United States. As a result of all the factors above, and our results to date, we expect bookings and revenue and results of operations to continue to be volatile with revenue trends experienced in the fourth quarter of 2020 to continue in the first quarter of 2021. These trends may result in decreases to existing or anticipated levels, which decreases could be material. We will continue to assess our routes and schedule in response to changes in demand, including related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented enhanced safety protocols focusing on our staff and guests, while at the same time working to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on our financial position and operations.
•Guest and Employee Experience. We have implemented enhanced cleaning procedures and guest-facing protocols in an effort to minimize the risk of transmission of COVID-19.
•Capacity Impacts. In response to reduced passenger demand as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we significantly reduced system capacity beginning late in the first quarter of 2020 to a level that maintained essential services, made adjustments to better align capacity with expected passenger demand throughout 2020 and expect to continue to make capacity adjustments throughout 2021.
•Expense Management. In response to the reduction in revenue we experienced in 2020, we have implemented, and will continue to implement as necessary, cost savings and liquidity measures.
•Cash Flow and Liquidity Management. Our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2020 was approximately $864.4 million as a result of various actions taken to increase liquidity and strengthen our financial position during 2020.
Flight Operations
Our flight operations are based in Honolulu, Hawai'i. Due to effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we significantly reduced system capacity to a level that maintained essential services to align capacity with expected demand. At December 31, 2020, we operated 118 scheduled flights with:
•Daily service on our North America routes between the State of Hawai'i and Long Beach, Los Angeles, Oakland, Sacramento, San Diego, San Francisco, and San Jose, California; Las Vegas, Nevada; Portland, Oregon; and Seattle, Washington; and scheduled service between the State of Hawai'i and Boston, Massachusetts; Phoenix, Arizona; and New York City, New York.
•Daily service on our Neighbor Island routes among the six major islands of the State of Hawai'i.
•Scheduled service on our International routes between the State of Hawai'i and Tokyo (Haneda and Narita), Japan, Osaka, Japan; and Seoul, South Korea.
•In addition, we operate various ad hoc charters.
As of December 31, 2020, we have suspended flights to the following destinations through at least the end of the second quarter of 2021. 
•Service between the State of Hawai'i and Pago Pago, American Samoa; Papeete, Tahiti; Sydney, Australia, Brisbane, Australia; Auckland, New Zealand; Sapporo, Japan; and Fukuoka, Japan.
Fuel
Our results of operations are significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel. The following table shows our aircraft fuel consumption and costs:
Year | Gallonsconsumed | Total cost,including taxes | | Average costper gallon | Percent ofoperating expenses
 | (in thousands) | | | 
2020 | 106,225 | | $ | 161,363 | | $ | 1.52 | 10.8 | %
2019 | 270,001 | | $ | 542,573 | | $ | 2.01 | 21.7 | %
2018 | 273,783 | | $ | 599,544 | | $ | 2.19 | 23.8 | %

As illustrated by the table above, fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our operating expenses. We purchase aircraft fuel at prevailing market prices, and seek to manage economic risks associated with fluctuations in aircraft fuel prices by entering into various derivative financial instruments.
Aircraft Maintenance
Our aircraft maintenance programs consist of a series of phased or continuous checks for each aircraft type. These checks are performed at specified intervals measured by calendar months, time flown, and by the number of takeoffs and landings, or cycles operated. In addition, we perform inspections, repairs, and modifications of our aircraft in response to FAA directives. We perform checks ranging from "walk around" inspections by our pilots before each flight's departure to major overhauls of the airframes which can take several weeks to complete. Aircraft engines are subject to phased maintenance programs designed to detect and remedy potential problems before they occur. Certain airframe and engine parts and components, whose service lives are time or cycle controlled, are replaced or refurbished prior to the expiration of their time or cycle limits. We have contracts with third parties to provide certain maintenance on our aircraft and aircraft engines.
Marketing and Ticket Distribution
We utilize various distribution channels for marketing and ticket distribution including our website www.hawaiianairlines.com, (primarily for our North America and Neighbor Island routes) and travel agencies and wholesale distributors (primarily for our International routes).
Our website is available in English, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese and offers our customers information on our flight schedules and status, information on our HawaiianMiles frequent flyer program, the ability to book reservations on our flights or connecting flights with any of our code-share partners, and the ability to purchase hotel, car and vacation packages. We also distribute our fares through online travel agencies. 
Frequent Flyer Program
The HawaiianMiles frequent flyer program was initiated in 1983 predominantly serving the intra-Hawai'i markets. At December 2020, the HawaiianMiles program has continued to grow, with approximately 10 million total members and approximately 2.5 million active members across Hawai'i, North America and the Pacific Rim. Approximately 58% of frequent flyer program members reside in the U.S. mainland, 26% live in Hawai'i, and the remainder live in our international markets. 
HawaiianMiles allows passengers to earn mileage credits by flying with us and our partner carriers. In addition, members earn mileage credits for patronage with our other program partners, including credit card issuers, hotels, car rental firms, and general merchants pursuant to our exchange partnership agreements. We also sell mileage credits to other companies participating in the program. Our Pualani Gold and Platinum status levels recognize our top fliers with enhanced benefits such as priority airport experiences, Premier Club access, seat upgrades and additional baggage allowances. With a large Hawai'i-based route network, our program has developed an extensive network of partnerships with leading local (Hawai'i) companies that allow members to earn miles beyond their flight activity. Partnerships in key spend categories such as grocery, retail, dining, banking and home improvement provide opportunities for member engagement and third-party revenues.
HawaiianMiles members have a choice of various awards based on accumulated mileage credits, with most of the awards being redeemed for free air travel on Hawaiian.
HawaiianMiles accounts with no activity (frequent flyer miles earned or redeemed) for 18 months automatically expire. The number of free travel awards used for travel on Hawaiian was approximately 174,000 in 2020. The number of free travel awards as a percentage of total revenue passengers was approximately 5% and 6% in 2020 and 2019, respectively. We believe displacement of revenue passengers by passengers using free travel awards is minimal due to our ability to manage frequent flyer seat inventory, and the relatively low ratio of free award usage to total revenue passengers.
Code-Share and Other Alliances
We have marketing alliances with other airlines that provide reciprocal frequent flyer mileage accrual and redemption privileges and code-shares on certain flights. These programs enhance our revenue opportunities by:
•increasing value to our customers by providing easier access to more travel destinations and better mileage accrual/redemption opportunities;
•giving customers access to more connecting traffic from other airlines; and
•providing members of our alliance partners' frequent flyer programs an opportunity to travel on our system while earning mileage credit in the alliance partners' programs.
Our marketing alliances with other airlines as of December 31, 2020 were as follows:

Competition
The airline industry is highly competitive. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the airline industry are:
•Fares;
•Flight frequency and schedule;
•Customer service;
•On-time performance and reliability;
•Name recognition;
•Marketing affiliations;
•Frequent flyer benefits;
•Aircraft type;
•Change fee waivers;
•Safety record; and
•In-flight services.
Domestic—We face multiple competitors on our North America routes including major network carriers such as Alaska (AS), American Airlines (AA), United Airlines (UA), Delta Airlines (DL), and Southwest Airlines (WN). Various charter companies also provide non-scheduled service to Hawai'i, mostly under public charter arrangements. Our Neighbor Island competitors consist of interisland carriers, which include Mokulele Airlines, Southwest Airlines, and a number of other "air taxi" companies.
International—Although certain of these routes were temporarily suspended as of December 31, 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are the only provider of direct service between Honolulu and each of Sapporo, Japan; Fukuoka, Japan; Pago Pago, American Samoa; and Papeete, Tahiti. However, we face multiple competitors from both domestic and foreign carriers on our other international routes.
Employees
As of December 31, 2020, we had 5,278 active employees, of whom approximately 79.0% were covered by labor agreements with the following organized labor groups:
Employee Group | Represented by | Number of Employees | Agreement amendable on (*)
Flight deck crew members | Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) | 773 | | July 1, 2022 
Cabin crew members | Association of Flight Attendants (AFA) | 1,378 | | April 2, 2025 
Maintenance and engineering personnel | International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM-M) | 860 | | January 1, 2021
Clerical | International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers - Clerical division (IAM-C) | 1,124 | | January 1, 2021
Flight dispatch personnel | Transport Workers Union (TWU) | 32 | | July 22, 2021 

* Our relations with labor unions representing our airline employees are governed by the Railway Labor Act of 1926. Under the Railway Labor Act, a collective bargaining agreement between us and the labor unions does not expire, but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date if either party wishes to modify the terms of the agreement.
We are in discussions with representatives of our IAM-M and IAM-C employees regarding terms of their collective bargaining agreement.
Human Capital Management
Human capital management, including our commitment to diversity and inclusion, is a key driver of our success. We retain our employees through competitive compensation and benefits packages, and by investing in training, mentoring, and career development opportunities. All of this enables us to hire and retain talented, high-performing employees. Our diversity efforts include participation in career events and conferences for veterans, people with disabilities, women, and underrepresented groups. In 2020, we were proud to lead the U.S. industry with the highest percentage of women pilots at more than 9 percent; the domestic industry average is 5.4 percent. We also embrace our diversity through our ASCEND (A Support Community for Employees Nurturing Diverse Abilities), LBGTQA, Network for Black Employees and Allies, Sustainability, Wahine (Women) in Aviation and Veterans employee resource groups. We take pride in and value the traditional culture of Hawai‘i. In 2019, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we expanded our ‘ōlelo Hawai‘i (Hawaiian language) certification program for crewmembers and made it available for all employees. The certification, which is offered at no cost to our employees, broadens our commitment to honor and perpetuate Hawai‘i’s rich culture by incentivizing our team members to share Hawai‘i’s native language with our guests and each other. The program adds to our Ke Kumu project consisting of employee-led hula and Hawaiian language classes.
Seasonality
Hawai'i is a popular vacation destination for travelers. For that reason, our operations and financial results are subject, under pre-COVID-19 operating conditions, to substantial seasonal and cyclical volatility, primarily due to leisure and holiday travel patterns. Demand levels are typically weaker in the first quarter of the year with stronger demand periods occurring during June, July, August, and December. We may adjust our pricing or the availability of particular fares to obtain an optimal passenger load factor depending on seasonal demand differences.
Customers
Our business is not dependent upon any single customer or a few customers and the loss of any one customer would not have a material adverse effect on our business.
We have entered into agreements with our co-brand, payment, and loyalty partners that may contain exclusivity aspects which restrict us and our subsidiaries from entering into certain arrangements with other payment and loyalty partners. These arrangements generally extend for the terms of the agreements. We believe the financial benefits generated by the exclusivity aspects of these arrangements outweigh the limitations imposed under such agreements.
Regulation
Our business is subject to extensive and evolving international, federal, state and local laws and regulations. Many governmental agencies regularly examine our operations to monitor compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Governmental authorities can enforce compliance with applicable laws and regulations and obtain injunctions or impose civil or criminal penalties or modify, suspend, or revoke our operating certificates in case of violations.
Industry Regulations
We are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the DOT and the FAA. The DOT has jurisdiction over international routes and fares for some countries (based upon treaty relations with those countries), consumer protection policies including baggage liability, denied boarding compensation, and unfair competitive practices as set forth in the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978. The FAA has regulatory jurisdiction over flight operations, including equipment, ground facilities, security systems, maintenance, and other safety matters. Pursuant to these regulations, we have established, and the FAA has approved, a maintenance program for each type of aircraft we operate that provides for the ongoing maintenance of our aircraft, ranging from frequent routine inspections to major overhauls.
Maintenance Directives
The FAA approves all airline maintenance programs and modifications to such programs. In addition, the FAA certifies and licenses the air carrier, mechanics, inspectors, and repair stations that perform inspections, repairs and overhauls.
The FAA frequently issues airworthiness directives in response to specific incidents or reports by operators or manufacturers, mandating operators of specified equipment types to perform prescribed inspections, repairs or modifications within stated time periods and/or aircraft hours and cycles. 
Airport Security
The Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) mandates that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) provide screening of all passengers and property, including mail, cargo, carry-on and checked baggage, and other articles that will be carried aboard a passenger aircraft. Under the ATSA, substantially all security screeners at airports are federal employees and airline and airport security is overseen and performed by federal employees, including security managers, law enforcement officers, and Federal Air Marshals. The ATSA also provides for increased security on flight decks of aircraft (and requires Federal Air Marshals to be present on certain flights), improved airport perimeter access security, airline crew security training, enhanced security screening of passengers, baggage, cargo, mail, employees and vendors, enhanced training and qualifications of security screening personnel, provision of passenger data to U.S. Customs and Border Protection and enhanced background checks.
The TSA also has the authority to impose additional fees on air carriers, if necessary, to cover additional federal aviation security costs. 
Environmental and Employee Safety and Health
We are subject to various laws and regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the U.S. and other countries in which we do business. Many aspects of airlines' operations are subject to increasingly stringent federal, state, local, and foreign laws protecting the environment. U.S. federal laws that have a particular impact on us include the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990, the Clean Air Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. Certain of our operations are also subject to the oversight of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) concerning employee safety and health matters. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), OSHA, and other federal agencies have been authorized to promulgate regulations that affect our operations. In addition to these federal activities, states have been delegated certain authority under the aforementioned federal statutes. Many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations, some of which are similar to or stricter than federal requirements, such as California.
The EPA is authorized to regulate aircraft emissions and has historically implemented emissions control standards previously adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organization. Our aircraft comply with the existing EPA standards, as applicable, by engine design date.
We seek to minimize the impact of carbon emissions from our operations through reductions in our fuel consumption and other efforts. We have reduced the fuel needs of our aircraft fleet through the retirement and replacement of certain aircraft in our fleet with newer, more fuel efficient aircraft. In addition, we have implemented fuel saving procedures in our flight and ground support operations that further reduce carbon emissions. We are also supporting initiatives to develop alternative fuels and efforts to modernize the air traffic control system in the U.S. as part of our efforts to reduce our emissions and minimize our impact on the environment.
Noise Abatement
Under the Airport Noise and Capacity Act, the DOT allows local airport authorities to implement procedures designed to abate special noise problems, provided such procedures do not unreasonably interfere with interstate and foreign commerce, or the national transportation system. Certain airports, including the major airports at Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, and San Jose, California; Sydney, Australia; and Tokyo, Japan, have established airport restrictions to limit noise, including restrictions on aircraft types to be used and limits on the number of hourly or daily operations or the time of such operations. Local authorities at other airports could consider adopting similar noise restrictions. In some instances, these restrictions have caused curtailments in services or increases in operating costs, and such restrictions could limit our ability to expand our operations.
Civil Reserve Air Fleet Program
The U.S. Department of Defense regulates the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) and government charters. We have elected to participate in the CRAF program by agreeing to make aircraft available to the federal government for use by the U.S. military under certain stages of readiness related to national emergencies. The program is a standby arrangement that allows the U.S. Department of Defense U.S. Transportation Command to call on as many as 12 contractually committed Hawaiian aircraft and crews to supplement military airlift capabilities. None of our aircraft are presently mobilized under this program.
Other Regulations
The State of Hawai'i is uniquely dependent upon air transportation. The Hawai'i state legislature has enacted legislation that addresses this concern. 
Other aspects of airline operations are subject to regulation or oversight by federal agencies other than the FAA and the DOT. Federal antitrust laws are enforced by the U.S. Department of Justice. The U.S. Postal Service has jurisdiction over certain aspects of the transportation of mail and related services provided by our cargo services. Labor relations in the air transportation industry are generally regulated under the Railway Labor Act. We and other airlines certificated prior to October 24, 1978 are also subject to preferential hiring rights granted by the Airline Deregulation Act to certain airline employees who have been furloughed or terminated (other than for cause). The Federal Communications Commission issues licenses and regulates the use of all communications frequencies assigned to us and other airlines. There is increased focus on consumer protection both on the federal and state level. We cannot always accurately predict the cost of such requirements on our operations.
Additional laws and regulations are proposed from time to time, which could significantly increase the cost of airline operations by imposing additional requirements or restrictions. U.S. law restricts the ownership of U.S. airlines to corporations where no more than 25% of the voting stock may be held by non-U.S. citizens and the airline must be under the actual control of U.S. citizens. The President and two thirds of the Board of Directors and other managing officers must also be U.S. citizens. Regulations also have been considered from time to time that would prohibit or restrict the ownership and/or transfer of airline routes or takeoff and landing slots and authorizations. Also, the award of international routes to U.S. carriers (and their retention) is regulated by treaties and related agreements between the U.S. and foreign governments, which are amended from time to time. We cannot predict what laws and regulations will be adopted or what changes to international air transportation treaties will be adopted, if any, or how we will be affected by those changes.
