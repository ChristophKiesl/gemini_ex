History and Overview
 
ZHRH Corporation (“we,” “our,” “us” or the “Company”) was originally incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 13, 2011, as Ketdarina Corp. On May 7, 2021, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation in Nevada to change its corporate name to ZHRH Corporation, our current name, which became effective on July 16, 2021.
 
Until November 19, 2014, the Company was in the business of wholesale of bedding products to industrial, commercial and institutional retailers, and other professional business users, or to other wholesalers and related subordinated services. On November 19, 2014, the Company’s then principal shareholders sold their shares of the Company to Western Highlands Minerals, Ltd., a Vietnamese corporation (“WHM”), resigned from all positions with the Company and appointed WHM’s designees as new management; WHM then took over the inactive bedding business from the Company, and cancelled all previous debt which was owed to them at that time.
 
In or about 2015, the Company phased out of its prior business and became a “shell company,” as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). The Company is currently a shell company.
 
On December 11, 2020, as a result of a receivership in the Eighth Judicial District Court in Clark County, Nevada, Case Number: A-20-816621-B, the plaintiff creditor in the case, Custodian Ventures LLC (the “Custodian”) received an order from the Clark County Court appointing David Lazar as the receiver of the Company. On the same date, David Lazar was appointed as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, President, Secretary, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors. On December 29, 2020, the Company’s Charter was reinstated in the State of Nevada. The receivership was terminated by the Eighth Judicial District Court in Clark County, Nevada, under Case Number: A-20-816621-B on May 10, 2021 and on the same date, the court also discharged Mr. Lazar as the receiver.

Each Quarterly Grant shall vest, if at all, on the one-year anniversary of the applicable grant date, and, once vested, shall be subject to no additional contractual lock-in period. In the event that Mr. Doublet ceases to serve as a director of the Company for any reason, any Quarterly Grant which has not vested at such time will be automatically forfeited.

Covid-19
 
The outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19), which the World Health Organization declared in March 2020 to be a pandemic, continues to spread throughout the United States of America and the globe, including the new Omicron variants. The extent of the ultimate impact of the pandemic on the Company’s operational and financial performance will depend on various developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, all of which cannot be reasonably predicted at this time. While management reasonably expects the COVID-19 outbreak to negatively impact the Company’s financial condition, operating results, and timing and amounts of cash flows, the related financial consequences and duration are highly uncertain.
