ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview



Kenongwo Group US, Inc. is a Nevada holding company, operating through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Jiangxi Kenongwo Technology Co., Ltd. (“Jiangxi Kenongwo”), a company incorporated under the laws of the PRC. Through Jiangxi Kenongwo, Wwe primarily engage in studying, developing, manufacturing and selling bamboo charcoal biomass organic fertilizers, amino acid water-soluble fertilizers, selenium-rich foliage fertilizers and other types of fertilizers in the PRC.



The main raw materials that are used in our organic fertilizers include bamboo charcoal, bamboo vinegar, rapeseed dregs and organic selenium. Bamboo charcoal is carbonized from bamboo and it is an excellent fertilizer carrier that can slowly release the fertilizer substance and at the same time reduce the pollution in the soil. Bamboo vinegar is a liquid obtained by condensing the water volatile organics in Moso bamboo, which is released during the high temperature pyrolysis through our patented technology. Fermented rapeseed dregs are the component of organic materials, which can significantly impact the quality of soil. Selenium is an essential trace mineral that is important for many bodily processes. By adding organic selenium into our fertilizers and applying them to the crops, selenium can be well absorbed and converted, making the final agricultural products rich of selenium. Our fertilizers also provide optimum levels of primary plant nutrients which including multi-minerals, proteins and carbohydrates that promote the healthiest soils capable of growing the healthy crops and vegetables. It can effectively reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides as well as reduce the penetration of large chemical fertilizers and pesticides into the soil and thus avoid water pollution. Therefore, our fertilizer can effectively improve fertility of soil, and the quality and safety of agricultural products.



We generate our revenue from the sales of our organic fertilizers, compound fertilizers, specific-function fertilizers and crop-specific fertilizers. We currently have one integrated factory covering a land area of 143,590 square feet in Yichun City, Jiangxi Province, PRC to produce our organic fertilizers, which has been in operations since 2017. We plan to expand our production capacity and build an automatic and standardized production line, equipped with fully automatic production machines for our fertilizers, including fermentation machines, granulation machines, drying and cooling machines, labeling machines, packaging machines and loading and unloading machines. Specifically, we plan to establish four automated production lines, including (1) the powder fertilizer production line, (2) the granular fertilizer production line, (3) the liquid water soluble fertilizer production line and (4) the powder water soluble fertilizer production line. As of the date of this report, (3) and (4) have been completed. In addition, we also installed the liquid raw material automatic storage tank system, the palletizing robot system and the raw material weighing and batching system. The estimated cost of building this production line is approximately RMB12 million (approximately $1.7 million). we plan to finance this amount in equity or debt. There is no assurance that we could raise that amount on satisfying terms. As a result, the implementation of this expansion depends on whether and when we could secure the financing.



We believe that our brand reputation and ability to tailor our products to meet the requirements of various regions of the PRC affords us a competitive advantage. We purchase the majority of our raw materials from suppliers located in the PRC and use suppliers that are located in close proximity to our manufacturing facilities, which helps us to control our cost of revenue.



China is the principal market for our products, which are primarily sold to farmers through distributors in over twenty-two provinces in China, including Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Fujian, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Sichuan, Chongqing, Guangdong, Hainan, Xinjiang, Guizhou, Guangxi, Liaoning, Shandong, Shanxi, Yunnan, Ningxia, Gansu, Henan, and Hebei provinces.



In 2019, the Company and two other individuals, Mr. Haijin Li and Mr. Weizhong Zhang, jointly formed Longyan Fuchi Agricultural Development Co., Ltd. (“Longyan”) pursuant to a cooperation agreement dated April 27, 2019 (the “Cooperation Agreement”). According to the Cooperation Agreement, the Company and Mr. Zhang together shall invest RMB540,000 (approximately $77,510) to Longyan, which, in exchange, will result in the Company and Mr. Zhang owning 25% and 20% equity interest in Longyan, respectively. As of the date of this report, the Company has invested RMB 200,000 (approximately $28,955) to and as a result owns 25% equity interest in Longyan. Longyan is an agricultural company with a primary focus on growing and selling passionfruit, in which the Company perceives excellent potentials in Fujian province. Pursuant to the Cooperation Agreement, the Company shall jointly manage Longyan with Mr. Li and Mr. Zhang.

Amidst the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020, our business operations were adversely impacted. In particular, the lockdown policy in China has caused delays in the logistics industry and consequently, the supply of our raw materials was impacted. In addition, the restrictions of face-to-face interactions have slowed down the process of our marketing, client meeting and new products launching activities. The spread of COVID-19 has been effectively controlled in China. People’s daily life and businesses’ operations started going to normalcy. As a result, we believe these negative impacts are temporary. However, there is significant uncertainty around the breadth and duration of business disruptions related to COVID-19, as well as its impact on the economy of China and the rest of the world and, as such, the extent of the business disruption and the related financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.



China is the principal market for our products, which are primarily sold to our customers through distributors in over twenty provinces in China, including Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Fujian, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Sichuan, Chongqing, Guangdong, Hainan, Xinjiang, Guizhou, Anhui, Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Yunnan and Guangxi provinces.




Kenongwo Group US, Inc. is a holding company and we operate our business through Jiangxi Kenongwo. Jiangxi Kenongwo is formed and operating the Peoples Republic of China (“Material PRC Company”) has been duly established and is validly existing as a limited liability company under the laws of the Peoples Republic of China (“PRC Laws”),and has received all authorizations required by the Peoples Republic of China (the “Governmental Authorizations”) for its establishment to the extent such Governmental Authorizations are required under applicable PRC Laws, and its business license is in full force and effect. The Material PRC Company has the capacity and authority to own assets, to conduct business, and to sue and be sued in its own name under PRC Laws. The articles of association, business license and other constitutional documents (if any) of the Material PRC Company complies with the requirements of applicable PRC Laws and are in full force and effect. The Material PRC Company has not taken any corporate action, nor has any legal proceedings commenced against it, for its liquidation, winding up, dissolution, or bankruptcy, for the appointment of a liquidation committee, team of receivers or similar officers in respect of its assets or for any adverse suspension, withdrawal, revocation or cancellation of its business license.



All of the equity interests of the Material PRC Company are owned by Kenongwo Group US, Inc., and (ii) the Material PRC Company has obtained all Governmental Authorizations for the ownership interest owned by Kenongwo Group US, Inc. The equity interests of the Material PRC Company are owned by Kenongwo Group US, Inc. free and clear of any pledge or other encumbrance under PRC Laws, and there are no outstanding rights, warrants or options to acquire, or instruments convertible into or exchangeable for, any equity interest in the Material PRC Company under PRC Laws, except for such encumbrance that would not be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. “Material Adverse Effect,” as used herein, means a material adverse effect on the assets, liabilities, properties or business of the Company.



All of our operations are conducted by our subsidiary, our wholly-foreign-owned entity (“WFOE”) based in China which involves unique risks to investors. Our WFOE structure is used to provide investors with exposure to foreign investment in China-based companies where Chinese law prohibits direct foreign investment in the operating companies. Investors may never hold equity interests in the Chinese operating company. The WFOE structure is not as stable as some have imagined. The senior management and the shareholders of the domestic company play a very important role in the WFOE structure. Once there are changes to such positions involving interests, potential risks of the WFOE structure will appear. Chinese regulatory authorities could disallow this structure, which would likely result in a material change in our operations and/or a material change in the value of the securities we are registering for sale, including that it could cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or become worthless.



The legal and operational risks associated with being based in or having the majority of the Company’s operations in China could result in a material change in the value of the securities we are registering for sale or could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless.

Recently, Beijing revamped its rules for overseas listings after ride-hailing Didi Global launched its initial public offering despite warnings from regulators. That triggered a data security investigation led by the Cyberspace Administration of China (“CAC”), which recently culminated with the firm announcing plans to delist in the US in favor of Hong Kong. This shows how recent statements and regulatory actions by China’s government have or may impact the company’s ability to conduct its business, accept foreign investments, or list on a U.S. or other foreign exchange.



Trading securities may be prohibited under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act if the PCAOB determines that it cannot inspect or fully investigate our auditor, and that as a result an exchange may determine to delist your securities.



The Company will settle amounts owed under the WFOE structure by transferring dividends, or distributions between the holding company and its subsidiaries, or to investors, which have not yet occurred. We rely primarily on dividends paid by the WFOE for our cash needs, including the funds necessary to pay dividends and other cash distributions, if any, to our shareholders, to service any debt we may incur and to pay our operating expenses. We have made no such distributions to date and we have no current cash management policies in place. We will look to implement one in the near future.



There are no legal, arbitral or governmental proceedings, regulatory investigations or other governmental decisions, rulings, orders, or actions before any Governmental Agencies in progress or pending in the PRC to which the Company or any Material PRC Company is a party or to which any assets of any Material PRC Company is a subject which, if determined adversely against any of the Company and the Material PRC Company, would be reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect.



All dividends declared and payable upon the equity interests in the WFOE may be converted into foreign currency and freely transferred out of the PRC free of any deductions in the PRC, provided that (i) the declaration and payment of such dividends complies with applicable PRC Laws and the constitutional documents of the WFOE, and (ii) the remittance of such dividends out of the PRC complies with the procedures required by the relevant PRC Laws relating to foreign exchange administration.



We face uncertainties with respect to indirect transfers of equity interests in PRC resident enterprises by their non-PRC holding companies.



Adverse changes in economic and political policies of the PRC government could have a material and adverse effect on overall economic growth in China, which could materially and adversely affect our business. General macroeconomic conditions may materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations and financial position. The PRC government’s control over foreign currency conversion may adversely affect our business and results of operations and our ability to remit dividends. PRC regulation of loans to and direct investments in PRC entities by offshore holding companies may delay or prevent us from using the proceeds of this offering to make loans or additional capital contributions to our operating subsidiary in China, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand business.



Assuming no offer, issuance or sale of the shares of our common stock has been or will be made directly or indirectly within the PRC, a prior approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission (“CSRC”) will not be required. However, there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of the M&A Rules, other PRC Laws and future PRC laws and regulations, and there can be no assurance that any Governmental Agency will not take a view that is contrary to or otherwise different from our opinions stated herein.



In accordance with the relevant articles 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the “Notice of the State Administration of Taxation on the Exemption of Value-added Tax on Organic Fertilizer Products issued by the Ministry of Finance of the People’s Republic of China “Finance and Taxation [2008] No. 56 and Finance and Taxation [2009] No. 17”, and in accordance with Article 28 of Chapter IV Tax Preference of the Enterprise Income Tax Law of the People’s Republic of China, eligible small low-profit enterprises shall be subject to enterprise income tax at a reduced rate of 20%, high-tech enterprises that need to be supported by the state shall be subject to enterprise income tax at a reduced rate of 15%, and according to the Notice of the General Office of the People’s Government of Jiangxi Province on the “Three-year Action Plan for Accelerating the High-quality Development of Selenium-rich Functional Agriculture（2023-2025）” and the “Opinions of the General Office of the People’s Government of Jiangxi Province on Accelerating the High-quality Development of the Bamboo Industry” and other documents, it shows that governments at all levels support the industry in which the company operates.

Jiangxi Kenongwo Technology Co., Ltd. obtained the National High-tech Enterprise Certificate on September 14, 2020. The approving authorities are: Jiangxi Provincial Department of Science and Technology, Jiangxi Provincial Department of Finance, Jiangxi Provincial Taxation Bureau of State Taxation Bureau.



On December 16, 2021, PCAOB issued a report on its determinations that PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely PCAOB-registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and in Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), because of positions taken by PRC authorities in those jurisdictions. The PCAOB made these determinations pursuant to PCAOB Rule 6100, which provides a framework for how the PCAOB fulfills its responsibilities under the HFCAA. The report further listed in its Appendix A and Appendix B, Registered Public Accounting Firms Subject to the Mainland China Determination and Registered Public Accounting Firms Subject to the Determination, respectively. The audit report included in this registration statement for the year ended December 31, 2020, was issued by Assentsure PAC, an audit firm headquartered in Singapore, a jurisdiction that the PCAOB has determined that the PCAOB is unable to conduct inspections or investigate auditors. Our auditor Assentsure PAC is among those listed by the PCAOB Determination, a determination announced by the PCAOB on December 16, 2021 that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in Singapore, a Special Administrative Region and dependency of the PRC, because of a position taken by one or more authorities in Singapore. The lack of access to the PCAOB inspection in China prevents the PCAOB from fully evaluating audits and quality control procedures of the auditors based in China. As a result, the investors may be deprived of the benefits of such PCAOB inspections. The inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections of auditors in China makes it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of these accounting firms’ audit procedures or quality control procedures as compared to auditors outside of China that are subject to the PCAOB inspections. In addition, under the HFCAA, our securities may be prohibited from trading on the U.S. stock exchanges or in the over-the-counter trading market in the U.S. if our auditor is not inspected by the PCAOB for three consecutive years, and this ultimately could result in our common stock being delisted. Furthermore, on June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (“AHFCAA”), which, if enacted, would amend the HFCAA and require the SEC to prohibit an issuer’s securities from trading on any U.S. stock exchanges or in the over the counter trading market in the U.S. if its auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspections for two consecutive years instead of three. In the future, if we do not engage an auditor that is subject to regular inspection by the PCAOB, our common stocks may be delisted.



The SEC may propose additional rules or guidance that could impact us if our auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspection. For example, on August 6, 2020, the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets, or the PWG, issued the Report on Protecting United States Investors from Significant Risks from Chinese Companies to the then President of the United States. This report recommended that the SEC implement five recommendations to address companies from jurisdictions that do not provide the PCAOB with sufficient access to fulfil its statutory mandate. Some of the concepts of these recommendations were implemented with the enactment of the HFCAA. However, some of the recommendations were more stringent than the HFCAA. For example, if a company was not subject to PCAOB inspection, the report recommended that the transition period before a company would be delisted would end on January 1, 2022.



The enactment of the HFCAA and the implications of any additional rulemaking efforts to increase U.S. regulatory access to audit information in China could cause investor uncertainty for affected SEC registrants, including us, and the market price of our stock could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, whether the PCAOB will be able to conduct inspections of our auditors in the next three years, or at all, is subject to substantial uncertainty and depends on a number of factors out of our control. If we are unable to meet the PCAOB inspection requirement in time, our stock will not be permitted for trading “over-the counter” either. Such a delisting would substantially impair your ability to sell or purchase our stock when you wish to do so, and the risk and uncertainty associated with delisting would have a negative impact on the price of our stock. Also, such a delisting would significantly affect our ability to raise capital on terms acceptable to us, or at all, which would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects.

We currently intend to retain all available funds and future earnings, if any, for the operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination related to our dividend policy will be made at the discretion of our board of directors after considering our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, contractual requirements, business prospects and other factors the board of directors deem relevant, and subject to the restrictions contained in any future financing instruments. To date, our cash is used for the development and operation of the WFOE. Since the Company has just recently started to recognizing material revenue, it has not yet arranged to issue dividends or distribution and as the Company is trying to use the funds for the company’s development, the shareholders’ income will not be arranged for the time being. Because our funds are used for the development of domestic enterprises, there is no foreign exchange restriction for the time being.



U.S shareholders may face difficulties in effecting service of process against the Company and officers and director, as they are both based in China. Even with proper service of process, the enforcement of judgments obtained in U.S. courts or foreign courts based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws would be extremely difficult. Furthermore, there would be added costs and issues with bringing an original action in foreign courts to enforce liabilities based on the U.S. federal securities laws against the Company.



The PRC government also imposes controls on the conversion of RMB into foreign currencies and the remittance of currencies out of the PRC. Therefore, we may experience difficulties in completing the administrative procedures necessary to obtain and remit foreign currency for the payment of dividends from our profits, if any. Furthermore, if our subsidiaries in the PRC incur debt on their own in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other payments. If we or our subsidiaries are unable to receive all of the revenues from our operations, we may be unable to pay dividends on our Shares. As of the date of this prospectus, we do not have any PRC subsidiaries.



Cash dividends, if any, on our Shares will be paid in U.S. dollars. If we are considered a PRC tax resident enterprise for tax purposes, any dividends we pay to our overseas shareholders may be regarded as China-sourced income and as a result may be subject to PRC withholding tax at a rate of up to 10.0%.



The registered capital of the Material PRC Company has been duly paid in accordance with applicable PRC Laws and their respective articles of association, to the extent that such registered capital is required to be paid prior to the date hereof.



All of our business operations are conducted in China. Accordingly, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects are affected significantly by economic, political and legal developments in China. Although the PRC economy has been transitioning from a planned economy to a more market-oriented economy since the late 1970s, the PRC government continues to exercise significant control over China’s economic growth through direct allocation of resources, monetary and tax policies, and a host of other government policies such as those that encourage or restrict investment in certain industries by foreign investors, control the exchange between the Renminbi and foreign currencies, and regulate the growth of the general or specific market. While the Chinese economy has experienced significant growth in the past 30 years, growth has been uneven, both geographically and among various sectors of the economy. As the PRC economy has become increasingly linked with the global economy, China is affected in various respects by downturns and recessions of major economies around the world. The various economic and policy measures enacted by the PRC government to forestall economic downturns or bolster China’s economic growth could materially affect our business. Any adverse change in the economic conditions in China, in policies of the PRC government or in laws and regulations in China could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of China and market demand for our outsourcing services. Such developments could adversely affect our businesses, lead to reduction in demand for our services and adversely affect our competitive position.



The PRC legal system is based on written statutes. Prior court decisions may be cited for reference but have limited precedential value. Since the late 1970s, the PRC government has been building a comprehensive system of laws and regulations governing economic matters in general. The overall effect has been to significantly enhance the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investments in China. We conduct our business primarily through our WFOE, the WFOE is established in China. These companies are generally subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investment in China. However, since these laws and regulations are relatively new and the PRC legal system continues to rapidly evolve, the interpretations of many laws, regulations and rules are not always uniform and enforcement of these laws, regulations and rules involves uncertainties, which may limit legal protections available to us. In addition, some regulatory requirements issued by certain PRC government authorities may not be consistently applied by other government authorities (including local government authorities), thus making strict compliance with all regulatory requirements impractical, or in some circumstances impossible. For example, we may have to resort to administrative and court proceedings to enforce the legal protection that we enjoy either by law or contract.

Corporate History and Structure



Kenongwo Group US, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 17, 2018. On January 1, 2019, we acquired all the issued and outstanding shares of Jiangxi Kenongwo pursuant to certain share transfer agreements with the two former shareholders of Jiangxi Kenongwo. The share transfer was completed on January 9, 2019. As a result, Jiangxi Kenongwo became our wholly-owned subsidiary.



The following diagram illustrates our current corporate structure: 






Any risks that any actions by the Chinese government to exert more oversight and control over offerings that are conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in China-based issuers could significantly limit or completely hinder your ability to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless.



Subject to the requirements and public policy considerations as stipulated under applicable PRC Laws relating to the enforceability of foreign court judgments, submission to foreign jurisdiction for dispute resolution and choice of law, and also subject to the conditions described under the caption “Enforceability of Civil Liabilities” in the Registration Statement and Prospectus, (i) the irrevocable submission of the Company to the jurisdiction of any courts in the United States, the waiver by the Company of any objection to the venue of a proceeding in any such court, the waiver and agreement not to plead an inconvenient forum, the waiver of sovereign immunity



Under PRC Laws, neither the Material PRC Company, nor their respective properties, assets or revenues, are entitled to any right of immunity on the grounds of sovereignty or otherwise from any legal action, suit or proceeding, from set-off or counterclaim, from the jurisdiction of any court, from services of process, from attachment prior to or in aid of execution of any judgment, or from other legal processes or proceedings for the giving of any relief or for the enforcement of any judgment.



As a company incorporated under the laws of Nevada, we are classified as a foreign enterprise under PRC laws and regulations, and our wholly-owned PRC subsidiary, SRAS, is a foreign-invested enterprise, or a FIE.



All of our revenue is denominated in Renminbi while our financial reporting is in U.S. dollars. As a result, any significant fluctuation in exchange rates may cause us to incur currency exchange translation and harm our financial condition and results of operations.



Movements in Renminbi exchange rates are affected by, among other things, changes in political and economic conditions and China’s foreign exchange regime and policy. The Renminbi has been unpegged from the U.S. dollar since July 2005 and, although the People’s Bank of China regularly intervenes in the foreign exchange market to limit fluctuations in Renminbi exchange rates, the Renminbi may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the U.S. dollar in the medium to long term. Moreover, it is possible that the PRC authorities may lift restrictions on fluctuations in Renminbi exchange rates and lessen intervention in the foreign exchange market in the future.





6







To date, we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. While we may decide to enter into hedging transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these hedges may be limited and we may not be able to adequately hedge our exposure or at all.



The M&A Rules and certain other PRC regulations may make it more difficult for us to pursue growth through acquisitions. Under the Enterprise Income Tax Law, we may be classified as a “Resident Enterprise” of China. Such classification will likely result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non-PRC shareholders and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the value of your investment. The M&A Rules, among other things, purport to require CSRC approval prior to the listing and trading on an overseas stock exchange of the securities of an offshore special purpose vehicle established or controlled directly or indirectly by the Material PRC Company or individuals and formed for the purpose of overseas listing through the acquisition of PRC domestic interests held by such Material PRC Company or individuals.



Based on our understanding of the explicit provisions under PRC Laws, and assuming no offer, issuance or sale of the Common Shares has been or will be made directly or indirectly within the PRC, a prior approval from the CSRC is not required for the Offering. However, there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of the M&A Rules, other PRC Laws and future PRC laws and regulations, and there can be no assurance that any Governmental Agency will not take a view that is contrary to or otherwise different from our opinions stated herein. Subject to any applicable administrative procedures required by PRC Laws, and provided that all required Governmental Authorizations have been duly obtained, the due application of the net proceeds to be received by the Company from the issue Common Shares as disclosed in the Prospectus under the caption “Use of Proceeds” does not and immediately after the Offering will not contravene any applicable PRC Laws, the articles of association or the business licenses of the Material PRC Company, except for such contravention or default which would not be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.



The Company is not subject to the requirements of Cyberspace Administration of China (“CAC”) and specifically the cybersecurity law, because our company is not an Internet company and does not have a large amount of customer data, so it is not subject to the Chinese cybersecurity law.



The Company or our subsidiary is required to obtain from Chinese authorities to operate our business. The Material PRC Company has obtained all material Governmental Authorizations necessary for its business operations and such Governmental Authorizations are in full force and effect and all required Governmental Authorizations have been duly obtained .

Enforceability of Civil Liabilities



All of our assets are located outside the United States. In addition, all of our directors and officers are nationals and/or residents of jurisdictions other than the United States, and all or a substantial portion of such persons’ assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon us or such persons, or to enforce against them or against us, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof. It may also be difficult for you to enforce judgments obtained in U.S. courts based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws against us and our officers and directors.
Industry Overview



Overview of the PRC Fertilizer Industry



According to Gulf Petrochemicals & Chemicals Association, China is the biggest fertilizer producer and consumer in the world. Total fertilizer consumption in China represents around a third of global fertilizer use. According to China Fertilizers Market - Growth, Trends, And Forecasts (2019–2024) (source: www.mordorintelligence.com), the China fertilizers market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 0.62% during the forecast period, 2019-2024. The market growth is restrained by the Chinese government’s zero-growth policy and environmental protection policy system for rural areas and the agricultural sector, in order to control the pollution and achieve green development. The national policies prohibit the use of pesticides, and require organic fertilizers to replace chemical fertilizers. In 2020, there was zero-growth in fertilizer and pesticide consumption. The policymakers are adjusting fertilizer consumption structure and promoting accurate fertilization, improved fertilization, and use of more micronutrients and secondary fertilizers, as compared to straight fertilizers, particularly nitrogenous fertilizers. This policy is expected to provide a fillip to the growth of the market for bio-fertilizers in China.
Increasing Demand for Organic and Bio-fertilizers



According to the Ministry of Agriculture of the People’s Republic of China (MOA), the use of organic fertilizers as a replacement for chemical fertilizers is one of the key points of agricultural supply-side structural reform in China, and it has a restraining influence on the growth of the chemical fertilizers market in China. The key crops used in the country for the trial fertilizer-replacement program are fruits, vegetables, tea, and others. In May 2016, the “Soil Pollution Prevention Action Plan” was issued to provide strong support for the promotion of organic fertilizer in the country. The government accords great importance to the production of organic fertilizers, and implements a tax exemption policy (implemented in 2016) for bio-organic fertilizer products, providing further support for the development of the organic fertilizer industry in China. The rising number of product innovations and activities in the organic fertilizer market in China act as a restraint to the chemical fertilizers market. All the products we currently sell qualify as the type of organic fertilizers discussed in this section.

According to a press release by Ken Research dated January 23, 2020 (source: https://www.openpr.com/news/1905736/china-complex-fertilizer-market-is-driven-by-rise-in-net), the long term growth potential of the industry remains optimistic of fertilizer market in China as China’s food grain production is expected to grow at a CAGR of 1.3% during 2017-2022 from 621.1 million MT* in 2017 to 663.2 million MT by 2022. Additionally, government support to agriculture industry in China would act as another growth promoting factor to fertilizer industry in China. However, the emerging segment in the coming years would be the organic fertilizers with the government of China planning additional farm subsidies, elimination of certain land taxes, land reform initiatives to promote organically grown products. (*The metric ton used here is 1,000 kg, equivalent to 2,204.6 pounds avoirdupois.)



Our Products



We are committed to ensuring the quality of our products and production is in compliance with GB/T19001-2016/ISO 9001: 2015 Standard Quality System, which is the standard system used by organizations to demonstrate their ability to consistently provide products and services that meet customer and regulatory requirements and to demonstrate continuous improvement. GB/T19001-2016 is the China national standard for quality management system requirements, including the examination standards and packaging standards. ISO 9001: 2015 is the international standard that specifies requirements for a quality management system, covering a broad range of activities, services and products, from the procurement of raw materials to the release of final products. We aim to provide high-quality and environmental friendly organic fertilizer to our customers. Our organic fertilizers are the products of natural decomposition and are easy for plants to absorb and digest. Our core products are bamboo charcoal biomass organic fertilizers, amino acid water-soluble fertilizers and selenium-rich foliar fertilizers. The main raw materials used in these products are bamboo charcoal, bamboo vinegar, rapeseed dregs and organic selenium, which are mainly obtained through calcination, distillation, extraction of moso bamboo and transformation of other plants. Our products can be divided into three categories based on their functions: general-function fertilizers, specific-function fertilizers and crop-specific fertilizers.

1. | General-Function Fertilizers - Bamboo charcoal biomass organic fertilizer
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------




Our general-function fertilizers can be applied to all kinds of crops to promote their growth. Bamboo charcoal biomass organic fertilizer is our flagship product under this category. Bamboo charcoal biomass organic fertilizer is developed on the basis of plant nutrition, soil biology and physical characteristics of the bamboo charcoal. Bamboo charcoal, one of the main components of bamboo charcoal biomass organic fertilizers, is carbonized from bamboo through our patented technology. We use bamboo charcoal, rapeseed dregs, bamboo vinegar liquid, amino acid, beneficial microbial flora and other metal ions (such as copper, iron, zinc and boron) as main raw materials and adopt international advanced production technology to compound them into the final product.



Growing in the natural environment, bamboo absorbs a large amount of water-soluble minerals such as potassium, sodium, calcium and magnesium. These minerals will be dissolved and condensed in the bamboo charcoal after the bamboo is smoldered under high temperature.

Our bamboo charcoal biomass organic fertilizer can promote the reproduction of a large number of probiotic strains around the roots of farm crops, and meanwhile prevent the growth of harmful microorganisms, thus making the fertilizer to has functions of nitrogen fixation, phosphorus-dissolving and kalium-dissolving, among others. Our bamboo charcoal biomass organic fertilizer can also greatly improve the contents and effectiveness of the N, P, K, Ca, Fe and other elements in the soil. Bamboo charcoal itself can adsorb and passivate heavy metals and pesticide residues in the soil and therefore improve the quality of farm crops. In addition, bamboo charcoal can enhance the soil permeability, increase crop root activity, promote photosynthesis, maintain nutrient components in the soil, enhance crops’ resistance ability and prevent the occurrence of crop diseases and insect pests. When using our bamboo charcoal biomass organic fertilizer in acidic soil, the bamboo charcoal substance’s PH value can improve the acidity balance of the soil, making the soil more suitable for growing crops.



Our general-function fertilizer products also include bamboo compound fertilizer and water-soluble fertilizer with amino acid.




2. | Specific-Function Fertilizers
---+------------------------------




Our specific-function fertilizers are designed to provide specific benefits to crops. Our selenium-rich foliar fertilizers can promote the content of selenium in the final agricultural products. Selenium is an essential trace mineral that is important for many bodily processes. By adding organic selenium into our fertilizers and applying them to the crops, selenium can be well absorbed and converted. In addition, the major components in our amino acid water-soluble fertilizers are bamboo vinegar. We mixed bamboo vinegar and other microelements, making our fertilizers rich of nutrition while adding no sterols of any kind. Bamboo vinegar can enhance plants’ abilities to absorb nutrition from soil and degrade the fertilizer residues. These fertilizers can be applied to the soil or sprayed on crops aboveground directly or indirectly in order to supply nutrients, increasing crop yields and improving product quality.




3. | Crop-Specific Fertilizers 
---+------------------------------




We also provide fertilizers that are designed for specific crops based on soil tests. The use of soil tests can help determine the status of nutrients available to plants in soil, thus it develops fertilizer recommendations to achieve optimum crop production. For example, we have designed and manufactured special fertilizer products for blueberries, dragon fruits and jackfruits. The best soil for blueberries to grow is acidic with a PH scale of 4.3 to 5.3 and has an organic-material level of 8% to 12%. Our blueberry fertilizers can effectively resolve the imbalance between the PH scale and organic-material level.



China’s fertilizer market is highly commercialized and therefore we adopted a multi-level brand strategy to target different market segments with tailored products. At present, selenium-rich foliar fertilizer and bamboo charcoal biomass organic fertilizers are marketed as high-end products, compound fertilizers as intermediate products, and amino acid water-soluble fertilizers as low-end products. We have so far developed nearly 20 kinds of products. In general, we believe our fertilizers have the following characteristics and advantages:




● | Increase the amount of probiotic strains and prevent the growth of harmful microorganisms; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Help the soil fix nitrogen, dissolve phosphorus and dissolution and better release the nutrients in the soil; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Adsorb and passivate heavy metals and pesticide residues in soil; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Enrich the mineral content of the soil, increase the organic matters in the soil and therefor increase the crop yield rate;

Our Technology and Manufacturing Process



The main raw materials that are used in our organic fertilizers include bamboo charcoal, bamboo vinegar, rapeseed dregs and organic selenium. Bamboo charcoal is carbonized from bamboo and it is an excellent fertilizer carrier that can slowly release the fertilizer substance and at the same time reduce the pollution in the soil. Bamboo vinegar is a liquid obtained by condensing the water volatile organics in Moso bamboo, which is released during the high temperature pyrolysis through our patented technology. Our production procedure is scientifically designed and its automated production line and quality control system ensures consistent high quality. Our automated production line for product processing is run by a central control system and only needs the input of control technicians. This central control system manages the process of producing products, including automatically feeding materials to machines, blending materials and controlling other manufacturing, packaging and stacking process. The machinery and vats for the line have been supplied by a local medical machinery manufacturer and the automated control systems were developed by us. Our access rights management system ensures that our proprietary ingredient mixes are protected at all times. Also, by linking the computer server with the electronic weights on each of the material input bins, the exact quantity of each element is delivered every time, thus maintaining quality and reducing waste. We also plan to establish an automatic production line controlled by a computer system to manage raw materials processing, which will control the process of fermenting and grinding raw materials, subject to our securing necessary financing to support this plan. Specifically, we plan to establish four automated production lines, including (1) the powder fertilizer production line, (2) the granular fertilizer production line, (3) the liquid water soluble fertilizer production line, and (4) the powder water soluble fertilizer production line). As of the date of this report, (3) and (4) have been completed. In addition, we also installed the liquid raw material automatic storage tank system, the palletizing robot system and the raw material weighing and batching system.
Sales and Marketing



We believe that our sales services, combined with the quality and reputation of our products will help us retain and attract new customers. Our salesmen are trained to work closely with distributors and customers to select suitable products and provide post-sales support. In addition, our salespersons share their knowledges in the fertilizer industry through organizing and opening agricultural technology training courses to the public.



China’s fertilizer market is highly commercialized and therefore we adopted a multi-level brand strategy to target different market segments with tailored products. At present, selenium-rich foliar fertilizer and bamboo charcoal biomass organic fertilizers are marketed as high-end products, compound fertilizers as intermediate products, and amino acid water-soluble fertilizers as low-end products.



We distribute and sell our products to our end-customers through several different channels, including professional markets, sales department of our company and distributors:

We currently sell our products through a carefully constructed network covering approximately 300 regional distributors in over 20 provinces across China. The distributors, in turn, sell the products to smaller local retail stores which then sell them to end users (typically farmers). We do not grant provincial or regional exclusive rights because there is currently no single distributor strong enough to warrant exclusive rights. We enter into non-exclusive written distribution agreements with selected distributors who demonstrate their local business experience and extensive regional sales network. The agreements do not specify the length of the engagement. The typical terms in a distribution agreement are regarding the sales amount of the products, the specification of the products, the means of transportation and the place of products’ delivery. Although our distributors and agents also work with other fertilizer manufacturers to sell their products, we have established our reputation in the market and approximately 30% of the products sold by our distributors and agents were supplied by us. We also plan to work with overseas distributors, such as the distributors in Malaysia, to sell our products, especially our high-purity bamboo vinegar and organic selenium products. 



By using various channels to sell and distribute our products to customers, we can directly serve our customers and end-customers by providing customer service and support.



Raw Materials and Suppliers



Moso bamboo is the crucial raw material for the production of bamboo charcoal, bamboo vinegar and organic selenium.

Our Strategies and Competitive Strength



We intend to build upon our proven ability to produce high-quality organic fertilizer and increase our presence and market share in the agriculture industry. The summary of our competitive strength is as follows:
Products with Selenium



Selenium is an essential trace mineral that is important for many bodily processes. Our factory is located in an area that has high level of selenium in soil and water which provides us the advantage of manufacturing selenium-rich fertilizer products. By adding organic selenium into our fertilizers and applying them to the crops, selenium can be well absorbed and converted, making the final agricultural products rich of selenium.
Nationwide Distribution Network



We have established our own distribution channels with approximately 300 distributors in over 20 provinces in China, enabling our products to be sold to retail stores across the country. We are continuing expanding our distribution network through developing more distributors and we plan to sell our fertilizers to more provinces in China.
Powerful Research & Development (“R&D”) Strength



It typically takes us three to six months from designing a product to putting it into production. Our R&D department is based on our intelligent greenhouse facilities which simulate the natural environment and soil conditions in different seasons. Our laboratory work, therefore, can accelerate the product development cycle. We are now able to design and provide customized fertilizers products based the specific crop, type of soil and weather conditions, allowing us to diversify our fertilizers to offer more options to our customers.
Automatic Production Line



Our automated production line for product processing is run by a central control system and only needs the input of control technicians. This central control system manages the process of producing products, including automatically feeding materials to machines, blending materials and controlling other manufacturing, packaging and stacking process. We also plan to establish an automatic production line controlled by a computer system to manage raw materials processing, including fermenting and grinding raw materials, subject to our securing of a future financing. Specifically, we plan to establish four automated production line, including (1) the powder fertilizer production line, (2) the granular fertilizer production line, (3) the liquid water-soluble fertilizer production line, and (4) the powder water soluble fertilizer production line). As of the date of this report, (3) and (4) have been completed. Also, our specialized bamboo charcoal production line is patented (patent number: ZL 2017 2 1264881.3).

We have further taken steps to restrict the number of persons involving in production. Instead of providing production personnel with the list of fertilizer ingredients, we give them the digit codes representing the ingredients to better protect the formula of our fertilizers.



Seasonality



We experience seasonality in our business, reflecting seasonal fluctuations in food productions and storages. For example, we generally experience higher transaction volumes during spring and fall. Our water-soluble fertilizers have a steady sale volume throughout the year, but our selenium-rich foliar fertilizers usually become more popular one month before the crops are ready to be harvested as that is the best time to apply the selenium-rich foliar fertilizers.
Employees



As of the date of this report, we have 57 full-time employees and 21 part-time employees. The departments cover, sales and marketing, administration, customer service, accounting, design, research and development and human resources. We are required under PRC law to make contributions to employee benefit plans for our PRC-based full-time employees at specified percentages of the salaries, bonuses and certain allowances of such employees, up to a maximum amount specified by the local governments in China and we also are required to make contributions to the work-related injury insurance for the part-time employees. We maintain a good working relationship with our employees, and as of the date of this report, we have not experienced any material labor disputes in the past. None of our employees are represented by labor unions.

Environmental Law Compliance



We believe that our manufacturing facilities are currently operating under compliance with provincial and central environmental laws in the PRC. We plan to continue acquiring environmental-oriented equipment and incurring the expenditures we deem necessary for compliance with applicable laws. Expenditures relating to compliance for operating facilities incurred in the past have not significantly affected our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
Insurance



We provide social security insurance including medical insurance, maternity insurance, workplace injury insurance, unemployment insurance and pension benefits for our employees. Consistent with customary industry practice in China, we do not maintain business interruption insurance, nor do we maintain product liability insurance or key-man life insurance.
Regulations on Fertilizer License



The examination and approval of fertilizer license is based on Article 25 of the Agricultural Law of the People’s Republic of China, the Management for the Administration of Fertilizer Registration (Order No. 32 and No. 38 by the Ministry of Agriculture), and the Requirements for Fertilizer Registration Materials (Publication No. 161 from the Ministry of Agriculture). Organic fertilizers are required to be registered with provincial agricultural department.
