ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Background
 
Odyssey Semiconductor Technologies, Inc. (the “Company”), formed as a Delaware corporation on April 12, 2019, is a semiconductor device company developing revolutionary high-voltage power switching components and systems based on proprietary Gallium Nitride (GaN) processing technology. The Company acquired its wholly-owned subsidiary, Odyssey Semiconductor, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Odyssey Semiconductor”), on June 21, 2019. Odyssey Semiconductor commenced business operations on June 17, 2019 when it acquired its wholly-owned subsidiary, JR2J LLC (“JR2J”), from its founders Richard Brown and James Shealy in exchange for shares of Odyssey Semiconductor.


Overview of the Semiconductor Industry
 
The semiconductor industry was formed in 1960 when the production of semiconductors became a viable option. The global semiconductor market has grown rapidly, from over $1 billion in 19641 to $468.78 billion in 20182, and we believe it will continue to grow steadily in the next few years.
 
The application of semiconductors has expanded extensively from radio in the 1960s to crucial electronic components nowadays to all manufactured products with computing or power management capabilities, ranging from computers and personal electronics to automotive goods and heavy machinery. Semiconductor devices mounted inside many electronics appliances are important electronic components that support our everyday live.
 
Integrated circuits (ICs) and electronic discrete components such as diodes (which are two-terminal electronic components that conduct current primarily in one direction) and transistors (which are devices possessing an amplification function) are made of semiconductors.
 
The semiconductor industry is divided into six broad categories based on the end-use application:
 

● | Data processing: This comprises chips used in servers, computers, printers, and related hardware. This is the largest segment where semiconductors are used. However, growth in this segment has moderated, and no breakthrough innovation is expected in the near future.

● | Communications: This comprises chips used in wired and wireless communication equipment such as smartphones, tablets, and broadband equipment. This segment is growing at a faster pace. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Consumer electronics: This comprises chips used in household appliances, LCD TVs, and gaming consoles. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Industrial: This comprises chips used in scanning devices such as bar code scanners and point-of-sale terminals, medical devices such as patient monitors and ultrasound imaging, and power supply equipment. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Automotive: This comprises chips used in electronic automotive components such as power steering and lighting. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Military and civil aerospace: This is a specialized segment where integrated circuits related to a particular application are built.

Market
 
The premium power switching device market is currently dominated by the semiconductor material silicon carbide (SiC). GaN-based systems outperform Si and SiC based systems in every way due to the superior material properties of GaN. However, GaN devices have, to-date proven difficult to process using standard semiconductor processing methods that are used to create Si and SiC based devices. While GaN can be implanted with ions through doping process like any other semiconductor, unlike Si or SiC, the temperature required to activate the ions in GaN destroys the crystal, making implant and activate scheme impractical in the GaN material. The Company has developed proprietary technology that allows activation of dopants in the GaN. This proprietary technology allows GaN to be processed in a manner that for the first time makes high voltage GaN power switching devices commercially viable.
Research and Development
 
The Company has incurred $607,148 in research expenses during the period covered by this report.
