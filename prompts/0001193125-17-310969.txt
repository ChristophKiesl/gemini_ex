ModusLink simplifies the returns process for retailers and manufacturers that want to improve service parts management and the value of returned assets.

 The Supply Chain Business solutions seamlessly integrate with other supply chain service providers such as contract manufacturing companies and transportation providers. 
 Operating Segments 
 The Company has four operating segments: Americas; Asia; Europe; and e-Business. Based on the information provided to the Companys chief operating decision-maker (CODM) for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance and quantitative thresholds, the Company has determined that it has four reportable segments: Americas, Asia, Europe and e-Business. The Company also has Corporate-level activity, which consists primarily of costs associated with certain corporate administrative functions such as legal and finance, which are not allocated to the Companys reportable segments. The Corporate-level balance sheet information includes cash and cash equivalents, trading securities, investments in affiliates, notes payables and other assets and liabilities which are not identifiable to the operations of the Companys operating segments. Certain reportable segment information, including revenue, profit and asset information, is set forth in Note 19 of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 below and in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Item 7 below. 
Technology Infrastructure 
 The Companys information technology systems and infrastructure serves as the backbone of a clients fully integrated global supply chain program and manages the flow and use of physical assets and information. The Company offers a secure and redundant operating environment to ensure the integrity and privacy of its clients data. The Company works with clients to integrate data, tools and applications to deliver an optimized solution that meets its clients business needs and improves management of the global supply chain.

The Companys Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system is designed to provide the visibility and control needed for better decision making, rapid response to global market dynamics and effective asset utilization across services and geographies. The Company has recently embarked on an ERP upgrade further improving its data collection and reporting tools and systems across its geographic footprint. 
 Facilities 
 The Companys global footprint consists of an integrated network of strategically located facilities, including sites throughout North America, Europe and Asia. The Companys regionally optimized and highly scalable solution centers are designed to provide the flexibility to manage supply chain requirements, deliver and configure products in-region, close to the point of consumption or close to the point of manufacturing in low-cost regions, such as Asia Pacific, Eastern Europe and Mexico for maximum efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Investments in automation and Lean methodologies have enhanced the Companys overall value proposition to its clients, enabling quicker response times, more efficient service levels and improved customer satisfaction. 
Sales and Marketing 
 The Companys sales and marketing staff is strategically and globally aligned to support the development, marketing and sale of its supply chain management services and solutions worldwide. 
 The Companys marketing efforts are focused on developing greater awareness and brand recognition among its target client base, with an emphasis on companies within its key markets of computing, software, storage, consumer electronics, communications and retail, among others. The Company markets its services and solutions through its website, other online channels, public relations, advertising and tradeshow campaigns, and has developed collateral materials and sales tools to support these efforts. The Company sells its services and solutions on a global scale, through a direct sales channel. The Companys strategically aligned, global sales staff identifies new opportunities and cultivates leads in all of its key regions throughout North America, Europe and Asia as well as within its target markets around the world. The Companys sales staff is focused on winning new programs with existing clients, while developing new relationships to further diversify its client base. 
 Competition 
 The market for the supply chain management service offerings provided by the Company is highly competitive. As an end-to-end solutions provider with service offerings covering a range of physical and digital supply chain operations and activities across the globe, the Company competes with different companies depending on the type of service it is providing or the geographic area in which an activity is taking place. 
 For the supply chain solutions, the Company faces competition from Electronics Manufacturing Services/Contract Manufacturers (EMS/CM), third party logistics (3PL) providers, Supply Chain Management (SCM) companies, and regional specialty companies. For the aftermarket services, the Company competes against independent repair vendors, EMS/CM companies, 3PL providers, and SCM companies. For the e-business solutions, the Companys competition includes global outsource providers, software as service providers and technology providers. For the entitlement management solutions the Company competes against computer software providers offering content and document management solutions. As a provider of an outsourcing solution, the Companys competition also includes current and prospective clients, who evaluate the Companys capabilities in light of their own capabilities and cost structures. 
 The Company believes that the principal competitive factors in its market are quality and range of solutions and services, technological capabilities, costs, location of facilities, responsiveness, and flexibility. With the Companys end-to-end physical and digital supply chain solution, global footprint, strong client service acumen, and its integrated global supply chain e-Commerce services, the Company believes that it is positioned well to compete in each of the markets it serves, while expanding across various industry subsets. 
Clients 
 A limited number of clients account for a significant percentage of the Companys consolidated net revenue. For the fiscal year ended July 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Companys 10 largest clients accounted for approximately 70%, 71% and 76% of consolidated net revenue, respectively. Sales to a consumer electronics client (Client A) accounted for approximately 15%, 13%, and 10% of the Companys consolidated net revenue for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Sales to

 a another consumer electronics client (Client B) accounted for approximately 10%, 13%, and 19% of the Companys consolidated net revenue for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Europe reportable segment reports revenue associated with Client A. All four reportable segments report revenues associated with Client B. In general, the Company does not have any agreements which obligate any client to buy a minimum amount of services from the Company, or which designate the Company as its sole supplier of any particular services. The loss of a significant amount of business or program with any key client could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company believes that it will continue to derive the vast majority of its consolidated operating revenue from sales to a small number of clients. There can be no assurance that revenue from key clients will not decline in future periods. 
 The Company sells its services to its clients primarily on a purchase order basis rather than pursuant to contracts with minimum purchase requirements. Consequently, sales are subject to demand variability by such clients. The Company purchases and maintains adequate levels of inventory in order to meet client needs rapidly and on a timely basis. The Company has no guaranteed price, quantity or delivery agreements with its suppliers other than the purchase obligations noted in Note 10 of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 below. Because of the diversity of its services, as well as the wide geographic dispersion of its facilities, the Company uses numerous sources for the wide variety of raw materials needed for its operations. The Company is not and does not expect to be adversely affected by an inability to obtain materials. 
 International Operations 
 The Company currently conducts business in many countries including China, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Ireland, and Singapore, among others, in addition to its North America operations. During the year ended July 31, 2017, approximately 76% of the Companys consolidated net revenue was generated internationally. Refer to Note 19 of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 below. 
 The Companys international operations increase its exposure to U.S. and foreign laws, regulations, and labor practices, which are often complex and subject to variation and unexpected changes, and with which the Company must comply. A substantial portion of our international business is conducted in China, where we face (i) the challenge of navigating a complex set of licensing and tax requirements and restrictions affecting the conduct of business in China by foreign companies, (ii) potential limitations on the repatriation of cash, (iii) foreign currency fluctuation and (iv) evolving tax laws. 
 Seasonality 
 The demand of our clients products is subject to seasonal consumer buying patterns. As a result, the services we provide to our clients are also subject to seasonality, with higher revenue and operating income typically being realized from handling our clients products during the first half of our fiscal year, which includes the holiday selling season. 
Intellectual Property 
 The Company relies upon a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property. From time to time, we develop new trade secrets and other intellectual property or obtain intellectual property through acquisition activities. Our business is not substantially dependent on any single or group of patents, trademarks, copyrights or licenses. 
Employees 
 At July 31, 2017, we employed approximately 1,990 persons on a full-time basis, 330 in the Americas, 940 in Asia and 720 in Europe. Our subsidiaries in Mexico are parties to several collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 48 employees. Our subsidiary in France is party to collective bargaining agreements covering its employees. Approximately 50 of the employees of our Ireland operation are members of labor unions. As of August 2017, approximately 110 of the employees at one of our China operations are members of labor unions. We consider our employee relations to be good. From time to time we hire project-based, temporary workers based on our client needs and seasonality of our business, and at times the number of these workers may approximate the number of our full-time employees.

 We make our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports available through our website, free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after we file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.
