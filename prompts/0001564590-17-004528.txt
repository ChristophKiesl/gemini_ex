Corporate Information 
 We were incorporated in Minnesota in 1998 under the name of GCI Lakes, Inc., which name was subsequently changed to Lakes Gaming, Inc. in August 1998, to Lakes Entertainment, Inc. in June 2002 and to Golden Entertainment, Inc. in July 2015. Our shares began trading publicly in January 1999. The mailing address of our headquarters is 6595 S Jones Boulevard, Las Vegas, Nevada 89118, and our telephone number at that location is (702) 893-7777.
Business Overview
 We are a diversified group of gaming companies that focus on distributed gaming (including tavern gaming) and casino and resort operations. 
 On July 31, 2015, we acquired Sartini Gaming through the merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of Golden with and into Sartini Gaming, with Sartini Gaming surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Golden (the “Merger”). The results of operations of Sartini Gaming and its subsidiaries have been included in our results subsequent to that date. Our common stock continues to be traded on the NASDAQ Global Market, and our ticker symbol was changed from “LACO” to “GDEN” effective August 4, 2015. 
 During the third quarter of 2015, we redefined our reportable segments to reflect the change in our business following the Merger. As a result of the Merger, we now conduct our business through two reportable operating segments: Distributed Gaming and Casinos. Prior to the Merger, we conducted our business through the following two segments: Rocky Gap and Other. Prior period information has been recast to reflect the new segment structure and present comparative year-over-year results. See Note 17, Segment Information, in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for financial information regarding our segments.
 Distributed Gaming 
 Our Distributed Gaming segment involves the installation, maintenance and operation of gaming and amusement devices in certain strategic, high-traffic, non-casino locations (such as grocery stores, convenience stores, restaurants, bars, taverns, saloons and liquor stores) in Nevada and Montana, and the operation of traditional, branded taverns targeting local patrons, primarily in the greater Las Vegas, Nevada metropolitan area. As of December 31, 2016, our distributed gaming operations comprised approximately 10,400 gaming devices in approximately 960 locations. In January 2016, we completed the acquisition of approximately 1,100 gaming devices from a distributed gaming operator in Montana, as well as certain other non-gaming assets and the right to operate within certain locations (the “Initial Montana Acquisition”). Additionally, in April 2016, we completed the acquisition of approximately 1,800 gaming devices from a second distributed gaming operator in Montana, as well as amusement devices and other non-gaming assets and the right to operate within certain locations (the “Second Montana Acquisition” and, together with the Initial Montana Acquisition, the “Montana Acquisitions”); see Note 3, Merger and Acquisitions, in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding the Montana Acquisitions.
 Nevada law limits distributed gaming operations (more commonly known as “restricted gaming” operations) to certain types of non-casino locations, including grocery stores, drug stores, convenience stores, restaurants, bars, taverns, saloons and liquor stores, where gaming is incidental to the primary business being conducted at the location and games are limited to 15 or fewer gaming devices and no other forms of gaming activity. The gaming area in these business locations is typically small, and in many instances, segregated from the primary business area, including the use of alcoves in grocery stores and drug stores and installation of gaming devices into the physical bar (more commonly known as “bar top” gaming devices) in bars, taverns and saloons. Such segregation provides greater oversight and supervision of the gaming devices. Under Montana law, distributed gaming operations are limited to business locations licensed to sell alcoholic beverages for on-premises consumption only, with such locations restricted to offering a maximum of 20 gaming devices.
 2


Gaming and amusement devices are placed in locations where we believe they will receive maximum customer traffic, generally near a store’s entrance. In Nevada, we generally enter into three types of gaming device placement contracts as part of our distributed gaming business: space lease, revenue share and participation agreements. Under space lease agreements, we pay a fixed monthly rental fee for the right to install, maintain and operate our gaming devices at a business location. Under revenue share agreements, we pay the business location a percentage of the gaming revenue generated from our gaming devices placed at the location, rather than a fixed monthly rental fee. With regard to both space lease and revenue share agreements, we hold the applicable gaming license to conduct gaming at the location (although revenue share locations are required to obtain separate regulatory approval to receive a percentage of the gaming revenue). Under participation agreements, the business location holds the applicable gaming license and retains a percentage of the gaming revenue that it generates from our gaming devices. In Montana, our gaming and amusement device placement contracts are all revenue share agreements. We also opened our first brewery in Las Vegas, PT’s Brewing Company, during the first quarter of 2016 to produce craft beer for our taverns, as well as other establishments licensed to sell liquor for on-premises consumption.
Our branded taverns offer a casually upscale environment catering to local patrons offering superior food, beer and other alcoholic beverages and typically include 15 onsite gaming devices. As of December 31, 2016, we operated 53 taverns, which offered approximately 850 onsite gaming devices. Most of our taverns are located in the greater Las Vegas, Nevada, metropolitan area and cater to locals seeking to avoid the congestion of the Las Vegas Strip. Our tavern brands include PT’s Pub, PT’s Gold, PT’s Place, PT’s Brewing Company, Sierra Gold, SG Bar and Sean Patrick’s. Our taverns also serve as an incubator for new games and technology that can then be rolled out to our third party distributed gaming customers within the segment and to our Casinos segment. 
 Casinos
 We own and operate the Rocky Gap Casino Resort in Flintstone, Maryland (“Rocky Gap”) and three casinos in Pahrump, Nevada: Pahrump Nugget Hotel Casino (“Pahrump Nugget”), Gold Town Casino and Lakeside Casino & RV Park. Pahrump is located approximately 60 miles from Las Vegas and is a gateway to Death Valley National Park. All of our casinos emphasize gaming device play. 
 Rocky Gap is situated on approximately 270 acres in the Rocky Gap State Park, which are leased from the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (the “Maryland DNR”) under a 40-year operating ground lease expiring in 2052 (plus a 20-year option renewal). As of December 31, 2016, Rocky Gap offered 662 gaming devices, 17 table games, two casino bars, three restaurants, a spa and the only Jack Nicklaus signature golf course in Maryland. Rocky Gap is a AAA Four Diamond Award® winning resort with approximately 200 hotel rooms, as well as an event and conference center.
 Our Pahrump Nugget casino is located on approximately 40 acres and, as of December 31, 2016, offered 453 gaming devices, as well as 11 table games (which include three live poker tables), a race and sports book, a 208-seat bingo facility and a bowling center. Pahrump Nugget is our largest property in the Nevada market with approximately 70 hotel rooms. 
 Our Gold Town Casino is located on four leased parcels of land, comprising approximately nine acres in the aggregate also in Pahrump, Nevada, and, as of December 31, 2016, offered 238 gaming devices and a 125-seat bingo facility. The leases for the parcels of land have various expiration dates beginning in 2026 (for the parcel on which our main casino building is located, which we lease from a competitor).
 Our Lakeside Casino & RV Park is located on approximately 35 acres also in Pahrump, Nevada, and, as of December 31, 2016, offered 190 gaming devices and a recreational vehicle park surrounding a lake with approximately 160 RV hook-up sites. 
 Sales and Marketing
 Distributed Gaming 
 We conduct our operations in our Distributed Gaming segment in Nevada and Montana. Our Distributed Gaming customer base is comprised of the third party distributed gaming customers with whom we enter into gaming and 
 3


amusement device placement contracts for the installation, maintenance and operation of gaming and amusement devices at non-casino locations, the primarily local patrons that use our gaming and amusement devices in such locations and the primarily local patrons of our traditional, branded taverns. We seek to place our gaming and amusement devices in strategic, high-traffic areas, including in our branded taverns, and the majority of our marketing efforts are focused on maximizing profitability from a high-frequency, convenience-driven customer base in the counties in which we operate. 
 Our marketing efforts also seek to capitalize on repeat visitation through the use of loyalty programs, such as our Golden Rewards promotional program for our taverns. Members of our Golden Rewards programs earn points based on play, which points are redeemable for complimentary slot play, food and beverages and other items. Our rewards technology is designed to track customer behavior indicators such as visitation, customer spend and customer engagement. Brand equity is also leveraged in our taverns through the number of our branded tavern locations located throughout the greater Las Vegas, Nevada metropolitan area. Our advertising initiatives include both traditional and non-traditional channels such as direct mail, email, radio, print, television, social media, search engine optimization and static/dynamic billboards.
 Casinos
 Rocky Gap is located in western Maryland in close proximity to the affluent and heavily populated metropolitan areas of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Baltimore, Maryland and Washington, D.C., as well as two major interstate freeways. Rocky Gap serves as a premier destination for both local and out-of-market patrons. Our marketing efforts for Rocky Gap are primarily focused on attracting patrons through local and regional campaigns promoting both the amenities of Rocky Gap and the vast array of outdoor activities available in the Rocky Gap State Park. A portion of Rocky Gap business is also arranged through group sales and bus coach wholesalers. 
 Our Nevada casinos are located in Pahrump, Nevada, which serves as a gateway to Death Valley National Park. Accordingly, we market our Nevada casino properties to both the locals market and tourist traffic, targeting the value-driven customer. We seek to attract local residents to our Nevada casinos through promotions geared towards enhancing local play, including dining offerings at our casino restaurants and promotions of our bowling and bingo amenities. Promotional programs for out-of-market patrons focus primarily on our newly remodeled hotel rooms at Pahrump Nugget and our award-winning recreational vehicle park surrounding a lake at the Lakeside Casino & RV Park.
 Our casino sales and marketing efforts also include rewards programs designed to encourage repeat business. We offer our Rewards Club promotional program at Rocky Gap and our Gold Mine Rewards promotional program at our Nevada casinos. The close proximity of our three Nevada casino properties allows us to leverage the convenience of a one-card player rewards system, where reward points and other benefits can be earned and redeemed across all three of our Nevada casinos via a single card. Members of our rewards programs earn points based on gaming activity and amounts spent on rooms, food, beverage and resort activities, which points may be redeemable (depending on the program) for complimentary slot play, food, beverages and hotel rooms, among other items. 
 Intellectual Property
 Our policy is to pursue registration of our important trademarks and service marks in the states where we do business and with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We have registered and/or have pending, among other trademarks and service marks, “Golden Entertainment,” “Golden Gaming,” “Golden Rewards,” “P.T.’s,” “Sierra Gold,” “PT’s Brewing Company” and “Pahrump Nugget Hotel Casino,” as trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. In addition, we have also registered or applied to register numerous other trademarks in various jurisdictions in the United States in connection with our properties, facilities and development projects. We also hold a patent in the United States related to player tracking systems.

Sale of Jamul Tribe Promissory Note
 On December 9, 2015, we sold our $60.0 million subordinated promissory note (the “Jamul Note”) from the Jamul Indian Village (the “Jamul Tribe”) to a subsidiary of Penn National Gaming, Inc. (“Penn National”) for $24.0 million in cash. We determined the fair value of the Jamul Note to be zero as of December 28, 2014. Under the terms of the January 2015 merger agreement with Sartini Gaming (the “Merger Agreement”) and subject to applicable law, we agreed that the proceeds received from the sale of the Jamul Note, net of related costs, would be distributed in a special cash dividend to our shareholders holding shares as of the record date for such dividend (other than shareholders that had waived their right to receive such dividend). On June 17, 2016, our Board of Directors approved and declared the special dividend to the eligible shareholders of record on the close of business on June 30, 2016 (the “Record Date”) of cash in the aggregate amount of approximately $23.5 million (the “Special Dividend”), which was paid on July 14, 2016. The $1.71 per share amount of the Special Dividend was calculated by dividing the aggregate amount of the Special Dividend by 13,759,374 outstanding shares of common stock held by eligible shareholders on the Record Date (rounded down to the nearest whole cent per share).
 In connection with the special dividend and in accordance with our equity incentive plans approved by our shareholders, equitable anti-dilutive adjustments were made to the exercise prices of outstanding stock options to purchase shares of our common stock in order to preserve the value of such stock options following the special dividend. Accordingly, effective as of the close of business on the dividend payment date of July 14, 2016, the exercise price of each stock option under our equity incentive plans outstanding on the Record Date was reduced by $1.71 per share. See Note 10, Share-Based Compensation, in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information on our anti-dilutive adjustments to the outstanding stock options. 
 Competition 
 The distributed gaming and casino resort industries are highly competitive. We face direct competition for our space lease, revenue share and participation locations from others involved in the distributed gaming business, as well as substantial competition for customers from other operators of casinos, hotels, taverns and other entertainment venues. With respect to our casinos, we compete for local gaming customers with other locals-oriented casino-hotels, as well as with other casinos and restricted gaming locations in the vicinity of our properties. We compete for customers primarily on the basis of location, customer service, range and pricing of amenities (including food and entertainment), gaming device payout rates, convenience and overall atmosphere. Many of our regional and national competitors have greater brand recognition and significantly greater resources than we have. Their greater resources may also provide them with the ability to expand operations in the future.
 In addition, we also face ever-increasing competition from online gaming, including mobile gaming applications for smart phones and tablet computers, state-sponsored lotteries, card clubs, and other forms of legalized gaming. In addition, various forms of internet gaming have been approved in Nevada, and legislation permitting internet gaming has been proposed by the federal government and other states. The expansion of internet gaming in Nevada and other jurisdictions could result in significant additional competition. Furthermore, several states are currently considering legalizing casino gaming in designated areas, and Native American tribes may develop or expand gaming properties in markets located more closely to our customer base. Legalized casino gaming in neighboring states and on Native American land could result in strong competition that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, particularly to the extent that such gaming is conducted in areas close to our gaming operations. 
 Regulation 
 Gaming Regulation
 As the owner and operator of gaming facilities, we are subject to extensive federal, state, and local regulation. State and local government authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate require us to obtain gaming licenses and require our officers, key employees and business entity affiliates to demonstrate suitability to be involved in gaming operations. These are privileged licenses or approvals which are not guaranteed by statute or regulation. State and local government authorities may limit, condition, suspend or revoke a license, impose substantial fines, and take other actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain and maintain the gaming licenses and 
 5


related approvals necessary to conduct our gaming operations. Any failure to maintain or renew our existing licenses, registrations, permits or approvals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Furthermore, if additional gaming laws or regulations are adopted, these regulations could impose additional restrictions or costs that could have a significant adverse effect on us and our business. 
 Gaming authorities may, in their sole and absolute discretion, require the holder of any securities issued by us to file applications, be investigated, and be found suitable to own our securities if they have reason to believe that the security ownership would be inconsistent with the declared policies of their respective states. Further, the costs of any investigation conducted by any gaming authority under these circumstances is typically required to be paid by the applicant, and refusal or failure to pay these charges may constitute grounds for a finding that the applicant is unsuitable to own the securities. If any gaming authority determines that a person is unsuitable to own our securities, then, under the applicable gaming laws and regulations, we can be sanctioned, including the loss of our privileged licenses or approvals, if, without the prior approval of the applicable gaming authority, we conduct certain business with the unsuitable person. 
 Our officers, directors, and key employees are also subject to a variety of regulatory requirements and various privileged licensing and related approval procedures in the various jurisdictions in which we operate gaming facilities. If any gaming authority with jurisdiction over our business were to find an officer, director or key employee of ours unsuitable for licensing or unsuitable to continue having a relationship with us, we would have to sever all relationships with that person. Furthermore, such gaming authorities may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications. Either result could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and prospects.
 Applicable gaming laws and regulations also restrict our ability to issue securities, incur debt, and undertake other financing activities. Such transactions would generally require approval of gaming authorities, and our financing counterparties, including lenders, might be subject to various licensing and related approval procedures in the various jurisdictions in which we operate gaming facilities. If state regulatory authorities were to find any person unsuitable with regard to his, her or its relationship to us or any of our subsidiaries, we would be required to sever our relationship with that person, which could materially adversely affect our business. 
 The gaming industry also represents a significant source of tax revenues to regulators. From time to time, various federal and state legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws, or in the administration of such laws, affecting the gaming industry. It is not possible to determine the likelihood of possible changes in tax laws or in the administration or interpretation of such laws. Such changes, if adopted, could have a material adverse effect on our future financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.
 From time to time, local and state lawmakers, as well as special interest groups, have proposed legislation that would expand, restrict or prevent gaming operations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Any such change to the regulatory environment or the adoption of new federal, state or local government legislation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
 Alcoholic Beverage and Food Service Regulation
 Our brewery operations at PT’s Brewing Company in Las Vegas, Nevada require federal, state, and local licenses, permits and approvals. Our restaurant and on-site brewery at PT’s Brewing Company operate pursuant to exceptions to the “tied house” laws, which in Nevada generally prohibit a manufacturer or supplier of brewery products from engaging in the business of wholesaling and prevent a wholesaler from engaging, directly or indirectly, in retail sales.
 The manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages is a highly regulated and taxed business. Our brewery operations are subject to more restrictive regulations and increased taxation by federal, state and local governmental entities than are those of non-alcohol related beverage businesses. Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the production and distribution of beer, including permitting, licensing, trade practices, labeling, advertising, marketing, distributor relationships and related matters. Federal, state and local governmental entities also levy various taxes, license fees, and other similar charges and may require bonds to ensure compliance with applicable laws and 
 6


regulations. Failure to comply with applicable federal, state or local laws and regulations could result in higher taxes, penalties, fees, and suspension or revocation of permits, licenses or approvals and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
 From time to time, local and state lawmakers, as well as special interest groups, have proposed legislation that would increase the federal and/or state excise tax on alcoholic beverages or certain types of alcoholic beverages. If adopted, such measures could affect some or all of our proprietary craft beer production. If federal or state excise taxes are increased, we may have to raise prices to maintain our current profit margins. Higher taxes may reduce overall demand for beer, thus negatively impacting sales of our beer. Further federal or state regulation may be forthcoming that could further restrict the distribution and sale of alcohol products. Any material increase in taxes or fees, or the adoption of additional taxes or fees or regulations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
 In addition, each restaurant we operate must obtain a food service license from local authorities. Failure to comply with such regulations could cause our licenses to be revoked or our related restaurant business or businesses to be forced to cease operations. Moreover, state liquor laws may prevent the expansion of restaurant operations into certain markets.
 Other Regulation
 We are also subject to extensive federal, state and local safety and health laws, regulations and ordinances that apply to non-gaming businesses generally, such as the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Occupational Safety and Health Act, Resource Conservation Recovery Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act. We believe that we are currently in material compliance with such regulations. The coverage and attendant compliance costs associated with such laws, regulations and ordinances may result in future additional cost to our operations. 
 We are also subject to a variety of other rules and regulations, including minimum wage, zoning, environmental, construction and land-use laws, regulations and permits. Any changes to these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
 Seasonality
 We believe that our Distributed Gaming and Casinos segments are affected by seasonal factors, including holidays, weather and travel conditions. Rocky Gap typically experiences higher revenues during summer months and may be significantly adversely impacted by inclement weather during winter months. Our casinos and distributed gaming business in Nevada have historically experienced lower revenues during the summer as a result of fewer tourists due to higher temperatures, as well as increased vacation activity by local residents. Our Nevada distributed gaming operations typically experience higher revenues during the fall which corresponds with several professional sports seasons. Our Montana distributed gaming operations typically experience higher revenues during the fall due to the inclement weather in the state and less opportunity for outdoor activities, in addition to the impact from professional sports seasons. While other factors like unemployment levels, market competition and the diversification of our business may either offset or magnify seasonal effects, some seasonality is likely to continue, which could result in significant fluctuation in our quarterly operating results.
Employees
 As of December 31, 2016, we had 2,802 total employees, of which approximately 10.3% were covered by a collective bargaining agreement. The collective bargaining agreement, which relates to employees at Rocky Gap, became effective on November 1, 2013 and expires on November 1, 2019. We consider our employee relations to be good.
