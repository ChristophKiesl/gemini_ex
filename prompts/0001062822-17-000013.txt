Item 1. Business
Overview

Lexicon Pharmaceuticals is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of breakthrough treatments for human disease.  We are presently devoting most of our resources to the commercialization or development of our four most advanced drug programs:

• | We have obtained approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, to sell our first commercial product, XERMELO™ (telotristat ethyl), an orally-delivered small molecule drug for the treatment of carcinoid syndrome diarrhea in combination with somatostatin analog, or SSA, therapy in adults inadequately controlled by SSA therapy. We have commenced sales and marketing of XERMELO, and it is now commercially available to patients in the United States. We have granted Ipsen Pharma SAS an exclusive, royalty-bearing right to commercialize telotristat ethyl outside of the United States and Japan, and Ipsen has filed an application for regulatory approval to market telotristat ethyl in the European Union. 


• | We are developing sotagliflozin, an orally-delivered small molecule drug candidate, as a treatment for type 1 and type 2 diabetes. We have reported positive top-line primary efficacy endpoint data from two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials of sotagliflozin in type 1 diabetes patients and are presently continuing such pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials and conducting a third Phase 3 clinical trial of sotagliflozin in type 1 diabetes patients. We have granted Sanofi an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing right to develop, manufacture and commercialize sotagliflozin, and Sanofi is presently conducting Phase 3 development of sotagliflozin in type 2 diabetes. 


• | We are developing LX2761, an orally-delivered small molecule drug candidate, as a treatment for diabetes. We are presently conducting Phase 1 development of LX2761. We have granted Sanofi certain rights of first negotiation with respect to the future development and commercialization of LX2761. 


• | We are developing LX9211, an orally-delivered small molecule drug candidate, as a treatment for neuropathic pain. We have completed preclinical studies required for the submission of an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, for LX9211 and are presently preparing to submit an IND and commence clinical development. 

Compounds from our most advanced drug programs, as well as compounds from a number of additional drug discovery and development programs that we have advanced into various stages of clinical and preclinical development, originated from our own internal drug discovery efforts. These efforts were driven by a systematic, target biology-driven approach in which we used gene knockout technologies and an integrated platform of advanced medical technologies to systematically study the physiological and behavioral functions of almost 5,000 genes in mice and assessed the utility of the proteins encoded by the corresponding human genes as potential drug targets. We have identified and validated in living animals, or in vivo, more than 100 targets with promising profiles for drug discovery.
We are working both independently and through strategic collaborations and alliances with third parties to capitalize on our drug target discoveries and drug discovery and development programs. We seek to retain exclusive or co-exclusive rights to the benefits of certain drug discovery and development programs by developing and commercializing drug candidates from those programs internally, particularly in the United States for indications treated by specialist physicians, as we have with XERMELO in the United States. We seek to collaborate with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, such as Ipsen and Sanofi, with respect to drug discovery or the development and commercialization of certain of our drug candidates, particularly with respect to commercialization in territories outside the United States, commercialization in the United States for indications treated by primary care physicians, or when the collaboration may otherwise provide us with access to expertise and resources that we do not possess internally or are complementary to our own.

Lexicon Pharmaceuticals was incorporated in Delaware in July 1995, and commenced operations in September 1995.  Our corporate headquarters are located at 8800 Technology Forest Place, The Woodlands, Texas 77381, and our telephone number is (281) 863-3000.

Drug Programs

We are presently devoting most of our resources to the commercialization or development of our four most advanced drug programs: XERMELO (telotristat ethyl) for carcinoid syndrome diarrhea in combination with SSA therapy in adults inadequately controlled by SSA therapy, sotagliflozin for type 1 and type 2 diabetes, LX2761 for diabetes and LX9211 for neuropathic pain. We have also advanced a number of additional compounds into various stages of clinical and preclinical development.
XERMELO (telotristat ethyl)

XERMELO is an orally-delivered small molecule compound approved by the FDA in February 2017 for the treatment of carcinoid syndrome diarrhea in combination with SSA therapy, the current standard of care, in adults inadequately controlled by SSA therapy. The recommended dose of XERMELO is 250mg three times daily, and the full prescribing information for XERMELO includes certain warnings and precautions relating to constipation. We have commenced sales and marketing of XERMELO, and it is now commercially available to patients in the United States.
XERMELO was internally generated by our scientists and inhibits tryptophan hydroxylase, or TPH, the rate-limiting enzyme for serotonin production found primarily in enterochromaffin cells of the gastrointestinal tract. Carcinoid syndrome can result when these cells become cancerous and metastisize to the liver or other organs, where they overproduce serotonin.
We have entered into a license and collaboration agreement under which we granted Ipsen an exclusive, royalty-bearing right and license to commercialize telotristat ethyl outside of the United States and Japan. Ipsen has submitted an application for regulatory approval to market telotristat ethyl in the European Union. Telotristat ethyl has received Orphan Drug designation from the Committee for Orphan Medical Products of the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of carcinoid tumors.
TELESTAR Pivotal Trial
Our pivotal TELESTAR Phase 3 clinical trial assessed the safety and efficacy of XERMELO and served as the primary basis for the regulatory approval of XERMELO in the United States. The trial enrolled 135 patients with inadequately controlled carcinoid syndrome on background SSA therapy in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 250mg three times daily and 500mg three times daily doses of XERMELO over a 12-week treatment period, followed by a 36-week, open-label extension where all patients received 500mg three times daily doses of XERMELO. The primary efficacy endpoint under evaluation in the trial was the number of daily bowel movements, with secondary efficacy endpoints including changes in urinary 5-HIAA, the primary metabolite of serotonin and a biomarker for serotonin synthesis, flushing episodes, abdominal pain and quality of life measures. Data from the study showed that patients who added XERMELO to the standard of care at both the 250mg and 500mg doses experienced a statistically significant reduction from baseline compared to placebo in the average number of daily bowel movements over the 12-week study period (p<0.001), meeting the study’s primary endpoint. Urinary 5-HIAA decreased from baseline following six and 12 weeks of treatment with XERMELO with the standard of care, and did not decrease for placebo. Thirty three percent of patients who added XERMELO to the standard of care at the 250mg dose experienced a reduction in overall bowel movements from baseline of at least two per day, as compared to four percent with placebo. A difference in average weekly reductions in bowel movement frequency between XERMELO and placebo was observed as early as one to three weeks, and persisted for the duration of the 12-week study period. The proportion of patients with treatment-emergent adverse events, serious adverse events and discontinuation due to adverse events were generally similar in all three treatment arms. The tolerability profile of the 250mg dose appeared similar to placebo and somewhat better than the 500mg dose with respect to gastrointestinal discomfort and mood.
Our TELECAST Phase 3 clinical trial of XERMELO was designed as a companion to our TELESTAR Phase 3 clinical trial. Data from the study showed that patients treated with XERMELO at both 250mg and 500mg three times daily doses experienced statistically significant reductions from baseline compared to placebo in urinary 5-HIAA at week 12 and in the average number of daily bowel movements over the 12-week study period. In general, the tolerability profile of both doses of XERMELO appeared similar to placebo and the overall incidence and nature of adverse events in TELECAST were consistent with those reported in previous studies.
Post-marketing Commitments
In connection with the regulatory approval of XERMELO in the United States, we are subject to the following post-marketing requirements or commitments:
 2


• | Two clinical pharmacology studies assessing the pharmacokinetics of XERMELO, one to assess the pharmacokinetics of administering XERMELO in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment, and the other to address the effect of administering concomitant gastric acid reducers on the pharmacokinetics of XERMELO;


• | A non-clinical study to further assess the carcinogenicity of XERMELO; and


• | Three non-clinical studies to further evaluate the drug interaction potential of XERMELO.

Commercialization
We have built an internal marketing organization and specialized sales force for the commercialization of XERMELO in the United States and an internal medical affairs function with responsibility for responding to external inquiries regarding the appropriate use of XERMELO with regularly updated and well-substantiated scientific and medical information. We are distributing XERMELO through two independent specialty pharmacies, allowing for efficient delivery of XERMELO by mail directly to patients.
We have established a comprehensive support program called LexCares to ensure that all appropriate patients have access to XERMELO.  LexCares is designed to support patients with any clinical or financial questions they may have while taking XERMELO. Staffed by nurses, pharmacists, and reimbursement experts, LexCares is intended to fully support the XERMELO patient and designed to provide comprehensive reimbursement support services, such as prior authorization support and benefits investigation. Through LexCares, we provide copay assistance to qualified, commercially insured patients to help minimize out-of-pocket costs, provide free drug to uninsured patients who meet certain clinical and financial criteria and make contributions to an independent copay assistance charity to help Medicare patients.
Sotagliflozin

Sotagliflozin is an orally-delivered small molecule compound that we are developing for the treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Sotagliflozin was internally generated by our scientists and inhibits both sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2, or SGLT2, a transporter responsible for most of the glucose reabsorption performed by the kidney, and sodium-glucose cotransporter type 1, or SGLT1, a transporter responsible for glucose and galactose absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. Our scientists identified mice lacking SGLT1, SGLT2 or both as having potent anti-diabetic phenotypes across multiple measures of glucose control and metabolism, and found that compounds inhibiting both targets had a favorable preclinical profile relative to compounds selective for SGLT2.
We have entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Sanofi under which we granted Sanofi an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing right and license to develop, manufacture and commercialize sotagliflozin. Under the alliance, we are responsible for conducting all clinical development activities relating to type 1 diabetes and Sanofi is responsible for conducting all clinical development activities relating to type 2 diabetes.
Type 1 Diabetes.
We reported top-line primary efficacy endpoint data in September 2016 from our pivotal inTandem1 Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the safety and tolerability of sotagliflozin and its effects on glycemic parameters associated with type 1 diabetes. The trial enrolled 793 patients with type 1 diabetes in the United States and Canada in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 200mg and 400mg once daily doses of sotagliflozin over a 24-week treatment period, followed by a 28-week extension. The primary efficacy endpoint under evaluation in the trial was the reduction of hemoglobin A1c, or A1C, versus placebo on optimized insulin treatment at 24 weeks, with secondary endpoints including percentage of patients achieving A1C levels of less than 7%, reduction in meal-time, or bolus, insulin use, and weight loss. Top-line data from the study showed that patients treated with sotagliflozin experienced statistically significant reductions in A1C from baseline of 0.43% for the 200mg dose (p<0.001) and 0.49% for the 400mg dose (p<0.001), as compared to a reduction of 0.08% on placebo after 24 weeks of treatment, meeting the study’s primary efficacy endpoint. Across all three dose arms (placebo, 200mg and 400mg), the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events were 67.5%, 67.3% and 71.0%, respectively; the incidence of serious adverse events were 3.4%, 3.8% and 6.9%, respectively; and the incidence of discontinuation due to adverse events were 1.5%, 1.1% and 3.8%, respectively. Two primary safety concerns for patients with type 1 diabetes are severe hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis, or DKA. The number of patients with severe hypoglycemic events during the 24-week treatment period was 18 (6.7%), 11 (4.2%) and 12 (4.6%) in the placebo, 200mg and 400mg dose arms, respectively. The number of patients with DKA events during the 24-week treatment period was 0 (0.0%), 3 (1.1%) and 8 (3.1%) in the placebo, 200mg and 400mg dose arms, respectively. We are presently completing the 28-week extension portion of the study.

 We reported top-line primary efficacy endpoint data in December 2016 from our pivotal inTandem2 Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the safety and tolerability of sotagliflozin and its effects on glycemic parameters associated with type 1 diabetes. The trial enrolled 782 patients with type 1 diabetes in Europe and Israel in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 200mg and 400mg once daily doses of sotagliflozin over a 24-week treatment period, followed by a 28-week extension. As with inTandem1, the primary efficacy endpoint under evaluation in the trial was the reduction of A1C versus placebo on optimized insulin treatment at 24 weeks, with secondary endpoints including percentage of patients achieving A1C levels of less than 7%, reduction in bolus insulin use, and weight loss. Top-line data from the study showed that patients treated with sotagliflozin experienced statistically significant reductions in A1C from baseline of 0.39% for the 200mg dose (p<0.001) and 0.37% for the 400mg dose (p<0.001), as compared to a reduction of 0.03% on placebo after 24 weeks of treatment, meeting the study’s primary efficacy endpoint. Across all three dose arms (placebo, 200mg and 400mg), the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events were 51.4%, 55.9% and 54.4%, respectively; the incidence of serious adverse events were 3.5%, 4.2% and 4.2%, respectively; and the incidence of discontinuation due to adverse events were 1.6%, 1.9% and 3.0%, respectively. The number of patients with severe hypoglycemic events during the 24-week treatment period was 7 (2.7%), 10 (4.2%) and 6 (2.3%) in the placebo, 200mg and 400mg dose arms, respectively. The number of patients with DKA events during the 24-week treatment period was 0 (0.0%), 1 (0.4%) and 3 (1.1%) in the placebo, 200mg and 400mg dose arms, respectively. We are presently completing the 28-week extension portion of the study.
We are also conducting a third Phase 3 clinical trial of sotagliflozin, inTandem3, which has completed enrollment of 1,406 patients with type 1 diabetes in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of a 400mg once daily dose of sotagliflozin over a 24-week treatment period. The primary efficacy endpoint under evaluation in the trial is the proportion of patients on optimized insulin treatment achieving A1C levels of less than 7% at 24 weeks without experiencing a severe hypoglycemic or DKA event, with secondary endpoints including the reduction of A1C, weight loss and systolic blood pressure levels.
We and Sanofi are presently preparing for the submission of an application for regulatory approval to market sotagliflozin for the treatment of type 1 diabetes in the United States. 
Type 2 Diabetes.
Sanofi is presently conducting Phase 3 development of sotagliflozin in type 2 diabetes patients. We previously completed two Phase 2 clinical trials evaluating the safety and tolerability of sotagliflozin and its effects on glycemic parameters associated with type 2 diabetes.
The Phase 2b clinical trial enrolled 299 patients with type 2 diabetes who were not adequately controlled on metformin monotherapy in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of 75mg once daily, 200mg once daily, 200mg twice daily and 400mg once daily doses of sotagliflozin, each administered in combination with standard metformin therapy over a 12‑week treatment period. The primary efficacy endpoint under evaluation in the trial was the change in A1C from baseline to week 12. Secondary efficacy endpoints included percentage of patients achieving A1C levels of less than 7%, as well as changes in fasting plasma glucose levels, weight, blood pressure and triglyceride levels. Data from the study showed that treatment with sotagliflozin demonstrated statistically significant benefits in the primary and multiple secondary endpoints. Patients in each of the 75mg once daily, 200mg once daily, 200mg twice daily and 400mg once daily sotagliflozin treatment arms had mean A1C reductions from baseline of 0.43, 0.52, 0.79 and 0.92 percent, respectively (p<0.001 for all treatment arms), while in patients randomized to placebo, A1C decreased by 0.09 percent. We also observed that patients treated with sotagliflozin showed significant reductions in body weight and blood pressure. Sotagliflozin was well tolerated and adverse events were generally mild to moderate, with the overall incidence of adverse events with sotagliflozin being similar to placebo.
The Phase 2a clinical trial enrolled 36 patients with non-insulin dependent type 2 diabetes in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of 150mg and 300mg doses of sotagliflozin, each administered once daily over a four-week treatment period. The efficacy endpoints under evaluation in the trial included urinary glucose excretion, fasting plasma glucose, response to oral glucose tolerance testing, and change in A1C. Data from the study showed that treatment with 150mg and 300mg of sotagliflozin provided improvements in glycemic control and demonstrated statistically significant benefits in the primary and multiple secondary efficacy endpoints. A marked and statistically significant decrease in fasting plasma glucose was observed at each measurement point throughout the treatment period in both treatment arms relative to placebo. After four weeks of dosing, patients in both dose groups exhibited statistically significant reductions in A1C as compared to patients receiving placebo (p=0.001 and p<0.001 for the 150mg and 300mg treatment arms, respectively). Patients in both treatment arms also exhibited statistically significant improvements in glucose tolerance in response to oral glucose tolerance testing (p<0.001 for both treatment arms). Consistent with the mechanism of action of sotgliflozin, there was also a significant, dose-
 4

dependent increase in 24-hour urinary glucose excretion in both treatment arms at each measurement point throughout the study period relative to placebo (p<0.001 at all time points measured). Patients in both treatment arms also showed positive trends in broader metabolic and cardiovascular parameters, including weight reduction, decreased blood pressure and lower triglyceride levels. Sotagliflozin was well tolerated in the trial, with no dose-limiting toxicities observed and adverse events being generally mild and equally distributed across all treatment groups, including the placebo group.
LX2761
LX2761 is an orally-delivered small molecule compound that we are developing for the treatment of diabetes. LX2761 was internally generated by our scientists and is designed to inhibit SGLT1 locally in the gastrointestinal tract without any significant inhibition of SGLT2 in the kidney. We are presently conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating the safety and tolerability of LX2761. The Phase 1 trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending single dose study of LX2761 in both healthy volunteers and patients with type 2 diabetes.
We have granted Sanofi certain rights of first negotiation with respect to the future development and commercialization of LX2761.
LX9211
LX9211 is an orally-delivered small molecule compound that we are developing for the treatment of neuropathic pain. LX9211 was jointly generated by our and Bristol-Myers Squibb’s scientists as part of our drug discovery alliance with Bristol-Myers Squibb and inhibits adaptor associated kinase 1, or AAK1, in the central nervous system. Our scientists identified mice lacking AAK1 as having increased resistance to induced neuropathic pain in preclinical models. We have completed IND-enabling studies of LX9211 and are presently preparing to submit an IND and commence clinical development.
We have obtained exclusive research, development and commercialization rights to LX9211 and additional compounds acting through AAK1 from Bristol-Myers Squibb.
Drug Target Discoveries
Our internal drug discovery efforts were driven by a systematic, target biology-driven approach in which we used gene knockout technologies and an integrated platform of advanced medical technologies to systematically study the physiological and behavioral functions of almost 5,000 genes in mice and assessed the utility of the proteins encoded by the corresponding human genes as potential drug targets. We have identified and validated in living animals, or in vivo, more than 100 targets with promising profiles for drug discovery.
Commercialization Strategy

We are working both independently and through strategic collaborations and alliances with third parties to capitalize on our drug target discoveries and drug discovery and development programs. Consistent with this approach, we seek to retain exclusive rights to the benefits of certain drug discovery and development programs by developing and commercializing drug candidates from those programs internally, particularly in the United States for indications treated by specialist physicians, as we have with XERMELO in the United States. We seek to collaborate with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, such as Ipsen and Sanofi, with respect to drug discovery or the development and commercialization of certain of our drug candidates, particularly with respect to commercialization in territories outside the United States, commercialization in the United States for indications treated by primary care physicians, or when the collaboration may provide us with access to expertise and resources that we do not possess internally or are complementary to our own. We also seek to collaborate with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, research institutes and academic institutions to capitalize on our drug target discoveries.
Strategic Collaborations
Sanofi. We entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Sanofi in November 2015 under which we granted Sanofi an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing right and license to develop, manufacture and commercialize sotagliflozin. We received a $300 million upfront payment under the agreement and we are eligible to receive up to $210 million upon the achievement of specified clinical development milestones, up to $220 million upon the achievement of specified regulatory 
milestones and up to $990 million upon the achievement of specified commercial milestones. We are also entitled to tiered, escalating royalties ranging from low double digit percentages to 40 percent of net sales of sotagliflozin, based on indication and territory, with royalties for the higher band of such range attributable to net sales for type 1 diabetes in the United States, and subject in each case to customary royalty reduction provisions. Royalties payable with respect to net sales of sotagliflozin for type 1 diabetes in the United States will also be reduced in the event we do not exercise our co-promotion option.
We are responsible for all clinical development activities relating to type 1 diabetes and retain an exclusive option to co-promote and have a significant role, in collaboration with Sanofi, in the commercialization of sotagliflozin for the treatment of type 1 diabetes in the United States. If we exercise our co-promotion option, we will fund 40 percent of the commercialization costs relating to such co-promotion activities. Sanofi is responsible for all clinical development and commercialization of sotagliflozin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes worldwide and is solely responsible for the commercialization of sotagliflozin for the treatment of type 1 diabetes outside the United States. We share in the funding of a portion of the planned type 2 diabetes development costs over the first three years of the collaboration, up to an aggregate of $100 million.
Ipsen. We entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Ipsen in October 2014 under which we granted Ipsen an exclusive, royalty-bearing right and license to commercialize telotristat ethyl outside of the United States, Canada and Japan. The collaboration was expanded in March 2015 to include Canada. We received $24.5 million in upfront payments under the agreement, a $6.4 million milestone payment in August 2016 upon the acceptance of the filing submitted by Ipsen to the European Medicines Agency for telotristat ethyl as an adjunct to SSA therapy for the long-term treatment of carcinoid syndrome, and we are eligible to receive up to approximately $27 million upon the achievement of specified regulatory and commercial launch milestones and up to €72 million upon the achievement of specified sales milestones. We are also entitled to tiered, escalating royalties ranging from low twenties to mid-thirties percentages of net sales of telotristat ethyl in the licensed territory, subject to a credit for Ipsen’s payments to us for the manufacture and supply of such units of telotristat ethyl and customary royalty reduction provisions.
Subject to certain exceptions, we are responsible for conducting clinical trials required to obtain regulatory approval for telotristat ethyl in the European Union and will have the first right to conduct most other clinical trials of telotristat ethyl.

Bristol-Myers Squibb.  We established a drug discovery alliance with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company in December 2003 to discover, develop and commercialize small molecule drugs in the neuroscience field.  Bristol-Myers Squibb extended the target discovery term of the alliance in May 2006.  We initiated the alliance with a number of neuroscience drug discovery programs at various stages of development and used our gene knockout technologies to identify additional drug targets with promise in the neuroscience field.  For those targets that were selected for the alliance, we and Bristol-Myers Squibb are working together, on an exclusive basis, to identify, characterize and carry out the preclinical development of small molecule drugs, and share equally both in the costs and in the work attributable to those efforts.  As drugs resulting from the alliance enter clinical trials, Bristol-Myers Squibb will have the first option to assume full responsibility for clinical development and commercialization. We received $86 million in upfront payments and research funding under the agreement during the target discovery portion of the alliance, which expired in October 2009. In addition, we are entitled to receive clinical and regulatory milestone payments ranging, depending on the timing and extent of our efforts in the alliance, up to $76 million for each drug developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb under the alliance.  We will also earn royalties on sales of drugs commercialized by Bristol-Myers Squibb under the alliance.
We jointly developed LX9211 with Bristol-Myers Squibb as part of the alliance, and separately obtained from Bristol-Myers Squibb exclusive research, development and commercialization rights to LX9211 and additional compounds acting through AAK1.
Genentech.  We established a drug discovery alliance with Genentech, Inc. in December 2002 to discover novel therapeutic proteins and antibody targets.  We and Genentech expanded the alliance in November 2005 for the advanced research, development and commercialization of new biotherapeutic drugs.  Under the original alliance agreement, we used our target validation technologies to discover the functions of secreted proteins and potential antibody targets identified through Genentech’s internal drug discovery research.  In the expanded alliance, we conducted additional, advanced research on a broad subset of those proteins and targets.  We have exclusive rights to develop and commercialize biotherapeutic drugs for two of these targets, while Genentech has exclusive rights to develop and commercialize biotherapeutic drugs for the other targets.  We retain certain other rights to discoveries made in the alliance, including non-exclusive rights, along with Genentech, for the development and commercialization of small molecule drugs addressing the targets included in the alliance. We received $58 million in upfront payments, research funding and research milestone payments under the agreement during the research collaboration term, which expired in November 2008.  In addition, we are entitled to receive clinical and regulatory milestone payments ranging, depending on the extent of our efforts in the alliance, up to $25 million for each drug target for which 
 5

Genentech develops a biotherapeutic drug under the alliance.  We will also earn royalties on sales of biotherapeutic drugs commercialized by Genentech under the alliance.  Genentech is entitled to receive milestone payments and royalties on sales of biotherapeutic drugs which we develop or commercialize under the alliance.
Other Collaborations
We have established collaborations with a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, research institutes and academic institutions under which we have received fees in exchange for generating knockout mice for genes requested by the collaborator, providing phenotypic data with respect to such knockout mice or otherwise granting access to some of our technologies and discoveries.  In some cases, we remain eligible to receive milestone or royalty payments on the sale of mice and phenotypic data or on products that our collaborators discover or develop using our technology.

Manufacturing and Distribution

We do not own or operate manufacturing or distribution facilities or resources for clinical or commercial production and distribution of our approved drug, XERMELO, or any of our drug candidates. Instead, we deploy internal resources to manage and oversee third parties working on our behalf under contract. These third parties procure raw materials, convert these raw materials into the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and then convert the API into finished drug product for use in commercial distribution or in clinical studies. All manufacturing occurs at facilities that comply with FDA requirements and the requirements of applicable foreign regulatory agencies.
The suppliers of our commercial and clinical supplies are located in multiple countries. Raw materials are procured from multiple third-party suppliers in Asia and Europe, third-party manufacturers in Asia and Europe convert those raw materials into API, and additional third-party manufacturers in Asia and North America convert the API into finished drug product for clinical and commercial purposes. We rely on sole source third-party manufacturers to produce finished drug product and package and label XERMELO for commercial distribution. We also rely on a single third-party logistics provider for shipping and warehousing of our commercial supply of XERMELO and two independent specialty pharmacies for dispensation of XERMELO to patients in fulfillment of prescriptions in the United States.
We are confident in the reliability of this supply chain and intend to continue to rely upon it for the foreseeable future.
Patents and Proprietary Rights

We will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that those rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. Accordingly, patents and other proprietary rights are an essential element of our business.  We own or exclusively license patents and/or patent applications throughout the world that claim our approved drug, XERMELO, and our drug candidates, including:

• | issued patents and pending patent applications in Europe, the United States, and other countries throughout the world, including Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, India, Israel, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, South

 7

Africa, and South Korea, that claim telotristat ethyl and associated crystalline forms, pharmaceutical compositions comprising telotristat ethyl, and methods of its manufacture and use;

• | issued patents and pending patent applications in Europe, the United States, and other countries throughout the world, including Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, India, Israel, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa, and South Korea, that claim sotagliflozin and associated crystalline forms, pharmaceutical compositions comprising sotagliflozin, and methods of its manufacture and use;


• | pending patent applications in Europe, the United States, and other countries throughout the world, including Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, India, Israel, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa, and South Korea, that disclose and/or claim LX2761, pharmaceutical compositions comprising LX2761, and methods of its use; and


• | pending patent applications in Europe, the United States, and other countries throughout the world, including Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, India, Israel, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa, and South Korea, that disclose and/or claim LX9211, pharmaceutical compositions comprising LX9211, and methods of its use.

Additionally, we hold rights to a number of patents and patent applications under license agreements with third parties.  Many of these licenses are nonexclusive, although some are exclusive in specified fields.  Most of the licenses have terms that extend for the life of the licensed patents.

Patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends on the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country.  We have filed patent applications and hold issued patents covering our approved drug, XERMELO, and each of our drug candidates.  None of our United States patents that claim XERMELO or one of our drug candidates has a normal expiration date earlier than 2026.
All of our employees, consultants and advisors are required to execute a proprietary information agreement upon the commencement of employment or consultation. In general, the agreement provides that all inventions conceived by the employee or consultant, and all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the term of the agreement, shall be our exclusive property and shall be kept confidential, with disclosure to third parties allowed only in specified circumstances. We cannot assure you, however, that these agreements will provide useful protection of our proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.
Our patent and intellectual property rights are subject to certain rights and uncertainties. See “Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” under “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

Competition

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change.  We face significant competition in each of the aspects of our business from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as academic research institutions, clinical reference laboratories and governmental agencies that are pursuing research or development activities similar to ours. Many of our competitors have substantially greater research, development and commercialization capabilities and financial, scientific, marketing and human resources than we do.  As a result, our competitors may succeed in developing products earlier than we do, obtaining approvals from the FDA or other regulatory agencies for those products more rapidly than we do, developing products that are more effective than those we develop or commercializing products more effectively and profitably than we do.  Similarly, our collaborators face similar competition from other competitors who may succeed in developing products more quickly, developing products that are more effective than those developed by our collaborators or commercialize products more effectively and profitably than our collaborators.
The competition for our products and drug candidates includes both marketed products and drug candidates that are being developed by others, including pharmaceutical products that are currently in a more advanced stage of clinical development or commercialization than are our own drug candidates.  These competitive marketed products and drug candidates include compounds that employ different mechanisms of action in addressing diseases and conditions for which we are developing our own drug candidates and, in some cases such as sotagliflozin, that employ the same or similar mechanisms of action.
 8


We believe that our ability to successfully compete with these potentially competitive drug candidates and other competitive products currently on the market will depend on, among other things:


• | the efficacy, safety and reliability of our products;


• | our ability, and the ability of our collaborators, to complete preclinical and clinical development and obtain regulatory approvals for our drug candidates;


• | the timing and scope of regulatory approvals of our products;


• | our ability, and the ability of our collaborators, to obtain product acceptance by physicians and other health care providers and secure coverage and adequate reimbursement for product use in approved indications;


• | our ability, and the ability of our collaborators, to manufacture and sell commercial quantities of our products;


• | the skills of our employees and our ability to recruit and retain skilled employees;


• | protection of our intellectual property; and


• | the availability of substantial capital resources to fund development and commercialization activities.

Our principal competition for XERMELO includes the use, above their maximum labeled dose, of the established SSA therapies octreotide and lanreotide, injectable products currently marketed by Novartis and Ipsen, respectively.
If approved for the treatment of type 1 diabetes, we expect that our principal competition for sotagliflozin will include established insulin therapies, as well as selective SGLT2 inhibitors which may gain regulatory approval for the treatment of type 1 diabetes, such as dapagliflozin, empagliflozin and canagliflozin, currently marketed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes by AstraZeneca, Boehringer Ingelheim and Eli Lilly, and Janssen (a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson), respectively. If approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, we expect that our principal competition for sotagliflozin will include such selective SGLT2 inhibitors, as well as inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase-4, or DPP-4, such as sitagliptin, currently marketed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes by Merck.

Government Regulation

The development, manufacture and sale of XERMELO and any other pharmaceutical products developed by us or our collaborators are subject to extensive regulation by United States and foreign governmental authorities, including federal, state and local authorities.  In the United States, new drugs are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder, or the FDC Act.  The FDA and comparable governmental authorities regulate, among other things, the development, preclinical and clinical testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, record keeping, reporting, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale, distribution and export of pharmaceutical products.

The standard process required by the FDA before a drug candidate may be marketed in the United States generally includes the following:


• | preclinical laboratory and animal tests performed under the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practices regulations;


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may commence;


• | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug candidate for its intended use;


• | pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities and selected clinical investigators for their compliance with FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices and Good Clinical Practices regulations;


• | submission and FDA approval of a New Drug Application, or NDA, for commercial marketing and sale, or of an NDA supplement, for approval of a new indication if the product is already approved for another indication.

     This process for the testing and approval of drug candidates requires substantial time, effort and financial resources.  Preclinical development of a drug candidate can take from one to several years to complete, with no guarantee that 
 9

an IND based on those studies will become effective to even permit clinical testing to begin.  Before commencing the first clinical trial of a drug candidate in the United States, we must submit an IND to the FDA.  The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial.  In such a case, we and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial may begin.  Submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development, and the FDA must grant permission for each clinical trial to start and continue.  Further, an independent institutional review board for each medical center proposing to participate in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that center.  Regulatory authorities or an institutional review board or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.

For purposes of NDA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap.


• | Phase 1 clinical trials are conducted in a limited number of healthy human volunteers or, in some cases, patients, to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion of the drug candidate;


• | Phase 2 clinical trials are conducted in groups of patients afflicted with a specified disease or condition to obtain preliminary data regarding efficacy as well as to further evaluate safety and optimize dosing of the drug candidate. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials; and 


• | Phase 3 clinical trials are conducted in larger patient populations at multiple clinical trial sites to obtain statistically significant evidence of the efficacy of the drug candidate for its intended use and to further test for safety in an expanded patient population.

In addition, the FDA may require, or companies may pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved.  These so-called Phase 4 studies may be made a condition to be satisfied after a drug receives approval. Failure to satisfy such post-marketing commitments can result in FDA enforcement action, up and to including withdrawal of NDA approval. The results of phase 4 studies can confirm the effectiveness of a drug candidate and can provide important safety information to augment the FDA’s adverse drug reaction reporting system.
After completion of clinical trials, FDA approval of an NDA must be obtained before a new drug may be marketed in the United States.  The submission of an NDA requires payment of a substantial user fee to the FDA. An NDA must contain, among other things, information on chemistry, manufacturing controls and potency and purity, non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology, human pharmacokinetics and bioavailability and clinical data.  There can be no assurance that the FDA will accept an NDA for filing and, even if accepted for filing, that approval will be granted.  The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on NDA review questions. Among other things, the FDA reviews an NDA to determine whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed, or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency.  The FDA may deny approval of an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or it may require additional clinical data or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial.  Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.  Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory standards are not met or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market.  In addition, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products which have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs.  Limited indications for use or other conditions on labeling, marketing and distribution could also be placed on any approvals that could restrict the commercial applications of a product or impose costly procedures in connection with the commercialization or use of the product.
In addition to obtaining FDA approval for each product, each drug manufacturing establishment must be inspected and approved by the FDA.  All manufacturing establishments are subject to inspections by the FDA and by other federal, state and local agencies and must comply with current Good Manufacturing Practices requirements.  Non-compliance with these requirements can result in, among other things, total or partial suspension of production, failure of the government to grant approval for marketing and withdrawal, suspension or revocation of marketing approvals.
Satisfaction of FDA requirements typically takes many years, with the actual time required varying substantially based on, among other things, the nature and complexity of the drug candidate and of the disease or condition.  Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of drug candidates or new diseases for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures upon our activities. Success in earlier-stage clinical trials does not ensure success in later-stage clinical 
 10

trials.  Targets and pathways identified in vitro may be determined to be less relevant in clinical studies and results in animal model studies may not be predictive of human clinical results. Furthermore, data obtained from clinical activities is not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Even if a drug candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific disease states, patient populations and dosages. Further, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market.

Once the FDA approves a product, a manufacturer must provide certain updated safety and efficacy information.  Product changes as well as certain changes in a manufacturing process or facility would necessitate additional FDA review and approval.  Other post-approval changes may also necessitate further FDA review and approval.  Additionally, a manufacturer must meet other requirements including those related to adverse event reporting and record keeping.

Products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including record-keeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences with the drug. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with GMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers.
The FDA closely regulates the marketing and promotion of drugs.  A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA.  Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may, in their independent medical judgment, prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturers’ communications on the subject of off-label use. Additionally, a significant number of pharmaceutical companies have been the target of inquiries and investigations by various United States federal and state regulatory, investigative, prosecutorial and administrative entities in connection with the promotion of products for off-label uses and other sales practices. These investigations have alleged violations of various United States federal and state laws and regulations, including claims asserting antitrust violations, violations of the FDC Act, false claims laws, the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, anti-kickback laws, and other alleged violations in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses, pricing and Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursement.
The United States Orphan Drug Act promotes the development of products that demonstrate promise for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases or conditions that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. Upon FDA receipt of Orphan Drug designation, the sponsor is eligible for tax credits of up to 50% for qualified clinical trial expenses, the ability to apply for annual grant funding, waiver of PDUFA application fee and upon approval, the potential for seven years of market exclusivity for the orphan-designated product for the orphan-designated indication.
The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track, priority review and accelerated approval, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for developing and reviewing promising drugs, or to provide for the approval of a drug on the basis of a surrogate endpoint. Generally, drugs that are eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and fill unmet medical needs. Priority review is designed to give drugs that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists an initial review within six months of NDA filing as compared to a standard review time of 10 months from NDA filing. Although Fast Track and priority review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast Track-designated drug and expedite review of the application for a drug designated for priority review. Accelerated approval provides for an earlier approval for a new drug that is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and that fills an unmet medical need based on a surrogate endpoint. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a product candidate receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing clinical trials to confirm the clinically meaningful outcome as predicted by the surrogate marker trial. In addition to the Fast Track, accelerated approval and priority review programs, the FDA also designates Breakthrough Therapy status to drugs that are intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a breakthrough 
 11

therapy product candidate receives intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program, intensive involvement of senior managers and experienced staff on a proactive, collaborative and cross-disciplinary review and rolling review.

Regulation Outside of the United States
In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to the regulations of other countries governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products outside of the United States. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside of the United States before we can commence clinical trials in such countries and approval of the regulators of such countries or economic areas, such as the European Union, before we may market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
Under European Union regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states. Within 90 days of receiving the applications and assessments report, each member state must decide whether to recognize approval. If a member state does not recognize the marketing authorization, the disputed points are eventually referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states.
As in the United States, we may apply for designation of a product as an Orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the European Union before the application for marketing authorization is made. Orphan drugs in Europe enjoy economic and marketing benefits, including up to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved indication unless another applicant can show that its product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan-designated product.
Healthcare Regulation
Federal and state healthcare laws, including fraud and abuse and health information privacy and security laws, also apply to our business. If we fail to comply with those laws, we could face substantial penalties and our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to: the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits. among other things, soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; and federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent. Additionally, we are subject to state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, which may be broader in scope and apply regardless of payer, and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, further complicate compliance efforts.
Numerous federal and state laws, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. Other countries also have, or are developing, laws governing the collection, use and transmission of personal information. In addition, most healthcare providers who are expected to prescribe our products and from whom we obtain patient health information, are subject to privacy and security requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, or HIPAA. Although we are not directly subject to HIPAA, we could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain individually identifiable health information from a HIPAA-covered entity, including healthcare providers, in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing amount of focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect our business, including recently enacted laws in a majority of states requiring security breach notification. These laws could create liability for us or increase our cost of doing business. International laws regulate the processing of personal data within Europe and between European countries and the United States. Failure to provide adequate privacy protections and maintain compliance with safe harbor mechanisms could jeopardize business transactions across borders and result in significant penalties.
In addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act, or the PPACA, created a federal requirement under the federal Open Payments program, that requires certain manufacturers to track and report to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, annually certain payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals made in the previous calendar year. In addition, there are 
 12

also an increasing number of state laws that require manufacturers to make reports to states on pricing and marketing information. These laws may affect our sales, marketing, and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. In addition, given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities.
For those marketed products which are covered in the United States by the Medicaid program, we have various obligations, including government price reporting and rebate requirements, which generally require products be offered at substantial rebates/discounts to Medicaid and certain purchasers. We are also required to discount such products to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, under which additional laws and requirements apply. These programs require submission of pricing data and calculation of discounts and rebates pursuant to complex statutory formulas, as well as the entry into government procurement contracts governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations, and the guidance governing such calculations is not always clear. Compliance with such requirements can require significant investment in personnel, systems and resources, but failure to properly calculate our prices, or offer required discounts or rebates could subject us to substantial penalties.  One component of the rebate and discount calculations under Medicaid is the “additional rebate,” a complex calculation which is based, in part, on the rate at which a branded drug price increases over time more than the rate of inflation (based on the CPI-U). This comparison is based on the baseline pricing data for the first full quarter of sales associated with a branded drug’s NDA, and baseline data cannot generally be reset, even on transfer of the NDA to another manufacturer.
Other Regulations

In addition to the foregoing, our business is subject to regulation under various state and federal environmental laws, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act.  These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in and wastes generated by our operations.  We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that our continued compliance with these laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business.  We cannot predict, however, whether new regulatory restrictions will be imposed by state or federal regulators and agencies or whether existing laws and regulations will adversely affect us in the future.
Research and Development Expenses

In 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, we incurred expenses of $178.2 million, $95.2 million and $89.3 million in company-sponsored as well as collaborative research and development activities, including $3.9 million, $3.7 million and $4.0 million of stock-based compensation expense in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Employees

As of February 28, 2017, we employed 168 persons, of whom 31 hold M.D. or Ph.D. degrees and another 34 hold other advanced degrees.  None of our employees are represented by a labor union and we believe that our relationship with our employees is good.
