Company Overview

ChromaDex is a global bioscience company dedicated to healthy aging. The ChromaDex team, which includes world-renowned scientists, is pioneering research on nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (“NAD+”), levels of which decline with age. 

NAD+ is an essential coenzyme and a key regulator of cellular metabolism. Best known for its role in cellular energy production, NAD+ is now thought to play an important role in healthy aging. Many cellular functions related to health and healthy aging are sensitive to levels of locally available NAD+ and this represents an active area of research in the field of NAD+.

NAD+ levels are not constant, and in humans, NAD+ levels have been shown to decline by more than 50% from young adulthood to middle age. NAD+ continues to decline as humans grow older. There are other causes of NAD+ depletion, such as poor diet, alcohol consumption and a number of disease states. NAD+ levels may also be increased, including through calorie restriction and moderate exercise. Healthy aging, mitochondrial health and NAD+ continue to be areas of focus in the research community. As of 2020, there were over 350 published human clinical studies related to NAD+. The areas of study include understanding NAD+’s role in Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, neuropathy and heart failure.

In 2013, ChromaDex commercialized NIAGEN® nicotinamide riboside (“NR”), a novel form of vitamin B3. Data from numerous preclinical studies, and confirmed in human clinical trials, show that NR is a highly efficient NAD+ precursor that significantly raises NAD+ levels. NIAGEN® is safe for human consumption. NIAGEN® has twice been successfully reviewed under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s new dietary ingredient (“NDI”) notification program, has been successfully notified to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) as generally recognized as safe (“GRAS”), and has been approved as safe by Health Canada, the European Commission and the Therapeutic Goods Administration of Australia. Clinical studies of NIAGEN® have demonstrated a variety of outcomes including increased NAD+ levels, increased cellular metabolism and increased energy production. NIAGEN® is the trade name for our proprietary ingredient NR, and is protected by patents to which we are the exclusive licensee.

ChromaDex is among the world leaders in the emerging NAD+ space. ChromaDex has amassed more than 200 research partnerships with leading universities and research institutions around the world including the National Institutes of Health, Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Cambridge and the Mayo Clinic. Additional relationships are currently being developed.

Our scientific advisory board is led by Chairman Dr. Roger Kornberg, Nobel Laureate Stanford Professor, Dr. Charles Brenner, one of the world’s recognized experts in NAD+ and inventor of nicotinamide riboside, Dr. Rudy Tanzi, the co-chair of the department of neurology at Harvard Medical School and one of the world’s leading experts in food and nutrition, Sir John Walker, Nobel Laureate and Emeritus Director, MRC Mitochondrial Biology Unit in the University of Cambridge, England, Dr. Bruce German, Chairman of food, nutrition and health at the University of California, Davis, Dr. Brunie Felding, Associate Professor, Department of Molecular Medicine at Scripps Research Institute, California Campus, and Dr. David Katz, the founder and former director of Yale University’s Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center.

STRATEGIC SHIFT TO GLOBAL CONSUMER PRODUCT COMPANY

In 2017, ChromaDex made the strategic decision to commercialize TRU NIAGEN® as a consumer brand for the product containing NIAGEN® ingredient. This marked our strategic shift from an ingredient testing company to a global, bioscience company dedicated to healthy aging.

We began the international expansion of our TRU NIAGEN® brand with the launch in Hong Kong and Macau with our strategic partner, A.S. Watson Group, in 2017, followed by the launch in Singapore in 2018. In 2018, we also launched TRU NIAGEN® in New Zealand with retail partner Matakana Superfoods and in Canada by making it available at www.truniagen.ca and to healthcare practitioners at Fullscript Canada after receiving regulatory approval for sale from Health Canada. We are currently selling cross border in China on Tmall, JD.com, Kaola.com and Wechat and on Amazon in Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Netherlands and Sweden. In 2019, we received a positive opinion from the European Food Safety Authority on NR as a novel food ingredient for use in food supplement and approval from the Australian Therapeutic Goods Association (“TGA”) for use in listed complementary medicines. With the TGA approval we extended our partnership with our New Zealand partner, Matakana Superfoods, to also include Australia. We will continue to focus on obtaining additional regulatory approvals required to expand our marketing and distribution of our TRU NIAGEN® brand in new strategic international markets.

INGREDIENTS AND ANALYTICAL REFERENCE STANDARDS AND SERVICES BUSINESS SEGMENTS

Through our ingredients business segment, we will continue to sell NIAGEN® in ingredient form to our strategic partners, including Nestec Ltd. (“Nestlé”), a global leader pioneering quality science-based nutritional health solutions. In 2018, we entered into a supply agreement with Nestlé, pursuant to which Nestlé is our exclusive customer for NIAGEN® for human use in the (i) medical nutritional and (ii) functional food and beverage categories in certain territories. As consideration for the rights granted to Nestlé, we received an upfront fee of $4.0 million. In 2020, we received an additional one-time fee of $1.0 million, following the launch of the products in the United States. Nestlé will potentially pay us multiple one-time fees for a total aggregate payment up to $6.0 million in product launch fees, following the launch of the products in certain territories. 

We are a leading provider of research and quality-control products and services to the natural products and life science industries. Through our analytical reference standards and services segment, customers worldwide in the dietary supplement, food and beverage, cosmetic, pharmaceutical, and life science industries use our products, which are small quantities of highly-characterized, research-grade, plant-based materials, to ensure the quality of their raw materials and finished products. We have conducted this analytical reference standards and services business since 1999.

For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, our revenues were approximately $59.3 million and $46.3 million, respectively. The following table summarizes the Company’s total sales for each of the business segments in the last two years. Please refer to Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for additional financial information for each of the business segments.

Impact of COVID-19

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to drive global uncertainty and disruption, which has created headwinds for our business. Our ecommerce consumer products business segment continues to perform relatively well in this challenging environment.

Our consumer products retail business, including sales to A.S. Watson group and other partners in international markets, has been more impacted by the effects of COVID-19, due to store closures and reduced operating hours.  To date, we have successfully navigated the business during the COVID-19 pandemic, managing our working capital effectively.

We have experienced shipment delays from our suppliers; however, we have not encountered any major disruptions in our supply chain.  We have been maintaining adequate safety stocks to support our growth and we currently have adequate inventory on hand to meet our current demands.  Overall, we believe the supply chain disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic will not have a material impact to our business operations.

In response to the outbreak, we prioritized the health and safety of our employees by closing our offices or enhancing safety protocols in place to ensure the well-being of our employees.  We have been able to successfully conduct business virtually.

Sales and Marketing Strategy

For our consumer products segment, we employ a variety of strategies to drive sales and consumer awareness of TRU NIAGEN®, including social media and internet advertising, managing websites, influencers, paid spokespersons and talent, events and tradeshows, e-mail, paid search, distribution of research publications and press releases. We also have a customer care department that handles day-to-day communications with our end customers addressing any needs or concerns related to our TRU NIAGEN® product.

For our ingredients segment and analytical reference standards and services segment, our strategy is based on a direct, technically-oriented model. We recruit and hire sales and marketing staff with appropriate commercial and scientific backgrounds. 

USA:

For our consumer products segment, we distribute our TRU NIAGEN® products direct to consumers through our propriety ecommerce platform TRUNIAGEN.com, Amazon and other established internet marketplaces. We also have specialty retailers and direct healthcare practitioners who are authorized resellers of TRU NIAGEN® in the U.S. 

For our ingredients segment and analytical reference standards and services segment, we intend to continue to use a direct marketing approach in the U.S. to promote our products and services.

Government Regulation 

Some of our operations are subject to regulation by various United States federal agencies and similar state and international agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), the Department of Commerce, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Agriculture and other state and international agencies. These regulators govern a wide variety of production activities, from design and development to labeling, manufacturing, handling, selling and distributing of products. From time to time, federal, state and international legislation is enacted that may have the effect of materially increasing the cost of doing business or limiting or expanding our permissible activities. We cannot predict whether or when potential legislation or regulations will be enacted, and, if enacted, the effect of such legislation, regulation, implementation, or any implemented regulations or supervisory policies would have on our financial condition or results of operations. In addition, the outcome of any litigation, investigations or enforcement actions initiated by state or federal authorities could result in changes to our operations being necessary and in increased compliance costs. 
U.S. FDA Regulation

In the United States dietary supplements and food are subject to FDA regulations. For example, the FDA’s final rule on Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMPs”) for dietary supplements published in June 2007 requires companies to evaluate products for identity, strength, purity and composition. Other regulations, for new dietary ingredients (“NDI”), require a pre-market notification that must be submitted to the FDA along with evidence of safety. In addition, depending on the type of product, whether a dietary supplement, cosmetic, food, or pharmaceutical, the FDA, under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”), can regulate: 

· | product testing; 
--+------------------------------------------------------
· | ingredient testing; 
· | documentation process, batch records, specifications;
· | product labeling; 
· | product manufacturing and storage; 
· | product claims, advertising and promotion; 
· | product sales and distribution; and 
· | Product post-market surveillance 


The FDCA has been amended several times with respect to dietary supplements, most notably by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (“DSHEA”). DSHEA established a new framework for governing the composition and labeling of dietary supplements. Generally, under DSHEA, dietary ingredients that were marketed in the United States before October 15, 1994, may be used in dietary supplements without notifying the FDA. However, an NDI (a dietary ingredient that was not marketed in the United States before October 15, 1994) is subject to NDI notification that must be submitted to the FDA unless the ingredient has previously been “present in the food supply as an article used for food” without being “chemically altered.” An NDI notification must provide the FDA with evidence of a “history of use or other evidence of safety” establishing that the use of the dietary ingredient “will reasonably be expected to be safe.” An NDI notification must be submitted to the FDA at least 75 days before the initial marketing of the NDI. There can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the evidence of safety for any NDIs that we may want to commercialize, and the FDA’s objection to such evidence could render products containing such dietary ingredients to be adulterated. The FDA is in the process of developing guidance for the industry that will aim to clarify the agency’s interpretation of the NDI notification requirements, and this guidance may raise new and significant regulatory barriers for NDIs. 


10


For any new ingredient developed by us to be used in conventional food or beverage products in the United States, the product either must be approved by the FDA as a food additive pursuant to a food additive petition (“FAP”) or be generally recognized as safe (“GRAS”). The FDA does not have to approve a company’s determination that an ingredient is GRAS. However, a company can voluntarily notify the FDA of its own self-determination. There can be no assurance that the FDA will approve any FAP for any ingredient that we may want to commercialize, or agree with our determination that an ingredient is GRAS, either of which could impact the marketing of such ingredient. 

U.S. Advertising Regulations

In addition to FDA regulations, the FTC regulates the advertising of dietary supplements, foods, cosmetics, and over-the-counter (“OTC”) drugs. In recent years, the FTC has instituted numerous enforcement actions against dietary supplement companies for failure to adequately substantiate claims made in advertising or for the use of false or misleading advertising claims. These enforcement actions have often resulted in consent decrees and the payment of civil penalties, restitution, or both, by the companies involved. We may be subject to regulation under various state and local laws that include provisions governing, among other things, the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising and distribution of dietary supplements, foods, cosmetics and OTC drugs. 

In addition, The National Advertising Division of the Council of Better Business Bureaus reviews national advertising for truthfulness and accuracy. The National Advertising Division of the Council of Better Business Bureaus uses a form of alternative dispute resolution, working closely with in-house counsel, marketing executives, research and development departments and outside consultants to decide whether claims have been substantiated. 

International Regulations

Our international sales for the consumer products segment and ingredients segment are subject to foreign government regulations, which vary substantially from country to country. Most countries, in particular major markets, have established regulations for (a) authorizing the introduction of novel ingredients to market in the food and/or dietary/food/health supplement sectors and (b) for allowing finished goods to be placed on the market for consumer access. Typically, novel ingredients must go through an extensive safety review process (similar to the NDI notification process in the US) by a regulatory or scientific authoritative body. Finished products typically must either be notified or registered (a limited approval process) with the relevant authorities. In some cases, new products can be brought to market without notifying the authorities.

The time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for the FDA notification process, and the requirements may differ. We may be unable to obtain on a timely basis, if at all, any foreign government approvals necessary for the marketing of our products abroad. 

Regulation of foods/food supplements in Europe is exercised primarily through the European Union, which regulates the combined market of each of its member states. Other countries, such as Switzerland, have voluntarily adopted laws and regulations that mirror those of the European Union with respect to novel foods or new dietary ingredients. 

Regulation in other major and established markets, including Canada, Japan, Brazil and Australia all maintain and enforce a clear regulatory framework for novel ingredients and dietary supplements (or their equivalent).

Major Customers

Major customers who accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s total sales were as follows: 


 | Years Ended December 31 | 
----------------------------------+-------------------------+-----
Major Customers | 2020 | | | 2019
A.S. Watson Group - Related Party | | 13.0 | % | | 15.8 | %


Generally, we do not depend upon a single customer, or a few customers, and the loss of any one or more would not have a material adverse effect on the Company. However, due to the volume of consumer products and ingredients we are selling in relation to the overall Company’s sales, we do expect that at times one or more of our customers may account for more than 10% of the Company’s sales.

Competitive Business Conditions

For our consumer products segment, we are in direct competition with Elysium Health who offers a similar product to TRU NIAGEN®. There are also a few resellers of NIAGEN® as consumer products that are our customers. We believe these resellers are focused on specific channels that we believe are complementary to our business. 

We also face strong indirect competition from other ingredient suppliers who may supply alternative ingredients that may have similar characteristics to ingredients we offer. Below is a list of some of the competitors for our ingredients segment.

Manufacturing

We currently utilize third-party manufacturers to produce and supply dietary supplement, ingredients, products, and services. Following the receipt of products or product components from third-party manufacturers, we inspect and ensure conformance of each product and product component to our specifications. We will also consider manufacturing certain products or product components internally, if our capacity permits, when demand or quality requirements make it appropriate to do so.

We intend to work with manufacturing companies that can meet the standards imposed by the FDA, the International Organization for Standardization and the quality standards that we will require for our own internal policies and procedures. We expect to monitor and manage supplier performance through a corrective action program developed by us. We believe these manufacturing relationships can minimize our capital investment, help control costs, and allow us to compete with larger volume manufacturers of dietary supplements, phytochemicals and ingredients.

W.R. Grace & Co. -Conn. (“Grace”) is the Company’s exclusive manufacturer for the supply of NR. Effective as of September 17, 2020, the Company entered into a Sixth Amendment (the “Sixth Amendment”) to the Manufacturing and Supply Agreement (such agreement as amended, the “Grace Manufacturing Agreement”), originally effective in January 2016 with Grace. In January 2019, Grace was issued patents related to the manufacturing of the crystalline form of NR (the “Grace Patents”). Pursuant to the Sixth Amendment, the Grace Manufacturing Agreement expires on December 31, 2021, subject to additional two-year renewal periods to be negotiated by the parties. In addition, the Grace Manufacturing Agreement may be terminated by (a) the Company by providing 12 months’ notice prior to the end of the current term, (b) Grace by providing 12 months’ notice of its intent to cease manufacture of NR (a “Market Exit”) and (c) a party in the case of (1) a material breach by the other party that is not cured within 30 days, (2) three material breaches by the other party in any 12 month period, or (3) bankruptcy of the other party. In the event that certain conditions are met, then the Company will become a licensee of the Grace Patents.

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials 

For all three business segments, and subject to the risks related to our Company and our Business recited below, we believe that we have identified reliable sources and suppliers of ingredients, chemicals, phytochemicals and reference materials that will provide products in compliance with our guidelines. 
Research and Development

To date, 11 human clinical trials have been published on our proprietary ingredient NIAGEN® demonstrating its safety and/or efficacy in healthy human volunteers. In addition, no adverse effects have been attributed to NIAGEN®. In both 2015 and 2018, NIAGEN® was successfully notified to the FDA as a “New Dietary Ingredient.” NIAGEN® was also successfully notified to FDA as “Generally Recognized as Safe” in August 2016.

16


In June of 2020, the ChromaDex External Research Program (CERP) achieved its 200th research agreement and over 100 preclinical studies and 11 peer-reviewed human clinical trial publications involving NIAGEN®.

Through our research and development laboratory in Longmont, Colorado, we intend to develop and evaluate products that we are planning to take to market as well as explore cost saving processes for existing products.

Research and development costs for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, were approximately $3.7 million and $4.4 million, respectively. 

Environmental Compliance

We incur significant expense in complying with GMPs and safe handling and disposal of materials used in our research and manufacturing activities. We do not anticipate incurring additional material expense to comply with federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. 
Working Capital

The Company’s working capital at the end of years 2020 and 2019 was approximately $4.9 million and $4.1 million, respectively. The Company measures working capital by adding trade receivables and inventories, and subtracting accounts payable. Most of the working capital is consumed by our consumer products segment and ingredients segment as the operations require a large amount of inventory to be on hand. As the consumer products segment and ingredients segment grow, more working capital will likely be needed to support the operations. 
Backlog Orders

For our consumer products segment where we ship products internationally to distributors, we may have a backlog from time to time as the production of TRU NIAGEN® finished bottles require up to three months lead time by our third-party contract manufacturers. As of December 31, 2020 we did not have any significant backlog orders from the distributors that have not been shipped. For products that are directly shipped to consumers, we have minimal backlog orders as we carry inventory on hand to ship upon the receipt of order. 

For our ingredients segment, we also have minimal backlog orders as we carry inventory on hand for most of the products we offer and we ship upon the receipt of customer’s order. 

For our analytical reference standards and services segment, we normally have a small backlog of orders for reference standards. These orders amount to approximately $25,000 or less. Because we list over 1,500 phytochemicals and 300 botanical reference materials in our catalog, we may not always have the items in stock at the time of customers’ orders. These backlog orders are normally fulfilled within 2 to 3 months. 

Facilities

For information on our facilities, see “Properties” in Item 2 of this Form 10-K.

Employees

As of December 31, 2020, ChromaDex had approximately 110 employees. We consider our relationships with our employees to be satisfactory. None of our employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
