Item 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 Box is the Content Cloud: one secure, cloud-native platform for managing the entire content journey. Content – from blueprints to wireframes, videos to documents, proprietary formats to PDFs – is the source of an organization’s unique value. Our cloud content management platform enables our customers, including 67% of the Fortune 500, to securely manage the entire content lifecycle, from the moment a file is created or ingested to when it’s shared, edited, published, approved, signed, classified, and retained. Box keeps content secure and compliant, while also allowing easy access and sharing of this content from anywhere, on any device. 
 With our Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform, users can collaborate on content both internally and with external parties, automate content-driven business processes, develop custom applications, and implement data protection, security and compliance features to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, internal policies and industry standards and regulations. Box provides a single content platform that accelerates business processes, improves employee productivity, enables secure remote work, and protects an organization’s most valuable data. Our platform enables a broad set of high-value business use cases across enterprises, hundreds of file formats and media types, and user experiences. Our platform integrates with leading enterprise business applications, and is compatible with multiple application environments, operating systems and devices, ensuring that workers can securely access their critical business content whenever and wherever they need it.
 Our go-to-market strategy is focused on selling our platform as a solution for the entire enterprise with the full set of Box capabilities, leveraging our product suite offerings, and driving high-value significant business outcomes for our customers. This strategy combines top-down, high-touch sales efforts with end-user-driven bottoms-up adoption. We focus our efforts on larger enterprises, capitalizing on international growth, and utilizing our partner ecosystem, where most advantageous. Our sales representatives engage directly with IT decision makers including CEOs, CIOs, CISOs, IT directors and line of business department heads. We also field inbound inquiries and online sales opportunities. We further expand our market reach by leveraging our network of channel partners that comprises value-added resellers and systems integrators as well as our own consulting services. We offer individuals a free basic version of Box that allows them to experience first-hand our easy-to-use and secure solution. Use of Box often spreads virally within and across organizations, as users adopt Box and invite new users to collaborate. In addition, an organization will frequently purchase Box for one use case and then later expand its deployment to other use cases with larger groups of employees, leading to deeper engagement with our service. We focus our sales strategy on ensuring that new and existing customers understand and experience the transformative impact of Box.
 We are building a rich technology partner ecosystem around Box. We offer nearly 1,500 pre-built integrations with partners including Microsoft, IBM, Salesforce.com, Apple, Google, Slack, Adobe, Palo Alto Networks, Okta, Zoom and others, giving our users easy access to their content in Box without leaving these applications. In addition, in-house enterprise developers and independent software developers can use our developer platform and open application programming interfaces (APIs) to rapidly build and provision new applications that leverage and extend the core functionality of our services, increasingly with a focus on specific industries and vertical market use cases. To date, tens of thousands of third-party developers have leveraged our platform as the secure content layer for their applications.
 We are committed to powering how the world does more good together. Box.org mobilizes our technology, talent, partners and institutional assets to enable nonprofits to innovate and fulfill their missions. Founded in 2014, Box.org now serves over 11,000 nonprofits with donated or discounted Box access, employee volunteer hours and cash grants from the Box.org Fund.

The Box Solution
 We offer web, mobile and desktop applications for cloud content management on a platform for developing custom applications, as well as industry-specific capabilities. Three core capabilities differentiate Box from potential competitors: frictionless security and compliance powered by our global cloud architecture, seamless external and internal collaboration and workflow, and expansive integrations and APIs that extend the value of our Content Cloud to every organization. Box features and functionality include the following:
Frictionless Security and Compliance
  
• | Global Cloud Architecture. We have built our platform from the ground up on a cloud-based architecture, which enables us to rapidly develop, update and provision our services to users. Our proprietary cloud architecture is particularly well-suited for today's dynamically changing business requirements because it enables use of the most up-to-date versions of our solutions at all times and administrators to immediately apply changes in policies and controls across all their organization’s critical content simultaneously. Our modern cloud infrastructure also powers global scalability and reliability with minimal downtime for our customers, ensuring their business-critical content is always secure, compliant, and available.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enterprise-Grade Security. We have invested heavily to build robust security features to protect our customers from the most pervasive security threats. At the most basic level, all files stored in Box are encrypted at rest and in transit. Box’s information rights management features enable secure access and management of files by providing granular control over users’ ability to access, view, download, edit, print or share content. With Box KeySafe, organizations can implement higher levels of data security and protection by keeping control of the encryption keys that protect their content. This advanced encryption feature is valuable to many organizations, including those in highly regulated industries such as financial services, health care, government and legal.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Intelligent Threat Detection and Smart Access with Box Shield. Box Shield uses machine learning to provide granular, real-time prevention and detection capabilities. Box Shield reduces the risk of accidental data leakage through native security classifications and granular access controls by, for example, automatically applying classification to files that contain personal identifiable information. It also detects potential insider threats and compromised accounts through alerts powered by Box's machine learning capabilities.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Comprehensive Data Governance Strategy. Box serves as a secure, centralized system of record for retaining content for operational use while ensuring adherence to the laws and regulations, using data retention and Data Loss Prevention (DLP) capabilities. Our data security policies allow customers to apply quarantine or notification-only policies to sensitive confidential files, such as those containing predefined attributes, such as credit card or social security system numbers, and we provide robust integrations for leading eDiscovery and DLP systems. Our Box Governance product allows customers to control how long documents are to be retained in Box and the disposition of those documents when the retention period expires.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Box Zones for In-Region Data Storage. Box Zones enables businesses around the globe to adopt Box as their modern content management platform, while letting them store their data locally in certain regions. This helps organizations address region-specific compliance mandates associated with data residency and privacy.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Focus on Industry-Specific Capabilities. In order to facilitate easier and faster time to market, we offer industry-specific capabilities for those industries that have significant content and collaboration challenges. These features target specific business problems within those industries with a combination of Box, integration with industry-specific partner technologies, and implementation expertise from Box Consulting and/or implementation partners. For example, Box GxP Validation provides life science companies with an approach for maintaining always-on GxP compliance in the cloud and enables organizations subject to Food and Drug Administration regulations to manage both unregulated and regulated content within Box. We successfully serve customers in highly regulated industries with specific requirements relating to compliance with certain security and regulatory standards, such as GxP and FedRAMP, and those required by HIPAA, FINRA, and the HITECH Act.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Administrative Controls. We give IT administrators powerful tools to define access rights by user, content type, device, and business need. Administrators can set specific content policies such as expiration dates to auto-delete files or deactivate links to time-sensitive materials. They can also manage mobile and sync security settings, including specification of which devices have access to Box and whether certain features are enabled.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Tracking and Reporting for Visibility. All actions taken by paying business users and their external collaborators in Box are tracked and auditable by our customers’ authorized administrators through Box’s native administrative applications. The tracking and audit data are also accessible to administrators with the appropriate access rights via our APIs.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Simple and Rapid Deployment. Our cloud-based software allows organizations to deploy our products easily, quickly, and inexpensively. IT administrators can quickly add users, set up permissions, create folders and policies, and begin using our products almost immediately without the need to procure and provision hardware or install and configure software.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 To give our customers the flexibility to choose between a la carte and bundled subscription options, we offer Box Shield, Box Governance, GxP, and Zones both as standalone add-ons and as part of our bundled Enterprise Suites.
 Seamless Collaboration and Workflow
  
• | Internal and External Collaboration. Box offers deep integrations with all major productivity and collaboration platforms so that users can work together on any file type, in whatever format they choose, with content security and access permissions handled consistently within Box. By enabling users to share, preview, and annotate files in Box, we provide a consistent collaboration layer so that all feedback is captured and preserved within Box. Our Annotations feature enables users to add text-based comments or free-form markups on any file type without altering the underlying content so teams can work together without worrying about version control or data loss.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Real-Time Collaboration and Content Authoring. Our native content authoring tool, Box Notes, enables users to seamlessly share and collaborate in real time with internal teams and external partners. Box Notes combines lightweight word processing functionality with easy-to-use tables, content organization, and commenting features to make it easy for users to work together on projects in real time.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mobility. Our solution enables users to securely access, manage, share, and collaborate on their content anytime and from anywhere, using nearly any device and a variety of operating systems through both native and web browser applications. Our mobile apps allow users to preview, comment, and collaborate on content from anywhere, as well as make it easy to add content to Box with native scanning, uploading, and classification.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Elegant, Intuitive and User-Focused Interface. We are dedicated to keeping our solution easy for users to understand with little to no upfront training. We strive to enable quick and viral user adoption by maintaining a simple and elegant interface with compelling access, sharing and collaboration features.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Built to Handle Content of Nearly Any Type. We have designed our solution to serve as the central content management layer for an organization’s employees. Users can securely access, share, and collaborate on all types of information, regardless of format or file type, including large media files, from virtually any device or operating system.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 7

 
• | Automation and Workflow Management. Box Relay, our no-code process automation tool for content-centric workflows, accelerates productivity by enabling both end users and administrators to build simple process automations. For example, documents can be routed to specific folders or flagged for user action based on the content of the document. In addition, we provide pre-built workflow templates and reporting capabilities to make it easy for users to track and manage their own workflows. This allows customers to accelerate the flow of information through their organizations and increase the efficiency of their business processes. Box Relay is available both as a standalone add-on and as part of our bundled Enterprise Suites.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Integrations and Developer Platform
  
• | Easy Integration with Other Cloud-Based Applications. Our open platform allows for easy integration with other cloud-based and enterprise applications. We offer nearly 1,500 pre-built integrations with partners including IBM, Microsoft, Salesforce.com, Google, Facebook, Slack, Adobe, Palo Alto Networks, Zoom, and others, as well as an open API for organizations to integrate Box with other packaged and home-grown applications, including solution applications our customers build for their customers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Box Platform. We provide a content Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) product, known as Box Platform, which allows IT teams and third-party developers to extend the power of Box across their applications and build custom content experiences. With our easy-to-use APIs, businesses can create a single source of truth for their content, allowing IT teams to deploy key business applications while easily managing how content is accessed, collaborated on, and secured. Coupled with our robust developer tools, the Box Platform helps organizations accelerate their transformation into digital businesses by building applications faster, without having to invest in building their own content management infrastructure. We also give organizations the ability to apply machine learning algorithms from leading providers such as IBM, Microsoft, and Google, as well as specialized industry-specific vendors directly to content within Box using Box Skills. This eliminates the need for customers to create and manage separate document repositories for performing functions such as image and character recognition, video and audio analysis and transcriptions, and document analysis on business content, thus improving content searchability and business process automation. Box Platform is available as a standalone add-on and as part of our bundled Enterprise Suites.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Customers
 Our user base included over 77.7 million registered users as of January 31, 2021. We define a registered user as a Box account that has been provisioned a unique user identification number. As of January 31, 2021, approximately 80% of our registered users were non-paying users who independently registered for accounts (in many cases to enable them to collaborate securely with our paying enterprise user base) and approximately 20% of our registered users were paying users who registered as part of a larger enterprise or business account or by using a paid personal account.
 As of January 31, 2021, we had over 105,000 paying organizations, and our solution was offered in 25 languages. We define paying organizations as separate and distinct buying entities, such as a company, an educational or government institution, or a distinct business unit of a large corporation, that have entered into a subscription agreement with us to utilize our services. Organizations typically purchase our solution in the following ways: (i) employees in one or more small groups within the organization may individually purchase our service; (ii) organizations may purchase IT-sponsored, enterprise-level agreements with deployments for specific, targeted use cases ranging from tens to thousands of user seats; (iii) organizations may purchase IT-sponsored, enterprise-level agreements where the number of user seats sold is intended to accommodate and enable nearly all information workers within the organization in whatever use cases they desire to adopt over the term of the subscription; and (iv) organizations may purchase our Box Platform service to create custom business applications for their internal use and extended ecosystem of customers, suppliers and partners.

We have developed several programs designed to provide customers with service options to quickly get them up and running and enhance their usage of Box. These services include 24x7 support provided by our Customer Success Management group and certain resellers; a professional services ecosystem that consists of our Box Consulting team and system integrators that help customers implement cloud content management oriented use cases; a Customer Success Management group to assist customers in production; and an online community with self-service training materials, best practice guides and product documentation.
 No customer represented 10% or more of our revenue in the year ended January 31, 2021. Our geographic revenue and segment information is set forth in Notes 2 and 14, respectively, of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Sales and Marketing
 We offer our solution to customers as a subscription-based service, with subscription fees based on customer requirements, including the number of users and functionality deployed. The majority of our customers subscribe to our service through one-year contracts, although we also offer our services for terms ranging from one month to three years or more. We typically invoice our customers at the beginning of the contract term, in multiyear, annual, quarterly or monthly installments. We recognize revenue as we satisfy a performance obligation. Accordingly, due to our subscription model, we recognize revenue for our subscription and premier services ratably over the term of the contract.
 We employ a direct sales team to offer a higher touch experience. We also make it easy for users and organizations to subscribe to paid versions of our service on our self-service web portal. Our sales team is composed of inside sales, outbound sales and field sales personnel who are generally organized by account size and geography, and/or major industry focus. We also have a rich ecosystem of channel partners who expand our reach to both large and small enterprises.
 We generate customer leads, accelerate sales opportunities and build brand awareness through our marketing programs and through our strategic relationships. Our marketing programs target senior IT leaders, technology professionals and senior line of business leaders.
 As a core part of our strategy, we have developed an ecosystem of partners to both broaden and complement our application offerings and to provide a broad array of services that fall outside of Box’s areas of focus. These relationships include software and technology partners, as well as consulting and implementation services providers that enable Box to address a broader set of use cases for our customers.
 Sales and marketing expenses were $275.7 million, $317.6 million and $312.2 million for the years ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
 Research and Development
 Our ability to compete depends in large part on our continuous commitment to product development and our ability to rapidly introduce new applications, technologies, features and functionality. In simple conceptual form, we provide a single, secure, easy-to-use platform built for the entire content lifecycle. In practice, we develop and maintain a set of sophisticated software services (e.g., search, share, secure, convert/view, logging) around content. These services, which comprise our platform, are used to develop our own applications (e.g., sync, desktop, web, native mobile) and also support the development of third-party applications.
 Our product development organization is responsible for the specification, design, development and testing of our platform and applications. We focus our efforts on providing a platform that accelerates business processes, improves employee productivity, enables secure remote work, and protects an organization’s most valuable data. We strive to continually improve our applications so that they help users and teams become more productive in their day-to-day work.

Research and development expenses were $201.3 million, $199.8 million and $163.8 million for the years ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
 Competition
 The cloud content management market is large, highly competitive and highly fragmented. It is subject to rapidly evolving technology, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services. We face competition from a broad spectrum of technology providers: traditional cloud content management vendors who deploy on-premise and offer deep records management, business process workflow, and archival capabilities; newer mobile enterprise vendors who are beginning to enter the content collaboration market; vendors whose core competency is simple file sync and share, which can be deployed on-premises, hybrid, or via a SaaS delivery model; and social collaboration vendors who focus on the conversations that occur between teams. Our primary competitors in the cloud content management market include, but are not limited to, Microsoft and OpenText (Documentum). In the enterprise file sync and share market, our primary competitors include, but are not limited to, Microsoft, Google and, to a lesser extent, Dropbox.
 We may face future competition in our markets from other large, established companies, as well as from smaller specialized companies. In addition, we expect continued consolidation in our industry which could adversely alter the competitive dynamics of our markets including both pricing and our ability to compete successfully for customers.
 The principal competitive factors in our market include:
  
• | enterprise-grade security and compliance;
--+------------------------------------------


• | scalability of product and infrastructure for large deployments;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | ability to store content in multiple geographic locations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | speed, availability, and reliability of the service;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | low-cost, quick deployment;
--+----------------------------


• | agnostic to device, operating system, and file type;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | ease of user experience;
--+-------------------------


• | customer-centric product development;
--+--------------------------------------


• | current and forward-thinking product development;
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | automation and workflow management;
--+------------------------------------


• | depth of integration into enterprise applications, including office productivity, desktop and mobile tools;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | rich ecosystem of channel partners and applications;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | open, extensible platform and APIs for custom application development;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | intelligent content management including metadata capabilities;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | superior customer service and commitment to customer success; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | strength of professional services organization.
--+------------------------------------------------

 We believe that we compete favorably on the basis of these factors, primarily because of our industry-leading security and compliance, cloud-native approach to real-time, internal and external collaboration, and integrations and open platform. Our ability to remain competitive will depend to a great extent upon our ongoing performance in the areas of product development, core technical innovation, platform and partner ecosystem, and customer support. In addition, many of our competitors may have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, larger marketing budgets, significantly greater resources and established relationships with our partners and customers, which can give them advantageous positioning for their products despite other competitive merits of respective product features and functionality. Some competitors may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we can to ours, which could allow them to respond more quickly than we can to new technologies and changes in customer needs.
 10

Intellectual Property
 We rely on a combination of trade secrets, patents, copyrights and trademarks, as well as contractual protections, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. As of January 31, 2021, our patents were set to expire between 2028 and 2039. We intend to pursue additional patent protection to the extent that we believe it would be beneficial and cost effective.
 We require our employees, contractors, consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements and control access to software, documentation and other proprietary information. Although we rely on the intellectual property rights and contractual protections described above, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, creation of new modules, features and functionality, and frequent enhancements to our applications are more essential to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position.
 Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop applications with the same functionality as our services. Policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights on a global basis is difficult.
 We expect that software and other applications in our industry may be subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of applications in different industry segments overlaps. Any of these third parties might make a claim of infringement against us at any time.
 Backlog
 We generally sign annual and multiple-year subscription contracts for our cloud content management services. The frequency of our invoices to each customer is negotiated and varies among our subscription contracts. We continued to focus on annual payment frequencies for multi-year contracts in the twelve months ended January 31, 2021. As a result, for multi-year contracts, we frequently invoice an initial amount at contract signing followed by subsequent annual invoices. Until amounts are invoiced, they are typically not recorded in revenue, deferred revenue, billings or elsewhere in our consolidated financial statements other than disclosed as part of remaining performance obligations. To the extent future invoicing is determined to be certain, we consider such future subscription invoices to be non-cancellable backlog, which is disclosed as part of remaining performance obligations. Future invoicing is determined to be certain when we have an executed non-cancellable contract or a significant penalty is due upon cancellation, and invoicing is not dependent on a future event such as the delivery of a specific new product or feature, or the achievement of contractual contingencies. We had $438.1 million and $353.4 million of non-cancellable backlog as of January 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase of non-cancellable backlog as of January 31, 2021 was primarily driven by expansion within existing customers as they broadened their deployment of our product offerings, longer customer contract durations, the addition of new customers, and the timing of customer-driven renewals.
 We expect that the amount of backlog relative to the total value of our contracts will change from year to year due to several factors, including the timing and duration of customer subscription agreements, varying price, volume, and invoicing cycles of subscription contracts, the timing of scheduled customer renewals, and foreign currency fluctuations. Accordingly, we believe that fluctuations in backlog are not always a reliable indicator of future revenue and we do not utilize backlog as a key management metric internally.
 Human Capital Resources
 Our company is built on people: We call them Boxers. They come from a range of backgrounds and experiences, and each of them has a unique story to tell. Our goal is to fully leverage and engage the individual talents and capabilities of our diverse teams, ultimately creating an inclusive environment where Boxers feel they belong. As of January 31, 2021, we employed 1,934 people. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be very good.
 11

Diversity and Inclusion
 One of our core values is creating a space where all Boxers can “Bring your (_____) self to work.” We take great pride in celebrating our differences, and we hire the best talent from all backgrounds. We want to build teams that are as diverse as our customers and the world we live in, with a broad representation of gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, backgrounds, and perspectives — among many other dimensions of diversity. 
 When it comes to recruiting, our hiring philosophy is centered around the belief that building diverse teams enables us to do our best work. Last year, all of our recruiters and hiring managers completed unconscious bias training and we now offer the lessons of unconscious bias training and best practices around interviewing to all interviewers and employees during our LearnFest training series. At our executive recruiting level, our policy is to interview at least one candidate from underrepresented backgrounds for all positions at the director level or above before making a hiring decision.  At the university recruiting level, we have instituted programs to connect with underrepresented student groups and create a more fair and equitable hiring process. For example, our Box Business Fellowship provides students of historically underrepresented backgrounds with an opportunity to explore business careers in the tech industry. This program helps students develop the skills to succeed in tech industry roles and provides them with insights into the career opportunities available to them. In addition, participants in this program are also invited to an expedited interview process for available roles at Box. 
 We also ensure that Boxers can Bring their (_____) Self to Work by creating safe spaces for engagement and providing opportunities for networking and development, while promoting a culture of learning and allyship to ensure that the needs of underrepresented Boxers are lifted. We support a dynamic array of employee-led resource communities for historically underrepresented groups and different communities at Box, including Box Women’s Network, Black Excellence Network, Latinx, Pride, and Box Vets, among others. For more information about our diversity and inclusion initiatives, we encourage you to visit our website at https://www.box.com/about-us/diversity-and-inclusion. 
 Learning and Development
 We want all of our employees to have thriving careers where they grow and develop in meaningful ways. There is no one-size-fits-all career path at Box, so we seek to ensure that every Boxer has the tools and support they need to drive their career. We do this by giving all Boxers access to learning and development opportunities based around individual needs in order to build up skill sets and experience. These initiatives include:
  
• | Internal mobility: We acknowledge that career progression looks less like a ladder and more like a climbing wall. We stand behind the idea that enabling our employees to work cross-functionally and within different teams provides a broader perspective of Box that will allow them to succeed in the future.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | LearnFest: LearnFest, our learning lineup for skill development and personal and professional growth, happens three times each year. During LearnFest, the entire company has focused time for trainings, workshops, book clubs, and other learning events.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Professional coaching and external leadership development programs: We offer targeted professional coaching for all levels of our executive leadership team (i.e., director-level and above) as well as access to business education and networking programs such as The Leadership Consortium (Harvard), Stanford’s Women’s Executive Leadership program and AWE, Advancing Women Executives.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | On-Demand Learning: We offer all Boxers access to an on-demand learning platform so they can develop anywhere, anytime, in any skills. There are more than 2,000 courses available at the disposal of any Boxer eager to learn, including over 600 courses aimed at personal development, management, and leadership plus hundreds of tech-based functional skill trainings. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pay Equity
 We hold ourselves accountable, which is why we signed the California Equal Pay Pledge. As part of our commitment, we conduct an annual companywide gender pay analysis on hiring and promotion procedures to reduce unconscious bias and structural barriers to equitable compensation. In addition, we externally benchmark the compensation we provide for each role to ensure pay parity, and provide periodic pay equity updates to the compensation committee of our board of directors.
Boxer Experience Surveys
 We survey employees two times a year to ensure that everyone’s voice gets heard and we better understand the key areas where we can improve employee experience. These key areas include our experience with our managers, our ability to get work done, and our sense of belonging at work. Survey results are reviewed and become part of our action plans at all levels of the organization. Our People and Communities team incorporates survey feedback into our programs, policies, and the cultivated experiences that drive our culture. Our functional leaders leverage the feedback to drive annual plans across their teams to improve efficiency, establish communication channels, and reinforce behaviors aligned with our values. Finally, following each survey, managers discuss employee experience results with their team and form a plan to address issues that are identified in survey results.
 Employee Health and Safety
 The health and safety of our employees is one of our top priorities. We strive to create an environment where Boxers are physically and mentally safe and healthy. We offer a comprehensive health and wellness benefits package to all employees. 
 In response to the COVID-19 crisis, we convened a cross-functional team made up of leaders from across our organization who met frequently to ensure Boxers' safety and that business crisis plans were enacted, communicated, and running smoothly. As part of these plans, Box is offering flexible remote work arrangements to employees through September 2021. To support the well-being of Boxers during these challenging times, we launched “Fresh Air Fridays” and "Mental Health Mondays," global company-wide days of paid time off, offered subscriptions to an app for meditation and mental health, partnered with a third-party family support system for families at Box, and provided additional paid time off for our employees, among other things.
