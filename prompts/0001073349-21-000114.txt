Our Products and Services 
    The following is a summary of our major product offerings; however, we continue to innovate and adapt our solutions as standards, customer needs and technology evolve.
Paymode-X and PTX
Paymode-X and PTX are our largest and fastest growing payment platforms.
    Paymode-X is a SaaS solution that helps over 450,000 businesses pay and get paid. Our Paymode-X solution allows businesses to easily transition from legacy invoice-to-pay processes, maximizing cost-savings, efficiency and security. Businesses can streamline invoice receipt, automate workflows, accelerate approvals, and make virtual card, automated clearing house (ACH), and check payments using a single integrated solution. Paymode-X customers gain immediate benefits because many of their vendors are already part of the Paymode-X network and can begin to be paid electronically on day one. Our vendor enrollment process leverages our proprietary Intelligent Engagement Model which includes predictive analytics, tailored digital campaign processes and tools designed to maximize vendor adoption. Our solution leverages known payment type preferences across member businesses in order for customers to settle vendor payments utilizing a mix of virtual card, automated clearing house (ACH), check and wire payments that will yield the greatest financial and efficiency gains. Accounts payable departments can improve payment processing security and compliance with comprehensive payment risk scoring and integrated vendor authentication and fraud prevention services. Their vendors benefit from convenient invoice submission, payment, and remittance options which streamline their receivables processes. In addition to our internal sales team, a number of leading financial institutions partner with us to resell Paymode-X capabilities to their corporate clients. We have commercial relationships with both Visa and Mastercard and are able to offer both options to financial institutions as part of an overall Paymode-X solution while also having the ability to offer Visa capabilities directly to corporate customers. 
Our PTX solution offers organizations of any size simple, secure and efficient ways to pay and get paid. PTX enables businesses to efficiently manage key business processes such as making payments domestically and overseas, receiving payments through a variety of channels and protecting payments from fraud and error. PTX ensures that the critical processes related to sending and receiving payments are as efficient and secure as possible. Efficiencies include saving time, such as by using one payment system for both domestic and international payments; saving money, by leveraging lower cost payment alternatives and avoiding failed transactions; and saving data, to reduce the risk of manual verification and human error. PTX also offers offers protection to ensure security and avoid fraudulent payments by leveraging intelligent fraud and cybercrime capabilities. PTX is a modular platform designed to incorporate regulatory changes such as the UK New Payments Architecture as well as innovation driven changes such as Open Banking, leveraging these changes to offer new ways to pay and facilitate consolidated views of bank accounts across the world. It supports making payments via BACS, Faster Payments and checks and supports collecting payments via direct debit, card and other methods. PTX also helps manage invoices, payment remittances and other important business documents. 
Financial Messaging
    Our Financial Messaging solutions are recognized and trusted by customers all over the world. Financial messaging leverages multiple domestic and cross-border payment networks and schemes, including SWIFT, UK Faster Payments, RT1, TIPS, Bacs, Six, EBICS, Visa and others. Overall, our solutions allow financial institutions and corporations to achieve lower costs, rapid implementation, greater security and improved risk management, while avoiding the costly internal infrastructure typical of legacy, on-premise solutions.
Banking Solutions
    Our digital banking solutions are designed to engage intelligently with customers, deliver a unified digital experience as well as acquire, deepen and grow profitable relationships.
Digital Banking IQ is our complete solution for digital banking transformation. From actionable insights to faster onboarding, Digital Banking IQ is a leading intelligent engagement platform for banking and payments.

These solutions feature an intuitive user interface designed to simplify all aspects of payments and cash management for customers of all sizes and sophistication, through both browser-based and mobile channels.
Legal Spend Management
    Our legal spend management solutions integrate with claims management and time and billing systems to automate legal invoice management processes and to provide insight into all areas of a company’s outside legal spend. Insurance carriers, third-party administrators and self-insureds use these solutions to better manage legal costs, determine which costs are accurate and where errors or overcharges exist. The combination of automated invoice routing and a sophisticated rules engine allows corporate legal and insurance claim departments to create more efficient processes for managing invoices generated by law firms and other service providers, while offering insight into important legal spend factors including expense monitoring and outside counsel performance. We continue to expand the capabilities of these offerings to leverage predictive analytics to facilitate the selection and retention of counsel, forecast claim settlement and litigation expense and augment the management and budgeting of litigation matters.
Fraud and Financial Crime Solutions
    Our fraud and financial crime solutions non-invasively monitor, replay and analyze user behavior and payment transactions to flag and prevent suspicious activity in real time. These solutions are highly configurable and create accountability by recording and analyzing each application interaction and screen view, reducing the risk of theft, information leakage, internal and external fraud, as well as decreasing the cost of regulatory compliance. Case management capabilities centralize risk management, speed investigations, and facilitate compliance with regulations pertaining to Anti Money Laundering (AML), SWIFT CSP, PSD2, FATF16/WTR2, Basel II, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Know Your Customer (KYC).

Our People
Global Workforce
We have a very talented team of people operating globally. They are at the center of everything we have accomplished to date and will accomplish in the future. At June 30, 2021 we had a total of 2,344 employees located worldwide, as follows: 
•North America 1,279
•Europe 718
•Asia Pacific 210
•Middle-East 137
We also use independent contractors and temporary personnel to supplement our employee workforce. Competition for qualified personnel has historically been, and remains, intense; particularly for technical and other specialist resources. 
Our goal in recruiting people to join Bottomline focuses on attracting, hiring and retaining talented, high-performing employees in all roles and at all career levels. Employment opportunities range from internship programs for students, roles for recent college graduates, entry level positions, management opportunities and executive careers.
We are always conscious of the competitive market for talent and try to be responsive to our employee team needs. We consider employee engagement to be strong. None of our employees is represented by a labor union. 
Bottomline Culture
The foundation of Bottomline’s culture is embodied in its six Guiding Principles which are reinforced and recommunicated to our entire team regularly:
•Delight customers
•Do the right thing
•Innovate, communicate, win and grow
•Work with and for each other
•Be a company of which all can be proud
•Create and grow sustained business value
We are committed to an inclusive environment, ensuring that employees feel safe, valued and respected regardless of race, color, age, gender, disabilities, sexual orientation or any other protected class. 
Compensation and Benefits
We strive to offer competitive salaries and benefits in each of the geographies in which we operate. Salary increases were postponed for a period of time during COVID-19 but have recently been restored globally for fiscal 2022 and beyond. We continually evaluate all aspects of the total compensation we offer in each geography to ensure we are offering an appropriate and competitive level of compensation. Similarly, our benefits are intended to be competitive and are tailored to the specific geographical location of the employee based on local laws and customs. 
In the United States (which comprises approximately 54% of our employee base at June 30, 2021) we provide health coverage for medical, vision and dental care, disability insurance, flexible spending accounts for medical care expenses, employee assistance programs, paid time off and retirement savings plans. 
In the United Kingdom (which comprises approximately 22% of our employee base at June 30, 2021) we provide private medical insurance based on individual eligibility, income protection in the event of long-term illness, life insurance, vision coverage, employee assistance programs, paid time off and retirement savings plans. Health coverage in the United Kingdom is provided predominantly under a government run national insurance program.
Many of these or similar benefits are available to employees outside of the United States and the United Kingdom, in addition to any locally customary or required benefits. For example, our Swiss based employees (which comprise approximately 7% of our employee base at June 30, 2021) are covered under defined benefit pension plans as required by Swiss government regulations. 
Employee Well Being
Since March of 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly all of our employees, regardless of geography, have worked remotely. We have continued, since that date, to suspend virtually all business related travel. During this period we have provided all employees additional measures of flexibility to adapt to the new demands brought on by this experience, including more flexibility in individual work schedules. We have communicated regularly to employees throughout this period and have consistently reinforced that no one will be required to return to a physical, in-office work setting until it is safe—and until they personally feel safe—to do so. Our team has maintained high productivity and engagement levels during this time. We intend to continue to provide flexibility to our team when we start the physical return to offices, whenever that may be. 
Employee Learning and Development
We recently announced two new programs focused on professional development. The first, the “Bottomline Growth Series” will be available to all team members globally regardless of their level within the organization. The program is designed to provide career advice, success characteristics, positive habits and lessons learned. The second program, “Leadership Lessons”, will be focused on any team member who directly manages people as well as high potential team members, nominated by the leadership team, who may not yet be managing people. The focus of this program is on leading, developing and motivating high performing people as well as driving transformation and growth.
Open Communications with Employees
We have regular, company-wide employee meetings led by our CEO. During these meetings, any employee is permitted to submit a question either in advance or real-time during the meeting, which our CEO addresses as part of the overall session. All employees have access to a “Straight-to-the CEO” email portal where questions, comments or concerns can be raised directly to our CEO, including on an anonymous basis. We also maintain a whistleblower program, administered by a third-party organization. Under this program any employee can submit a concern, including anonymously if they wish. Any matter reported through this program is automatically reported to our Chief Executive Officer and to the Chair of our Audit Committee.
We regularly solicit employee feedback through the use of company-wide, pulse-style surveys. The use of these surveys and related outreach has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of these surveys are shared with our CEO, leadership team, Board of Directors and employee team. In our most recent annual pulse survey, we had over 1,800 responses which represented approximately 87% of our then employee base. The responses confirmed our commitment to customers and positive culture of Bottomline with 94% of the respondents indicating they believe Bottomline is committed to customer delight, 88% indicating they would recommend Bottomline to a friend, 87% believed that our commitment to social responsibility, community support and sustainability is genuine and 91% indicated that they are proud to work for Bottomline.
Our Competition 
    The markets in which we participate are highly competitive. We believe our ability to compete depends on factors within and beyond our control, including:
•our ability to develop new, innovative and feature-rich technology solutions that meet the evolving needs of our customers and the shifting dynamics of the markets we participate in;
•the capabilities, performance, reliability, features, ease-of-use and price of our offerings as compared to competitor alternatives;
•our ability to attract, retain and develop employees with the requisite domain knowledge and technical skill set necessary to execute against our innovation agenda;
•our industry knowledge and expertise;
•the execution of our sales and customer success organizations; and
•the timing and market acceptance of new products as well as enhancements to existing products, by us and by our current and future competitors.
    For our payment platforms, our principal competitors include AccessPay, AvidXchange, Commerce Bank, CSI Enterprises, Finastra, Form 3, Go Cardless, JPMorgan Chase, Kyriba, MineralTree, SWIFT, Tipalti, and Wells Fargo. 
 For our banking solutions, we primarily compete with companies such as ACI Worldwide, FIS, Fiserv, MeridianLink, NCR, Polaris, Q2 and Temenos. 
    For our legal spend management solutions, we compete with a number of companies, including Wolters Kluwer ELM Solutions, Mitratech, Quovant, and DXC Legal Solutions.
    For our fraud and financial crime solutions, we primarily compete with Verafin, Feedzai, NICE Actimize, FeatureSpace and NetGuardians. 
    Our payment and document automation products compete primarily with companies that provide solutions to create, publish, manage and archive electronic documents and companies that offer payments software and services. We also compete with providers of ERP solutions and providers of traditional payment products.
    We believe that we compete favorably in each of the markets in which we participate, however the markets for our products and services are intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change and a number of factors could adversely affect our ability to compete in the future, including those discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Our Segments
    Operating segments are the components of our business for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Our chief operating decision maker is our chief executive officer. Our operating segments are generally organized by the type of product or service offered and by geography.
Similar operating segments have been aggregated into four reportable segments as follows: 
    Cloud Solutions. Our Cloud Solutions segment provides customers with SaaS technology offerings that facilitate electronic payments, electronic invoicing, and spend management. Our two most significant and fastest growing payment platforms (Paymode-X and PTX) and our financial messaging solution are included in this segment. These solutions are highly scalable, secure and cost effective and facilitate cash payment and transaction settlement between businesses and vendors. Our legal spend management solutions, which enable customers to create more efficient processes for managing invoices generated by outside law firms while offering insight into important legal spend factors such as expense monitoring and outside counsel performance, are also included within this segment. Revenue within this segment is generally recognized on a subscription or transaction basis.
Banking Solutions. Our Banking Solutions segment provides solutions that are specifically designed for banking and financial institution customers. Our Banking Solutions products are sold predominantly on a hosted basis, with revenue recognized on a subscription or transaction basis. 
Payments and Documents. Our Payments and Documents segment supplies financial business process management software solutions, including making and collecting payments, sending and receiving invoices, and generating and storing business documents. When licensed for on-premise deployment, software license revenue is typically recorded upon delivery of the software and commencement of the license term, professional services revenue is normally recorded as we perform the work and software support and maintenance revenue is recorded ratably over the support period. If the solution is hosted by us, we typically record revenue over time.
    Other. Our Other segment consists of our fraud and financial crime solutions and our healthcare solutions. The fraud and financial crime solutions results reported in this segment reflect the revenue contribution from the legacy sales channel we acquired and the burden of certain other centralized costs; however these solutions are sold as part of all of our operating segments. Our 
healthcare solutions focus on eliminating paper intensive processes and providing electronic signature and mobile document capabilities to allow healthcare organizations to improve efficiency and reduce costs. Software revenue for perpetual licenses of our fraud and financial crime and healthcare products is typically recorded upon delivery of the software and commencement of the license term. Professional services revenue is recorded as we perform the work and software support and maintenance revenue is recorded ratably over the support period, which is normally twelve months.
Product Development and Engineering
Our product development and engineering organization includes employees as well as strategic development partners who provide a flexible supplement to our internal resources. We have three primary development groups: product design and user experience, software engineering and quality assurance. Our teams work collaboratively, integrating design thinking approaches with development operations and scaled agile practices, to deliver validated solutions to our customers. 
    Our product design and user experience team is extensively involved in the design of all of our products, driving the user-centered design process to ensure elegant, engaging and intuitive, easy-to-use products. Part of this process is user experience testing that is conducted to provide additional productivity gains for the end user.
    Our software engineers have substantial experience in advanced software development techniques as well as extensive knowledge of the complex processes involved in business document workflow, cash management, payment and invoicing applications. Our technologies focus on providing business solutions utilizing industry standards, providing a path for extendibility and scalability of our products. The team focused on applying relevant technologies to uniquely make our customers more successful. Security, control and fraud prevention, as well as performance, data management and resource efficiencies are priorities in the solutions we develop and deploy.
    Our quality assurance engineers have extensive knowledge of our products and expertise in software quality assurance techniques. The quality assurance team participates in all phases of our product development processes. Members of the quality assurance group make use of both manual and automated software testing techniques to ensure high-quality software is being delivered to our customers. The quality assurance group members participate in alpha and beta releases, testing of new product releases and performance and security testing for our products. Our process promotes an end-to-end design to delivery pipeline view that connects these critical product development and engineering functions to our product management, delivery, operations and support organizations so that all share a common vision of customer-focused success.
Proprietary Rights 
We use a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secret laws to help establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology and products. During fiscal year 2021, we added 9 patents to our portfolio. In total, we currently hold 46 U.S. patents as well as 8 foreign equivalent patents in Europe, Israel and India. We expect to receive other patents and we have 53 applications pending before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The earliest year of expiration of any of our remaining patents is 2022.
    We intend to continue to file patent applications as we identify patentable technology. There can be no assurance, however, that our existing patent applications, or others that we may file in the future, will issue or will be of sufficient scope and strength to provide meaningful protection to our technology or any commercial advantage to us, or that the issued patents will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. In addition, we rely upon a combination of copyright and trademark laws and non-disclosure and other intellectual property contractual arrangements to help protect our proprietary rights. Given the rapidly changing nature of the industry’s technology, the creative abilities of our development, marketing and service personnel may be as or more important to our competitive position as are the legal protections and rights afforded by patents. We enter into agreements with our employees and clients that seek to limit and protect our intellectual property and the distribution of proprietary information. However, there can be no assurance that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to deter misappropriation of proprietary information and we may not be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our proprietary rights.
Government Regulation 
Our U.S. chartered financial institution customers are federally regulated by either the Federal Reserve (FED), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the National Credit Union Association (NCUA) or the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Our non U.S. based financial institution customers are normally subject to a similar regulatory oversight within their respective country of domicile. We are subject to periodic examination by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) interagency in our capacity as a technical financial service provider, during which our operating practices are risk-assessed and compared against applicable laws and regulations. If as part of such an examination we were to receive a material unfavorable regulatory rating, our customers may be advised by their direct federal regulators to reassess their commercial relationships with us, including the continued use of our products.
    Each of our operating segments provides services and/or products that may be subject to various federal, state or foreign laws or regulations, particularly in the area of data security and privacy. These laws and regulations govern the collection, processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal information as well as notification requirements in the event of security breaches. For example, we are 
subject to periodic General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliance examinations by the Information Commissioner Office (ICO) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in our capacity as a technical financial service provider processing and/or storing financial data within a European Union (EU) and/or European Economic Area (EEA) country. The legal and regulatory framework in these areas is complex and continually evolving, particularly with respect to data security, payment technology and payment methodologies. We are also subject to regulatory obligations such as Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) in Switzerland and Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) in Canada. We may become subject to new or increased regulation in the future, and the cost of complying with current or future regulatory requirements could be significant. Our products and services must be designed to work effectively within this legal framework and the regulatory framework that our customers operate within.
