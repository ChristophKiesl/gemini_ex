Item 1 - Business
General
Founded in 1880 by Laroy S. Starrett and incorporated in 1929, The L.S. Starrett Company (the “Company”) is engaged in the business of manufacturing over 5,000 different products for industrial, professional and consumer markets. The Company has a long history of global manufacturing experience and currently operates three major global manufacturing plants. The global manufacturing plants consist of the one domestic location in Athol, Massachusetts (1880) and the international operations located in Itu, Brazil (1956), and Suzhou, China (1997). The Company consolidated Jedburgh; Scotland and Mt. Airy, NC saw manufacturing operations into Brazil in fiscal year 2021. This strategic restructuring continues to improve manufacturing utilization and creates a global scale saw business. All subsidiaries principally serve the global manufacturing industrial base with concentration in the metalworking, construction, machinery, equipment, aerospace and automotive markets. The Tru-Stone Technologies Division develops and supplies ultra-high precision granite components and assemblies into the semiconductor production and inspection markets and the most demanding laboratory and commercial applications.
The Company offers its broad array of measuring and cutting products to the market through multiple channels of distribution throughout the world. The Company’s products include precision tools, electronic gages, gage blocks, optical, vision, laser measuring equipment, custom engineered granite solutions, tape measures, levels, chalk products, squares, band saw blades, hole saws, hacksaw blades, jig saw blades, reciprocating saw blades, M1® lubricant and precision ground flat stock. The Company primarily distributes its precision hand tools, saw and construction products through distributors or resellers both domestically and internationally. Starrett® is brand recognized around the world for precision, quality and innovation. 
In accordance with the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 280, Segment Reporting, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 (fiscal 2022), we determined that we have two reportable operating segments (North America and International). Refer to Note 17, Financial Information by Segment & Geographical Area, contained in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for more information on our reportable segments.
Products
The Company’s tools and instruments are sold throughout North America and in over 100 other countries. The largest consumer of these products is the manufacturing industry including metalworking, aerospace, medical, oil and gas, government and automotive. Other important consumers are marine and farm equipment shops, do-it-yourselfers and tradesmen such as builders, carpenters, plumbers and electricians.
For over 140 years, the Company has been a recognized leader in providing measurement and cutting solutions to industry. Measurement tools consist of precision instruments such as micrometers, vernier calipers, height gages, depth gages, electronic gages, dial indicators, steel rules, combination squares, custom, non-contact gaging such as vision, optical and laser measurement systems. The Company believes advanced, non-contact systems with easy-to use software will be attractive to industry to reduce measurement and inspection time and are ideal for quality assurance, inspection labs, manufacturing and research facilities. Skilled personnel, superior products, manufacturing expertise, innovation and unmatched service has earned the Company its reputation as the “Best in Class” provider of measuring application solutions for industry.
As one of the premier industrial brands, the Company continues to be focused on every touch point with its customers. To that end, the Company now offers modern, easy-to-use interfaces for distributors and end-users including interactive catalogs and several online applications. 
The Company’s saw and hand tool product lines enjoy strong global brand recognition and market share. These products encompass a breadth of uses. The Company introduced several new products in the recent past including a new line of hand tools for measuring, marking and layout that include tapes, levels, chalk lines and other products for the building trades. The Company also introduced new products to its hand tool portfolio to extend its reach into the construction and retail trades. The continued focus on high performance, production band saw applications has resulted in the development of two new ADVANZ carbide tipped products MC5 and MC7 ideal for cutting ferrous materials (MC7) and non-ferrous metals and castings (MC5). These actions are aimed at positioning the Company for global growth in wide band products for production applications.
Over the last few years, the Company has launched new products, such as abrasive cut-off wheels and butcher knives, in order to become more product diverse and to invest in new distribution channels and industries such as the food industry. The Company was able to move into this channel with, in addition to meat and fish cutting blades, a variety of products such as 
butter knives, skinner and slicer blades, bandsaw machines and related products. The Company has also invested in new channels taking its traditional products such as Bi-metal bandsaws and its Power Tool Accessories product lines into welding and e-Commerce channels.

Human Capital
Founding Principle:
“I have believed that I could do not greater good than to help create a business that would give people employment and a chance to earn an honest living." - Laroy S. Starrett - Founder
History

It has been said that a business is but the lengthened shadow of a man. If this is so, surely there can be no finer tribute to our business than to say that Mr. Laroy S. Starrett was that man, the founder of our Company. Like many great leaders, Mr. Starrett came from the farm. His inventive genius was not to be denied, and he soon became the owner of a small machine shop. In 1868, he came to Athol and became a member of the Athol Machine Company in order to manufacture some of his own inventions. Misfortunes that would have halted a less courageous man befell Mr. Starrett. His wife died, leaving him with four small children; he was penniless and also handicapped by total deafness. However, he overcame all obstacles and, at his death in 1922, left behind him many enduring monuments to his genius as a manufacturer and philanthropist. It has always been, and will continue to be the aim of the Company to perpetuate his ideals and founding principal.
Stewardship
Since 1880, we have exercised rigorous stewardship over our Company in the best interest of our stakeholders: employees, customers, shareholders and communities. We have striven to build a sustainable business that aligns with our environmental, social and governance responsibilities, our historical track record, and to carry on the high standards set forth by our founder. 
Board of Directors
Our Board of Directors, through the Compensation and Governance and Nominating Committees, has direct oversight of our human capital, our culture and policies related to human capital management.
Employees
A company is strongest when all of its employees work together harmoniously for a common purpose. Our rules of human engagement include but not limited to the following:
•We have common goals 
•We hire, develop and retain skilled people
•We aim for clear, direct and respectful communication
•We respect diversity 
•We are committed to providing a safe work environment for all personnel and visitors.
•We make and keep our commitments 
•We are all stewards of the Starrett brand
•Our stakeholders are our focus
At June 30, 2022, the Company had 1,493 employees, split equally between North America and International operations. This represents a net increase from June 30, 2021 of 57 employees, consistent with the growth of our business. The headcount change included an increase of 16 in our North American operations and an increase of 41 internationally. 
The L.S. Starrett Company prefers to deal directly with its employees regarding the terms and conditions of their employment. It has always been the Company’s open-door policy to deal directly with our employees instead of through a third party, and the Company believes that sound leadership and concern for its employees is the best way of ensuring the propriety of the Company and the welfare of its employees. Since the Company’s founding none of our domestic employees is or have been subject to a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a trade or labor union. Internationally, our personnel are represented by trade or labor unions in Brazil, Scotland and China. The Company considers relations with its employees to be excellent. 
Domestic employees hold shares of Company stock resulting from various stock purchase plans and employee stock ownership plans. The Company believes that this dual role of owner-employee has strengthened employee morale over the years.
Culture and Code of Business Conduct and Ethics
Laroy S. Starrett founded this Company in 1880 on the principles of humanity, integrity and honesty. Throughout successive generations, we have strived to make Starrett one of the finest companies in the world. The pursuit of excellence and integrity includes having a well-defined Code of Business Conduct and Ethics which embodies the highest standards of ethics and integrity, and which should serve as a source of pride for all of us. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics has been developed by Starrett’s management and has been strongly endorsed by our Board of Directors. It summarizes the virtues and the principles that should guide all of our actions in the marketplace and our interactions with each other. Our goal at Starrett is simply to be the best in everything we do. We want each one of our employees, officers and directors to be proud to be associated with Starrett and part of that pride stems from our commitment to practicing the highest ethical and professional standards
Personnel Development, Training and Engagement 
Attracting, developing and retaining top talent in all areas of the business, is critical to the successful execution of our strategy. We endeavor to hire the best people for our positions and develop our existing employees in their current roles as well as preparing them for future roles within our Company. Our global leadership teams review our workforce to identify organizational needs, development opportunities, and potential future leaders. 
We are cognizant that in today’s current environment not all people have the skills sets necessary to be of immediate value; as such we do not abdicate our responsibility to train new employees. This includes employee referral program, apprenticeship training programs, internships and domestic and international rotational assignments among others. 
Personnel engagement is an ongoing and not limited to bi-annual messages from the CEO to the entire Starrett population, regular virtual and face-to-face meetings and communication with our senior divisional leadership teams globally, lunch-and-learn programs, lean training and career development courses and tuition reimbursement. 
Competition
The Company competes on the basis of its reputation as the best in class for quality, precision and innovation combined with its commitment to customer service and strong customer relationships. To that end, Starrett is increasingly focusing on providing customer centric solutions. Although the Company is generally operating in highly competitive markets, the Company’s competitive position cannot be determined accurately in the aggregate or by specific market since none of its competitors offer all of the same product lines offered by the Company or serve all of the markets served by the Company.
The Company is one of the largest producers of mechanics’ hand measuring tools and precision instruments. In the United States, there are three major foreign competitors and numerous small companies in the field. As a result, the industry is highly competitive. During fiscal 2022, there were no material changes in the Company’s competitive position. The Company’s products for the building trades, such as tape measures and levels, are under constant margin pressure due to a channel shift to large national home and hardware retailers. The Company has responded to such challenges by expanding its manufacturing operations in China. Certain large customers also offer their own private labels “own brand” that compete with Starrett branded products. These products are often sourced directly from low cost countries.
Saw products encounter competition from several domestic and international sources. The Company’s competitive position varies by market and country. Continued research and development, new patented products and processes, strategic acquisitions and investments and strong customer support have enabled the Company to compete successfully in both general and performance applications.
Foreign Operations
The operations of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are consolidated in its financial statements. The subsidiaries located in Brazil and China are actively engaged in the manufacturing and distribution of precision measuring tools, saw blades, optical and vision measuring equipment and hand tools. Subsidiaries in Scotland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Mexico are engaged in distribution of the Company’s products. In the March quarter, the Company announced plans related to the closure of its distribution and sales centers in Singapore and Japan. The Company will continue to service Asia out of Brazil and China, The Company expects its foreign subsidiaries to continue to play a significant role in its overall operations. A summary of the Company’s foreign operations is contained in Note 17 “Financial Information by Segment & Geographic Area” to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
Orders and Backlog
The Company generally fills orders from finished goods inventories on hand. Sales order backlog to fulfillment for the Company is shorter than many industries. As of June 30, 2022, backlog in our U.S. Precision Tools and Saws Manufacturing “Core U.S.” business were approximately $14.6 million or $6.1 million greater than June 30, 2021. Total Company inventories amounted to $66.9 million at June 30, 2022 and $60.6 million at June 30, 2021. 
Intellectual Property
When appropriate, the Company applies for patent protection on new inventions and currently owns a number of patents. Its patents are considered important in the operation of the business, but no single patent is of material importance when viewed from the standpoint of its overall business. The Company relies on its continuing product research and development efforts, with less dependence on its current patent position. The Company has, for many years, maintained engineers and supporting personnel engaged in research, product development and related activities. The expenditures for these activities during fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020 were approximately $3.5 million, $3.0 million, and $3.8 million, respectively.
The Company uses trademarks with respect to its products and considers its trademark portfolio to be one of its most valuable assets. All of the Company’s important trademarks are registered and rigorously enforced.
Environmental
Compliance with federal, state, local, and foreign provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of the environment is not expected to have a material effect on the capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position of the Company. The Company seeks to reduce, control and treat water discharges and air emissions
Strategic Activities
Historically, globalization has had a profound impact on product offerings and buying behaviors of industry and consumers in North America and around the world, resulting in the Company revising its strategy to fit this highly competitive business environment. In the past few years the world has seen pandemic, supply chain challenges and inflation. The Company continuously evaluates most aspects of its business, aiming for new ideas to set itself apart from its competition.
The Company’s strategic concentration is to continue building a global brand and providing unique customer value propositions through technically supported application solutions for our customers. The Company’s job is to recommend and produce the best suited standard product or to design and build custom solutions. The combination of the right tool for the job with value added service maintains the Company’s competitive advantage. The Company continues its focus on lean manufacturing, plant consolidations, global sourcing, new software and hardware technologies, and improved logistics to optimize its value chain.
The execution of these strategic initiatives has expanded the Company’s manufacturing and distribution in developing economies, resulting in international net sales revenues totaling 47% of consolidated sales for fiscal 2022.
