Item 1. Business
Corporate History
 
Wizard Brands, Inc. (formerly known as) Wizard Entertainment, Inc., Wizard World, Inc. and GoEnergy, Inc.) was incorporated in Delaware on May 2, 2001. The Company was initially involved in oil and gas exploration but ceased operations and abandoned any interests it had in such properties.
 
On December 7, 2010, the Company entered into a Share Purchase and Share Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) among the Company, an entity known as “Conventions” which was the former majority stockholder of the Company, and shareholders of Conventions, under which Conventions became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
 
On August 27, 2014, the Company entered into a Joint Venture and Operating Agreement for a forty-seven and one half percent (47.5%) interest in CON TV, LLC (“CONtv”), with Cinedigm Entertainment Corp. (“Cinedigm”), ROAR, LLC (“ROAR”) and Bristol Capital, LLC (“Bristol”). On November 16, 2015, the parties entered into an Amended and Restated Operating Agreement, effective as of July 1, 2015, which, among other things, restructured the business relationship between the Company and Cinedigm with respect to the ownership and operation of CONtv. Under that agreement, the Company greatly reduced and limited its obligations to the venture, while retaining a ten percent (10%) membership interest in CONtv.
 
On December 29, 2014, the Company and a member of the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of the Company formed Wiz Wizard, LLC (“Wiz Wizard”) in the State of Delaware. On February 4, 2016, the member of the Board assigned his fifty percent (50%) membership interest to the Company. Consequently, Wiz Wizard is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company which was dissolved in March 2019.
 
On April 10, 2015, the Company and a third-party formed ButtaFyngas, LLC in the State of Delaware. The Company owns fifty percent (50%) of the membership interests. ButtaFyngas, LLC is not currently active.
 
In 2018, the Company changed its name from Wizard World, Inc. to Wizard Entertainment, Inc.
 
On July 29, 2020, the Company changed its name from Wizard Entertainment, Inc. to Wizard Brands, Inc.
 
The Company’s executive offices are located at 2700 Homestead Road, Park City, UT 84098, the telephone number is 650-525-0231. We promote and operate our business operations in part, through the use of our websites, www.wizardworld.com, www.wizardbrands.com, and www.getjevo.com.
 
Comic Conventions
 
Prior to the onset of the age of Covid-19, the Company produced live pop culture conventions (“Comic Conventions”) across the United States providing a social networking and entertainment venue for enthusiasts of movies, TV shows, video games, technology, toys, social networking, gaming, comic books, and graphic novels. Our Comic Conventions have provided an opportunity for companies in the entertainment, toy, gaming, publishing and retail business to carry out sales, marketing, product promotion, public relations, advertising, and sponsorship efforts. However, with the advent of Covid-19, the Company has not been able to produce a live event since March 8, 2020 in Cleveland, Ohio. Many events that had been planned for 2020 after March 8, 2020, were postponed indefinitely. The timing of when live events can be resumed is dependent upon the progression of the Covid-19 virus, the availability and effectiveness of the vaccines that have been introduced, and the imposition of governmental authority either allowing or disallowing the mounting of live events. The following information is provided in anticipation that the Company will be able to recommence its Comic Conventions in the future.

The Company began producing Comic Conventions in July of 1997. The Company receives revenue from its Comic Conventions primarily from three sources: (i) consumer admissions; (ii) exhibitor booth sales; and (iii) national and/or regional sponsorships. Comic Conventions vary in cost to produce. Production costs vary based on the size and scope of the production. Generally, our production costs range from under $1,000,000 for a smaller scale production to $3,000,000 for a larger production.
 
In 2020, the Company produced Comic Conventions in the following cities: (i) New Orleans, (ii) Portland; and (iii) Cleveland. Events that had been planned for St Louis, Philadelphia, Columbus, and Chicago were postponed in the face of the Pandemic.
 
Our target audience includes men and women in the 18 to 34-year-old demographic, together with families of all ages who are fans of various types of entertainment and media, including movies, music, toys, video games, consumer electronics, computers, and lifestyle products (e.g., clothes, footwear, digital devices, and mobile phones). We continuously review our existing operations and procedures relating to our Comic Conventions in order to ensure that we produce the best possible fan experience at our Comic Conventions and maximize revenue while containing costs.
 
Sponsorships and Promotions
 
We provide sponsorship opportunities that allow advertisers a wide range of promotional vehicles on-site and through our social media and fan outreach efforts. For example, we offer advertisers the ability to: (i) display signage at our Comic Conventions, (ii) include their desired logos on all direct mail that is sent in connection with one or more Comic Conventions, (iii) be included in press releases to the media, (iv) obtain sponsor tags on the radio spots or in the print or online ads where we advertise, and (v) obtain advertising space in our digital media. We also provide the opportunity for advertisers to sponsor events at the Comic Conventions, such as costume contests or gaming tournaments and the ability to brand “step-and-repeats” for photo opportunities, meet and greets with celebrities, VIP packages, and giveaways. Sponsors pay a fee based upon the position of their advertising media and the exposure it will receive. We are able to increase our revenue by utilizing a strategic floor layout that maximizes the amount of highly profitable booth, advertising, and sponsorship opportunities. We are focused on increasing our sponsorship revenue and we are currently actively engaged in enhancing our capabilities in that regard.
Marketing
 
Our Comic Conventions are marketed through a variety of media outlets, including social media, websites, public relations, television, radio, out-of-home (OOH), email, “street-teams”, and by flyers, and postcards. Our Comic Conventions usually obtain publicity through coverage of the events at our Comic Conventions by local TV stations, radio stations, newspapers, national press, fan websites, blogs, and social network channels such as Twitter and Facebook,. In certain instances, we do not pay for advertising because we can provide desirable content to media outlets. For example, we typically invite local TV stations to our Comic Conventions so that they can interview the celebrities featured at our Comic Conventions. As a result, we receive TV coverage at no cost and the TV stations obtain content for their shows. In addition, we arrange for celebrities to call into local radio stations. As a result, we receive on-air promotion of our events and the radio station reaches a larger audience who want to tune in to hear our celebrities. We also receive on-air promotion by exchanging airtime for admission giveaways to our Comic Conventions. With respect to the internet and online advertising, we advertise throughout our website www.wizardworld.com about upcoming Comic Conventions. We also send out emails to our fans on a regular basis.
Show Attendees
 
Our Comic Conventions are attended primarily by men and women in the 18 to 34-year-old demographic, together with families of all ages who are fans of various types of entertainment and media, including movies, music, toys, video games, consumer electronics, computers, and lifestyle products (e.g., clothes, footwear, digital devices, and mobile phones). We are seeking to develop a positive reputation for hosting quality events in order to build brand loyalty among our show attendees and ensure repeat attendance.

Corporate Sponsors and Exhibitors
 
We identify and target some of the leading movie studios, video game producers, comic book publishers, television broadcasters, and toy manufacturers as future exhibitors and sponsors. In addition, our digital media business will provide sales opportunities across the Fortune 1000 corporate sector, as these brand advertisers look to leverage our media properties to reach our target audience. No single advertiser, promoter or sponsor comprises a significant portion of our revenues.
Competition; Competitive Strengths
 
In the live, regionally-based consumer conventions market, the strength of a competitor is measured by the location and size of the region or city, the frequency of live events per year, the guest and VIP list (e.g., celebrities and artists), the number of paying attendees, the physical size of the convention, the extent of the public relations outreach (through traditional media, digital media and social media), and the quantity and quality of exhibitors and dealers. We believe that we have a strong competitive position because our Comic Conventions take place in well-known major cities across the United States throughout the year. Our strategy of providing multiple conventions per year enables us to market our events throughout the entire year, create a large amount of high-quality content that can be distributed through our digital media outlets, and market in not only the regional consumer areas, but nationally as well. The multiple locations also allow us to work with more celebrities, artists and writers and host them in multiple cities.
 
There are a number of Comic Convention providers that produce events across the country. We are unique in that we produce more Comic Conventions in the United States annually than any other organization. We reach audiences coast-to-coast, north-to-south markets in the United States. We believe that creates an advantage over other event producers because our Comic Conventions are not limited to one city, but rather span well-known cities across the United States.
 
We also believe that we have an advantage over competitors because our Comic Conventions are well known and well respected in the Comic Convention and pop culture industry. We have a reputation among fans, exhibitors, and celebrities for producing high-quality and well attended Comic Conventions that provide consumers with a good value proposition for an entertainment experience.
 
Sales Channels and Pricing Policies
 
We have outsourced our admission sales to a national ticketing service. Admission prices typically range from $50 for a single day pass to $80 for a general weekend pass. Entry for children ten years old and under is free at Wizard Comic Conventions.
Regulation
 
Typically, we do not have to obtain permits to operate the Comic Conventions. The convention centers at which such events occur obtain any required permits and cover fire safety and occupancy matters as part of the rental agreement. Crowd control varies by location and is either provided by the convention center’s personnel or by a third-party security service recommended by the convention center. The convention centers do, however, require liability insurance, which Conventions has obtained and maintained.
Wizard World Virtual
 
Following Wizard World’s last live event in Cleveland in early March of 2020, the Company transitioned nimbly to a Virtual Event Format that went from concept to execution in three weeks, with our first Virtual event held on March 31, 2020.
 
Since March 2020, the Company has broadcast over 200 interactive Virtual events across three platforms: Twitch, Facebook, and YouTube. Programming has included celebrity cast reunions and game shows, concerts, workshops and how-to classes, gaming with celebrities, cosplay contests, fan panels, and more.

Tapping into the international audience potential of our streaming events, in Q4 2020, Wizard World Virtual launched an international series of virtual events geared toward the Asian market with full translation services and marketing designed for these specific markets. Based on the success of this endeavor, Wizard World Virtual will continue to expand into more international markets in 2021, creating a global demand for our original affinity content.
 
Because of the enormous changes in society during the past year, online activity and connection through virtual communities are more important than ever. We see great opportunity to build on our established equity as the online destination for like-minded affinity groups. The virtual events produced by the Company feature a no-charge 30-to-45-minute moderated discussion. Following the moderated discussion there is an opportunity for fans to speak directly with celebrities while paying by the minute for the experience. Additionally, autographs and videos are being sold.
 
In March 2021, Wizard World Virtual launched its Subscription Series — the next generation of the Wizard World Virtual Platform, bringing Wizard World Virtual to wide new audiences as we build interactive communities of affinity groups, offering Virtual and eCommerce experiences they can’t find anywhere else. The Company is primed to grow our communities in breadth, but also in depth as we drill down into niche groups that hunger for VIP access to industry experts, influencers, and behind-the scenes access.
 
Through our Subscription Series approach, the possibilities for our content library are limitless: by partnering with both individuals and businesses with the shared goal of bringing more consumers into their franchise, Wizard World will become the online destination for affinity groups to gain behind-the-scenes and unique experiences they can’t otherwise access.
 
In addition to Wizard World Virtual, the Company produces a number of digital media properties, including, but not limited to, our website www.wizardworld.com, emails, newsletters, together with posts on Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Instagram, to create awareness of our Comic Conventions and provide updates to our fans and consumers. To a large extent we also use our website www.wizardworld.com to provide the latest Wizard World news and information. While we derive little or no direct revenue from these properties, they have the indirect benefit of supporting sales relating to our Comic Conventions (dealer and exhibitor booths, admissions, sponsorships), as well as helping us secure additional sought after and high-profile talent. This in turn helps us obtain additional admissions, booth sales and sponsorships for our Comic Conventions.
 
The Company maintains an email list consisting of all our current and active users. This is a primary driver of information dissemination along with Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. YouTube is mainly used as brand awareness, information is posted after a Comic Convention, which helps to generate excitement at future events. Because our Comic Conventions visit multiple cities, it is essential that we create excitement in multiple regions, not just focused on a single event.
 
Through posts on Facebook, our attending artists and celebrities are able to help promote our Comic Conventions by announcing their involvement at our events. This helps generate excitement among both their existing fan base and ours while creating a sense of community and groundswell of support for the upcoming Comic Convention. Once we establish a critical mass of people, the Comic Convention can become part of the fabric of the community where people anticipate and look forward to the event months and sometimes even a full year in advance. Retention of Comic Convention attendees is essential to our sales process. Procuring new and timely talent helps generate new customers, as well as the word of mouth of previous attendees. Much of this is achieved via email, Facebook, Twitter, and www.wizardworld.com.
 
Unlike many live events (sports, concerts, etc.), where attendees are spectators (even if they are a part of a community at large), at our Comic Conventions the attendees participate in the events. This atmosphere creates a greater amount of user generated content on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. For instance, we generally observe an increase in Facebook “Likes” on profile picture changes on Facebook the days during and after our Comic Conventions featuring celebrity “Photo Ops.” This is a non-paid form of free advertising. Social networks such as Facebook and Twitter are a perfect marriage for these types of event photos.

Wizard World Vault
 
To augment our move into digital programming, in Q1 of 2020 we launched an eCommerce site, Wizard World Vault, which features the best in pop culture memorabilia from the Wizard World Live and Virtual events, along with items from the top artists and exhibitors in the memorabilia world.
 
Through our platforms, Wizard World and Vault are reaching an average of 1.5M people weekly – with enormous potential for upselling and cross-merchandising. The Vault is a collection of autographed photographs, memorabilia and one-of-a-kind collectibles that are offered for sale via e-commerce. The Vault, which launched at or about the same time as the Virtual Experiences, has already proven to be a popular source of celebrity memorabilia among fans of motion pictures and television programming. Included in the Vault is inventory which includes stock from the Company’s inventory of merchandise, consignment inventory, and merchandise that is being sourced for sale by the Company.
 
Jevo
 
On April 28, 2020 the Company, through one of its wholly-owned operating subsidiaries, acquired the assets of the creator of the Jevo machine, which is a patent-protected first-mover application for the creation of gelatin shots. With Jevo, the Company has diversified its revenue generation capabilities by manufacturing, marketing and selling Jevo units and related consumables, both nationally and internationally, to bars, restaurants, clubs, casinos, hotels, cruise lines, resorts and other establishments that serve beverages (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic) to the public. In addition to food and beverage applications, the Company has identified other market segments where the Jevo units can be marketed including but not limited to the healthcare and cannabis industries. The Company intends to resume the manufacturing of the Jevo units with a target of producing new Jevo machines in the second quarter of 2021.
 
Clearly, issues emanating from the Covid-19 Pandemic have impacted the hospitality industry (a key segment for Jevo sales), which in turn have impacted operations of Jevo. However, the Company has utilized this time to engage in a wide range of preparatory activities positioning Jevo for a successful re-launch. Such preparatory activities have included, but are not limited to, engaging with suppliers, forecasting and ordering consumables, establishing sales channels, creating marketing materials, and engaging in numerous inventory and supply chain processes necessary to successfully relaunch the manufacturing of Jevo units. The acquisition of Jevo is the Company’s initial entry into M&A activity intended to broaden the Company’s revenue base.
 
As we open up our verticals – entering the spa and fitness, medical, senior living, educational, and cannabinoid sectors – our patented gelatin delivery system will enter sectors far beyond the hospitality industry. Revenue possibilities in healthcare are particularly compelling given the rapid growth of the long-term care field. Already a $443 billion industry, long-term care is expected to grow another 7% over the next four years with 60% of Americans needing long-term care at some point in their lives
 
At our launch event in Florida in January, 2021, target audience interest was keen in learning about the many different applications for delivery of everything from electrolytes to multivitamins, CBD to spirits.
 
Some highlights of the growth industries we are targeting forecast healthy revenue streams once the Jevo technology is adopted:
 
The United States CBD market value was just over $4 billion in 2019 and is projected to exceed $25 billion by 2025. (Brightfield Group, 2019)
 
The health and wellness industry growth rate is 6.4% (and is expected to continue at this pace.
 
Employees
 
We currently have 13 full-time equivalent employees. Additionally, we engage part-time freelance consultants providing us with greater core competence in the disciplines of Marketing, Sponsorship Sales, Event Production and e-commerce.
