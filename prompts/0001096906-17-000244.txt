Who We Are

 Alpine 4 is a publicly held enterprise with four principles at the core of its business: Synergy, Innovation, Drive, and Excellence (S.I.D.E.).  At Alpine 4, we believe synergistic innovation drives excellence. By anchoring these words to our combined experience and capabilities, we are able to aggressively pursue opportunities within and across vertical markets. We deliver solutions that not only drive industry standards, but also increase value for our shareholders.
 


 At Alpine 4, we understand the nature of how technology and innovation can accentuate a business. We strive to develop strategic synergies between our holdings to create value and operational excellence within a unique long-term perspective.
 
Our Strategy
 
Alpine 4's strategy is to provide Fortune 500-level execution strategies in its subsidiary companies and market segments to businesses and companies that have the most to benefit from this access.
 
Alpine 4 feels this opportunity exists in smaller middle market operating companies with revenues between $5 to $150 million.  In this target rich environment, businesses generally sell at more reasonable multiples, presenting greater opportunities for operational and strategic improvements and have greater potential for growth.   Implementation of our strategy within our holdings is accomplished by the offering of strategic and tactical MBA-level training and development, delivered via the following modules:

- | An Alpine 4 developed ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning system) and collaboration system called SPECTRUMebos. SPECTRUMebos is what we are defining as an Enterprise Business Operating System (ebos). This system will combine the key technology software components of Accounting and Financial Reporting, an Enterprise Resource Planning System (ERP), a Document Management System (DMS), a Business Intelligence (BI) platform and a Customer Resource Management (CRM) hub which will be tethered to management reporting and collaboration toolsets. Management believes that these tools will help drive real-time information in two directions: first, to the front lines by empowering customer-facing stakeholders; and second, back to management for planning, problem solving, and integration. Management believes that SPECTRUMebos will be the technology "secret sauce" in managing our portfolio of companies and, in time, will be an offering to external customers.

All great strategies must have trades offs. Therefore, Alpine 4 avoids companies that have unionized employees, businesses that have more than $150 million in revenue and companies that reside in highly regulated business industries.
 
Diversification
 
It is our goal to help drive Alpine 4 into a leading multi-faceted holding company with diverse products and services that not only benefit from one another as whole but also have the benefit of independence.  This type of corporate structure is about having our subsidiaries prosper through strong onsite leadership, while working synergistically with other Alpine 4 holdings.   Alpine 4 has been set up with a holding company model, with Presidents who will run each business, and Managers with specific industry related experience who, along with Kent Wilson, the CEO of Alpine 4, will help guide our portfolio of companies as needed.  Alpine 4 will work with our Presidents and Managers to ensure that our motto of S.I.D.E (Synergistic, Innovation, Drives, Excellence) is utilized.  Further, we plan to work with our subsidiaries and capital partners to provide the proper capital allocation and, to work to make sure each business is executing at high levels. 
 
In 2016, we saw the beginning of our plan for diversification take hold with the acquisition of Quality Circuit Assembly, Inc. ("QCA") when Alpine 4 acquired 100% of QCA's stock effective April 1, 2016.  Additional information relating to our acquisition of QCA can be found in our Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the SEC on March 15, 2016.
 
In October of 2016, Alpine 4 formed a new Limited Liability Company called ALTIA (Automotive Logic & Technology In Action) to create an independent subsidiary for Alpine 4's 6th Sense Auto product and its BrakeActive product.
 
Effective, January 1, 2017, Alpine 4 acquired 100% of Horizon Well Testing, LLC ("Horizon"). Additional information about the acquisition of Horizon can be found in our Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on December 8, 2016, and January 13, 2017.
 
Finally, we have entered into two additional LOI's to acquire two different companies, and will provide additional disclosures relating to those transactions as they progress.

 Recent Developments
 
Acquisition of Horizon Well Testing
 
On November 30, 2016, Alpine 4 entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the "HWT SPA") with Horizon Well Testing, L.L.C., an Oklahoma company ("HWT") and its sole shareholder, Alan Martin ("HWT Seller").  Effective as of January 1, 2017, Alpine 4 acquired and took full control of HWT.
 
Since 2010, HWT has been providing services to the Oil and Gas industry.  This acquisition is another step in Alpine 4's strategy of diversification through acquisitions.
 
Pursuant to the HWT SPA, Alpine 4, HWT and HWT Seller agreed on the terms pursuant to which Alpine 4 would purchase from HWT Seller all of the outstanding shares of common stock of HWT (the "HWT Stock").  The purchase price paid by Alpine 4 for the HWT Stock consisted of cash, a note, a convertible note, and securities consideration.  The "Cash Consideration" paid was $2,200,000.  The "Note" consisted of a secured note in the amount of $300,000, secured by a subordinated security interest in the assets of HWT.  The Note bears interest at 1% and will be payable in full by April 30, 2017.  The "Convertible Note" consisted of a secured convertible note in the amount of $1,500,000, secured by a subordinated security interest in the assets of HWT.  The HWT Seller has the opportunity to convert the Convertible Note into shares of Alpine 4's Class A common stock at a conversion price of $8.50 after a restricted period according to securities laws.  The Convertible Note bears interest at 5% and is payable in full with a  balloon payment on the 18-month anniversary of the closing date of the transaction with no monthly payments.  The "Securities" consisted of two components, an aggregate of 379,403 shares of alpine 4s Class A common stock issued to the Seller, and a warrant to purchase an additional 75,000 shares of Class A common stock.

In the HWT SPA, Mr. Martin acknowledged and agreed that his entry into consulting agreements with Alpine 4 was an integral part of the transaction contemplated by the HWT SPA. As such, Mr. Martin agreed to enter into consulting agreements with Alpine 4 and HWT, and continue to work with HWT for a period of time agreed upon by Alpine 4 and Mr. Martin.

Change in Capital Structure

 Effective November 1, 2016, pursuant to the approved amendment for a reverse split, Alpine 4 issued one (1) new share for each ten (10) old share of the Company's commons stock.  The reverse split only reduced the number of outstanding shares of class A and Class B common stock and did not correspondingly reduce the number of Class a and Class B commons shares authorized for issuance, which remained at 500,000,000 and 100,000,000 respectively.
