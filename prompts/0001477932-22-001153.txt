ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Background
 
Kingfish Holding Corporation (“us,” “our,” “we,” the “Company,” or “Kingfish”) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on April 11, 2006 as Offline Consulting Inc. We became Kesselring Holding Corporation (“Kesselring Holding”) on June 8, 2007, and on November 25, 2014 we changed our name to Kingfish Holding Corporation. The principal executive offices of the Company are located at 2641 49th Street, Sarasota, Florida 34234, and our telephone number is (941) 870-2986.
 
On May 18, 2007, we entered into a reverse merger transaction pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement whereby we acquired Kesselring Corporation, a Florida corporation that was engaged in the business of homebuilding and restoration operations in central Florida and in the manufacture of building products from operations located in the State of Washington. Following the completion of the reverse merger transaction, the Company formed a wholly-owned subsidiary named Kesselring Holding Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and engaged in a merger transaction with this subsidiary, pursuant to which the Company was the surviving entity, to effect a name change of the Company from “Offline Consulting, Inc.” to “Kesselring Holding Corporation.” A Certificate of Ownership was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, effective as of June 8, 2007.
 
During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010, the Company defaulted on its loan agreements with AMI Holdings, Inc., a corporation controlled by James K. Toomey, a shareholder, officer and director of the Company (“Mr. Toomey”), and certain of his relatives (“AMI”), and on May 24, 2010, AMI foreclosed on and took possession of all of the Company’s then-existing operating entities. In addition, in order settle an indebtedness with Gary E. King, a former officer and director of the Company, and with Kenneth Craig, the Company’s then-President, on May 24, 2010, the Company sold its remaining assets to an entity affiliated with Mr. King. Following the foreclosure and this sale of assets, the Company no longer held any operating entities and was not engaged in any business operations.
 
On September 16, 2011, the Company, having only 69 holders of record and no significant assets, filed a Form 15 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) to terminate the registration of its common shares under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) and to suspend its reporting obligations under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act. 
 
In 2014, our remaining management concluded that it might be feasible to acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation and, as a result, our management began to explore potential opportunities to acquire other assets or business operations in an effort to maximize shareholder value. Accordingly, the Company took the steps necessary to reactivate its reporting obligations which had been suspended since 2011 under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act (“Reactivation Actions”). The Company completed its Reactivation Actions and commenced its reactivated reporting obligations on December 17, 2014.
 
The Company was unsuccessful in its endeavor to identify and engage in a business combination with a potential target company or business following its Reactivation Actions and, as of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, the Company had expended substantially all of its available cash and was unable to secure any additional funds to finance its operations. As a result, the Company was unable to prepare and timely file its periodic reports under the Exchange Act, commencing with its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 and, other than maintaining its corporate status, was dormant from such date through May 2020. 
 
In May 2020, the Company determined that the business environment had sufficiently changed so that identifying a target and completing a business combination may be more likely than was previously the case. As part of this strategy, the Company determined to attempt to seek the financing necessary to prepare and file all of its delinquent periodic reports on Form 10-K under the Exchange Act and to again aggressively pursue an acquisition target. 
 
In order for the Company to finance the preparation and filing of such delinquent periodic report with the Commission, Mr. Toomey, a principal shareholder, director and secretary of the Company, has loaned the Company approximately $130,000 during the fiscal year ended 2020 and the first quarter of the 2021 fiscal year (“Toomey Loans”). See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “—Subsequent Developments” for a description of the Toomey Loans.

Business Operations 
 
As a result of our very limited cash resources, we were unable to prepare and timely file our periodic reports under the Exchange Act, commencing with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 and, other than maintaining our corporate status, we were dormant from September 30, 2016 through May 2020. 
Recent Activities 
 
As of the date of filing of this Form 10-K, the Company entered into preliminary discussions regarding a potential business combination and equity financing transaction with Renovo Resource Solutions, Inc. (“Renovo”), a Florida corporation located in Manatee County, Florida, and 6, LLC, a Florida limited liability real estate holding company controlled by Renovo which owns the land on which Renovo conducts its business (Renovo and 6 LLC, collectively the “Renovo Group”). Renovo is engaged in an environmentally friendly scrap yard operation. Renovo’s operation are located on a site specifically engineered for its business and includes a new constructed facility for its operations. Renovo is a privately held company in which Mr. Toomey and his family have a one-third ownership interest. The Company has only commenced preliminary discussions with the Renovo Group and has not entered into a letter of intent or other undertaking with Renovo. It is anticipated that when the Company is analyzing the available alternatives, it will consider and evaluate, among other things, a potential business combination with Renovo in combination with a simultaneous equity financing transaction. 
 
The Renovo Group has incurred indebtedness of approximately $6.1 million in connection with its business operations and land holdings, consisting primarily of the construction costs incurred in connection with its newly constructed facilities. In order for a business combination with the Renovo Group to be feasible, the Company and Renovo would need to simultaneously raise approximately $12,500,000 in equity financing (“Equity Financing”) at the time of any such potential business combination in order (a) to repay the Company’s outstanding indebtedness owed to Mr. Toomey, (b) to pay the costs associated with any business combination transaction and Equity Financing, and (c) for the Renovo Group to repay its outstanding debt obligations, to pay its operating expenses until such expenses can be paid from operating income, to finance the completion of the permitting and improvements needed on its operational site, and to permit it to take advantage of operational opportunities in its local community. Accordingly, if the Company were to pursue a business combination with Renovo under such circumstances, it would likely require as a condition to any such business combination that the necessary Equity Financing be firmly committed and made available at the time of the consummation of such business combination. In the event that the Renovo Group is unable to commit to timely raising such Equity Financing, the Company would have no interest in pursuing a business combination transaction with the Renovo Group. Although we have commenced negotiations with the Renovo Group, we have not entered into a letter of intent or other undertaking with the Renovo Group for a business combination and no source of Equity Financing has been secured or is in the process of negotiations at this time. In view of the number of significant uncertainties surrounding a possible transaction, there is no assurance that the Company and the Renovo Group will reach any agreement with respect to a business combination and, if so, that they will be able to secure the Equity Financing necessary to consummation of such a transaction. 
 
Additionally, if we are unable to reach an agreement or otherwise consummate a transaction with the Renovo Group, no assurance can be given that the Company will be able to identify other suitable opportunities for a business combination. 
 
Generally
 
Our business strategy is to seek a suitable private company candidate for a business combination with us with the goal of maximizing shareholder value. The Company will not restrict its potential candidate target companies or businesses to any specific business, industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of business.
 
We may consider a business that has recently commenced operations, is a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products or markets, is seeking to develop a new product or service, or is an established business that may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital. In the alternative, a business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital, but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares, while avoiding, among other things, the time delays, significant expense, and loss of voting control which may occur in a public offering.

We anticipate that the selection of an appropriate business combination transaction will be complex and extremely risky. We expect to pursue our search for business opportunities primarily through our officers and directors, although other sources, such as professional advisors, securities broker-dealers, venture capitalists, members of the financial community, and others, may present unsolicited proposals. It is likely that any such transaction also would require the participation of a financing partner that would acquire a significant equity position in connection with any such transaction. The participation of a financing partner may dilute the holdings of our current shareholders. Our activities are subject to several significant risks that arise primarily as a result of the fact that we may acquire or participate in a business opportunity based on the decision of management that will be made in the exercise of its business judgment, and, in all probability, without the consent, vote, or approval of our shareholders. Potentially available business combinations may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. 
 
Because of general economic conditions, rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available capital, our management believes that there are firms seeking the perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation. Such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include, among other things, facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained, providing liquidity for the principals of and investors in a business, creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees, and offering greater flexibility in structuring acquisitions, joint ventures and the like through the issuance of stock. Potentially available business combinations may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex.
 
The Company has unrestricted flexibility in seeking, analyzing and participating in potential business opportunities and the analysis of potential business combination opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of the officers and directors of the Company. In its efforts to analyze potential acquisition targets or businesses, the Company will consider the following kinds of factors:
 

· | Potential for growth, indicated by new technology, anticipated market expansion or new products 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | The extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced 
· | Capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds, to be provided by the Company or from operations, through the sale of additional securities, through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources
· | The cost of participation by the Company as compared to the perceived tangible and intangible values and potentials 
· | Competitive position as compared to other firms of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the industry as a whole 
· | The accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, raw materials, services, professional assistance and other required items 
· | Strength and diversity of management, either in place or scheduled for recruitment 
· | Other relevant factors 

 
In applying the foregoing criteria, none of which will be controlling, management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data. Potentially available business opportunities may occur in many different industries, and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. Due to the Company’s limited capital available for investigation, the Company may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the opportunity to be acquired.

In evaluating a prospective business combination, we will conduct a due diligence review of potential targets in an extensive manner as is practicable given the lack of information which may be available regarding private companies, our limited personnel and financial resources, and the inexperience of our management with respect to such activities. We expect that our due diligence will encompass, among other things, meetings with the target business’s incumbent management and inspection of its facilities, as necessary, as well as a review of financial and other information that is made available to us. This due diligence review will be conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties that we may engage, including but not limited to attorneys, accountants, consultants or other such professionals. At this time, the Company has not specifically identified any third parties that it may engage. The costs associated with hiring third parties as required to complete a business combination may be significant and are difficult to determine as such costs may vary depending on a variety of factors, including the amount of time it takes to complete a business combination, the location of the target company, and the size and complexity of the business of the target company. Also, we do not currently intend to retain any entity to act as a “finder” to identify and analyze the merits of potential target businesses. 
 
It is anticipated that when the Company is analyzing the available alternatives, it will consider and evaluate a potential business combination with the Renovo Group, combined with a simultaneous funding transaction. 
 
The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target company or business and to structure and complete a business combination cannot presently be ascertained with any degree of certainty. The amount of time it takes to complete a business combination, the location of the target company and the size and complexity of the business of the target company are all factors that determine the costs associated with completing a business combination transaction. The time and costs required to complete a business combination transaction can be ascertained once a business combination target has been identified. Any costs incurred with respect to evaluation of a prospective business combination that is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us.
 
Our management anticipates that we will likely be able to effect only one business combination, due primarily to our limited financing and the degree of dilution anticipated for present and prospective shareholders, which is likely to occur as a result of our management’s plan to offer a controlling interest to a target business in order to achieve a tax-free reorganization. This lack of diversification should be considered a substantial risk in investing in us, because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one venture against gains from another.
 
Blank Check Company Status
 
The Company currently is considered to be a “blank check” company. The rules and regulations of the Commission defines blank check companies as “any development stage company that is issuing a penny stock, within the meaning of Section 3(a)(51) of the Exchange Act and that has no specific business plan or purpose, or has indicated that its business plan is to merge with an unidentified company or companies.” Pursuant to Rule 12b-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act, the Company also qualifies as a “shell company,” because it has no or nominal assets (other than cash) and no or nominal operations. Many states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of “blank check” companies in their respective jurisdictions. Management does not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in our securities, either debt or equity, until we have successfully concluded a business combination transaction. 
Form of Acquisition
 
The manner in which the Company participates in any specific opportunity would depend upon the nature of the opportunity, the respective needs and desires of the Company and the promoters of the opportunity, and the relative negotiating strength of the Company and such promoters.
 
It is likely that the Company will acquire its participation in a business opportunity through the issuance of common stock or other securities of the Company. Although the terms of any such transaction cannot be predicted, it should be noted that in certain circumstances the criteria for determining whether or not an acquisition is a so-called “tax free” reorganization under Section 368(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), depends upon whether the owners of the acquired business own 80% or more of the voting stock of the surviving entity. If a transaction were structured to take advantage of these provisions rather than other “tax free” provisions provided under the Code, all prior stockholders would in such circumstances retain 20% or less of the total issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity.

Under other circumstances, depending upon the relative negotiating strength of the parties and including situations where the investment is made in the Company to fund the purchase of operating assets,, prior stockholders may retain substantially less than 20% of the total issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity. This could result in substantial additional dilution to the equity of those who were stockholders of the Company prior to such reorganization.
 
The stockholders of the Company will likely not have control of a majority of the voting securities of the Company following a reorganization or investment transaction. As part of such a transaction, all or a majority of the Company’s directors may resign and one or more new directors may be appointed without any vote by stockholders.
 
In the case of an acquisition, the transaction may be accomplished upon the sole determination of management without any vote or approval by stockholders. In the case of a statutory merger or consolidation directly involving the Company, it will likely be necessary to call a stockholders’ meeting and obtain the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding securities. The necessity to obtain such stockholder approval may result in delay and additional expense in the consummation of any proposed transaction and will also give rise to certain appraisal rights to dissenting stockholders. Most likely, management will seek to structure any such transaction so as not to require stockholder approval. 
 
Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating, and selecting a target business, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. There are numerous “public shell” companies either actively or passively seeking operating businesses with which to merge in addition to a large number of “blank check” companies formed and capitalized specifically to acquire operating businesses. Additionally, we are subject to competition from other companies looking to expand their operations through the acquisition of a target company or business. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. Our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses is limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Further, our outstanding Convertible Notes and the future dilution they potentially represent may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses.
 
Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. Our management believes, however, that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately-held entities with a business objective similar to ours to acquire a target business on favorable terms.
 
If we succeed in effecting a business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. Many of our target business’ competitors are likely to be significantly larger and have far greater financial and other resources than we will. Some of these competitors may be divisions or subsidiaries of large, diversified companies that have access to financial resources of their respective parent companies. Our target business may not be able to compete effectively with these companies or maintain them as customers while competing with them on other projects. In addition, it is likely that our target business will face significant competition from smaller companies that have specialized capabilities in similar areas. We cannot accurately predict how our target business’ competitive position may be affected by changing economic conditions, customer requirements or technical developments. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the resources to compete effectively.

Employees 
 
We presently have no employees apart from our management. Our officers and directors are engaged in outside business activities and are employed on a full-time basis by certain unaffiliated companies. Our officers and directors will be dividing their time among these entities and anticipates that they will devote very limited time to our business until the acquisition of a successful business opportunity has been identified. The specific amount of time that management will devote to the Company may vary from week to week or even day to day, and therefore the specific amount of time that management will devote to the Company on a weekly basis cannot be ascertained with any level of certainty. In all cases, management intends to spend as much time as is necessary to exercise its fiduciary duties as an officer and director of the Company and believes that it will be able to devote the time required to consummate a business combination transaction as necessary. We expect no significant changes in the number of our employees other than such changes, if any, incident to a business combination.
