     Item 1.  Business.
 Overview
     Carlisle Companies Incorporated (“Carlisle”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) was incorporated in 1986 in Delaware as a holding company for Carlisle Corporation, whose operations began in 1917, and its wholly‑owned subsidiaries. Carlisle is a diversified manufacturing company consisting of five segments that manufacture and distribute a broad range of products. Additional information is contained in Items 7 and 8.
     Our executive offices are located at 16430 North Scottsdale Road, Suite 400, Scottsdale, Arizona 85254. The Company’s main telephone number is (480) 781‑5000. Our Company website is www.carlisle.com, through which (found in the “Investor Relations” link), we make available, free of charge, our Annual Report on Form 10‑K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10‑Q and Current Reports on Form 8‑K and all amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after these reports are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
     Management Philosophy/Business Strategy
     We strive to be the market leader of highly‑engineered products in the various markets we serve. We are dedicated to achieving low‑cost positions and providing service excellence based on, among other things, superior quality, on‑time delivery, and short cycle times.
     The presidents of the various operating companies are given considerable autonomy and have a significant level of independent responsibility for their businesses and their performance. The Company believes that this structure encourages entrepreneurial action and enhances responsive decision making thereby enabling each operation to better serve its customers and react quickly to its customers’ needs.
     Our executive management role is to (i) provide general management oversight and counsel, (ii) manage the Company’s portfolio of businesses including identifying acquisition candidates and assisting in acquiring candidates identified by the operating companies, as well as identifying businesses for divestiture in an effort to optimize the portfolio, (iii) allocate and manage capital, (iv) evaluate and motivate operating management personnel, and (v) provide selected other services.
     The Company utilizes its Carlisle Operating System (“COS”), a manufacturing structure and strategy deployment system based on lean enterprise and six sigma principles, to drive operational improvements. COS is a continuous improvement process that defines the way the Company does business. Waste is eliminated and efficiencies improved enterprise wide, allowing us to increase overall profitability. Improvements are not limited to production areas, as COS is also driving improvements in new product innovation, engineering, supply chain management, warranty, and product rationalization. COS has created a culture of continuous improvement across all aspects of our business operations.
     The Company has a long‑standing acquisition strategy. Traditionally, we have focused on strategic acquisitions or acquiring new businesses that can be added to existing operations. In addition, the Company considers acquiring new businesses that can operate independently from other Carlisle companies. Factors considered in making an acquisition include consolidation opportunities, technology, customer dispersion, operating capabilities, and growth potential. We acquired three businesses during 2016, which complement our existing Interconnect Technologies and Fluid Technologies segments, and acquisitions in 2017 that will expand our FoodService Products and Construction Materials segments. We have also pursued the sale of operating divisions when it is determined they no longer fit within the Company’s long‑term goals or strategy.
     For more details regarding acquisitions of the Company’s businesses during the past three years, see “Part II—Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Acquisitions” and Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

      Description of Businesses by Segment
     Carlisle Construction Materials (“CCM” or “Construction Materials”)
     The Construction Materials segment is a market leader in manufacturing and selling rubber (“EPDM”), thermoplastic polyolefin (“TPO”), and polyvinyl chloride membrane (“PVC”) roofing systems. In addition, CCM markets and sells accessories purchased from third party suppliers. CCM also manufactures and distributes energy‑efficient rigid foam insulation panels for substantially all roofing applications. Roofing materials and insulation are sold together in warranted systems or separately in non‑warranted systems to the new construction, re‑roofing and maintenance, general construction, and industrial markets. Through its coatings and waterproofing operation, this segment manufactures and sells liquid and spray‑applied waterproofing membranes, vapor and air barriers, and HVAC duct sealants and hardware for the commercial and residential construction markets. The majority of CCM’s products are sold through a network of authorized sales representatives and distributors.

 CCM operates manufacturing facilities located throughout the United States, its primary market, and in Germany, the Netherlands, and Romania. Insulation facilities are located in Montgomery, New York; Franklin Park, Illinois; Lake City, Florida; Terrell, Texas; Smithfield, Pennsylvania; Tooele, Utah; and Puyallup, Washington. EPDM manufacturing operations are located in Carlisle, Pennsylvania; Greenville, Illinois; Kampen; the Netherlands; and in Hamburg and Waltershausen, Germany. TPO facilities are located in Senatobia, Mississippi, Tooele, Utah; and Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Coatings and waterproofing manufacturing operations include four production facilities in North America. Block molded expanded polystyrene (“EPS”) operations include nine production and fabrication facilities across the United States. CCM also has a PVC manufacturing plant in Greenville, Illinois.
     Raw materials for this segment include EPDM polymer, TPO polymer, carbon black, processing oils, solvents, asphalt, methylene diphenyldiisocyanate, polyol, polyester fabric, black facer paper, oriented strand board, clay, and various packaging materials. Critical raw materials generally have at least two vendor sources to better assure adequate supply. For raw materials that are single sourced, the vendor typically has multiple processing facilities.
     Sales and earnings for CCM tend to be somewhat higher in the second and third quarters due to increased construction activity during those periods.
     The working capital practices for this segment include:
    
(i) | Standard accounts receivable payment terms of 45 days to 90 days.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | Standard accounts payable payment terms of 30 days to 60 days.
-----+---------------------------------------------------------------


(iii) | Inventories are maintained in sufficient quantities to meet forecasted demand.
------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      CCM serves a large and diverse customer base; however, in 2016 two distributor customers represented approximately 34% of this segment’s net sales, but neither customer represented 10% of the Company’s consolidated net sales. The loss of either of these customers could have a material adverse effect on this segment’s net sales and cash flows.
     This segment faces competition from numerous competitors that produce roofing, insulation, and waterproofing products for commercial and residential applications. The level of competition within this market varies by product line. As one of four major manufacturers in the single‑ply industry, CCM competes through pricing, innovative products, long‑term warranties, and customer service. CCM offers separately‑priced extended warranty contracts on its installed roofing systems, ranging from five years to 40 years and, subject to certain exclusions, covering leaks in the roofing system attributable to a problem with the particular product or the installation of the product. In order to qualify for the warranty, the building owner must have the roofing system installed by an independent authorized roofing contractor trained by CCM to install its roofing systems.
     Carlisle Interconnect Technologies (“CIT” or “Interconnect Technologies”)
     The Interconnect Technologies segment is a market leader in designing and manufacturing high‑performance wire, cable, connectors, contacts, and cable assemblies for the transfer of power and data primarily for the aerospace, medical, defense electronics, test and measurement equipment, and select industrial markets. This segment operates manufacturing facilities in the United States, Switzerland, China, Mexico, and the United Kingdom, with the United States, Europe, and China being the primary target markets for sales. Sales are made by direct sales personnel and independent sales representatives.
     Raw materials for this segment include gold, copper conductors that are plated with tin, nickel, or silver, polyimide tapes, polytetrafluoroethylene (“PTFE”) tapes, PTFE fine powder resin, thermoplastic resins, stainless steel, beryllium copper rod, machined metals, plastic parts, and various marking and identification materials. Key raw materials are typically sourced worldwide and have at least two supplier sources to better assure adequate supply.
     Sales and earnings of the Interconnect Technologies segment are generally not seasonal in nature.
     The working capital practices for this segment include:
    
(i) | Standard accounts receivable payment terms of 30 days to 60 days.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  5



(ii) | Standard accounts payable payment terms of 30 days to 60 days.
-----+---------------------------------------------------------------


(iii) | Inventories are maintained in sufficient quantities to meet forecasted demand. The majority of CIT’s sales are from made‑to‑order products, resulting in inventories purchased on demand.
------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      CIT serves a large and diverse customer base; however, in 2016 one customer represented approximately 22% of this segment’s net sales, but did not represent 10% of the Company’s consolidated net sales. The loss of this customer could have a material adverse effect on this segment’s net sales and cash flows.
     The Interconnect Technologies segment faces competition from numerous competitors within each of the markets it serves. While product specifications, certifications, and life cycles vary by market, the Interconnect Technologies segment primarily positions itself to gain design specification for customer platforms or products with long life cycles and high barriers to entry such as in the aerospace and medical markets that generally have high standards for product certification as deemed by the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) and Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), respectively. The Interconnect Technologies segment competes primarily on the basis of its product performance and its ability to meet its customers’ highly specific design, engineering, and delivery needs on a timely basis. Relative to many of its competitors that are large multi‑national corporations, the Interconnect Technologies segment retains the ability to remain agile and respond quickly to customer needs and market opportunities. 
     Carlisle Fluid Technologies (“CFT” or “Fluid Technologies”)
     Acquired in April 2015, the Fluid Technologies segment is a market leader in designing, manufacturing, and selling highly‑engineered liquid and powder finishing equipment and system components primarily in the automotive, automotive refinishing, aerospace, agriculture, construction, marine, and rail industries. The business operates manufacturing and assembly facilities in the United States, Mexico, Brazil, the United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland, China, and Japan, with approximately 60% of its sales outside the United States. The Fluid Technologies segment manufactures and sells products that are sold under the brand names of Binks®, DeVilbiss®, Ransburg®, BGK®, and MS Powder®. The majority of sales into these industries are made through a worldwide network of distributors, national accounts, integrators, and some direct to end‑user sales. These business relationships are managed primarily through direct sales personnel worldwide.
     Key raw materials for this segment include carbon and various grades of stainless steel, brass, aluminum, copper, machined metals, carbide, machined plastic parts, and PTFE. Key raw materials are typically sourced worldwide and have at least two vendor sources to better assure adequate supply.
     Approximately 20% to 25% of CFT’s annual net sales are for the development and assembly of large fluid handling or other application systems projects. Timing of these system sales can result in sales that are higher in certain quarters versus other quarters within the same calendar year. In addition, timing of system sales may cause significant year over year sales variances.
     The working capital practices for this segment include:
    
(i) | Standard accounts receivable payment terms of 30 days to 90 days.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | Standard accounts payable payment terms of 30 days to 60 days.
-----+---------------------------------------------------------------


(iii) | Inventories are maintained in sufficient quantities to meet forecasted demand.
------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      CFT serves a large and diverse customer base. The loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on this segment’s net sales and cash flows.

 The Fluid Technologies segment competes against both regional and international manufacturers. Major competitive factors include innovative designs, the ability to provide customers with lower cost of ownership than its competitors, dependable performance, and high quality at a competitive price. Fluid Technologies’ ability to spray, mix, or deliver a wide range of coatings, applied uniformly in exact increments, is critical to the overall appearance and functionality of the finished product. The segment’s installed base of global customers is supported by a worldwide distribution network with the ability to deliver critical spare parts and other services. Brands that are well recognized and respected internationally, combined with a diverse base of customers, applications, and industries served, positions the Fluid Technologies segment to continue designing patented, innovative equipment and solutions for customers across the globe.
     Carlisle Brake & Friction (“CBF” or “Brake & Friction”)
     The Brake & Friction segment consists of off‑highway braking systems and friction products for off‑highway, on‑highway, aircraft, and other industrial applications. CBF also includes the performance racing group which markets and sells high‑performance motorsport braking products. The Brake & Friction segment manufactures and sells products which are sold under several brand names, such as Hawk®, Wellman®, and Velvetouch®. CBF’s products are sold by direct sales personnel to Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEMs”), mass merchandisers, and various wholesale and industrial distributors around the world, including North America, Europe, Asia, South America, and Africa. Key markets served include construction, agriculture, mining, aircraft, heavy truck, and performance racing. Manufacturing facilities are located in the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, China, Japan, and India, where we have established a light manufacturing presence.
     The brake manufacturing operations require the use of various metal products such as castings, pistons, springs, and bearings. With respect to friction products, the raw materials used are fiberglass, phenolic resin, metallic chips, copper and iron powders, steel, custom‑fabricated cellulose sheet, and various other organic materials. Raw materials are sourced worldwide to better assure adequate supply, and critical raw materials generally have at least two vendor sources.
     The working capital practices for this segment include:
    
(i) | Standard accounts receivable payment terms of 30 days to 60 days.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | Standard accounts payable payment terms of 30 days to 90 days.
-----+---------------------------------------------------------------


(iii) | Inventories are maintained in sufficient quantities to meet forecasted demand.
------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      CBF serves a large and diverse customer base; however, in 2016 one customer represented approximately 18% of this segment’s net sales, but did not represent 10% of the Company’s consolidated net sales. The loss of this customer could have a material adverse effect on this segment’s net sales and cash flows.
     This segment strives to be a market leader by competing globally against regional and international manufacturers. Few competitors participate in all served markets. A majority participate in only a few of CBF’s served markets on a regional or global basis. Markets served are competitive and the major competitive factors include product performance, quality, product availability, and price. The relative importance of these competitive factors varies by market segment and channel.

 Carlisle FoodService Products (“CFS” or “FoodService Products”)
     The FoodService Products segment is a leading manufacturer, distributor, and seller of commercial foodservice and janitorial products with three main focus markets. CFS is a leading provider of (i) tabletop dining supplies, table coverings, and display serving ware, (ii) food preparation, storage and handling and transport supplies and tools, and (iii) cleaning and sanitation tools and waste handling for restaurants, hotels, hospitals, nursing homes, business and industry work sites, education, and government facilities. CFS’s Dinex brand business is a leading provider of healthcare meal delivery systems for in‑room and mobile dining for acute care hospital patients and senior assisted living residents. CFS’s Sanitary Maintenance Products group is the leading provider of Sparta brand cleaning brushes, floor care supplies, and waste handling for janitorial professionals managing commercial building, industrial, and institutional facilities cleaning and maintenance.

San Jamar designs and distributes dispensers for paper towels, tissue, soap and air purification as well as personal and food safety products for commercial and institutional foodservice and sanitary maintenance customers.
     CFS operates manufacturing facilities in the United States and Mexico. Sales are primarily in North America. CFS’s product line is distributed from three primary distribution centers located in Charlotte, North Carolina; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; and Batavia, Illinois, to wholesalers, distributors, and dealers. These distributor and dealer customers, in turn, sell to restaurant, hotel, and onsite foodservice operators and sanitary maintenance professionals. Distributors and dealer business relationships are managed through both direct sales personnel and subcontracted manufacturer representatives. With the acquisition of San Jamar, CFS added one additional distribution center in Elkhorn, WI. 
     Raw materials used by the FoodService Products segment include polymer resins, stainless steel, and aluminum. Key raw materials are sourced nationally from recognized suppliers of these materials.
     The working capital practices for this segment include:
    
(i) | Standard accounts receivable payment terms of 30 days to 60 days.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | Standard accounts payable payment terms of 30 days to 90 days.
-----+---------------------------------------------------------------


(iii) | Inventories are maintained in sufficient quantities to meet forecasted demand.
------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      The FoodService Products segment serves a large and diverse customer base; however, in 2016 three distributor customers together represented approximately 26% of this segment’s net sales, none of which represented 10% of the Company’s consolidated net sales. The loss of one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on this segment’s net sales and cash flows.
     The FoodService Products segment is engaged in markets that are generally highly competitive and competes equally on price, service, and product performance.
