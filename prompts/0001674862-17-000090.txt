ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
GENERAL
Ashland Global Holdings Inc. is a Delaware corporation, with its principal executive offices located at 50 E. RiverCenter Boulevard, Covington, Kentucky 41011 (Telephone: (859) 815-3333).  Ashland Global Holdings Inc. was incorporated in 2016 as the successor to a Kentucky corporation named Ashland Inc. organized in 2004 (now known as Ashland LLC), which was itself organized as the successor to a Kentucky corporation of the same name organized in 1936. The new holding company structure was put in place to allow Ashland Inc. to reincorporate in Delaware and to help facilitate the separation of the Valvoline business from the specialty chemicals businesses, creating two independent, publicly held companies (the Reorganization). As a result of the Reorganization, Ashland Global Holdings Inc. replaced Ashland Inc. as the publicly held corporation, and Ashland Inc. was converted to a Kentucky limited liability company and is now an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Ashland Global Holdings Inc. The terms “Ashland” and the “Company” as used herein include Ashland Global Holdings Inc., its predecessors and its consolidated subsidiaries, except where the context indicates otherwise. As a result of the Reorganization, Ashland is the successor issuer to Ashland Inc. pursuant to Rule 12g-3(a) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act) and will file periodic and other reports required by the Exchange Act.

CORPORATE DEVELOPMENTS
Ashland Separation of Valvoline
On September 22, 2015, Ashland announced that the Board of Directors approved proceeding with a plan to separate Ashland into two independent, publicly traded companies comprising of the Valvoline business and the specialty chemicals businesses.
In connection with the separation, in May 2016, Ashland filed a proxy statement/prospectus for a proposal to reorganize under a new public holding company to facilitate its reincorporation in the State of Delaware and to help facilitate the separation process. Upon completing the Reorganization in September 2016, Ashland Global Holdings Inc. replaced Ashland Inc. as the publicly held corporation and, through its subsidiaries, conducts all of the operations previously conducted by Ashland Inc. Each outstanding share of Ashland Inc. common stock was converted into one share of Ashland Global Holdings Inc. common stock. Ashland Inc. was converted to a limited liability company and is now an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Ashland Global Holdings Inc.
Following the closing of the Reorganization, Ashland took steps to transfer the Valvoline business to Valvoline Inc. On September 22, 2016, Ashland and Valvoline Inc. announced the pricing of the initial public offering (IPO) of 30 million shares of Valvoline Inc.’s common stock at a price to the public of $22.00 per share and closed the IPO on September 28, 2016. The underwriters exercised an option to purchase an additional 4.5 million shares of Valvoline Inc.’s common stock to cover overallotments. After completing the IPO, Ashland owned 170 million shares of Valvoline Inc.’s common stock, representing approximately 83% of the total outstanding shares of Valvoline Inc.’s common stock. The total net proceeds, after underwriters discount and other offering expenses, received from the IPO were $712 million. 
Ashland completed the distribution of its remaining 170 million shares of common stock of Valvoline Inc. as a pro rata dividend on shares of Ashland common stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date of May 5, 2017. Based on the shares of Ashland common stock outstanding as of May 5, 2017, the record date for the distribution, each share of Ashland common stock received 2.745338 shares of Valvoline common stock in the distribution. The distribution was recorded at the carrying amount of Valvoline Inc.'s net assets which was a deficit of $187 million as of May 12, 2017.
Pharmachem Acquisition
On May 17, 2017, Ashland completed its acquisition of the stock of Pharmachem, a leading provider of quality ingredients to the global health and wellness industries and high-value differentiated products to fragrance and flavor houses. With annual revenues of approximately $300 million and 14 manufacturing facilities in the United States and Mexico, New Jersey-based Pharmachem develops, manufactures and supplies custom and branded nutritional and fragrance products. Ashland has included Pharmachem within the Specialty Ingredients reporting segment. 
The acquisition was recorded by Ashland using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with applicable U.S. GAAP whereby the total purchase price was allocated to tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on respective fair values. The all-cash purchase price of Pharmachem was $680 million which included working capital adjustments of approximately $20 million.

MISCELLANEOUS
Environmental Matters
Ashland maintains a companywide environmental policy overseen by the Environmental, Health, Safety and Quality Committee of Ashland’s Board of Directors.  Ashland’s Environmental, Health, Safety, Quality and Regulatory Affairs (EHSQ&RA) department has the responsibility to ensure that Ashland’s businesses worldwide maintain environmental compliance in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.  This responsibility is carried out via training; widespread communication of EHSQ&RA policies; information and regulatory updates; formulation of relevant policies, procedures and work practices; design and implementation of EHSQ&RA management systems; internal auditing by a separate auditing group; monitoring of legislative and regulatory developments that may affect Ashland’s operations; assistance to the businesses in identifying compliance issues and opportunities for voluntary actions that go beyond compliance; and incident response planning and implementation.
Federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment have a significant impact on how Ashland conducts its businesses.  In addition, Ashland’s operations outside the United States are subject to the environmental laws of the countries in which they are located.  These laws include regulation of air emissions and water discharges, waste handling, remediation and product inventory, registration and regulation.  New laws and regulations may be enacted or adopted by various regulatory agencies globally.  The costs of compliance with any new laws or regulations cannot be estimated until the manner in which they will be implemented has been more precisely defined.
At September 30, 2017, Ashland’s reserves for environmental remediation and related environmental litigation amounted to $163 million, reflecting Ashland’s best estimates of the most likely costs that will be incurred over an extended period to remediate identified conditions for which the costs are reasonably estimable, without regard to any third-party recoveries.  Engineering studies, historical experience and other factors are used to identify and evaluate remediation alternatives and their related costs in determining the estimated reserves for environmental remediation.  Environmental remediation reserves are subject to numerous inherent uncertainties that affect Ashland’s ability to estimate its share of the costs.  Such uncertainties involve the nature and extent of contamination at each site, the extent of required cleanup efforts under existing environmental regulations, widely varying costs of alternate cleanup methods, changes in environmental regulations, the potential effect of continuing improvements in remediation technology and the number and financial strength of other potentially responsible parties at multiparty sites.  Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the ultimate costs of environmental remediation, Ashland currently estimates that the 
5

upper end of the reasonably possible range of future costs for identified sites could be as high as approximately $416 million.  No individual remediation location is significant, as the largest reserve for any site is approximately 15% of the remediation reserve. Ashland regularly adjusts its reserves as environmental remediation continues. Environmental remediation expense, net of insurance receivables, amounted to $24 million in 2017, compared to $40 million in 2016 and $40 million in 2015. 
Product Control, Registration and Inventory - Many of Ashland’s products and operations are subject to chemical control laws of the countries in which they are located.  These laws include regulation of chemical substances and inventories under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) in the United States and the Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (REACH) regulation in Europe.  Under REACH, additional testing requirements, documentation, risk assessments and registrations are occurring and will continue to occur and may adversely affect Ashland’s costs of products produced in or imported into the European Union.  Examples of other product control regulations include right to know laws under the Global Harmonized System (GHS) for hazard communication, regulation of chemicals used in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals and personal care products and that contact food under the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act in the United States, the Framework Regulation in Europe and other product control requirements for chemical weapons, drug precursors and import/export.  New laws and regulations may be enacted or adopted by various regulatory agencies globally.  The costs of compliance with any new laws or regulations cannot be estimated until the manner in which they will be implemented has been more precisely defined.
Remediation - Ashland currently operates, and in the past has operated, various facilities at which, during the normal course of business, releases of hazardous substances have occurred.  Additionally, Ashland has known or alleged potential environmental liabilities at a number of third-party sites.  Federal and state laws, including but not limited to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) and various other remediation laws, require that contamination caused by hazardous substance releases be assessed and, if necessary, remediated to meet applicable standards.  Some of these laws also provide for liability for related damage to natural resources, and claims for alleged property and personal injury damage can also arise related to contaminated sites.  Laws in other jurisdictions in which Ashland operates require that contamination caused by such releases at these sites be assessed and, if necessary, remediated to meet applicable standards.
Air - In the United States, the Clean Air Act (CAA) imposes stringent limits on facility air emissions, establishes a federally mandated operating permit program, allows for civil and criminal enforcement actions and sets limits on the volatile or toxic content of many types of industrial materials and consumer products.  The CAA establishes national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) with attainment deadlines and control requirements based on the severity of air pollution in a given geographical area.  Various state clean air acts implement, complement and, in many instances, add to the requirements of the federal CAA.  The requirements of the CAA and its state counterparts have a significant impact on the daily operation of Ashland’s businesses and, in many cases, on product formulation and other long-term business decisions.  Other countries where Ashland operates also have laws and regulations relating to air quality.  Ashland’s businesses maintain numerous permits and emission control devices pursuant to these clean air laws.
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has increased its frequency in reviewing the NAAQS.  The USEPA has stringent standards for particulate matter, ozone and sulfur dioxide.  Throughout 2017, state and local agencies continued to implement options for meeting the newest standards.  Particulate matter strategies include dust control measures for construction sites and reductions in emission rates allowed for industrial operations.  Options for ozone include emission controls for certain types of sources, reduced limits on the volatile organic compound content of industrial materials and consumer products, and requirements on the transportation sector.  Most options for sulfur dioxide focus on coal and diesel fuel combustion sources.  It is not possible at this time to estimate the potential financial impact that these newest standards may have on Ashland’s operations or products.  Ashland will continue to monitor and evaluate these standards to meet these and all air quality requirements.
Solid Waste - Ashland’s businesses are subject to various laws relating to and establishing standards for the management of hazardous and solid waste.  In the United States, Ashland’s facilities are subject to RCRA and its regulations governing generators of hazardous waste.  Ashland has implemented systems to oversee compliance with the RCRA regulations.  In addition to regulating current waste disposal practices, RCRA also addresses the environmental effects of certain past waste disposal operations, the recycling of wastes and the storage of regulated substances in underground tanks.  Ashland has the remediation liability for certain facilities subject to these regulations.  Other countries where Ashland operates also have laws and regulations relating to hazardous and solid waste, and Ashland has systems in place to oversee compliance.
Water - Ashland’s businesses maintain numerous discharge permits.  In the United States, such permits may be required by the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System of the Clean Water Act and similar state programs.  Other countries have similar laws and regulations requiring permits and controls relating to water discharge.
Climate Change and Related Regulatory Developments - Ashland has been collecting energy use data and calculating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for many years.  Ashland evaluates the potential impacts from both climate change and the anticipated GHG regulations to facilities, products and other business interests, as well as the strategies commonly considered by 
6

the industrial sector to reduce the potential impact of these risks.  These risks are generally grouped as impacts from legislative, regulatory and international developments, impacts from business and investment trends and impacts to company assets from the physical effects of climate change.  Current North American, European and other regional regulatory developments are not expected to have a material effect on Ashland’s operations, although some facilities are subject to promulgated rules.  Business and investment trends are expected to drive an increase in the demand for products that improve energy efficiency, reduce energy use and increase the use of renewable resources.  At this time, Ashland cannot estimate the impact of this expected demand increase to its businesses.  Physical effects from climate change have the potential to affect Ashland’s assets in areas prone to sea level rise or extreme weather events much as they do the general public and other businesses.  Due to the uncertainty of these matters, Ashland cannot estimate the impact at this time of GHG-related developments on its operations or financial condition.
Competition
Ashland competes in the highly fragmented specialty chemicals industry.  The participants in the industry offer a varied and broad array of product lines designed to meet specific customer requirements.  Participants compete with service and product offerings on a global, regional and/or local level subject to the nature of the businesses and products, as well as the end-markets and customers served.  Competition is based on several key criteria, including product performance and quality, product price, product availability and security of supply, responsiveness of product development in cooperation with customers, customer service, industry knowledge and technical capability.  Certain key competitors are significantly larger than Ashland and have greater financial resources, leading to greater operating and financial flexibility.  The industry has become increasingly global as participants have focused on establishing and maintaining leadership positions outside of their home markets.  Many of these segments’ product lines face domestic and international competition, because of industry consolidation, pricing pressures and competing technologies. In order to improve its competitive position, as Ashland narrows its focus on specialty chemicals, the company is building and more strongly leveraging the Ashland corporate brand as to better communicate the capabilities and scale of the company, making it easier to introduce new product lines and applications.
Intellectual Property
Ashland has a broad intellectual property portfolio which is an important component of all of Ashland’s reportable segments.   Ashland’s Specialty Ingredients, Composites and Intermediates and Solvents reportable segments rely on patents, trade secrets, formulae and know-how to protect and differentiate their products and technologies.  In addition, these reportable segments own valuable trademarks which identify and differentiate Ashland’s products from its competitors.  Ashland also licenses intellectual property rights from third-parties.
Raw Materials
Ashland purchases its raw materials from multiple sources of supply in the United States and other countries, and believes that raw material supplies will be available in quantities sufficient to meet demand in fiscal 2018. All of Ashland’s reportable segments were impacted to varying degrees in fiscal 2017 by the volatility of raw materials costs, and these conditions may continue in fiscal 2018. 
Research and Development
Ashland’s program of research and development is focused on defining the needs of the marketplace and framing those needs into technology platforms. Ashland has the capability to deliver and develop the intellectual property required to grow and protect those platforms.  Ashland is focused on developing new chemistries, market-changing technologies and customer driven solutions at numerous technology centers located in the Americas, Europe and the Asia Pacific region.  Research and development costs are expensed as they are incurred and totaled $83 million in 2017, $87 million in 2016 and $99 million in 2015. During 2015, this amount included impairment charges of $11 million related to certain in-process research and development assets associated with the 2011 acquisition of International Specialty Products Inc. (ISP). For additional information regarding these impairment charges, see Note H of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this annual report on Form 10-K.
Seasonality
Ashland’s business may vary due to seasonality. Ashland’s business units typically experience stronger demand during warmer weather months, which generally occur during Ashland’s third and fourth quarters.
