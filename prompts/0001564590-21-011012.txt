ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 Summit Midstream Partners, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (including its subsidiaries, collectively, “we”, “our”, “us”, "SMLP", or “the Partnership”), is a value-driven limited partnership focused on developing, owning and operating midstream energy infrastructure assets that are strategically located in unconventional resource basins, primarily shale formations, in the continental United States. Our common units are listed and traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “SMLP.”
 The Partnership was formed in May 2012. The Partnership’s executive offices are located at 910 Louisiana Street, Suite 4200, Houston, Texas 77002, and can be reached by phone at 832-413-4770. The Partnership also maintains regional field offices in close proximity to our areas of operation to support the operation and development of our midstream assets.
 As a result of the GP Buy-In Transaction (as described below), the Partnership indirectly owns its General Partner, and the General Partner’s Board of Directors is comprised of a majority of independent directors. The Partnership’s Fourth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership (the “Partnership Agreement”) provides the Partnership’s common unitholders with voting rights in the election of the members of the Board of Directors on a staggered basis beginning in 2022.
 Our Business Strategies
 We operate a differentiated midstream platform that is built for long-term, sustainable value creation. Our integrated assets are strategically located in premier production basins and core demand centers, including the Williston Basin, DJ Basin, Utica Shale, Marcellus Shale, and Permian Basin. Our primary business objective is to provide cash flow stability for our stakeholders while growing prudently and profitably. We intend to accomplish this objective by executing the following strategies:

• | Liability management. We seek to maximize unitholder value by reducing and extending, where appropriate, the Partnership’s indebtedness and other fixed capital obligations through a combination of opportunistic liability management transactions, operating cash flow, and other corporate transactions.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Portfolio management. We seek to maximize unitholder value by strategically managing our portfolio of midstream assets and allocating capital based on appropriate risk-informed cash flow assumptions. This may include opportunistic divestitures, re-allocation of capital to new or existing areas, and development of joint ventures involving our existing midstream assets or new investment opportunities.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maintaining our focus on fee-based revenue with minimal direct commodity price exposure. We intend to maintain our focus on providing midstream services under primarily long-term and fee-based contracts. We believe that our focus on fee-based revenues with minimal direct commodity price exposure is essential to maintaining stable cash flows.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maintaining strong producer relationships to maximize utilization of all of our midstream assets. We have cultivated strong producer relationships by focusing on customer service, reliable project execution and by operating our assets safely and reliably over time. We believe that our strong producer relationships will create future opportunities to optimize the utilization of the gathering systems in our Legacy Areas and develop new midstream infrastructure in our Core Focus Areas.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Suspension of common and preferred unit distributions. In May 2020, and in conjunction with the GP Buy-In Transaction, the Partnership suspended distributions to holders of its common units and its Series A Preferred Units, commencing with respect to the quarter ending March 31, 2020. The suspension of distributions enabled the Partnership to retain an incremental $76.0 million per annum of operating cash flow and reallocate this retained cash to indebtedness reduction, liability management transactions and other corporate initiatives. The unpaid cash distributions on the Series A Preferred Units continue to accrue semi-annually, until paid.

Our Midstream Assets
 Our systems gather natural gas from pad sites, wells and central receipt points connected to our systems. Gathered natural gas volumes are then compressed, dehydrated, treated and/or processed for delivery to downstream pipelines serving processing plants and/or end users. We also contract with producers to gather crude oil and produced water from wells connected to our systems for delivery to downstream pipelines and third-party rail terminals in the case of crude oil and to third-party disposal wells in the case of produced water. We generally refer to all of the services our systems provide as gathering services.
 We classify our midstream energy infrastructure assets into two categories, our Core Focus Areas and our Legacy Areas. Further details on our Focus Areas and Legacy Areas are summarized below.
  
• | Core Focus Areas. Core producing areas of basins in which we expect our gathering systems to experience greater long-term growth, driven by our customers’ ability to generate more favorable returns and support sustained drilling and completion activity in varying commodity price environments. In the near-term, we expect to concentrate the majority of our capital expenditures in our Core Focus Areas. Our Utica Shale, Ohio Gathering, Williston Basin, DJ Basin and Permian Basin reportable segments comprise our Core Focus Areas.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Legacy Areas. Production basins in which we expect volume throughput on our gathering systems to experience relatively lower long-term growth compared to our Core Focus Areas, given that our customers require relatively higher commodity prices to support drilling and completion activities in these basins. Upstream production served by our gathering systems in our Legacy Areas is generally more mature, as compared to our Core Focus Areas, and the decline rates for volume throughput on our gathering systems in the Legacy Areas are typically lower as a result. We expect to continue to decrease our near-term capital expenditures in these Legacy Areas. Our Piceance Basin, Barnett Shale and Marcellus Shale reportable segments comprise our Legacy Areas.

Industry Overview and Commercial Arrangements
 We compete with other midstream companies, producers and intrastate and interstate pipelines. Competition for volumes is primarily based on reputation, commercial terms, service levels, access to end-use markets, geographic proximity of existing assets to a producer's acreage and available capacity. We may also face competition to gather production outside of our AMIs and attract producer volumes to our gathering systems. Additionally, we could face incremental competition to the extent we make acquisitions.
 We earn revenue by providing gathering, compression, treating and/or processing services pursuant to primarily long-term and fee-based gathering and processing agreements with some of the largest and most active producers in North America. The fee-based nature of these agreements enhances the stability of our cash flows by limiting our direct commodity price exposure.
 The significant features of our gathering and processing agreements and the gathering systems to which they relate are discussed in more detail below. For additional operating and financial performance information, on a consolidated basis and by reportable segment, see the "Results of Operations" section in Item 7. MD&A.
 Areas of Mutual Interest. The vast majority of our gathering and processing agreements contain AMIs, some of which extend through 2036. The AMIs generally require that any production by our customers within the AMIs will be shipped on and/or processed by our assets. In general, our customers have not leased acreage that cover our entire AMIs but, to the extent that they have leased acreage, or lease additional acreage in the future, within our AMIs, any production from wells drilled by them within that AMI will be dedicated to our systems.
 Under certain of our gathering agreements, we have agreed to construct pipeline laterals to connect our gathering systems to producer pad sites located within the AMI. However, in certain circumstances we may choose not to fund a pad connection opportunity presented by a customer or we may choose not to fund capital calls in Ohio Gathering if we believe that the investment would not meet our internal return expectations. Under this scenario, the customer may, in certain circumstances, construct the infrastructure itself and sell it to us at a price equal to their cost plus an applicable profit margin, or, in some cases, we may release the relevant acreage dedication from the AMI. For Ohio Gathering, our joint venture partner may elect to fund 100% of the capital calls, if we choose not to fund our proportionate share of a given capital call, which could reduce our ownership interests in OGC and/or OCC. For example, in 2020, we chose not to fund capital calls at OGC and OCC, and as a result, our ownership interest in those ventures was reduced from 40% to 38.2% and 40% to 38.2%, respectively, as of December 31, 2020. 
 Minimum Volume Commitments. Certain of our gathering and/or processing agreements contain MVCs which, like AMIs, benefit the development and ongoing operation of a gathering system because they provide a minimum contracted monthly or annual revenue stream. As of December 31, 2020, we had remaining MVCs totaling 1.4 Tcfe. Our MVCs had a weighted-average remaining life of 4.9 years (assuming contracted MVCs for the remainder of the term) and average approximately 0.9 Bcfe/d through 2023. In addition, certain of our customers have an aggregate MVC, which is a total amount of volume throughput that the customer has agreed to ship and/or process on our systems (or an equivalent monetary amount) over the MVC term. In these cases, once a customer achieves its aggregate MVC, any remaining future MVCs will terminate and the customer will then simply pay the applicable gathering or processing rate multiplied by the actual throughput volumes shipped or processed, pursuant to the contract. As a result of this mechanism, in many cases, the weighted-average remaining period for which our MVCs apply is less than the weighted-average of the remaining contract life. For additional information on our MVCs, see Notes 3 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements.
 Our financial results are primarily driven by volume throughput across our gathering systems and by expense management. During 2020, aggregate natural gas volume throughput averaged 1,375 MMcf/d and crude oil and produced water volume throughput averaged 79 Mbbl/d. A majority of the volumes that we gather, compress, treat and/or process have a fixed-fee rate structure, which enhances the stability of our cash flows by providing a revenue stream that is not subject to direct commodity price risk or volatility. We also earn a portion of our revenues from the following activities that directly expose us to fluctuations in commodity prices: (i) the sale of physical natural gas and/or NGLs purchased under percentage-of-proceeds or other processing arrangements with certain of our customers in the Williston Basin, Piceance Basin, and Permian Basin segments, (ii) the sale of natural gas we retain from certain Barnett Shale customers and (iii) the sale of condensate we retain from our gathering services in the Piceance Basin segment. During the year ended December 31, 2020, these additional activities accounted for approximately 13% of total revenues.
 13


In addition, the vast majority of our gathering and/or processing agreements in both our Core Focus Areas and our Legacy Areas include AMIs. Our AMIs cover approximately 2.8 million surface acres in the aggregate, which includes more than 0.8 million surface acres associated with Ohio Gathering. Certain of our gathering and processing agreements also include MVCs. To the extent the customer does not meet its MVC, it is contractually obligated to make an MVC shortfall payment to cover the shortfall of required volume throughput not shipped or processed, either on a monthly or annual basis. We have designed our MVC provisions to ensure that we will generate a minimum amount of revenue from each customer over the life of the associated gathering and/or processing agreement, by collecting gathering or processing fees on actual throughput or from cash payments to cover any MVC shortfall. As of December 31, 2020, we had remaining MVCs totaling 1.4 Tcfe. Our MVCs have a weighted-average remaining life of 4.9 years (assuming contracted MVCs for the remainder of the term) and average approximately 0.9 Bcfe/d through 2023.
We use a variety of financial and operational metrics to analyze our performance, including among others, throughput volume, revenues, operation and maintenance expenses and segment adjusted EBITDA. We view each of these operational and/or GAAP metrics as important factors in evaluating our profitability and determining whether, and what amount of cash distributions, we pay to our unitholders. For additional information on our results of operations, see the “Results of Operations” section included in Item 7. MD&A.

Utica Shale | | 720 | | n/a | | n/a | | 12.2 | | n/a

 The Summit Utica system is a natural gas gathering system located in Belmont and Monroe counties in southeastern Ohio and serves producers targeting the dry gas window of the Utica and Point Pleasant shale formations. The Summit Utica system gathers and delivers natural gas, primarily under long-term, fee-based gathering agreements, which include acreage dedications. XTO and Ascent are the key customers of Summit Utica.
 We have connected a substantial number of our customers’ pad sites to our gathering system and we expect to benefit in the near-term from incremental volumes arising from drilling and completion activity that is occurring and will continue to occur on previously connected pad sites. Over time, we intend to expand our midstream service offering for the Summit Utica system to connect additional customer pad sites and install centralized compression facilities. Centralized compression services have been dedicated to us in our gathering agreements and will eventually constitute a new revenue stream from our customers; however, to date, this service has not been required given the relatively high downhole pressures exhibited by dry gas wells in the Utica Shale compared to other unconventional shale plays. 
 The Summit Utica system interconnects with the Ohio River System pipeline, which provides access to the Clarington Hub and Rover Pipeline. The Summit Utica system currently provides natural gas midstream services for the Utica Shale reportable segment.
 Ohio Gathering (Core Focus Area).

(1) Weighted average based on total remaining MVC (total remaining MVCs multiplied by average rate).
 AMIs for the Barnett Shale reportable segment total approximately 124,000 surface acres.
 The DFW Midstream system is primarily located in southeastern Tarrant County, in north-central Texas. We consider this area to be the core of the core of the Barnett Shale because of the quality of the geology and the high production profile of the wells drilled to date. The DFW Midstream system is underpinned by a long-term, fee-based gathering agreement with Total and additional customers.
 The DFW Midstream system includes natural gas gathering pipelines located under both private and public property and is partially located along existing electric transmission corridors. Compression on the system is powered by electricity. To offset the costs we incur to operate the system's electric-drive compressors, we either pass through a portion of the power expense to our customers or retain a fixed percentage of the natural gas that we gather. 
 The DFW Midstream system currently has six primary interconnections with third-party, primarily intrastate pipelines. These interconnections enable us to connect our customers, directly or indirectly, with the major natural gas market hubs in Texas and Louisiana. Total Gas & Power North America, Inc. ("Total") is the key customer for DFW Midstream.
 The DFW Midstream system currently provides midstream services for the Barnett Shale reportable segment.

 The Mountaineer Midstream system is located in Doddridge and Harrison counties in West Virginia where it gathers natural gas under a long-term, fee-based contract with Antero, which is targeting liquids-rich natural gas production from the Marcellus Shale formation in the Appalachian Basin. Volume throughput on the Mountaineer Midstream system is underpinned by minimum revenue commitments from Antero.
 The Mountaineer Midstream system consists of a high-pressure natural gas gathering system and two compressor stations. This system gathers high-pressure natural gas received from upstream pipeline interconnections with Antero Midstream Corporation and Crestwood Equity Partners LP. Mountaineer Midstream serves as a critical inlet to the Sherwood Processing Complex, a primary destination for liquids-rich natural gas in northern West Virginia and one of the largest natural gas processing facilities in the United States.
 The Mountaineer Midstream system currently provides midstream services for the Marcellus Shale reportable segment.
 For additional information relating to our business and gathering systems, see the "Trends and Outlook" and "Results of Operations" sections in Item 7. MD&A.
 Our Customers
 The systems that we operate and/or have significant ownership interests in have a diverse group of customers and counterparties comprising affiliates and/or subsidiaries of some of the largest natural gas and crude oil producers in North America. 
 We believe that our gathering systems in the Core Focus Areas are positioned for long-term growth through further development by our customers and increased utilization of our gathering systems. We intend to continue expanding our operations and creating additional scale in our Core Focus Areas through the execution of new, and the expansion of existing, strategic partnerships with our existing and prospective customers. 
 We believe that our customers in our Legacy Areas will pursue a slower pace of drilling and completion activity than customers in our Core Focus Areas. As a result, volume throughput in our Legacy Areas could decline or experience a lower rate of growth than our gathering systems in our Core Focus Areas. In general, our gathering systems in our Legacy Areas have a more mature base of connected wells, larger and longer-lived MVCs and experience lower volume throughput decline rates as compared to our gathering systems in our Core Focus Areas. We will continue to evaluate divestitures or joint ventures of certain of our gathering systems included in our Core Focus Areas or our Legacy Areas, which could result in a reallocation of capital or other resources to repay outstanding debt and other liabilities and fixed capital obligations, or re-invest in our Core Focus Areas.
 Regulation of the Natural Gas and Crude Oil Industries
 General. Sales by producers of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs are currently made at market prices. However, gathering and transportation services are subject to various types of regulation, which may affect certain aspects of our business and the market for our services. FERC regulates the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce and the interstate transportation of crude oil, petroleum products and NGLs. FERC regulation includes reviewing and accepting or approving rates and other terms and conditions for such transportation services and authorizing and regulating the construction and operation of interstate natural gas pipelines. FERC is also authorized to prevent and sanction market manipulation in natural gas markets while the FTC is authorized to prevent and sanction market manipulation in petroleum markets and the CFTC is authorized to prevent and sanction fraud and price manipulations in the commodity and futures markets, including the energy futures markets. State and municipal regulations may apply to the production and gathering of certain natural gas, the construction and operation of natural gas and crude oil facilities and the rates and practices of gathering systems and intrastate pipelines.
 22


Regulation of Crude Oil and Natural Gas Exploration, Production and Sales. Sales of crude oil and NGLs are not currently regulated and are transacted at market prices. In 1989, the U.S. Congress enacted the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act, which removed all remaining price and non-price controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas. FERC, which has the authority under the NGA to regulate the prices and other terms and conditions of the sale of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce, has issued blanket authorizations for all gas resellers subject to its regulation, except interstate pipelines, to resell natural gas at market prices. Either Congress or FERC (with respect to the resale of gas in interstate commerce), however, could re-impose price controls in the future.
 Exploration and production operations are subject to various types of federal, state and local regulation, including, but not limited to, permitting, well location, methods of drilling, well operations and conservation of resources. While these regulations do not directly apply to our business, they may affect our customers' ability to produce natural gas.
 Regulation of the Gathering and Transportation of Natural Gas and Crude Oil. We believe that the majority of our natural gas pipeline facilities qualify as gathering facilities that are exempt from the jurisdiction of FERC. Our Epping Pipeline interstate crude oil pipeline in North Dakota, which is owned and operated by Epping, is subject to FERC’s jurisdiction and oversight pursuant to FERC's authority under the ICA, and Epping has on file with FERC a tariff for interstate movements of crude oil on the pipeline. Additionally, in October 2020, Double E received FERC approval of its application to construct and operate the Double E Project, pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act. The Double E Project is anticipated to provide interstate natural gas transmission service from the Delaware Basin in southeastern New Mexico to delivery points in and around the Waha Hub in Texas, will be subject to FERC jurisdiction. In 2018, FERC solicited public comment on its current policy on the certification of construction of new pipeline facilities, although it has not made any determinations yet on whether to make any changes to that policy. In addition to approving and regulating the construction and operation of interstate natural gas pipelines, FERC also regulates such pipelines’ rates and terms and conditions of service, including transportation service agreements and negotiated rate agreements.
 Under FERC’s ICA jurisdiction, rates for interstate movements of liquids by pipeline are currently regulated primarily through an annual indexing methodology, under which pipelines increase or decrease their existing rates in accordance with a FERC-specified adjustment that sets a rate ceiling. This adjustment, which may be positive or negative in a given year, is subject to review every five years. For the five-year period beginning on July 1, 2016, FERC established an annual index adjustment equal to the change in the producer price index for finished goods plus 1.23%. In 2016, FERC proposed a policy change that would deny proposed index increases for pipelines under certain circumstances where revenues exceed cost-of-service by a certain percentage or where the proposed index increases exceed certain annual cost changes reported to FERC. FERC terminated this rulemaking on February 20, 2020 without adopting any part of the proposal. FERC completed its five-year review of its index adjustment by issuing an order on December 17, 2020 adopting a new annual index adjustment of the producer price index for finished goods plus 0.78% to become effective starting July 1, 2021. FERC’s order is subject to rehearing and possible judicial review.
 Under current FERC regulations, liquids pipelines can request a rate increase that exceeds the rate obtained through the indexing methodology by using a cost-of-service approach, but a pipeline must establish that a substantial divergence exists between its actual costs and the rates resulting from the indexing methodology. The rates charged by Epping may also be affected by FERC’s March 15, 2018 announcement of a revised policy eliminating the recovery of an income tax allowance in cost-of-service-based rates by FERC-jurisdictional crude oil and natural gas pipelines owned by master limited partnerships. FERC has not required oil pipelines on an industry-wide basis to decrease their rates to implement the new policy, but FERC has stated that the effects of the revised policy statement must be incorporated in annual FERC financial reports made by oil pipelines. The effect of the elimination of the income tax allowance for MLP pipelines, as well as the reduction in the corporate income tax rate resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Reform Legislation”), was considered in FERC’s five-year review of index rate adjustments which resulted in the December 17, 2020 order adopting a new annual index adjustment for the five-year period starting July 1, 2021. 
 The ICA permits interested persons to challenge proposed new or changed rates and authorizes FERC to suspend the effectiveness of such rates for up to seven months and investigate such rates. If, upon completion of an investigation, FERC finds that the new or changed rate is unlawful, it is authorized to require the pipeline to refund revenues collected in excess of the just and reasonable rate during the term of the investigation. FERC may also investigate, upon complaint or on its own motion, rates that are already in effect and may order a carrier to change its rates prospectively. Under certain circumstances, FERC could limit 
 23


Epping’s ability to set rates based on costs or could order reduced rates and reparations to complaining shippers for up to two years prior to the date of a complaint. FERC also has the authority to change terms and conditions of service if it determines that they are unjust and unreasonable or unduly discriminatory or preferential. The ICA also imposes potential criminal liability for certain violations of the statute.
 Intrastate pipelines, which may include some pipelines that perform gathering functions, may be subject to safety regulation by the DOT, although typically state regulatory authorities (operating under a federal certification) perform this function. State regulatory authorities also have jurisdiction over the rates and practices of intrastate pipelines and gathering systems, including requirements for ratable takes or non-discriminatory access to pipeline services. The basis for state regulation and the degree of regulatory oversight of gathering systems and intrastate pipelines varies from state to state. In Texas, we are regulated as a gas utility and have filed tariffs with the Railroad Commission of Texas to establish rates and terms of service for our DFW Midstream system assets. We have not been required to file tariffs in the other states in which we operate, although we are required to submit shape files and other information regarding the location and construction of underground gathering pipelines in North Dakota. The states in which we operate have adopted complaint-based regulation that allows natural gas producers and shippers to file complaints with state regulators in an effort to resolve access issues and rate grievances, among other matters. State authorities in the states in which we operate generally have not initiated investigations of the rates or practices of gathering systems or intrastate pipelines in the absence of a complaint. State regulation of intrastate pipelines continues to evolve and may become more stringent in the future. For example, the North Dakota Industrial Commission (“NDIC”) recently adopted rule changes that resulted in additional construction and monitoring requirements for all pipelines, including, but not limited to, those that transport produced water, and has recently adopted reclamation bonding requirements for certain underground gathering pipelines in North Dakota.
 Natural gas, crude oil and produced water production, gathering and transportation, including the construction of new gathering facilities and expansion of existing gathering facilities may also be subject to local regulation, such as approval and permit requirements.
 Anti-Market Manipulation Rules. We are subject to the anti-market manipulation provisions in the NGA and the NGPA, as amended by the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which authorize FERC to impose fines of up to $1,307,164 per day per violation of the NGA, the NGPA, or their implementing regulations, subject to future adjustments for inflation. In addition, the FTC holds statutory authority under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to prevent market manipulation in petroleum markets, including the authority to request that a court impose fines of up to $1,246,249 per violation, subject to future adjustment for inflation. These agencies have promulgated broad rules and regulations prohibiting fraud and manipulation in oil and gas markets. The CFTC is directed under the CEA to prevent price manipulations in the commodity and futures markets, including the energy futures markets. Pursuant to statutory authority, the CFTC has adopted anti-market manipulation regulations that prohibit fraud and price manipulation in the commodity and futures markets. The CFTC also has statutory authority to seek civil penalties of up to the greater of $1,227,202 per day per violation, subject to future adjustment for inflation, or triple the monetary gain to the violator for violations of the anti-market manipulation sections of the CEA. We are also subject to various reporting requirements that are designed to facilitate transparency and prevent market manipulation.
 Safety and Maintenance. We are subject to regulation by the DOT, which establishes federal safety standards for the design, construction, operation and maintenance of natural gas and crude oil pipeline facilities. In the Pipeline Safety Act of 1992, Congress expanded the DOT's regulatory authority to include regulated gathering lines that had previously been exempt from federal jurisdiction. Additional legislation has been passed over the years to reauthorize federal funding for federal pipeline programs, increase penalties for safety violations and establish additional safety requirements. For example, in December 2020, the Protecting our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2020 became law, reauthorizing PHMSA for funding through 2023 and requiring, among other things, rulemaking to amend the integrity management program, emergency response plan, operation and maintenance manual, and pressure control recordkeeping requirements for gas distribution operators; to create new leak detection and repair program obligations; and to set new minimum federal safety standards for onshore gas gathering lines.
 The DOT has delegated the implementation of pipeline safety requirements to PHMSA, which has adopted and enforces safety standards and procedures applicable to a limited number of our pipelines. In addition, many states, including the states in which we operate, have adopted regulations that are identical to or more restrictive than existing PHMSA regulations for intrastate pipelines. Among the regulations applicable to us, PHMSA requires pipeline operators to develop integrity management 
 24


programs for certain pipelines located in high consequence areas, which include high-population areas such as the Dallas-Fort Worth greater metropolitan area where our DFW Midstream system is located. While the majority of our pipelines meet the DOT definition of gathering lines and are thus currently exempt from the integrity management requirements of PHMSA, we also operate a limited number of pipelines that are subject to the integrity management requirements. Those regulations require operators, including us, to:
  
• | perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity;
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | identify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact a high consequence area;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | maintain processes for data collection, integration and analysis;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | repair and remediate pipelines as necessary;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | adopt and maintain procedures, standards and training programs for control room operations; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | implement preventive and mitigating actions.
--+---------------------------------------------

 In October 2019, the PHMSA issued three new final rules. One rule, which became effective in December 2019, establishes procedures to implement the expanded emergency order enforcement authority set forth in an October 2016 interim final rule. Among other things, this rule allows the PHMSA to issue an emergency order without advance notice or opportunity for a hearing. The other two rules, which became effective in July 2020, impose several new requirements on operators of onshore gas transmission systems and hazardous liquids pipelines. The rule concerning gas transmission extends the requirement to conduct integrity assessments beyond “high consequence areas” (“HCAs”) to pipelines in “moderate consequence areas” (“MCAs”). It also includes requirements to reconfirm Maximum Allowable Operating Pressure (“MAOP”), report MAOP exceedances, consider seismicity as a risk factor in integrity management, and use certain safety features on in-line inspection equipment. PHMSA modified the rule in July 2020, in response to a petition for reconsideration, to limit the rule’s recordkeeping requirement related to class location changes to gas transmission pipelines (not gas distribution pipelines) and to clarify that the rule’s reconfirmation requirements related to MAOP is limited to segments without traceable, verifiable and complete pressure test records. The rule concerning hazardous liquids extends the required use of leak detection systems beyond HCAs to all regulated non-gathering hazardous liquid pipelines, requires reporting for gravity fed lines and unregulated gathering lines, requires periodic inspection of all lines not in HCAs, calls for inspections of lines after extreme weather events, and adds a requirement to make all lines in or affecting HCAs capable of accommodating in-line inspection tools over the next 20 years.
 Gathering systems like ours are also subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Act and comparable state statutes, the purposes of which are to protect the health and safety of workers, both generally and within the pipeline industry. In addition, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration hazard communication standard, EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that such information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and the public.
 Environmental Matters
 General. Our operation of pipelines and other assets for the gathering, treating and/or processing of natural gas and the gathering of crude oil and produced water is subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. As an owner or operator of these assets, we must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels. These laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways, such as:

• | requiring the installation of pollution-control equipment or otherwise restricting the way we operate;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | limiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas, such as wetlands, coastal regions or areas inhabited by endangered or threatened species;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | delaying system modification or upgrades during permit reviews;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | requiring investigatory and remedial actions to mitigate pollution conditions caused by our operations or attributable to former operations; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 25


 
• | enjoining the operations of facilities deemed to be in non-compliance with permits or permit requirements issued pursuant to or imposed by such environmental laws and regulations.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties. Certain environmental statutes impose strict joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where substances, hydrocarbons or wastes have been disposed or otherwise released. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or other waste products into the environment.
 The trend in environmental regulation is to place more stringent requirements, resulting in more restrictions and limitations, on activities that may affect the environment. Thus, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate. We try to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and plan accordingly to remain in compliance with changing environmental laws and regulations and to minimize the costs of such compliance. We also actively participate in industry groups that help formulate recommendations for addressing existing and future regulations.
 The following is a discussion of the material environmental laws and regulations that relate to our business.
 Hazardous Substances and Waste. Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the management and release of solid and hazardous wastes and other substances, including hydrocarbons. These laws generally regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and may impose strict joint and several liability for the investigation and remediation of affected areas where hazardous substances may have been released or disposed. Furthermore, the Toxic Substances Control Act and analogous state laws, impose requirements on the use, storage and disposal of various chemicals and chemical substances at our facilities. CERCLA and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. We may handle hazardous substances within the meaning of CERCLA, or similar state statutes, in the course of our ordinary operations and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which these hazardous substances have been released into the environment.
 We also generate industrial wastes that are subject to the requirements of the RCRA and comparable state statutes. While the RCRA regulates both solid and hazardous wastes, it imposes strict requirements on the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous wastes. Although we generate minimal hazardous waste, it is possible that non-hazardous wastes, which could include wastes currently generated during our operations, will in the future be designated as hazardous wastes and, therefore, be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements. Moreover, from time to time, the EPA and state regulatory agencies have considered the adoption of stricter disposal standards for non-hazardous wastes, including natural gas wastes.
 We currently own or lease properties where hydrocarbons are being or have been handled for many years. Although we believe that the previous operators utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under the other locations where these hydrocarbons and wastes have been transported for treatment or disposal, without our knowledge. These properties and the wastes disposed thereon may be subject to CERCLA, the RCRA and analogous state laws. Under these laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), to clean up contaminated property (including contaminated groundwater) or to perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination. We are not currently aware of any facts, events or conditions relating to such requirements that could materially impact our operations or financial condition.
 Air Emissions. Our operations are subject to the federal CAA and comparable state and local laws and regulations. These laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources, including our facilities, and also impose various monitoring, control and reporting requirements. Such laws and regulations may require that we obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with air permits containing various emissions and operational limitations and utilize specific emission control technologies to limit emissions. Our failure to comply with these requirements could subject us to monetary penalties, injunctions, conditions or restrictions on operations and criminal enforcement actions. Furthermore, we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future to obtain and maintain operating permits and approvals for air pollutant emitting sources.
 26


In October 2015, the EPA issued a new lower NAAQS for ozone. The previous ozone standard was set at 75 parts per billion ("ppb"). The revised standard has been lowered to 70 ppb. The lowered ozone NAAQS could subject us to increased regulatory burdens in the form of more stringent emission controls, emission offset requirements and increased permitting delays and costs. Impacts from the 2015 standard have not yet been determined, as states are still in the process of incorporating the new standard into their respective state implementation plans. We will continue to monitor developments to determine if any adverse effects on our operations can be expected.
 On June 3, 2016, the EPA finalized revisions to its 2012 New Source Performance Standard ("NSPS") OOOO for the oil and gas industry, to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases - most notably methane - along with smog-forming VOCs. The revisions, which are published in the Federal Register under Subpart OOOOa, included the addition of methane to the pollutants covered by the rule, along with requirements for detecting and repairing leaks at gathering and boosting stations. The revised rule applies to sources that have been modified, constructed, or reconstructed after September 18, 2015. In August 2020, the EPA issued two final rules that rescinded the methane-specific requirements of NSPS OOOO and OOOOa applicable to sources in the production and processing segments and removed the transmission and storage segment from the source category. However, these 2020 rules are being challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. In addition, President Biden’s January 20, 2021 Executive Order on “Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis” directed EPA to consider publishing a proposed rule suspending, revising, or rescinding the 2020 rules, as well as to consider establishing methane and VOC emission standards for existing sources in the oil and gas sector, including the transportation and storage segments.
 On November 16, 2016 the Bureau of Land Management ("BLM") issued a final rule to reduce venting and flaring of natural gas on public and Indian lands. The final rule mirrors many of the requirements found in NSPS OOOOa, with additional natural gas royalty requirements for flared volumes at sites already connected to gas capture infrastructure. In September 2018, the BLM published a final rule that rescinded several requirements of this rule. However, in July 2020, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California vacated BLM’s 2018 revision rule. In addition, in October 2020, a Wyoming federal district judge vacated the 2016 venting and flaring rule. Environmental groups appealed the October 2020 decision in December 2020 and litigation is ongoing. While the rule, if implemented, is expected to have little or no direct impact on our operations, our customers that are primarily upstream wellhead operators may be impacted by the requirements in this rule.
 In recent years, the EPA has also demonstrated an increased focus on CAA compliance for natural gas gathering operations. For example, in September 2019, EPA issued an enforcement alert noting that EPA identified CAA noncompliance caused by unauthorized and/or excess emissions from depressurizing pig launchers and receivers in natural gas gathering operations. The alert discussed engineering, design, operations, and maintenance practices that EPA found that can cause noncompliance and summarizes engineering solutions to reduce emissions. This increased focus on natural gas gathering operations and any resulting enforcement actions by EPA or state agencies could subject us to monetary penalties, injunctions, conditions or restrictions on operations.
 Water Discharges. The CWA and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters, which impacts our ability to conduct construction activities in waters and wetlands. Certain state regulations and the general permits issued under the Federal National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program prohibit the discharge of pollutants and chemicals. In addition, the CWA and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. These permits require us to control storm water runoff from some of our facilities. Some states also maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the CWA and analogous state laws and regulations. Except as otherwise disclosed in this annual report, we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable requirements of the CWA and analogous state laws and regulations relating to water discharges.
 Oil Pollution Control Act. The OPA requires the preparation of an SPCC plan for facilities engaged in drilling, producing, gathering, storing, processing, refining, transferring, distributing, using, or consuming oil and oil products, and which due to their location, could reasonably be expected to discharge oil in harmful quantities into or upon the navigable waters of the United States. The owner or operator of an SPCC-regulated facility is required to prepare a written, site-specific spill prevention plan, which details how a facility's operations comply with the requirements. To be in compliance, the facility's SPCC plan must satisfy all of the applicable requirements for drainage, bulk storage tanks, tank car and truck loading and unloading, transfer operations 
 27


(intrafacility piping), inspections and records, security and training. Certain of our facilities are classified as SPCC-regulated facilities. We believe that they are in substantial compliance with all applicable requirements of OPA.
 Hydraulic Fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and increasingly common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or crude oil from dense subsurface rock formations and is primarily presently regulated by state agencies. However, Congress has in the past and may in the future consider legislation to regulate hydraulic fracturing by federal agencies or limit the ability of companies to engage in hydraulic fracturing. Many states have already adopted laws and/or regulations that require disclosure of the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. A number of states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure and well construction requirements on oil and/or natural gas drilling activities. For example, a Colorado ballot initiative, Proposition 112, would have substantially increased setback distances for various upstream activities, thereby substantially restricting new oil and gas development in the state. Although Proposition 112 was defeated in the November 2018 elections, similar ballot initiatives have been circulated by interested groups for potential consideration in elections. Further, Colorado Senate Bill 19-181, signed into law in April 2019, changed the mandate of the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (“COGCC”), the state’s oil and gas regulator from fostering oil and gas development to regulating oil and gas development in a reasonable manner to protect public health and the environment. The new law also allows local governments to impose more restrictive requirements on oil and gas operations than those issued by the state and reduced the oil and gas representation on the COGCC. Further, in November 2020, the COGCC adopted new regulations that increase oil and gas setbacks to a minimum of 2,000 feet from schools and childcare facilities, prohibit routine venting and flaring, increase wildlife protections, and alter certain aspects of the permitting process. These regulations and similar efforts in Colorado and elsewhere could restrict oil and gas development in the future. States also could elect to prohibit hydraulic fracturing altogether, as New York, Maryland, and Vermont have done. In addition, certain local governments have adopted, and additional local governments may adopt, ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular.
 The EPA has also moved forward with various regulatory actions, including approving new regulations requiring green completions of hydraulically-fractured wells and corresponding reporting requirements that went into effect in 2015. Revisions to the green completion regulations were finalized in June 2016 and include additional requirements to reduce methane and VOCs. In August 2020, the EPA issued two final rules that rescinded the methane-specific requirements of these regulations applicable to sources in the production and processing segments and removed the transmission and storage segment from the source category. However, these 2020 rules are being challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. In addition, President Biden’s January 20, 2021 Executive Order on “Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis” directed EPA to consider publishing a proposed rule suspending, revising, or rescinding the 2020 rules as well as to consider establishing methane and VOC emission standards for existing sources in the oil and gas sector, including the transportation and storage segments. The BLM has also asserted regulatory authority over aspects of the hydraulic fracturing process, and issued a final rule in March 2015 that established more stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands. However, in December 2017, the BLM published a final rule rescinding the 2015 rule. The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California upheld the December 2017 rescission rule in a March 2020 decision. The State of California and environmental plaintiffs then appealed the decision in June 2020. Litigation is currently ongoing. 
 Further, several federal governmental agencies have conducted reviews and studies on the environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing, including the EPA. The results of such reviews or studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing. 
 State and federal regulatory agencies recently have focused on a possible connection between the hydraulic fracturing related activities and the increased occurrence of seismic activity. When caused by human activity, such events are called induced seismicity. Some state regulatory agencies, including those in Colorado, Ohio, and Texas, have modified their regulations or guidance to account for induced seismicity. These developments could result in additional regulation and restrictions on the use of injection disposal wells and hydraulic fracturing. Such regulations and restrictions could cause delays and impose additional costs and restrictions on our customers.
 Additionally, certain of our customers produce oil and gas on federal lands. On January 20, 2021, the Acting Secretary for the Department of the Interior signed an order effectively suspending new fossil fuel leasing and permitting on federal lands for 60 days. Then on January 27, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order indefinitely suspending new oil and natural gas leases on public lands or in offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices.
 28


If new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to drilling activities or to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted, this could result in a reduction in the supply of natural gas and/or crude oil that our customers produce, and could thereby adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. Compliance with such rules could also generally result in additional costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, for our customers, which could ultimately decrease end-user demand for our services and could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 Endangered Species Act. The Endangered Species Act restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. Some of our pipelines may be located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species.
 National Environmental Policy Act. The NEPA establishes a national environmental policy and goals for the protection, maintenance and enhancement of the environment and provides a process for implementing these goals within federal agencies. Major projects having the potential to significantly impact the environment require review under NEPA. Many of our activities are covered under categorical exclusions which results in an expedited NEPA review process. Large upstream and downstream projects with significant cumulative impacts may be subject to longer NEPA review processes, which could impact the timing of those projects and our services associated with them.
 Climate Change. The EPA has adopted regulations under the CAA that, among other things, establish GHG emission limits from motor vehicles as well as establish PSD construction and Title V operating permit reviews for certain large stationary sources that are potential major sources of GHG emissions. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their GHG emissions also will be required to meet “best available control technology” standards that will be established by the states or, in some cases, by the EPA on a case-by-case basis.
 EPA rules also require the reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG-emitting sources in the United States, including onshore and offshore oil and natural gas systems. We are required to report under these rules for our assets that have GHG emissions above the reporting thresholds. In October 2015, the EPA issued revisions to Subpart W of the GHG reporting rule to include reporting requirements for gathering and booster stations, onshore natural gas transmission pipelines, and completions and workovers of oil wells with hydraulic fracturing. This development resulted in increased monitoring and reporting for our operations and for upstream producers for whom we provide midstream services.
 In addition, almost half of the states, either individually or through multi-state regional initiatives, have begun to address GHG emissions, primarily through the planned development of emission inventories or regional GHG cap and trade programs. Most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring either major sources of emissions, such as electric power plants, or major producers of fuels, such as refineries and gas processing plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances. In general, the number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year until the overall GHG emission reduction goal is achieved. Depending on the scope of a particular program, we could be required to purchase and surrender allowances for GHG emissions resulting from our operations (e.g., at compressor stations). Although most of the state-level initiatives have to date been focused on large sources of GHG emissions, such as electric power plants, it is possible that certain components of our operations, such as our gas-fired compressors, could become subject to state-level GHG-related regulation.
 Further, in December 2015, over 190 countries, including the United States, reached an agreement to reduce global GHG emissions. The agreement entered into force in November 2016, after over 70 countries, including the United States, ratified or otherwise consented to be bound by the agreement. In November 2019, the United States submitted formal notification to the United Nations that it intended to withdraw from the agreement. However, on January 20, 2021, President Biden signed an “Acceptance on Behalf of the United States of America” that reversed the prior withdrawal, and the United States officially rejoined the Paris Agreement on February 19, 2021. In addition, shortly after taking office in January 2021, President Biden issued a series of executive orders designed to address climate change. Reentry into the Paris Agreement and President Biden’s executive orders may result in the development of additional regulations or changes to existing regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and that of our customers.
 Legislation or regulations that may be adopted to address climate change could also affect the markets for our products by making our products more or less desirable than competing sources of energy. To the extent that our products are competing with higher GHG-emitting energy sources, our products would become more desirable in the market with more stringent limitations on GHG emissions. Conversely, to the extent that our products are competing with lower GHG-emitting energy sources such as solar and wind, our products would become less desirable in the market with more stringent limitations on GHG emissions.
