Item 1. Business.
Overview
Signify Health is a leading healthcare platform that leverages advanced analytics, technology, and nationwide healthcare provider networks to create and power value-based payment programs. Our mission is to build trusted relationships to make people healthier. We believe that we are a market leader in the value-based healthcare payment industry offering a suite of total cost of care enablement services, including, among others, in-home health evaluations (“IHEs”) performed either within the patient’s home, virtually or at a healthcare provider facility, diagnostic & preventive services, ACO enablement services, provider enablement services, 340B referrals and return to home services. IHEs are health evaluations performed by a clinician in the home to support payors’ participation in Medicare Advantage and other government-run managed care plans. Our mobile network of providers completed evaluations for over 2.3 million individuals participating in Medicare Advantage and other managed care plans in 2022. ACOs are an alternative payment model where a range of providers take responsibility for the cost of a patient’s healthcare over the course of a year with the goal of improving quality and operational efficiency and sharing in any savings achieved as a result of such coordination. Our ACO services are intended to help our clients generate and receive shared savings. These services include, but are not limited to, population health software, analytics, practice improvement, compliance, and governance. We believe that these core solutions have enabled us to become integral to how health plans and healthcare providers successfully participate in value-based payment programs, and that our platform lessens the dependence on facility-centric care for acute and post-acute services and shifts more services towards alternate sites and, most importantly, the home. 
Value-based payment programs are rapidly transforming how governments, employers, and health plans pay for and manage healthcare services. The objective of these initiatives is to improve patient outcomes while lowering the overall cost of healthcare services. We believe that our differentiated data assets, proprietary analytics capabilities, comprehensive cloud-based software platforms, and healthcare provider networks enable success in two of the largest population-based payment programs: Medicare Advantage and the Medicare Shared Saving Program (“MSSP”). We have leading positions serving these programs, as measured by our volume of IHEs and the number of attributed lives in MSSP, respectively.
Our solutions support value-based payment programs by aligning financial incentives around outcomes, providing tools to health plans and healthcare organizations designed to assess and manage risk and identify actionable opportunities for improved patient outcomes, coordination and cost-savings. Through our platform, we coordinate what we believe is a holistic suite of clinical, social, and behavioral services to address an individual’s healthcare needs and prevent adverse events that drive excess cost. Our business model is aligned with our customers, as we generate revenue when we successfully engage members for our health plan customers and generate savings for our provider customers.
As of December 31, 2022, operations in our former Episodes of Care wind-down segment had ceased and therefore we now have one operating segment. 
On July 7, 2022, we announced our plans to exit our Episodes of Care business. As of December 31, 2022, we have ceased operations in the former Episodes of Care Wind-down segment. See “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Recent Developments and Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations.”
On September 2, 2022, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with CVS Pharmacy, Inc., a Rhode Island corporation. See ”Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Recent Developments and Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations.”
Our Solutions
In-home health evaluations and related services
We have a large mobile network of credentialed providers in the United States, which we deploy into the home primarily to conduct IHEs and to perform select diagnostic services. Through our IHEs, we create a comprehensive, documented record of the clinical, social, and behavioral needs of our health plan customers’ medically complex populations and seek to further engage them with the healthcare system. Working with data from our health plan customers, our operating platform and advanced data analytics help to identify the highest priority individuals for an in-home evaluation. We then engage with those members to schedule visits to perform IHEs. While in the home, our providers perform IHEs with the assistance of our longitudinal patient records and our proprietary clinical workflow software with its integrated device hub. Our software guides clinical workflows as well as in-home diagnostic screenings, yielding a rich patient report of hundreds of data points. The duration of our IHEs is up to 2.5 times longer than the average visit with a primary care physician (“PCP”). In performing these evaluations, we also seek to engage individuals more closely with the healthcare system. For example, the evaluation results of IHEs are provided to individuals’ PCPs. We believe sharing these results helps to fill gaps in care, while encouraging individuals who have not regularly visited their PCP to schedule a visit.
In addition to providing health plans with insights into member health without taking members out of the home, the reports our IHEs produce form a basis of the Medicare Risk Adjustment Factor (“RAF”) scores, which contribute to health plans’ ability to effectively participate in value-based and risk-adjusted government programs like Medicare Advantage, and affect the premiums health plans receive for Medicare Advantage beneficiaries. The data we gather is also a resource that can be used by health plans to improve their Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (“HEDIS”) scores and Medicare Advantage Star Ratings (“Star Ratings”). We conducted over 2.3 million IHEs (including virtual IHEs) in the year ended December 31, 2022.
Telehealth through virtual IHEs
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and in close coordination with our customers, we accelerated our telehealth initiatives by launching virtual IHEs (“vIHEs”) in the second quarter of 2020. vIHEs primarily take place via videoconference. vIHEs have allowed us to engage with high-need, vulnerable individuals during a critical time, ensuring that our health plan customers maintain detailed insights into their members’ health and are able to coordinate services accordingly. Although the volume of vIHEs declined in 2021 and 2022 compared to the initial launch in 2020, we continue to conduct vIHEs to meet the changing needs of our clients.
Diagnostic and Preventive Services
We offer Diagnostic and Preventive Services (“DPS”) to address care gaps when coupled with an IHE. Together, these integrated services create a more comprehensive and convenient care experience for the member. DPS help health plans close the risk and quality-based gaps in care of Medicare Advantage and Medicaid plan members, through the early detection, diagnosis, and management of some of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality. In-home screenings we offer include: spirometry, peripheral artery disease screening, fecal immunochemical test, urinalysis and estimated glomerular filtration rate, hemoglobin A1c blood test, retinal imaging and bone density ultrasound. 
Comprehensive Medication Review
Our comprehensive medication review services provide members with an in-person medication therapy management solution, as required by CMS for Medicare Part D providers. Our providers thoroughly review members’ medications and adherence, discuss prescription regimens, answer questions, and provide educational resources and referrals.
Return to Care
Powered by our proprietary data and technology, our IHEs can generate actionable clinical data, empowering health plans to more effectively predict risk and quality gaps - all during a single visit. When unmet care needs are identified, we coordinate the next best action with health plan members, leading to a more connected, effective care experience that we believe also leads to better health outcomes. In 2022, we coordinated the return to care of approximately 325 thousand individuals, through case management referrals, urgent care and PCP and specialty appointment scheduling.
Social determinants of health
In 2019, we started utilizing telephonic outreach and comprehensive, in-home evaluations to directly identify the social determinants of an individual’s health (“SDOH”), such as food insecurity, slip and fall risk, access to transportation, social isolation, and the financial resources to afford medications. We combine this assessment with IHEs and refer to this combined product as an IHE+. We believe this feature adds an advanced SDOH component to an already high-value IHE product and helps us to drive increased member engagement.
ACO Enablement Services - Medicare Shared Savings Program (“MSSP”)
On March 1, 2022, we acquired Caravan Health. Through Caravan Health, we support providers participating in the MSSP. Providers participating in MSSP create an Accountable Care Organization (“ACO”), which is a network of healthcare providers and suppliers that work together to invest in infrastructure and redesign delivery processes to attempt to achieve high quality and efficient delivery of services. ACOs that achieve performance standards established by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) are eligible to share in a portion of the amounts saved by the Medicare program. MSSP has different risk tracks pursuant to which providers can assume greater risk in exchange for the opportunity to receive a greater portion of savings realized. We served over 600 thousand attributed lives in 2022 and have verified attribution of over 700 thousand lives under management in 2023. 
MSSP employs a retrospective payment system in which Medicare reimburses providers in accordance with their usual FFS payment schedule, while also tracking the total FFS costs for all billable services rendered for attributed Medicare beneficiaries over the course of a year. CMS periodically compares the total amount of all FFS payments for a beneficiary against a benchmark price for the annual cost of such beneficiary’s medical care. If the total FFS costs exceed the benchmark price, then (unless the ACO is participating in the lowest risk track) the ACO owes a portion of the difference to CMS and, likewise, if total FFS costs are lower than the benchmark price, then CMS pays a portion of the difference (representing the shared savings achieved) to the ACO. In 2021, our collaborative ACOs generated more than $138 million in gross savings, which are shared amongst Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), our provider customers, and Signify Health.
Many providers are unable to successfully participate in MSSP because they have small patient populations and cannot spread the expense of high-cost patients, or the risk of random events, over a sufficiently large 
population of attributed Medicare FFS beneficiaries. The result is that such providers are exposed to significant downside risk, as the effects of random events and outlier patients can outweigh performance improvements from improved care coordination. In addition, while increasing care coordination has been shown to improve health outcomes and reduce overall costs in the healthcare system, it can require significant time and specialized resources that many healthcare systems, hospitals and physician group practices lack. For the same reasons, even ACOs formed by larger providers are often hesitant to select the higher risk tracks in MSSP.
We help providers succeed in MSSP in three ways. First, we help unrelated providers join together to form a “collaborative ACO”. The collaborative ACO has a large attributed patient population, consisting of the beneficiaries attributed to all of the participating providers. Risks are therefore spread across a much larger beneficiary population, helping to stabilize performance and reduce downside risk for participating providers. Second, we offer providers a suite of tools and services that are designed to enhance their ability to effectively manage and coordinate the care of attributed patients in order to improve patient outcomes, reduce costs, and generate savings. Third, we assume a portion of the collaborative ACO’s financial risk (and receive a portion of any shared savings received by the collaborative ACO).
Our services include the following:
•Data Integration & Analytics: We set up secure data feeds with our provider partners and are able to receive data from leading electronic health record (“EHR”) systems, which allows us access to real-time EHR data in order to quickly identify individuals with high healthcare utilization, co-morbid conditions, and/or unmet needs. Our analytics tools also identify areas of high variability with opportunities for improvement, generate comparative benchmarks to help providers measure performance relative to their peers, and power our 340B program offering. The 340B program is a federal drug pricing program that requires pharmaceutical manufacturers participating in Medicaid or Medicare Part B to sell outpatient drugs at discounted prices to certain qualifying health care providers. Our 340B offering includes services that assist qualified healthcare providers in identifying 340B program eligible claims.
•Provider Enablement Platform: Our provider enablement platform presents data and the results of our analytics to providers in a convenient, easy-to-use format. The platform includes performance dashboards and regional and national benchmarks, highlights high-priority patients, and identifies if they are eligible for complex care management or have conditions requiring attention.
•Patient-Facing Mobile App: We offer providers access to our mobile app for patients, which provides patients with reminders for time-sensitive tasks, allows them to record their vital signs, educates them on certain conditions and how to manage such conditions, and provides them with a HIPAA-compliant platform to message their providers.
•Incentive Alignment: We assist ACO provider participants in developing, tracking and reporting on appropriate metrics in order to align incentives and maximize realization of shared savings. 
•Training & Educational Tools: We provide our clients with a wealth of training and educational resources, including training providers on population health tactics and principles, information on best practices, specialized training in transition care management to stabilize patients post-discharge and reduce the risk of hospital readmission, practice transformation resources, preventive and care management workflows and staffing recommendations, and initiatives to promote evidence-based medicine.
•Annual Wellness Visit Support: We assist providers with patient outreach and scheduling of annual wellness visits (“AWVs”), provide them with workflows and data to support AWVs, and collaborate with them to offer patients in-home AWVs.
•Quality Measurement and Reporting: We provide tools and resources to help providers measure and track quality, and assist with reporting quality measures to CMS.
•Distribution of Shared Savings: We calculate, pay and distribute shared savings to participants in collaborative ACOs.
•Compliance: We offer providers and collaborative ACOs assistance with training, advice and assistance in meeting MSSP and related regulatory compliance requirements.
•Patient Education / ER Avoidance: In addition to the educational resources contained within our mobile app for patients, we reach out to attributed ACO patients to educate them on disease and condition management and available healthcare resources in order to reduce unnecessary emergency room utilization.
ACO Enablement Services – Non-MSSP ACOs
In 2022, we launched our non-MSSP ACO service, and began offering health plans collaborative ACO programs. Our service offering includes designing and administering such ACO programs, as well as recruiting and contracting with participating providers. We leverage our relationships and credibility with providers participating in our MSSP ACOs to recruit providers for these health plan ACOs. Participating providers receive a suite of services similar to our MSSP service offering, and we also share risk with these providers, thereby aligning incentives and building trust.
Industry
Total U.S. healthcare spending exceeded $4.3 trillion in 2021 and we operate in the large market associated with payment for healthcare services. We serve needs of healthcare funding sources including Medicare, Medicaid, and private health plans. Signify Health operates in the value-based payment sector of the healthcare industry. We believe value-based payments have grown dramatically over the past ten years and are expected to eventually represent the majority of healthcare spending in the United States according to studies by Health Care Payment Learning & Action Network (“HCP-LAN”) and other research reports by industry analysts, which suggest that approximately 75% of total U.S. health spending is expected to be tied to quality and value by 2025 through the adoption of new payment models focused on value. We believe this will especially be the case as value-based payment models continue to penetrate the commercial insured and self-funded markets. Our leadership position in enabling some of the most significant risk programs has allowed us to invest in and develop scale and expertise around analytics, technology, networks, and relationships to grow rapidly as demand for services in the value-based payment industry increases over time.
Industry reports estimate the current addressable market for value-based payor programs, such as Medicare Advantage and Medicaid, is at least $300 billion, with 84 million members enrolled in Medicare Advantage and Medicaid Managed Care. Under such payor value-based care programs, payor rates are set based upon overall population risk. Through these arrangements, payors take on risk and need to develop an accurate picture of the health of their patient population in order to receive appropriate funding. Adjusting funding based upon a member’s health helps stabilize payor value-based care programs and incentivizes payors to enroll both healthy and higher cost members. A critical element to developing and understanding the overall health of a patient population is an accurate health evaluation in the home and coding of each individual patient’s health conditions. While the overall cost to perform these activities is a small component of total spending, there is significant value from the resulting data that is captured.
According to HCP-LAN, in 2020, approximately 40.9% of U.S. health care payments, representing approximately 238.8 million Americans and 80.2% of the covered population, flowed through alternative value-based payment models, such as total cost of care models like MSSP, which are alternatives to the traditional fee-for-service payment models. HCP-LAN further reported that of the total in alternative payment models , approximately 44% of spending was through value-based payment models with two-sided risk, where providers also assumed 
potential risk in the event of suboptimal outcomes, as opposed to models where providers only stood to benefit from shared savings without the possibility of bearing downside risk. Under provider value-based care programs, healthcare provider reimbursement is tied to the outcomes and the overall quality of care delivered to patients. Value-based care reimbursement is different from the standard fee-for-service model in that providers are reimbursed based on the financial value of the healthcare services they provide and are rewarded for both efficiency and effectiveness. In order for providers to be able to participate in value-based care models, they need to utilize solutions that can track and report on hospital readmissions, adverse events, population health, patient engagement, and more. They also need tools to help them analyze costs, redesign care and align incentives with other healthcare providers. These solutions are used to holistically organize and finance healthcare delivery to ensure higher quality outcomes at improved costs.
Competition
The U.S. healthcare industry is highly competitive. We compete primarily in the market associated with payment for healthcare services, where large and small companies are formulating innovative ways to transition the healthcare market to value-based care with an increasing focus on treating individuals within the home. With regard to our IHEs and related services, we compete with a wide variety of local and national providers of in-home, virtual and in-person diagnostic and evaluative services. Our competitors include pure-play companies whose principal business is providing health risk assessments and similar services as well as large payors that have in-house capabilities for performing a portion of their health risk assessments. We believe our IHEs offer a more comprehensive visit than traditional health risk assessments provided by some of our competitors. Among the several pure-play companies, our primary competitor is Matrix Medical Network, another pure-play company providing IHEs and other health risk assessments nationally. With respect to large payors, most large payors use a variety of different providers to perform health risk assessments across care settings and several large payors service some or all of their total volume with their own in-house capabilities. For example, UnitedHealth has a division called OptumCare, which performs health risk assessments for a portion of the payor’s plan members. As a result, we compete with these in-house capabilities for additional volume. Although large payors, such as UnitedHealth, have more resources than we do, because we focus principally on IHEs and have dedicated significant resources to our national network, we believe we are able to provide an efficient and effective value proposition for performing health risk assessments to payor plan members.
With regard to our IHEs and related services, we also compete for, among other things, physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants and other medical and non-medical personnel. In particular, we face significant competition in attracting and retaining qualified providers for our mobile network, specifically from telehealth service providers but also across other care settings. However, we believe we remain competitive in recruiting providers given the attractiveness of working with our business.
With regard to our MSSP services, we compete with healthcare risk management providers. Our key competitors are companies that work directly with providers to enable them to successfully take risk in value-based care arrangements. Some of these competitors focus on a specific function – like analytics – while others offer more comprehensive services. We believe that our comprehensive service offering, which includes our collaborative ACO model, a suite of population health tools and services, and the ability to facilitate in-home annual wellness visits, is unique and distinguishes us from competitors. Some of our key competitors operate nationally, such as Aledade, Collaborative Health Systems, Evolent Health, Vytalize Health, and Stellar Health. Other competitors, such as Equality Health and Physicians of Southwest Washington, are more geographically focused. Competitors that focus on analytics and software include Innovaccer, Arcadia and Cedar Gate. Other key competitors include Premier, Imperium Health, Main Street Health, and Hometown Health Centers.
Our principal competitors vary considerably in type and identity by market. There have also been increasing indications of interest from non-traditional providers and others to enter the in-home diagnostic and evaluative services space and/or develop innovative technologies or business activities that could be disruptive to the healthcare risk management industry.
Sales and Marketing
For each of our primary service offerings (IHEs and ACO management services), we focus our sales and marketing initiatives on three primary dimensions of growth: (1) sales to new customers, (2) cross-sales to existing customers and (3) product expansion with existing customers. In order to successfully obtain new customers and to cross-sell solutions to existing customers, we have a strong sales team that is organized by product/service offered. 
For example, we have representatives dedicated to selling our ACO management services to new providers. We recruit providers into our collaborative ACOs by building a network around an “anchor” hospital and developing a service offering that will support the success of the hospital and its affiliated physicians, but also independent physicians. We have the capabilities necessary to effectively support providers of varying sizes and needs, from smaller rural hospitals to larger clinically integrated networks. 
In terms of product expansion with existing customers, we also have a certain number of sales representatives that are not organized by service, but are instead responsible for managing significant existing customer relationships. These representatives focus on engaging with our customers and finding ways that we can expand and grow with them. For example, these representatives may focus on increasing the volume of IHEs we perform for existing health plan customers, or they may work with existing ACO customers to see if there is different or better data available to guide such providers through the program and identify opportunities for further cost savings.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our brand, technology and inventions; to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; to defend and enforce our intellectual property and proprietary rights; and to operate without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the valid and enforceable patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties. We also obtain written invention assignment agreements from our employees, consultants, and vendors that assign to us all right, interest and title to inventions and work products developed during their employment or service engagement with us.
We rely on a combination of trademarks, service marks, copyrights and trade secrets to protect our proprietary technology and other intellectual property. As of December 31, 2022, we exclusively owned 19 trademark applications and registrations in the United States, including for the core Signify Health ® trademark. In addition, we have registered domain names for websites that we use or may use in our business. As of December 31, 2022, we had two issued U.S. patents and one pending U.S. patent application. 
Given the rapid pace of technical development, we rely upon trade secrets, confidential know-how and copyrights in software to develop and maintain our competitive position. In order to protect our innovations, we seek to control access to and distribution of our confidential and proprietary information, including our algorithms, source and object code, designs, and business processes, through physical, technical, and administrative security measures and contractual restrictions. We seek to limit access to our confidential and proprietary information on a “need to know” basis and enter into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with our employees, consultants, customers, vendors and other third parties that may receive or otherwise have access to any confidential or proprietary information. 
Government Regulation
Our operations and those of the providers we employ and contract with are subject to extensive federal, state and local governmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations require us to meet various standards relating to, among other things, billing and coding for services and reports to government payment programs; quality of equipment and services; personnel qualifications; licensure, certification, and enrollment with government programs; maintenance and interoperability of health-related and medical records; privacy and security of health-related and personal information; communication with patients and consumers; and quality assurance programs.
We expect that our industry will continue to be subject to substantial regulation and that the laws and regulations affecting our business will continue to evolve. It is difficult to predict the scope and effect of changes to laws and regulations. Our activities could be subject to investigations, audits and inquiries by various government and regulatory agencies and private members and payors with whom we contract in the future. See “Item 1A. Risk factors—Risks related to governmental regulation.”
Medicare, Medicare Advantage, Medicaid, Bundled Payment Initiatives and ACOs
Medicare
Medicare is a federal program that provides healthcare benefits to individuals age 65 or over, some disabled persons, and persons with end-stage renal disease. CMS administers the Medicare program through various contractors.
CMS has established guidelines for the coverage and reimbursement of products and procedures by Medicare. In general, to be reimbursed by Medicare, a healthcare procedure furnished to a Medicare beneficiary must be reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of an illness or injury, or to improve the functioning of a malformed body part. The methodology for determining coverage status and the amount of Medicare reimbursement varies based upon, among other factors, the setting in which a Medicare beneficiary received healthcare products and services. Medicare coverage and reimbursement is subject to statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive and prospective rate adjustments, administrative rulings, interpretations of policy, contractor determinations, and government funding restrictions, any of which may materially increase or decrease the reimbursement received by healthcare providers. Any changes in federal legislation, regulations and policy affecting the Medicare program and entities with which we contract could have a material effect on our performance.
Medicare Advantage
Under the Medicare Advantage program, also known as Medicare Part C, the federal government contracts with private health insurers to provide members with Medicare Part A, Part B and Part D benefits. In addition, Medicare Advantage Plans may choose to offer supplemental benefits and impose higher premiums and plan costs on beneficiaries. Generally, supplemental benefits must be primarily health related, a definition that may include certain nonmedical services. For beneficiaries with chronic illnesses, Medicare Advantage plans may also offer special supplemental benefits that are not primarily health related but that can improve or maintain the health or overall function of enrollees, giving plans greater flexibility to provide benefits that address social determinants of health.
Medicare Advantage plans can be structured as Health Maintenance Organizations (“HMOs”), Preferred Provider Organizations (“PPOs”) or private FFS plans. Medicare beneficiaries that choose to participate in Medicare Advantage choose which health plan through which to receive their Medicare coverage. To assist beneficiaries with 
plan selection, CMS maintains a five-star quality rating system. Using this system, CMS publishes Star Ratings based on a variety of quality, patient experience and performance measures for health plans on an annual basis. These ratings are based on data gathered from a variety of sources, including HEDIS, the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems program, the Medicare Health Outcome Survey, the Medicare Prescription Drug Program and CMS administrative data. CMS updates its rating methodology annually. Over 45% of all Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans according to CMS.
CMS generally pays health insurance plans that participate in the Medicare Advantage program on a per enrollee basis. Medicare Advantage plans submit bids to CMS for their estimated cost of Medicare Part A and B benefits for an average enrollee, and CMS compares the bids against benchmarks, which are determined based on projected average spending for beneficiaries in traditional Medicare, and which may be adjusted based on the Medicare Advantage plan’s star rating. 
Payments to Medicare Advantage plans are risk adjusted based on the health status and other characteristics of enrollees. Plans with higher average risk scores receive higher Medicare payments, since their enrollees are expected to incur higher costs. The IHEs that we provide for our health plan customers are one of several ways to support risk adjustment factor (“RAF”) scores attributable to the Medicare Advantage plan members and, thus, payment adjustments made by CMS. RAF scores are central to payment under Medicare Advantage programs in which our customers participate. CMS routinely adjusts the RAF and the monetary “coefficient” values associated with diseases that our customers manage in their member populations. 
CMS audits Medicare Advantage plans for documentation to support RAF-related payments for members through its Risk Adjustment Data Validation (“RADV”) audits. OIG also conducts audits of Medicare Advantage plans that are similar to RADV audits. Such audits may result in payment adjustments to a Medicare Advantage plan, including extrapolation across the entire contract. On February 1, 2023, CMS published a final rule that includes significant updates to the RADV audit methodology used by CMS to address overpayments to Medicare Advantage plans based on the submission of unsupported risk-adjusting diagnosis codes, which are used to determine payments under Medicare Advantage. Among other things, the final rule allows CMS to extrapolate RADV audit findings for any CMS and OIG audits beginning with payment year 2018. Extrapolation is expected to be the standard practice for RADV audits beginning with payment year 2018. CMS will not extrapolate RADV audit findings for payment years 2011 through 2017, as it originally contemplated in the proposed rule. Our health plan customers may seek to hold us liable for penalties owed to CMS for the plan’s submission of inaccurate or unsupportable RAF scores based on information provided by us. In addition, the government or a whistleblower could assert that our errors caused our health plan customers to submit false claims to CMS, which could subject us to liability under the federal False Claims Act (“FCA”) if the government could prove the elements of an FCA claim. 
Medicare Sequestration
Beginning in 2013, Medicare reimbursement has been reduced due to the Budget Control Act of 2011, which requires across-the-board spending cuts to the federal budget, also known as sequestration. These sequestration cuts include reductions in payments for Medicare and other federally funded healthcare programs. The Medicare spending cuts required by the Budget Control Act of 2011 may not be more than 2% for a fiscal year. 
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) and related legislation temporarily suspended these reductions through March 31, 2022, but extended sequestration through 2030. The sequestration adjustment was phased back in at 1% reduction from April 1, 2022 through June 30, 2022, and returned to 2% on July 1, 2022. Congress has extended Medicare sequestration through the first six months of 2032. In addition, the 
American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (“ARPA”) increased the federal budget deficit in a manner that triggers an additional sequestration mandated under the Pay As You Go Act of 2010. As a result, a further payment reduction of up to 4% was required to take effect in January 2022. However, Congress has delayed implementation of this payment reduction until 2025.
Medicaid
Medicaid programs provide medical assistance benefits to qualifying (typically low income or medically needy) persons. Medicaid programs are funded jointly by the federal government and the states and are administered by states under approved plans. Most state Medicaid program payments are made under a prospective payment system (“PPS”) or are based on negotiated payment levels. Medicaid reimbursement is often less than a healthcare provider’s cost of services. 
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education and Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “ACA”), requires states to expand Medicaid coverage to all individuals under age 65 with incomes effectively at or below 138% of the federal poverty level. However, states may opt out of the expansion without losing existing federal Medicaid funding. Some states have opted out of the Medicaid expansion. Other states use, or have applied to use, waivers granted by CMS to implement expansion, impose different eligibility or enrollment conditions, or otherwise implement programs that vary from federal standards. Some of these program changes may reduce the number of Medicaid enrollees in certain states.
Because most state governments must operate with balanced budgets and because the Medicaid program is often the state’s largest program, many states have adopted, or are considering, legislation designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures. Outside of the government response to the COVID-19 pandemic, budgetary pressures have, in recent years, resulted and likely will continue to result in decreased spending, or decreased spending growth, for Medicaid programs in many states. Many states have adopted, or are considering, legislation designed to reduce coverage, enroll Medicaid recipients in managed care programs and/or impose additional taxes on healthcare providers to help finance or expand the states’ Medicaid systems. The current presidential administration has implemented policies intended to strengthen Medicaid programs.
Federal funds under the Medicaid program may not be used to reimburse healthcare providers for treatment of certain provider-preventable conditions. Each state Medicaid program must deny payments to healthcare providers for the treatment of healthcare-acquired conditions designated by CMS as well as other provider-preventable conditions that may be designated by the state.
Congress has expanded the federal government’s involvement in fighting fraud, waste and abuse in the Medicaid program through the Medicaid Integrity Program. CMS employs Unified Program Integrity Contractors (“UPICs”) to perform post-payment audits of Medicaid claims, identify overpayments, and perform other program integrity activities. The UPICs collaborate with states and coordinate healthcare provider investigations across the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In addition, state Medicaid agencies are required to establish Medicaid Recovery Audit Contractor (“RAC”) programs. These programs vary by state in design and operation.
Accountable Care Organizations and Bundled Payment Initiatives
An ACO is a network of healthcare providers and suppliers that work together to invest in infrastructure and redesign delivery processes to attempt to achieve high quality and efficient delivery of services. Promoting accountability and coordination of care, ACOs are an alternative payment model intended to produce savings as a result of improved quality and operational efficiency. The goals of an ACO are assessed using a set of quality 
measures and spending benchmarks. Medicare-approved ACOs that achieve performance standards established by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) are eligible to share in a portion of the amounts saved by the Medicare program. 
There are several types of ACO programs, including the MSSP and the ACO Realizing Equity, Access, and Community Health (“REACH”) model. Medicare ACOs are accountable for total Medicare Part A and Part B spending for a defined population of beneficiaries and for the quality of their care. Medicare provides ACOs with claims data for assigned beneficiaries to help ACOs coordinate care. HHS has significant discretion to determine key elements of ACO programs. Certain waivers and exceptions are available from fraud and abuse laws for ACOs. 
The MSSP, which was established by statute, is a permanent part of the Medicare program. Providers and suppliers participating in the MSSP voluntarily agree to be held accountable for the quality, cost, and experience of care of an assigned Medicare fee-for-service beneficiary population. The program has different participation options, or tracks, that allow ACOs to assume various levels of risk (one-sided or two-sided). An ACO’s participation options depend on different factors, including the past experience of the ACO and its participants in performance-based risk Medicare ACO initiatives and whether the ACO is a low- or high-revenue ACO. While CMS intends for its ACOs to eventually move to a two-sided risk model, with both downside and upside risk, it has indicated that the duration for which ACOs are permitted to stay in a one-sided model remains under consideration. CMS periodically makes policy changes affecting the MSSP, such as modifying its benchmarking methodology and providing certain new, low revenue ACOs the opportunity for advance shared savings payments in the form of advance investment payments.
The CMS Innovation Center is responsible for establishing demonstration projects and other initiatives in order to identify, develop, test and encourage the adoption of new methods of delivering and paying for healthcare that create savings under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, while improving quality of care. For example, healthcare providers participating in bundled payment initiatives agree to be responsible for the costs of services provided to Medicare patients experiencing certain medical conditions which trigger an episode of care, accepting accountability for costs and quality of care. By rewarding healthcare providers for increasing quality and reducing costs and penalizing healthcare providers if costs exceed a set amount, these models are intended to lead to higher quality, more coordinated care at a lower cost to the Medicare program. Healthcare providers may receive incentive payments or owe repayments to CMS depending on whether overall CMS spending per episode falls below or exceeds a target specified by CMS and whether quality standards are met. 
The CMS Innovation Center has implemented bundled payment models, including the Bundled Payment for Care Improvement Advanced (“BPCI-A”) initiative, which is voluntary and has been extended until December 2025. Participation in bundled payment programs is generally voluntary, but has required healthcare providers in selected geographic areas to participate in a mandatory bundled program for specified orthopedic procedures, the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (“CJR”) model, which is scheduled to run through December 2024. In addition, as of January 1, 2021, CMS began requiring certain hospitals to participate in a bundled payment initiative for end-stage renal disease treatment. A mandatory radiation oncology bundled payment model was expected to begin January 1, 2023, but CMS has indefinitely postponed its implementation. 
In a strategic report issued in 2021 and updated in 2022, the CMS Innovation Center published an outline of its strategy for the next decade, noting the need to accelerate the movement to value-based care and drive broader system transformation. By 2030, the CMS Innovation Center aims to have all fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries and most Medicaid beneficiaries in a care relationship with accountability for quality and total cost of care. CMS also indicated it will streamline its payment model portfolio and consider how to ensure broad provider participation, including by implementing more mandatory models. Moreover, several private third-party payers are 
increasingly employing alternative payment models, which may increasingly shift financial risk to healthcare providers.
Fraud and Abuse
Participation in federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, is heavily regulated by federal statute and regulation. A variety of laws govern various aspects of our business relationships and our relationships with physicians and others who either refer or may influence the referral of patients or certain business or are the recipients of such referrals. These laws include, but are not limited to, the FCA, federal Anti-Kickback Statute (“AKS”), the federal Physician Self-Referral Law (“Stark Law”), the Civil Monetary Penalties Statute, other federal civil and criminal fraud and abuse laws and similar state laws. We have carefully structured our arrangements in accordance with applicable guidance and endeavor to comply with all the fraud and abuse laws. However, there can be no assurance that regulatory authorities enforcing these laws will determine our arrangements are compliant. If any of our business transactions or arrangements are found to violate these laws, we may be subject to criminal and/or civil penalties and it may be necessary to restructure existing business arrangements. Any findings that we have violated these laws could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, reputation and stock price. Even an unsuccessful challenge to our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from and defense or settlement by us.
Federal Anti-Kickback Statute
The AKS prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made in whole or in part under federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Some court decisions have held that the statute may be violated even if only one purpose of remuneration is to induce referrals. By statute, actual knowledge of the AKS or specific intent to violate the law is not required in order to engage in prohibited conduct.
Federal criminal penalties for the violation of the AKS include imprisonment, fines and exclusion from future involvement with federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Violations of the AKS are punishable by imprisonment for up to ten years, fines of up to $100,000 per kickback or both. Larger fines can be imposed upon corporations under the provisions of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the Alternate Fines Statute. Individuals and entities convicted of violating the AKS are subject to mandatory exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs for a minimum of five years. Civil penalties for violation of the AKS include substantial civil monetary penalties per violation that are subject to annual adjustment based on updates to the consumer price index, payments of up to three times the total payments between the parties to the arrangement and suspension from future participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, any claims for items or services resulting from a violation of the AKS are considered false or fraudulent for purposes of the FCA.
The AKS includes statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors that protect certain arrangements. These exceptions and safe harbors are voluntary. Business transactions and arrangements that are structured to comply fully with an applicable safe harbor do not violate the AKS. However, transactions and arrangements that do not satisfy all elements of a relevant safe harbor do not necessarily violate the law. When an arrangement does not satisfy a safe harbor, the arrangement must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis in light of the intent of the parties and the arrangement’s potential for abuse. 
Amongst the exceptions and safe harbors to the AKS that are relevant to our business is the eligible managed care organization (“EMCO”) safe harbor. It provides protection to certain arrangements between EMCOs and first tier contractors, between first tier contractors and downstream contractors, or between two downstream contractors. 
The EMCO safe harbor is premised on the view that many managed care arrangements do not present the same risks of overutilization or increased federal healthcare program costs that can exist with certain fee-for-service payment arrangements. Key to safe harbor protection for arrangements under the EMCO safe harbor is that payments not be tied to business outside the EMCO arrangement and that the financial burden of the arrangement is not inappropriately shifted to federal healthcare programs. As noted above, failure to fully satisfy a safe harbor does not make an arrangement illegal. Instead, the arrangement must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis in light of the intent of the parties and the arrangement’s potential for abuse.
Certain of our programs involve arrangements that potentially implicate the AKS because they may involve payments intended to influence behavior relative to Medicare and other federal healthcare program beneficiaries, including risk sharing and “gainsharing” arrangements. While there is no fixed definition of a gainsharing arrangement, the term typically refers to an arrangement in which a share of cost savings for patient care attributable in part to a physician’s efforts are shared with the physician. The OIG has recognized that there are legitimate interests in enlisting physicians in efforts to reduce unnecessary costs from the healthcare system and, if appropriately structured, such gainsharing arrangements should not violate the AKS. With respect to BPCI-A, MSSP and other CMS innovation models in which we may participate, the OIG and CMS jointly issued waivers of the AKS and certain other fraud and abuse laws for arrangements that meet certain conditions. However, with respect to our non-BPCI-A Episodes of Care program and any other episode of care programs in which we may participate, there are no fraud and abuse waivers that are directly applicable. Effective in early 2021, CMS and OIG, as part of their so-called regulatory sprint to coordinated care, established new safe harbors that protect certain value-based arrangements. We continue to assess how these new safe harbors may apply to both new and existing programs. 
Stark Law
The Stark Law prohibits a physician who has a financial relationship, or who has an immediate family member who has a financial relationship, with entities providing “designated health services” (“DHS”) from referring Medicare patients to such entities for the furnishing of DHS, unless an exception applies. The Stark Law prohibits any entity providing DHS that has received a prohibited referral from presenting, or causing to be presented, a claim or billing for the services arising out of the prohibited referral. Similarly, the Stark Law prohibits an entity from “furnishing” DHS to another entity with which it has a financial relationship when that entity bills for the service. The prohibition applies regardless of the reasons for the financial relationship and the referral. Unlike the AKS, the Stark Law is a strict liability statute where unlawful intent need not be demonstrated. Although uncertainty exists, some federal agencies and some courts have taken the position that the Stark Law also applies to Medicaid.
DHS is defined to include clinical laboratory services; physical therapy services; occupational therapy services; radiology services including magnetic resonance imaging; computerized axial tomography scans; and ultrasound services; radiation therapy services and supplies; durable medical equipment and supplies; parenteral and enteral nutrients; equipment and supplies; prosthetics, orthotics and prosthetic devices and supplies; home health services; outpatient prescription drugs; inpatient and outpatient hospital services; and outpatient speech-language pathology services. The definition of DHS under the Stark Law does not include outpatient physician services. Since many services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries provided through our programs are outpatient physician services, our services do not always implicate the Stark Law referral prohibition. However, certain services we may provide, including certain diagnostic testing, may be considered DHS.
The types of financial arrangements between a physician and an entity providing DHS that trigger the self-referral prohibitions of the Stark Law are broad and include direct and indirect ownership and investment interests and compensation arrangements. 
If the Stark Law is implicated, the financial relationship must fully satisfy a Stark Law exception. If an exception is not satisfied, then the parties to the arrangement could be subject to sanctions. Sanctions for violation of the Stark Law include denial of payment for claims for services provided in violation of the prohibition, and substantial civil monetary penalties per claim submitted and exclusion from the federal healthcare programs. Failure to refund amounts received as a result of a prohibited referral on a timely basis may constitute a false or fraudulent claim and may result in civil penalties and additional penalties under the FCA. The statute also provides for a penalty for a circumvention scheme. Civil monetary penalties are adjusted annually based on updates to the consumer price index.
Certain of our programs involve arrangements that potentially implicate the Stark Law because they may involve payments between a physician and an entity providing DHS in connection with Medicare patients, including risk sharing and gainsharing arrangements. With respect to BPCI-A, MSSP and other CMS innovation models in which we may participate, the OIG and CMS jointly issued waivers of the Stark Law. In early 2021, CMS established new exceptions to the Stark Law that protect certain value-based arrangements.
The False Claims Act
The FCA is the government’s primary means of policing false claims for payment in the healthcare delivery system. The FCA imposes treble damages and per claim penalties on any “person” (including an individual, organization or company) who, among other acts:
•knowingly presents or causes to be presented to the federal government a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval; 
•knowingly makes, uses or causes to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim; 
•knowingly makes, uses or causes to be made or used a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay the government, or knowingly conceals or knowingly and improperly avoids or decreases an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government; or 
•conspires to commit the above acts. 
The federal government has used the FCA to prosecute a wide variety of alleged false claims and fraud allegedly perpetrated against Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs, including but not limited to coding errors, billing for services not rendered, the submission of false cost or other reports, billing for services at a higher payment rate than appropriate, billing under a comprehensive code as well as under one or more component codes included in the comprehensive code, billing for care that is not considered medically necessary and intentionally reporting of inaccurate risk-adjusted diagnostic codes to Medicare Advantage plans. Claims that result from a violation of the AKS are deemed by statute to be false for purposes of the FCA. Some courts have held that filing claims or failing to refund amounts collected in violation of the Stark Law can form the basis for liability under the FCA. 
In addition, false claims under the FCA include the knowing and improper failure to report and refund amounts owed to the government in a timely manner following proper identification of an overpayment. Under these provisions, within 60 days of identifying and quantifying an overpayment, a healthcare provider is required to notify CMS or the Medicare Administrative Contractor of the overpayment and the reason for it and return the overpayment. An overpayment impermissibly retained could subject us to liability under the FCA, exclusion from federal healthcare programs and penalties under the federal Civil Monetary Penalty statute. 
The penalties for a violation of the FCA include up to three times the amount of damages caused by each false claim, which can be as much as the amounts received directly or indirectly from the government for each such false claim, plus substantial civil monetary penalties for each separate false claim. The civil monetary penalties are adjusted annually based on updates to the consumer price index. Beyond civil enforcement under the FCA, the federal government can use several criminal statutes to prosecute individuals or entities that are alleged to have submitted false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government. 
State fraud and abuse laws
Some states have laws prohibiting physicians and other healthcare providers from having financial interests in or with healthcare facilities to which they refer patients. A number of states also have laws similar to or stricter than the AKS that may affect our ability to enter into financial relationships with certain entities or individuals. Some state anti-kickback laws also include civil and criminal penalties. Some of these laws include exemptions that may be applicable to our business. Others, however, may not include explicit exemption for certain aspects of our business. We carefully structure our arrangements to comply with applicable state fraud and abuse laws.
Similarly, states have beneficiary inducement prohibitions and consumer protection laws that may be triggered by the offering of inducements, incentives and other forms of remuneration to patients and prospective patients. Violations range from civil to criminal and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
In addition, various states in which we operate have adopted their own analogs of the FCA. States are becoming increasingly active in using their false claims laws to police alleged healthcare fraud, particularly with regard to Medicaid fee-for-service and Managed Medicaid programs
Civil Monetary Penalties Statute
The Civil Monetary Penalties Statute authorizes the imposition of civil monetary penalties, assessments and exclusion against an individual or entity based on a variety of prohibited conduct, including, but not limited to:
•presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to Medicare or other federal healthcare programs that the individual or entity knows or should know are for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent; 
•offering remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid program beneficiary that the individual or entity knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order or receive healthcare items or services from a particular healthcare provider; 
•arranging contracts with an entity or individual excluded from participation in the federal healthcare programs; 
•violating the AKS; 
•being involved in a hospital or a critical access hospital knowingly making a payment, directly or indirectly, to a physician as an inducement to reduce or limit medically necessary services provided with respect to Medicare or Medicaid patients who are under the direct care of the physician; 
•making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim for payment for items and services furnished under a federal healthcare program; 
•making or causing to be made any false statement, omission or misrepresentation of a material fact in any application, bid or contract to participate or enroll as a provider of healthcare services or a supplier under a federal healthcare program, including Medicare Advantage Organizations (“MAOs”) and entities that apply to participate as healthcare providers of services or suppliers in such managed care organizations and such plans; and 
•failing to report and return an overpayment owed to the federal government. 
Substantial civil monetary penalties may be imposed under the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Statute and may vary depending on the underlying violation. In addition, an assessment of not more than three times the total amount claimed for each item or service may apply and a violator may be subject to exclusion from federal healthcare programs.
Certain of our programs involve arrangements that potentially implicate aspects of the Civil Monetary Penalties Statute because they may involve payments intended to influence behavior of physicians relative to Medicare and other federal healthcare program beneficiaries, including risk sharing and gainsharing arrangements. Such arrangements could be viewed as implicating the AKS or the prohibition against hospitals making payments to physicians to reduce or limit medically necessary services to Medicare or Medicaid patients under their direct care. With respect to BPCI-A, MSSP and other CMS innovation models in which we may participate, the OIG and CMS jointly issued waivers of the Civil Monetary Penalties Statute for arrangements meeting certain conditions. 
There are, however, new exceptions to the Civil Monetary Penalties Statue that protect certain value-based arrangements. We continue to assess how these new exceptions and safe harbors may apply to both new and existing programs. 
We could be exposed to a wide range of other allegations involving the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Statute. We perform checks on our providers, healthcare provider organizations, and certain affiliates and vendors using government databases to confirm that these individuals have not been excluded from federal programs. However, should an individual or entity become excluded and we fail to detect it, a federal agency could require us to refund amounts attributable to all claims or services performed by or sufficiently linked to an excluded individual or entity. Thus, we cannot foreclose the possibility that we will face allegations subject to the Civil Monetary Penalty Statute with the potential for a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
State corporate practice of medicine and fee splitting laws
We are subject to various state laws, regulations and legal and administrative decisions that restrict the corporate practice of medicine and fee splitting. The corporate practice of medicine doctrine generally prohibits corporate entities from practicing medicine or employing physicians (and, in some cases, other providers) to provide professional medical services. The doctrine reflects a variety of historical public policy concerns, including concerns that (a) allowing corporations to practice medicine or employ physicians will result in the commercialization of the practice of medicine, (b) a corporation’s obligation to its shareholders may not align with a physician’s obligation to his/her patients and (c) employment of a physician by a corporation may interfere with the physician’s independent medical judgment. While many states have some form of the corporate practice of medicine doctrine, the scope and enforcement varies widely. In those states where the doctrine exists, it typically arises from the state’s medical practice act, but has been shaped over the years by state statutes, regulations, court decisions, attorney general opinions and actions by state medical licensing boards. In addition, some states may have corporate practice restrictions that apply to other providers, such as nurse practitioners and physician assistants.
Historically, the medical profession has recognized an ethical prohibition against physicians (and often other providers) paying professional peers and others for referrals and fee splitting. Fee splitting generally occurs when a physician splits part of the professional fee earned from treating a referred patient with the source of the referral. Among the public policy harms that have been cited in support of fee splitting prohibitions are (a) unnecessary medical services, and (b) incompetent specialists. In response to these legitimate concerns, many states have adopted prohibitions against fee splitting. States have taken a variety of legislative approaches to fee splitting, from near complete bans, to bans with various exceptions, to no prohibition at all. Some of the prohibitions, have a broad reach and also prohibit otherwise legitimate business relationships with entities that are not healthcare providers, such as billing agencies or management companies.
Legal structures have been developed to comply with various state corporate practice of medicine and fee splitting laws. The “captive” or “friendly” professional corporation model allows a legal entity (typically a professional corporation or professional limited liability company) whose shareholders are all physicians to employ the physicians (and other providers). The physician entity then contracts with a corporate entity referred to as a management services organization (“MSO”) to provide various management services. The physician entity is kept “friendly” through a stock transfer restriction agreement and/or other relationship between the MSO and the physician owners of the professional corporation. The fees under the management services arrangement must be carefully structured to comply with state fee splitting laws, which in some states may prohibit percentage-based fees.
Provider licensure and telehealth laws
We utilize the services of a variety of providers, including physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, pharmacists and nurses, among others. States generally require providers providing professional healthcare services, whether in person or via telehealth, to a patient residing within the state to be licensed in that state. States have established a variety of licensing and other regulatory requirements around the provision of telehealth services. These requirements vary from state to state. Many states require notification of certain material events be provided to the applicable licensing agency. We have established systems for ensuring that our providers are appropriately licensed under applicable state law and that their provision of telehealth to patients with whom we interact occurs in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in licensure actions against the providers as well as civil, criminal or administrative penalties against the providers and/or entities engaging the services of the provider.
Privacy and security
We are subject to federal and state laws and regulations that restrict the use and disclosure of certain types of individually identifiable data. These include the federal regulations promulgated under the authority of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) that require us to provide certain protections to individuals and their health information. Further all 50 states and certain territories maintain additional laws regulating the privacy and security of personally identifiable information (“PII”). The HIPAA privacy and security regulations extensively regulate the use and disclosure of protected health information (“PHI”) and require covered entities, which include healthcare providers and health plans, and their business associates to implement and maintain administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the security of such information. Additional security requirements apply to electronic PHI. These regulations also provide individuals with substantive rights with respect to their health information. 
The HIPAA privacy and security regulations also require us to enter into written agreements with our covered entity customers and our subcontractors, also known as business associates, to whom we disclose PHI. Covered entities may be subject to penalties as a result of a business associate violating HIPAA, if the business associate is 
found to be an agent of the covered entity. Business associates are also directly subject to liability under certain HIPAA privacy and security regulations and may be found liable for the violations of their agents.
HIPAA requires covered entities to notify affected individuals of breaches of unsecured PHI without unreasonable delay but no later than 60 days after discovery of the breach. If a business associate is acting as an agent of a covered entity, then the covered entity must provide the required notifications to individuals based on the time when the business associate discovered the breach. Reporting must also be made to the HHS Office for Civil Rights (“OCR”) and, for breaches of unsecured PHI involving more than 500 residents of a state or jurisdiction, to the media. Impermissible uses or disclosures of unsecured PHI are presumed to be breaches unless the covered entity or business associate establishes that there is a low probability the PHI has been compromised. Various state laws and regulations may also require us to notify affected individuals and the state regulators in the event of a data breach involving personal information without regard to the probability of the information being compromised. State laws and standard practice often provide for shorter data breach reporting timelines than required by HIPAA.
Violations of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations may result in criminal penalties and in substantial civil penalties per violation. The civil penalties are adjusted annually based on updates to the consumer price index. OCR is required to perform compliance audits and investigates HIPAA compliance in response to complaints and reports of breaches. In addition to enforcement by OCR, state attorneys general are authorized to bring civil actions seeking either injunction or damages in response to violations of HIPAA privacy and security regulations that threaten the privacy of state residents. OCR may resolve HIPAA violations through informal means, such as allowing a covered entity to implement a corrective action plan, but OCR has the discretion to move directly to impose monetary penalties and is required to impose penalties for violations resulting from willful neglect. There can be no assurance that we will not be the subject of an investigation (arising out of a reportable breach incident, audit or otherwise) alleging noncompliance with HIPAA regulations in our maintenance of PHI.
In addition to HIPAA, numerous state and federal laws and regulations govern the collection, dissemination, use, privacy, confidentiality, security, availability, integrity, creation, receipt, transmission, storage, and other processing of medical information and other types of PII. Privacy and data security statutes and regulations vary from state to state, and these laws and regulations in many cases are more restrictive than, and may not be preempted by, HIPAA and its implementing rules. These laws and regulations protect data pertaining to specific conditions, such as substance use disorder, HIV/AIDS, genetic disorders, and mental and behavioral health. Under the CARES Act Congress made significant modifications to the authorizing statute for the regulations that regulate the confidentiality of substance use disorder data, known as the “Part 2 Regulations.” The CARES Act changes significantly align the statutory requirements more closely with the HIPAA privacy rule. The law directs the Secretary of HHS to revise the Part 2 Regulations to align with the statutory changes, but the regulations have not yet been finalized.
As we look to expand our workforce into Ireland, we are also subject to international data protection regulations related to the collection, transmission, storage and use of employee data. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which became effective on May 25, 2018, imposes strict compliance obligations on the collection, use, retention, security, processing, transfer and deletion of PII and creates enhanced rights for individuals, including requirements relating to processing health and other sensitive data, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the PII relates in certain circumstances, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, providing notification of data breaches and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors that will have access to personal data. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the European Economic Area, including the United States and the United Kingdom. Entities that fail to comply with the 
requirements of the GDPR may be subject to very significant penalties, including potential fines of up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of annual global revenue.
Government regulators, privacy advocates and class action attorneys are also increasingly scrutinizing how companies collect, process, use, store, share and transmit other types of personal data. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), which went into effect on January 1, 2020, and was significantly modified by the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which became fully effective on January 1, 2023, applies broadly to information that identifies or is associated with any California household or individual, and requires that we implement several operational changes, including processes to respond to individuals’ requests regarding their personal information. The CPRA also creates a new enforcement agency to enforce the CCPA and CPRA and imposes additional requirements, including privacy risk assessments, audits and vendor contractual requirements for data sharing, license and access arrangements. The CCPA and CPRA provide for civil penalties for violations and allow private rights of action for data breaches. Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut and Utah have also passed comprehensive privacy legislation, and several other states, as well as federal lawmakers, have proposed additional consumer privacy legislation. The complex, dynamic legal landscape regarding privacy, data protection and information security creates significant compliance challenges for us, potentially restricts our ability to collect, use and disclose data, and exposes us to additional expense, and, if we cannot comply with applicable laws in a timely manner or at all, adverse publicity, harm to our reputation, and liability.
Telecommunications and telemarketing laws
Our marketing and communications activities may be subject to a variety of federal and state laws that regulate telecommunications and telemarketing activities, including the following.
The Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”) places restrictions on making certain telemarketing calls, non-telemarketing calls, faxes, and SMS text messages to consumers. Prior express consent of consumers may be required to override certain activities prohibited under the TCPA. The scope and interpretation of the TCPA, and other laws that are or may be applicable to making calls and delivering SMS text messages to consumers, are continuously evolving and developing. TCPA violations may be subject to penalties of $500 per violation and $1,500 for each willful or knowing violation. Recent expansion of the law through the Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence (“TRACED”) Act expanded the authority of the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) to impose civil penalties of up to $10,000 per call for intentional violations of federal robocall laws and increased the time period that the FCC can take action against those who intentionally violate federal law to four years. This penalty is in addition to other penalties for TCPA violations.
The CAN-SPAM Act regulates commercial email messages. It prohibits the inclusion of deceptive or misleading information and subject headings and requires identifying information such as a return address in email messages. The CAN-SPAM Act also specifies penalties for the transmission of commercial email messages that do not comply with certain requirements, such as providing an opt-out mechanism for stopping future emails from senders.
While we strive to adhere to strict policies and procedures that comply with such laws and regulations, our interpretation of these laws and regulations or our implementation of our policies and procedures may be subjected to challenge through class action lawsuits or regulatory actions which could subject us to penalties and other consequences for noncompliance. Determination by a court or regulatory agency that our marketing and communications practices violate communications privacy laws could subject us to civil penalties and could require us to change some portions of our business. Even an unsuccessful challenge to our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from and defense or settlement by us.
Healthcare reform
The healthcare industry is subject to changing political, regulatory, and other influences, along with various scientific and technological innovations. In recent years, the U.S. Congress and certain state legislatures have passed and implemented a large number of laws and regulations intended to effect significant change within the U.S. healthcare system, including the ACA. The ACA affects how healthcare services are covered, delivered, and reimbursed through expanded health insurance coverage, reduced growth in Medicare program spending, and the establishment of programs that tie reimbursement to quality and integration. A number of ACA provisions impacted and continue to impact our business and operations. More broadly, we are unable to predict how employers, private payors or persons buying insurance might react to healthcare reform legislation, whether already enacted or enacted in the future.
The ACA has been, and continues to be, subject to legislative and regulatory changes and court challenges. For example, effective January 1, 2019, the financial penalty associated with the ACA’s individual mandate that most individuals enroll in a qualifying health insurance plan was effectively eliminated. However, some states have imposed individual health insurance mandates, and other states have explored or offer public health insurance options. To increase access to health insurance during the COVID-19 pandemic, the ARPA enhanced subsidies for individuals eligible to purchase coverage through the ACA marketplaces. The Inflation Reduction Act, enacted in August 2022, extends these enhanced subsidies through 2025. In addition, in a September 2021 final rule, HHS extended the annual open enrollment period for coverage through federal marketplaces and granted state exchanges flexibility to lengthen their open enrollment periods. These changes and initiatives may impact the number of individuals that elect to obtain public or private health insurance or the scope of such coverage, if purchased, which may indirectly affect our business.
There is uncertainty regarding the ongoing net effect of the ACA due to the potential for continued changes to the law’s implementation and its interpretation by government agencies and courts. There is also uncertainty regarding the potential impact of other health reform efforts at the federal and state levels. For example, some members of Congress have proposed measures that would expand government-sponsored health insurance coverage, including single-payor models. The CMS Innovation Center has noted the need to accelerate the movement to value-based care and drive broader system transformation and indicated that it intends to streamline its payment model portfolio. Legislative and executive branch efforts related to healthcare reform could result in increased prices for consumers purchasing health insurance coverage, or destabilize insurance markets, among other effects. Private third-party payers, large employer groups and their affiliates and other healthcare industry participants may introduce other additional financial or delivery system reforms.
While there may be significant changes to the healthcare environment in the future, the specific changes and their timing are not yet apparent. As a result, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the current healthcare marketplace and the future of healthcare reform. Future elections may create conditions for Congress to adopt new federal coverage programs that may disrupt our current revenue streams both from payors and other government programs.
It is possible that future legislative or regulatory changes could lower our reimbursement rates, increase our expenses, require us to modify certain aspects of our operations, or otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.
Worker Classification
Our business, like many in the healthcare industry, is subject to an uncertain and challenging legal environment with respect to the application of various worker classification laws to the many healthcare providers 
with whom we work. Various worker classification laws exist at the federal, state and local levels. The tests governing whether a healthcare provider should be deemed an independent contractor or an employee are typically highly fact sensitive and vary by the applicable governing law. In addition, these laws are subject to varying interpretations and periodic changes. If healthcare providers or others with whom we work are deemed to be misclassified under applicable law, then significant sanctions could apply.
At the federal level, the United States Department of Labor (the “DOL”) issued a rule in January 2021 regarding the classification of workers under the Fair Labor Standards Act (with an effective date of March 2021). The rule identified two of five “economic reality factors” as being “core factors” that should be initially considered alone when evaluating classification of workers as independent contractors or employees. If those two factors – nature and degree of control over the work and the worker’s opportunity for profit or loss – pointed toward a certain classification, then such classification was deemed likely to be the accurate classification. The rule identified three other factors to be considered – amount of skill required for the work, degree of permanence of the working relationship, and whether the work performed was part of an integrated unit of production – but such factors were deemed less probative of the proper classification and as highly unlikely to overrule a classification indicated by the two core factors. In October 2022, the DOL issued a proposed rule under which all of the factors are regarded as equal, investment in the work is regarded as an additional standalone factor, and an emphasis is placed on whether the work being performed is integral to the purported employer’s business. If adopted, this newly proposed rule would render classification of workers as employees by the DOL to be more likely. The impact of any change in the DOL rule will be felt both federally, and in any jurisdiction that follows the Federal Labor Standards Act’s (“FLSA”) “economic realities” test. The Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) focuses on three primary categories of factors to determine whether a worker is properly classified: behavioral control (including type and degree of instruction given and training provided); financial control (including investment in tools and office space, payment of expenses, whether pay is by hour or job, and the worker’s opportunity for profit or loss); and the type of relationship (including whether there is a written contract, whether benefits are provided, and whether services performed by the worker are a key activity of the business). 
At the state level, worker classification is also evaluated under state laws and regulations with respect to a number of issues including state wage and hour laws and unemployment taxes. As generally applied, the “ABC” test presumptively considers all workers to be employees, and permits workers to be classified as independent contractors only if the hiring business demonstrates that the worker in question satisfies each of the three conditions establishing independent contractor status relating to control, usual course of conduct of the business and customary conduct by the worker. Numerous states such as California and Massachusetts have adopted the “ABC” test, or a modified version of it, under which classification of workers as independent contractors is far less likely to be deemed lawful. Notably, states using the “ABC” test will be unaffected by any change in the DOL rule, as those tests are even more stringent that the proposed rule. 
Other regulations
Our operations are subject to various state hazardous waste and non-hazardous medical waste disposal laws. These laws do not classify as hazardous most of the waste produced from medical services. Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations require employers to provide workers who are occupationally subject to blood or other potentially infectious materials with prescribed protections. These regulatory requirements require employers to make a determination as to which employees may be exposed to blood or other potentially infectious materials and to have in effect a written exposure control plan. In addition, employers are required to provide or employ hepatitis B vaccinations, personal protective equipment and other safety devices, infection control training, post-exposure evaluation and follow-up, waste disposal techniques and procedures and work practice controls. Employers are also required to comply with various record-keeping requirements.
Federal and state law also governs the storage, handling and dispensing of controlled substances. For example, the Prescription Drug Marketing Act governs the distribution of drug samples. Any allegations or findings that we or our provider partners have violated any of these laws or regulations could result in criminal or civil liability, including significant monetary fines, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
Employees and Human Capital
Our success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified personnel. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 2,200 employees, of which approximately 2,100 employees were full time. Our employees are based at our offices located in Dallas, TX, New York, NY, Rapid City, SD, Deerfield, FL, Oklahoma City, OK, and Galway, Ireland or are full-time remote. We also had over 10,000 credentialed physicians and nurse practitioners and other providers within our mobile network that we contract with on an independent contractor basis, either directly or through professional affiliates. These credentialed physicians and nurse practitioners form a mobile network of practitioners located all over the country. We consider our relationship with our independent contractors and employees to be positive. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or party to a collective bargaining agreement.
We strive to foster an innovative culture as we further build our business and expand our products and services, and we view our human capital-related initiatives as an ongoing priority. Such initiatives include: (i) implementing a robust talent acquisition approach, including competitive pay and benefits, (ii) implementing our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion initiative and Spirit of Signify programs to promote diversity and foster a sense of connection and community throughout our Company, (iii) offering an array of learning and development opportunities, including live programs and online courses through our learning management system and (iv) conducting annual employee engagement surveys and developing action plans based on the survey outcomes.
