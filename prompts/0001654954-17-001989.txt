  ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.
  
  Company Overview
  
 Issuer Direct Corporation (Issuer Direct Corporation and its subsidiaries are hereinafter collectively referred to as “Issuer Direct”, the “Company”, “We” or “Our” unless otherwise noted). We are a Delaware corporation formed in October 1988 under the name Docucon Incorporated. In December 2007, we changed our name to Issuer Direct Corporation. Our corporate offices are located at 500 Perimeter Park Drive, Suite D, Morrisville, North Carolina, 27560.
 Businesses
  
 Issuer Direct is a market leader and innovator of  disclosure management solutions, shareholder communications tools and cloud–based compliance technologies. We alleviate the complexity of maintaining compliance with our integrated portfolio of products and services that enhance companies' ability to efficiently produce and distribute their financial and business communications both online and in print.  The Company’s core technology, Platform id (formerly our Disclosure Management System, or DMS) – is a secure cloud-based communications and compliance system for corporate issuers, mutual funds, and compliance professionals.
 
We work with a diverse client base in the financial services industry, including brokerage firms, banks and mutual funds.  We also sell products and services to corporate issuers, professional firms, such as investor relations and public relations, and the accounting and the legal communities. Corporate issuers and their constituents utilize our cloud-based platforms and related services from document creation all the way to dissemination to regulatory bodies, platforms and shareholders.

Disclosure Management
 
Our disclosure business consists of our traditional document conversion, typesetting and pre-press design services, XBRL tagging services, and the issuance of securities as it relates to our stock transfer business. These services represent our disclosure offerings that are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
A portion of our disclosure business also comes from strategic relationships, where we manage the compliance functions for our partners’ clients. Since we do not have the relationship with the end client, it is difficult to predict the growth from this business. We have seen some partner client attrition in the smaller cap space, due to significant pricing pressure.
 
Shareholder Communications
 
Our shareholder communications offerings are centered around annual and quarterly earnings events of a public company, which includes our press release distribution, investor outreach and engagement services, webcast teleconference services, investor hotline and our legacy proxy and printing services. Many of these services are marketed and bundled under annual agreements. Like our disclosure business, our communications offerings help make up our proprietary cloud-based platform. This platform has become a significant competitive advantage when competing in the corporate issuer marketplace.
 Press Release Distribution
 
Our press release platform, Accesswire, is a cost-effective FD (Fair Disclosure) news dissemination service. We acquired the business on October 29, 2014.  Accesswire is dependent upon several key partners for news distribution, some of which are also partners that we rely on for other shareholder communications services. A disruption in any of these partnerships could have an adverse impact on our business.
 
The Accesswire business focuses on press release distribution for both private and publicly held companies. We anticipate the press release business to be an area where we will continue to add new clients throughout 2017 and beyond, and as such, we will continue to brand our press release offerings under the name Accesswire, which we believe will solidify our market position in the newswire business.
 
 Investor Outreach and Engagement
 
Our investor outreach and engagement offering, formerly known as the Annual Report Service ("ARS"), now known as the Investor Network, was acquired from PrecisionIR ("PIR"). The ARS business has existed for over 20 years primarily as a physical hard copy delivery service of annual reports and prospectuses globally for tens of thousands of customers. As part of our integration with PrecisionIR during 2014, we updated these legacy systems and integrated them into our platform. We continue to operate a portion of this legacy system and continue to migrate the install base over to Investor Network, which is a digital platform and outreach engagement dataset. Portions of this legacy system are still operational, specifically for those who opt to take advantage of physical delivery of material.
 Webcasting – Teleconference
 
There are over 5,000 companies in North America conducting earnings events that include teleconference, webcast or both as part of their events. Our platform incorporates each element of the earnings event including earnings announcement, earnings press release, and SEC Form 8-K filings. There are a handful of our competitors that can offer this today, however, we believe our real-time event setup and integrated approach offers a more effective way to manage the process as well as attract an audience of investors. Additionally, all webcasts and teleconferences are broadcast live on our Investor Network properties, which allows our clients to reach a broader audience.
 
We currently market and sell our webcasting platforms and teleconference systems in North America, United Kingdom, Sweden and Germany, the current markets in which we have clients subscribing to our platforms.
 
Investor Hotline
 
Our Investor Hotline platform is an add-on product within our shareholder communications business. A good percentage of our clients using this service are Fortune 500 companies, which utilize our platform to extend their corporate investor relations systems to and with our shareholder delivery platform. This system delivers notifications and documents to shareholders, institutions and to industry partners, such as annual and quarterly reports, earnings data, transcripts and other unique content from our issuer clients.
Proxy – Printing and Voting
 
Our proxy business is marketed as a fully integrated, real-time voting platform for our corporate issuers and their shareholders of record. This platform is utilized for every annual meeting and or special meeting we manage for our client base and offers both full-set mailing and notice of internet availability options.

Platform and Technology
 
As the Company continues its transition to a cloud-based subscription business, we expect the platform and technology portion of our business to continue to expand over the next several years. Leading this transition are product subscriptions from each of our core businesses, disclosure management and shareholder communications.
 
In disclosure management, Blueprint is our cloud-based document conversion, editing and filing platform for corporate issuers seeking to insource the document drafting, editing and filing processes. Blueprint is available in both a secure public cloud within the Company’s disclosure management system, as well as in a private cloud for corporations, mutual funds and the legal community looking to further enhance their internal document process. Our belief is that once fully marketed and as Blueprint sales begin to ramp, we will see a negative impact on our legacy disclosure services business in the future. However, the margins associated with our subscription business compared to our services business are higher and align with our long-term strategy, as such we believe Blueprint will have a positive impact on our net income in the future.
 
In our shareholder communications business we have Classify – our buy-side, sell-side and media targeting database and intelligence platform. This new subscription-based platform is centered around both our shareholder communications and news distribution businesses. We believe our data-set will be an attractive option for both investor relations and public relations firms and for corporate issuers looking for an alternative to current products in the market, based on price and flexibility, as well as data quality and quantity. Because this is a new offering for Issuer Direct, which will complement other products and services, we anticipate Classify will increase our average revenue per user based on its competitive cloud licensing options.
 
Additionally, our product roadmap includes further development of both our Investor Network and Classify products that we will continue to commercialize and bring to market during the first half of 2017. These two new cloud-based products will be a key component of our communications technology business. We expect the proprietary data-set to generate revenues from the corporate issuers initially then to the investment community thereafter. The Investor Network has replaced the ARS and Company Spotlight brands as we continue to transition this business from hard copy to digital delivery and real-time engagement. This transition continued during 2016, and will continue for the beginning part of 2017, as further clients transition from our legacy ARS to our new digital platforms.

In the teleconference and webcasting space we are continuing to spend time developing and integrating our current systems and processes with our platform and partners. The earnings event business is a highly competitive space with the majority of the business being driven from practitioners in the investor and communications firms. During the end of 2016, we created an application protocol interface (API) for the webcast marketplace, and will begin partnering with publishers, and other platforms to license our datasets, which we believe will further increase our brand awareness. This API license will allow publishers to query single or multiple companies' current and past earnings calls and present those on their platforms. We believe this will increase the demand for our webcasting services.

  Our Strategy
  
 We strive to improve the way businesses collect, manage, communicate, report and analyze their data. Our overall strategy includes:
  
  Expansion of Current Customers
  
 We expect to continue to see demand for our products within our client base. Migrating client contracts over to our subscription-based platforms will naturally help align the Company’s recurring revenues and long-term strategies. Additionally, as part of our client expansion efforts, we are committed to working beyond the single point of contact and into the entire C suite (CEO, CFO, IRO, Corporate Secretary, etc.).
 Focus on Organic Growth
  
 Our primary growth strategy continues to be selling our subscription-based platforms via Platform id to new clients under our cloud-based arrangement, whereas in the past we were inclined to sell single solutions and not subscriptions, in highly commoditized businesses, that resulted in significant pricing pressures.
 New Offerings
  
 During 2017 and going forward, we will continue to innovate, improve and build new applications into and with our platform; with the ultimate objective of developing applications in combination, that are not offered by our competitors. As a company focused on technology offerings, we understand the importance of advancements and fully appreciate the risks and consequences of losing our position as a market leader- a very common mistake many technology companies have made. The pursuit of technological innovation is and has been a part of our overall strategy as an organization over the last several years.
  
 During 2017 we will bring to market several new products and platforms targeted at both our current install base as well as new clients. Many of these will be evident in our Investor Network brands and platforms – where we are reinventing the destination for both the professional and retail investors.
 
 For example, we are seeing significant opportunities as a result of the Securities and Exchange Commission's new rule, Regulation A+. Regulation A+ offers us the opportunity to build, market and solidify our platform as a viable option to private companies seeking to raise capital under this rule and/or go public via this new regulation compared to a traditional initial public offering. Specifically, we believe our current technology and platforms as well as enhancements currently being made to our platforms may allow us to establish relationships much earlier in the life cycle of a business as it contemplates going public.  A typical Regulation A+ offering will require substantial support in terms of processing subscription agreements and other offering coordination.   We believe these increased needs of issuers will fit well with our Blueprint, Classify, Accesswire and stock transfer product bundles and potentially create higher revenues per issuer than we achieved in 2016. We intend to create and release certain platform API's during the first half of 2017 that will hopefully give us a competitive advantage in the Regulations A+ space.
  
  Acquisition Strategy
  
 We will continue to evaluate complimentary verticals and systems that we can integrate well into our current platforms. These opportunities need to be accretive and consistent with what the Company has done in the past. We will continue to maintain our product and technology focus, so it is highly likely we will look for acquisitions in areas we currently have revenues, that we refer to as "bolt on". In these transactions we will tend to look for key people, technologies, and long-term clients that will further enhance our overall market position.

  Sales and Marketing
  
 During 2017, we will continue to strengthen our brands in the market, by working aggressively to expand our new client footprint and continue to cross sell to increase average revenue per user. Our platform, systems and operations are built to handle growth – so with little capital or operational expense we can leverage this growth to produce further bottom line profits and cash flows.
 Sales
  
 Our global sales organization is responsible for generating new customer opportunities and expanding our current customers. We ended 2016 with a multi-tier organization, made up of Strategic Account Managers and Account Executives. We believe this structured approach is the most efficient and highly impactful way to reach new clients and also grow our current install base. The total compensation packages for these teams are heavily weighted with commission compensation and base salary to incent sales.  All members of the team have sales quotas. At the end of December 31, 2016, we employed 14 full-time equivalent sales personnel.
  
 We are on track to continue to expand our sales headcount during 2017 both in our current markets and also in verticals or countries where we have not typically had a sales presence. However, we expect a majority of the increase to be in our Accesswire business as well as in our cloud-based subscription products.
  
 Additionally, our executive team plays a critical role in our sales process, assisting the organization and clients with new offerings, cross selling opportunities and channel development; because our organization is still relatively small, we benefit from this approach and believe this is key to our future success.
  
  Marketing
  
 Our marketing organization has also undergone reorganization between our businesses; our newly created marketing and business development team now manages both business-to-business and business-to-consumer marketing efforts. This alignment was necessary, as we get ready to release the rebranded Annual Report Service and Company Spotlight products into and with the new Investor Network. This organization is also responsible for collaborating with our sales teams on product marketing, outbound digital marketing and all social media efforts of our entire brand. 
 Technology
  
 We will continue to make investments in our technology, as we transition our business from a historically service-oriented business to a cloud-based subscription organization. In all of our offerings, quality, support, and scalability as well as the need to preserve the confidential content of our clients is of utmost importance and part of our core values.
 Industry Overview
  
 Our industry benefits from increased regulatory requirements and the need for platforms and systems to manage these new regulations. Additionally, the industry along with cloud-based technologies have matured considerably over the past several years, whereby corporate issuers and communication professionals are seeking platforms and systems to do some, if not all the work themselves. We are uniquely positioned in this new environment to benefit from software licensing and further advancements of Platform id.
  
 The business services industry as it relates to compliance and communications is highly fragmented, with hundreds of independent service companies that provide a range of financial reporting, document management services and with a wide range of printing and technology software providers. The demands for many of our services historically have been cyclical and reliant on capital market activity. During 2016, we spent a considerable amount of time growing several new service offerings beyond our traditional compliance reporting and transaction services business. These new offerings will afford us the ability to reduce our revenue seasonality and provide a new baseline of recurring annualized contracts under our new subscription-based business.
  
  Competition
  
 Despite some consolidation in recent years, the industry remains both highly fragmented and extremely competitive. The success of our products and services are generally based on price, quality and the ability to service client demands. Management has been focused on offsetting these risks relating to competition as well as the seasonality by introducing its cloud-based subscription platforms, with significantly higher margins, clear competitive advantages and scalability to withstand market and pricing pressures.
  
 We also review our operations on a regular basis to balance growth with opportunities to maximize efficiencies and support our long-term strategic goals. We believe by blending our workflow technologies with our legacy service offerings we are able to offer a comprehensive set of products and solutions to each of our clients that most competitors cannot offer today.

 We believe we are positioned to be the public company platform of choice as a cost-effective alternative to both small regional providers and global providers. We also believe we benefit from our location in North Carolina, as we do not experience significant competition for sales, customer service, or production personnel.
  
  Customers
  
 Our customers include a wide variety of issuers, mutual funds, law firms, brokerage firms, banks, individuals, and other institutions. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we did work for approximately 2900 clients on our Accesswire platform and 1200 clients through our other products and services.  We did not have any customers during the year ended December 31, 2016 that accounted for more than 10% of our revenue and no customer represented more than 10% of our year end accounts receivable balance. 
 Employees
  
 As of December 31, 2016, we employed sixty full-time employees as compared to fifty-three full-time employees at December 31, 2015, none of which are represented by a union. Our employees work in our corporate offices in North Carolina, and in satellite locations throughout North America and the United Kingdom. 
 Facilities
  
 Our headquarters are located in Morrisville, North Carolina. In October 2015, we agreed to an extension on our current lease to extend the maturity through October 2019. Our current office includes 16,059 square feet of office space. We believe we have sufficient space to sustain our growth through 2019. Additionally, we also have a shared office facility in London, England.   
 Insurance
  
 We maintain both a general business liability policy and an errors and omissions policy in excess of $5,000,000 specific to our industry and operations. We believe that our insurance policies provide adequate coverage for all reasonable risks associated with operating our business. Additionally, we maintain a Directors and Officers insurance policy, which is standard for our industry and size. We also maintain key man life insurance on our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer, and one other key individual.
 Regulations
  
 The securities and financial services industries generally are subject to regulation in the United States and elsewhere. Regulatory policies in the United States and the rest of the world are tasked with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and financial markets with protecting the interests of both issuers and shareholders.
  
 In the United States, corporate issuers are subject to regulation under both federal and state laws, which often require public disclosure and regulatory filings. At the federal level, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regulates the securities industry, along with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, formally known as NASD, and NYSE market regulations, various stock exchanges, and other self-regulatory organizations (“SRO”).
  
 In the European Union (EU), the securities and reporting authorities tend to be based on exchanges as well as individual country disclosure requirements. We currently work with our stock exchange partners to deliver our solutions. We believe this is the best approach as this market is highly complex and divided in comparison to our North American markets.
  
 We operate our filing agent business and transfer agent business under the direct supervision and regulations of the SEC.
  
 Our transfer agency business, Direct Transfer, LLC, is subject to certain regulations, which are governed, without limitation by the SEC, with respect to registration with the SEC, annual reporting, examination, internal controls, tax reporting and escheatment services. Our transfer agency is approved to handle the securities of NYSE, NASDAQ and the Over the Counter listed securities; as well we select issuers traded on TSX.
  
 Our mission is to assist corporate issuers with these regulations, communication and compliance of rules imposed by regulatory bodies. The majority of our business involves the distribution of content, either electronically or paper, to governing bodies and shareholders alike. We are licensed under these regulations to disseminate, communicate and or solicit on behalf of our clients, the issuers.
