The following information is qualified in its entirety by and should be read together with the more detailed information and audited financial statements, including the related notes, contained or incorporated by reference in this report.



General



We operate in the fragrance business and manufacture, market and distribute a wide array of fragrance and fragrance related products. We manage our business in two segments, European based operations and United States based operations. Certain prestige fragrance products are produced and marketed by our European operations through our 27% owned subsidiary in Paris, Interparfums SA, which is also a publicly traded company as 73% of Interparfums SA shares trade on the NYSE Euronext.



Our business is not capital intensive, and it is important to note that we do not own manufacturing facilities. We act as a general contractor and source our needed components from our suppliers. These components are received at one of our distribution centers and then, based upon production needs, the components are sent to one of several third party fillers which manufacture the finished product for us and deliver them to one of our distribution centers.



Our fragrance products focus on prestige brands, each with a devoted following. By concentrating in markets where the brands are best known, we have had many successful product launches. We typically launch new fragrance families for our brands every year or two, and more frequently seasonal and limited edition fragrances are introduced as well.




1







The creation and marketing of each product family is intimately linked with the brand’s name, its past and present positioning, customer base and, more generally, the prevailing market atmosphere. Accordingly, we generally study the market for each proposed family of fragrance products for almost a full year before we introduce any new product into the market. This study is intended to define the general position of the fragrance family and more particularly its scent, bottle, packaging and appeal to the buyer. In our opinion, the unity of these four elements of the marketing mix makes for a successful product.



As with any business, many aspects of our operations are subject to influences outside our control. We believe we have a strong brand portfolio with global reach and potential. As part of our strategy, we plan to continue to make investments behind fast-growing markets and channels to grow market share. We discuss in greater detail risk factors relating to our business in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, and the reports that we file from time to time with the SEC.



European Operations



We produce and distribute our fragrance products primarily under license agreements with brand owners, and fragrance product sales through our European operations represented approximately 78% of net sales for 2020. We have built a portfolio of prestige brands, which include Boucheron, Coach, Jimmy Choo, Karl Lagerfeld, Kate Spade New York, Lanvin, Moncler, Montblanc, Paul Smith, Repetto, Rochas, S.T. Dupont and Van Cleef & Arpels, whose products are distributed in over 120 countries around the world.
United States Operations



Prestige brand fragrance products are also produced and marketed through our United States operations, and represented approximately 22% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020. These fragrance products are sold under trademarks owned by us or pursuant to license or other agreements with the owners of brands, which include Abercrombie & Fitch, Anna Sui, bebe, Dunhill, French Connection, Graff, GUESS, Hollister, MCM and Oscar de la Renta.
Recent Developments



Anna Sui Corp.



In January 2021, we renewed our license agreement with Anna Sui Corp. for the creation, development and distribution of fragrance products through December 31, 2026, without any material changes in terms and conditions. Our initial 10-year license agreement with Anna Sui Corp. was signed in 2011. The renewal agreement also allows for an additional 5-year term through 2031 at the option of the Company.
Building Acquisition - Future Headquarters in Paris



In December 2020, our majority owned Paris-based subsidiary, Interparfums SA, signed a purchase contract, subject to certain conditions, to acquire an office building complex for its exclusive use as its future headquarters located in the heart of Paris. In order to maintain our current cash position, it is expected that approximately 90% of the €125 million ($153 million) purchase price, excluding taxes and related expenses, will be financed by a bank loan. The transaction is expected to be completed in the spring of this year with the move planned for the end of 2021 or the beginning of 2022.



This acquisition is a unique opportunity with benefits to be realized over the long-term. Owning our corporate headquarters in a very prestigious part of Paris, and customizing the complex for our European operations, will enhance our reputation, provide an exceptional work environment, as well as a welcoming and productive atmosphere for our suppliers, distributors and licensors.

Origines-Parfums



In June 2020, the Company through its 73% owned subsidiary, Interparfums SA, and Divabox SAS (“Divabox”), owner of the Origines-parfums e-commerce platform for beauty products, signed a strategic agreement and equity investment pursuant to which we acquired a 25% of Divabox capital for $14.0 million, through a capital increase. In connection with the acquisition, the Company entered into a $13.4 million term loan, which has been amended such that the loan was repaid in full in February 2021. As a website of reference for all selective fragrance brands, Origines-parfums is a key French player in the online beauty market recognized for its customer relationship expertise. This agreement should enhance the introduction of dedicated fragrance lines and products designed to address a specific consumer demand for this distribution channel and accelerate our digital development.

Fragrance Portfolio



Abercrombie & Fitch — In 2014, we entered into a worldwide license to create, produce and distribute new fragrances and fragrance related products under the Abercrombie & Fitch brand name. We distribute these fragrances internationally in specialty stores, high-end department stores and duty free shops, and in the U.S., in duty free shops and in select Abercrombie & Fitch retail stores. Our initial men’s scent, First Instinct was launched in 2016 followed by a women’s version in 2017. During 2018 and early 2019, we introduced several First Instinct brand extensions. In the spring of 2019, we unveiled a new fragrance family for Abercrombie & Fitch, Authentic, for men and women, and in 2020, we released Authentic Night. In April 2021, we have Naturally Fierce Perfume ready for international distribution and in the second half of 2021, we have a new pillar ready for launch.



Abercrombie & Fitch believes that every day should feel as exceptional as the start of the long weekend. Since 1892, the brand has been a specialty retailer of quality apparel, outerwear and fragrance – designed to inspire our global customers to feel confident, be comfortable and face their Fierce.



Anna Sui—In 2011, we entered into an exclusive worldwide fragrance license to create, produce and distribute fragrances and fragrance related products under the Anna Sui brand. We work in partnership with American designer, Anna Sui, and her creative team to build upon the brand’s growing customer appeal, and develop new fragrances that capture the brand’s very sweet feminine girly aspect, combined with touch of nostalgia, hipness and rock-and-roll. Anna Sui’s devoted customer base, which spans the world, is concentrated in Asia.



 The successful launch in 2017 of Fantasia by Anna Sui together with the benefits that accrued from our continued commitment to advertising and marketing, produced a significant increase in 2018 brand sales. Brand sales declined modestly in 2019, as new product launches were primarily brand extensions. The COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in retail store closings and a virtual shutdown of travel retail, significantly affected Anna Sui brand sales in 2020. A recovery began in late 2020, and to take advantage of markets reopening, we began the initial rollout of our newest Anna Sui fragrance, Sky by Anna Sui in China and Hong Kong. For 2021, we plan a broader distribution of Anna Sui Sky throughout Asia.



Boucheron— In 2010, we entered into an exclusive 15-year worldwide license agreement for the creation, development and distribution of fragrances under the Boucheron brand. Boucheron is the French jeweler “par excellence”. Founded by Frederic Boucheron in 1858, the House has produced some of the world’s most beautiful and precious creations. Today Boucheron creates jewelry and timepieces and, under license from global brand leaders, fragrances and sunglasses. Currently Boucheron operates through over 40 boutiques worldwide as well as an e-commerce site.



Boucheron brand sales continue to be driven by legacy scents Boucheron Femme and Boucheron Homme as well as its legendary Jaipur lines. A scent collection was launched under the Boucheron brand in 2017, and additional scents are added annually. In 2019, two new fragrances, Boucheron Fleurs and Boucheron Quatre en Rouge, were added to the Boucheron collection. For 2020, we added Rose D’Isparta and Serpent Boheme and for 2021, Quatre en Bleu and Cuir de Venise will be making their debuts.



Coach— In 2015, we entered into an exclusive 11-year worldwide license to create, produce and distribute new men’s and women’s fragrances and fragrance related products under the Coach brand name. We distribute these fragrances globally to department stores, specialty stores and duty free shops, as well as in Coach retail stores.



Coach, established in New York City in 1941, is a leading design house of modern luxury accessories and lifestyle collections with a rich heritage of pairing exceptional leathers and materials with innovative design. Coach branded products are sold worldwide through Coach stores, select department stores and specialty stores, and through Coach’s website.



In 2016, we launched our first Coach fragrance, a women’s scent, and in 2017, a men’s scent, both of which have quickly become top selling prestige fragrances. The Coach brand achieved remarkable sales growth and quickly become one of the largest brands in our portfolio. Coach sales were driven by the continued popularity of the Coach signature lines, as well as the success of flankers. In 2020 we launched a new Coach women’s scent, Coach Dreams. We also have a new fragrance, Dreams Sunset, which is scheduled to debut in 2021. Coach is part of the Tapestry house of brands.

Known for its commitment to elegance and innovation and being a leader of British men’s style, the brand continues to blend innovation and creativity with traditional craftsmanship.



Beginning in 2015, we rolled out a new Dunhill scent, Icon, the success of which has made the Dunhill brand one of the stars within our United States based operations at that time. Building upon the established success of the Icon fragrance family, we launched several product extensions in 2017 and 2018. In 2019, the Dunhill Signature Collection debuted exclusively at Harrod’s followed by a global rollout, and brand extensions dominated for Dunhill in 2020. For 2021, we have a completely new fragrance family for Dunhill called Driven.



Graff— In 2018, the Company entered into an exclusive, 8-year worldwide license agreement with London-based Graff for the creation, development and distribution of fragrances under the Graff brand.

The company remains a family business, overseen by Francois Graff, Chief Executive Officer.



For Graff, a six-scent collection for women, Lesedi La Rona, debuted exclusively at Harrods beginning in March 2020. The exclusive was extended through 2020 as a result of the interruption from mandatory store closings at various times throughout 2020.

This license took effect on April 1, 2018 and we began selling GUESS legacy scents in 2018. In 2019 the GUESS brand quickly became the largest within our U.S. operations, with legacy fragrances dominating the sales mix. In 2019, we began shipments of 1981 Los Angeles and Seductive Noir, both flankers of established scents, which accelerated brand growth further.

In 2017, we changed the strategic positioning and instituted new pricing with the launch of a new duo called Les Parfums Matières. Building on excellent sales results of the initial scents, in the second half of 2018, we expanded the Les Parfums Matières line with another fragrance duo, and in 2019, we added new scents to the brand’s expanding multi-scent collection. In 2021 Karl Cities, a new collection, is being prepared.

For a number of years, it has developed timeless and must-have collections with a fully modernized signature style ranging from dance shoes, ballet slippers, flat shoes, sandals, handbags and high-end accessories.



With Repetto boutiques in several countries throughout the world, the brand has branched out into Asia, notably China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, South Korea and Japan with a mix of cross-generational appeal and French chic. Despite this brand’s success with footwear, handbags and high-end accessories, fragrance sales have been modest.



Rochas— In 2015, we acquired the Rochas brand from The Procter & Gamble Company. Founded by Marcel Rochas in 1925, the brand began as a fashion house and expanded into perfumery in the 1950s under Hélène Rochas’ direction. This transaction included all brand names and registered trademarks for Rochas (Femme, Madame, Eau de Rochas, etc.), mainly for fragrance, cosmetics and fashion.



This acquisition opened a new page in the Company’s history by integrating for the first time both fragrances and fashion, allowing us to apply a global approach to managing a fragrance brand with complete freedom in terms of creativity and aesthetic choices. At the same time, we enjoy a very high degree of visibility establishing a position of even greater preeminence for Rochas in the luxury goods universe. Rochas brand sales currently include approximately $2.2 million of royalties generated by the fashion and accessory business via its portfolio of license agreements. Our first new fragrance for Rochas, Mademoiselle Rochas, had a successful launch that began in the first quarter of 2017 in its traditional markets of France and Spain. In 2018, we debuted flankers for Eau de Rochas and Mademoiselle Rochas and in late 2018, we launched our first new men’s line, Rochas Moustache. In 2019, a seasonal limited edition called Escapade Exotique came to market, as well as the debut of Mademoiselle Rochas Couture. A new women’s line, Byzance, debuted in early 2020. For 2021, we have a new two new fragrances debuting, Rochas Girl in the first half of the year, and later in the year, a flanker for the L’Homme Rochas collections.



S.T. Dupont— In 1997, we signed an exclusive worldwide license agreement with S.T. Dupont for the creation, manufacture and distribution of S.T. Dupont fragrances. The license agreement had been renewed several times and is now renewed annually, without any material changes in terms and conditions. S.T. Dupont is a French luxury goods house founded in 1872, which is known for its fine writing instruments, lighters and leather goods. S.T. Dupont fragrances include: S.T. Dupont pour Femme, S.T. Dupont pour Homme, S.T. Dupont Essence Pure and S.T. Dupont Collection.



Van Cleef & Arpels— In 2018, the Company renewed its license agreement for an additional six years with Van Cleef & Arpels for the creation, development, and distribution of fragrance products through December 2024. Our initial 12-year license agreement with Van Cleef & Arpels was signed in 2006.



Van Cleef & Arpels fragrances in current distribution include: First and Collection Extraordinaire. Sales of the Collection Extraordinaire line have experienced continued growth since its debut. We continue to introduce new additions to the Van Cleef & Arpels Collection Extraordinaire assortment annually, including Oud Blanc, in 2020. We have new additions to the Collection Extraordinaire, including Réve de Matiere unveiling in 2021.

Business Strategy 



Focus on prestige beauty brands. Prestige beauty brands are expected to contribute significantly to our growth. We focus on developing and launching quality fragrances utilizing internationally renowned brand names. By identifying and concentrating in the most receptive market segments and territories where our brands are known, and executing highly targeted launches that capture the essence of the brand, we have had a history of successful launches. Certain fashion designers and other licensors choose us as a partner, because our Company’s size enables us to work more closely with them in the product development process as well as our successful track record.



Grow portfolio brands through new product development and marketing. We grow through the creation of fragrance family extensions within the existing brands in our portfolio. Every year or two, we create a new family of fragrances for each brand in our portfolio. We frequently introduce seasonal and limited edition fragrances as well. With new introductions, we leverage our ability and experience to gauge trends in the market and further leverage the brand name into different product families in order to maximize sales and profit potential. We have had success in introducing new fragrance families (sub-brands, flanker brands or flankers) within our brand franchises. Furthermore, we promote the performance of our prestige fragrance operations through knowledge of the market, detailed analysis of the image and potential of each brand name, and a highly professional approach to international distribution channels.



Continue to add new brands to our portfolio, through new licenses or acquisitions. Prestige brands are the core of our business and we intend to add new prestige beauty brands to our portfolio. Over the past 30 years, we have built our portfolio of well-known prestige brands through acquisitions and new license agreements. We intend to further build on our success in prestige fragrances and pursue new licenses and acquire new brands to strengthen our position in the prestige beauty market. To that end, in 2019, we extended our license agreements for Abercrombie & Fitch, Hollister and Oscar de la Renta, and signed new licenses for Kate Spade New York and MCM. During 2020, we signed a new license for the Moncler brand. In 2020, we also acquired a minority interest in Divabox, which owns the Origines-parfums online platform. As a website of reference for all selective fragrance brands, Origines-parfums is a key French player in the online beauty market recognized for its customer relationship expertise. This agreement should enhance the introduction of dedicated fragrance lines and products designed to address a specific consumer demand for this distribution channel and accelerate our digital development. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $296 million, which we believe should assist us in entering new brand licenses or out-right acquisitions. We identify prestige brands that can be developed and marketed into a full and varied product families and, with our technical knowledge and practical experience gained over time, take licensed brand names through all phases of concept, development, manufacturing, marketing and distribution.



Expand existing portfolio into new categories. We selectively broaden our product offering beyond the fragrance category and offer other fragrance related products and personal care products under some of our existing brands. We believe such product offerings meet customer needs and further strengthen customer loyalty.



Continue to build global distribution footprint. Our business is a global business and we intend to continue to build our global distribution footprint. In order to adapt to changes in the environment and our business, in addition to our arrangements with third party distributors globally, we are operating distribution subsidiaries or divisions in the major markets of the United States, France and Spain for distribution of prestige fragrances. We may look into future joint arrangements or acquire distribution companies within other key markets to distribute certain of our prestige brands. While building a global distribution footprint is part of our long-term strategy, we may need to make certain decisions based on the short-term needs of the business. We believe that in certain markets, vertical integration of our distribution network may be one of the keys to future growth of our Company, and ownership of such distribution should enable us to better serve our customers’ needs in local markets and adapt more quickly as situations may determine.

Suppliers’ accounts for our European operations are primarily settled in euro and for our United States operations, suppliers’ accounts are primarily settled in U.S. dollars. For our European operations components for our prestige fragrances are purchased from many suppliers around the world and are primarily manufactured in France. For United States operations, components for our prestige fragrances are sourced from many suppliers around the world and are primarily manufactured in the United States. However, occasionally, we will utilize third party manufacturers in France, China and Turkey.

Environmental and Social Governance 



Both our US operations and our European operations are good corporate citizens and take our responsibilities seriously. We comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations in general, and in particular with regard to chemicals and hazardous materials. From procurement of components to distribution of finished products, we act as a good corporate citizen and monitor and comply with all legal requirements.



Interparfums SA, our European operations with their headquarters in Paris, was ranked number 11 in the Gaïa Index for 2020. This index assesses the Environmental and Social Governance (“ESG”) performance of the top 70 small and medium enterprises for French companies with revenue between €150-500 million.



Interparfums SA also applies a comprehensive approach addressing issues of corporate, environmental and social responsibility and transparency. Interparfums SA complies with IS 22716, International Standards for Good Manufacturing Practices, with all aspects of the manufacturing process, including receiving of raw materials and packaging materials, production and quality control. In this regulatory environment, regular audit campaigns are carried out for all packaging plants by the quality department based on the ISO 22716 standard in place. The ultimate purpose of these audits is to ensure that packaging service providers maintain a good level of traceability for their activities. All plant activities were reviewed: receiving process for raw materials and packaging materials, manufacturing, packaging and quality controls. These reports demonstrated that Interparfums SA’s subcontractors comply with ISO 22716 Good Manufacturing Practices and in particular traceability requirements for all perfume production operations. It is also in compliance with EU directive entitled Regulation on Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”), which governs and regulates the safe use of chemicals. Although not a manufacturer, per se, Interparfums SA has taken the initiative and monitors its suppliers for compliance with REACH, and has commitments from each of them concerning “Substances of Very High Concern” as listed in appendix XIV of REACH. No supplier of Interparfums SA has advised it of any such hazardous materials in any of Interparfums products to date.



Interparfums SA monitors the outsourcing of the entire production process of its manufacturing partners with expertise and accountable leadership in their respective areas. These include producers of juice, glass, caps and cardboard boxes and packaging companies. We take environmental issues into account at each of these phases, and in particular regarding the choice of materials used for components, waste management and reducing the carbon footprint.



In the US we are also a good corporate citizen. Like our French subsidiary, we are not a true manufacturer, but we regularly monitor our subcontractors, suppliers and fillers for their compliance. In addition, our subcontractors and fillers are subject to inspection and audit from our various licensors for compliance with all aspects of law. One of our largest pump manufactures is the recipient of the 2020 Bronze Medal from EcoVadis for its corporate social responsibility rating, and a large glass bottle manufacturer was awarded gold metals from EcoVadis for its corporate social responsibility rating two years in a row.



In our US operations, we do not use any banned ingredients or components and use sustainable ingredients where practicable. Some componentry (glass/folding cartons) is also recyclable where practicable. For example, our new Abercrombie & Fitch Away fragrance uses glass and folding cartons that are 100% recyclable, and the carton liner is 100% recyclable and biodegradable. We are also licensed to use the “Green Dot” logo on our packaging, and that licensing fee goes towards packaging recycling efforts of consumer goods. Lastly, our product development team works with our fragrance houses – all very sustainable in their own right – to incorporate sustainably sourced ingredients in the fragrance oils used.



In addition to our production operations complying with applicable law, our managers, supervisors and traffic coordinators in our New Jersey distribution center undergo the following training in order for us to comply with Dangerous Goods Regulations. Compliance requires training and certification to deal in hazardous materials to prevent damage to the environment. The two main certifications are:



International Maritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG) Dangerous Goods Training – 3 year Certification for Ocean Shipment and International Air Transport Association (IATA) Dangerous Goods Training – 2 year Certification for Global Air Shipments.



Further, our distribution center in New Jersey has in-rack sprinklers to accommodate our hazardous material products. Our fragrances, Class 9 – Consumer Commodity ID8000, are registered with American Chemistry Council, Inc. (known in the chemicals industry as Chemtrec). Chemtrec has a 24/7 hazardous materials emergency communications center, which provides immediate assistance for incidents involving hazardous materials of any kind.

Marketing and Distribution



Our products are distributed in over 120 countries around the world through a selective distribution network. For our international distribution, we either contract with independent distribution companies specializing in luxury goods or distribute prestige products through our distribution subsidiaries. In each country, we designate anywhere from one to three distributors on an exclusive basis for one or more of our name brands. We also distribute our products through a variety of duty free operators, such as airports and airlines and select vacation destinations.



As our business is a global one, we intend to continue to build our global distribution footprint. For distribution of brands within our European based operations we operate through our distribution subsidiaries or divisions in the major markets of the United States, France, Italy and Spain, in addition to our arrangements with third party distributors globally. Our third party distributors vary in size depending on the number of competing brands they represent. This extensive and diverse network together with our own distribution subsidiaries provides us with a significant presence in over 120 countries around the world.



Over 45% of our European based prestige fragrance net sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. We address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. We primarily enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. 



The business of our European operations has become increasingly seasonal due to the timing of shipments by our distribution subsidiaries and divisions to their customers, which are weighted to the second half of the year.



For our United States operations, we distribute product to retailers and distributors in the United States as well as internationally, including duty free and other travel-related retailers. We utilize our in-house sales team to reach our third party distributors and customers outside the United States. In addition, the business of our United States operations has become increasingly seasonal as shipments are weighted toward the second half of the year.



Competition



The market for prestige fragrance products is highly competitive and sensitive to changing preferences and demands. The prestige fragrance industry is highly concentrated around certain major players with resources far greater than ours. We compete with an original strategy, regular and methodical development of quality fragrances for a growing portfolio of internationally renowned brand names. 
Inventory



We purchase raw materials and component parts from suppliers based on internal estimates of anticipated need for finished goods, which enables us to meet production requirements for finished goods. We generally ship product to customers within 72 hours of the receipt of their orders. Our business is not capital intensive, and it is important to note that we do not own manufacturing facilities. We act as a general contractor and source our needed components from our suppliers. These components are received at one of our distribution centers and then, based upon production needs, the components are sent to one of several third party fillers which manufacture the finished product for us and then deliver them to one of our distribution centers.
Product Liability



Our United States operations maintain product liability coverage in an amount of $10.0 million, and our European operations maintain product liability coverage in an amount of €20.0 million (approximately $24.5 million). Based upon our experience, we believe this coverage is adequate and covers substantially all of the exposure we may have with respect to our products. We have never been the subject of any material product liability claims.

Government Regulation



A fragrance is defined as a “cosmetic” under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act. A fragrance must comply with the labeling requirements of this FDC Act as well as the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act and its regulations. In addition, various jurisdictions prohibit the use of certain ingredients in fragrances and cosmetics.



Our fragrance products that are manufactured or sold in Europe are subject to certain regulatory requirements of the European Union, such as Regulation number 1223/2009 on cosmetic products, but as of the date of this report, we have not experienced any material difficulties in complying with such requirements.



Trademarks



The market for our products depends to a significant extent upon the value associated with our trademarks and brand names. We have licenses or other rights to use, or own, the material trademark and brand name rights used in connection with the packaging, marketing and distribution of our major products both in the United States and in other countries where such products are principally sold. Therefore, trademark and brand name protection are important to our business. Although most of the brand names we license, use or own are registered in the United States and in certain foreign countries in which we operate, we may not be successful in asserting trademark or brand name protection. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. The costs required to protect our trademarks and brand names may be substantial.



Under various license and other agreements, we have the right to use certain registered trademarks throughout the world for fragrance products. These registered trademarks include:




● | Abercrombie & Fitch 
--+------------------------


● | Anna Sui 
--+-------------


● | bebe

Human Capital



As of January 1, 2021, we had 396 full-time employees worldwide. Of these, 289 are full-time employees of our European operations, with 107 employees engaged in sales activities and 182 in administrative, production and marketing activities. Our United States operations have 107 employees, and of these, 21 were engaged in sales activities and 86 in administrative, production and marketing activities. We do not have collective bargaining agreements relating to any of our employees, strive to maintain an inclusive environment free from discrimination of any kind, including sexual or other discriminatory harassment and, believe that our relationship with our employees is good.



Our employees are one of our most valuable assets, and fostering long-term relationships are beneficial to the continuity of our business. After experience and expertise in the respective fields of employment, we look for dedication and loyalty among our employees, as we believe having long-term staff members benefits our company. All of our executive officers have been with us for more than twenty years, and we have several senior and upper level staff members, who have also been with us long term. These long-term executives and employees believe that our company and their co-workers are an extended family. Their efforts and dedication are what allow our company to prosper.



The safety of our employees is of paramount importance to us. In the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic we experienced brief closures at all of our locations, and adapted to working remotely. Upon reopening, we implemented prevention protocols to minimize the spread of COVID-19 in our workplaces. These protocols, which remain in place, are in compliance with the Centers for Disease Control guidelines and state requirements.
